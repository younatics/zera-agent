"Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has made a major political statement by coming out as gay . Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has revealed he is gay in a tweet posted in English to his 14,000 followers. In the tweet published at around 8pm GMT, the minister said: 'I proudly announce I am gay...good luck all of you. 'Our country has to create a legal status for all kinds of partner relationships, and I will fight for this. I know that there will quickly be mega-hysteria, but #proudtobegay.' The revelation is a major political statement as Latvia is one of a handful of EU countries that has a ban on same-sex marriage. There is open hostility to gay people in the country and they are often attacked in the streets or in meeting places. Elsewhere, a law that would confine sex education in schools to traditional opposite-sex marriage is making its way through Parliament. A Russian-style bill banning 'gay propaganda' is also being prepared. The announcement came less than two months before Latvia assumes the European Union’s rotating presidency on January 1, giving Mr Rinkēvičs an even higher-profile platform from which to push for more tolerance for same-sex relationships. Latvia enacted a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in 2005, and very few gay men and lesbians in the country are open about their sexuality. Many people in Latvia have prejudices against homosexuality, usually rooted in social conservatism and lingering preconceptions dating from the Soviet period. The Latvian Foreign Minister, one of the country's most popular politicians, has revealed he is gay on Twitter . A spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the post. The 41-year-old is one of Latvia’s most popular politicians and had long declined to discuss his personal life. He is a member of the ruling Unity party and since 2011 has been foreign minister of the Baltic nation of two million people. The announcement comes a day after his post as foreign minister was confirmed as part of Latvia's new government. The nation held parliamentary elections last month.","In the tweet he said: 'I proudly announce I am gay...good luck all of you'

"All Blacks veteran Keven Mealamu had a Brodie Retallick moment when quizzed on the injury crisis that has decimated England's pack ahead of Saturday's autumn international opener at Twickenham. Mealamu's team-mate Retallick famously could not name a single England player when asked to during last summer's tour of New Zealand, and while Mealamu's faux pas was not quite of the same proportion, it may be perceived as another example of Kiwi indifference towards England. Asked if the All Blacks would look to take advantage of England's problems up front, a puzzled Mealamu admitted: 'To be honest I'm not too sure on who's injured at the moment.' New Zealand hooker Keven Mealamu talks to the media after New Zealand arrived in England on Monday . New Zealand captain Richie McCaw and head coach Steve Hansen arrive at their team hotel on Monday . Wasps lock Joe Launchbury became the latest England player to be ruled out the series with a neck injury . When told England had seven regular forwards out - Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury, Geoff Parling, Tom Croft and Tom Johnson - the 121-cap hooker, 35, backtracked somewhat. 'They're pretty lucky up here,' added. 'They have always had a good forward pack up here, so we're expecting no matter who is on the field it is going to be an English calibre forward pack.' Whether or not talismanic fly half Dan Carter starts on Saturday was the burning question for the assembled Kiwi press - who were also unaware of England's injury problems - on Monday. Carter came off the bench to feature in Saturday's 12-try demolition of the United States in Chicago. It was his first appearance since injuring his leg in the Super Rugby final back in July. Dan Carter's last game before the weekend was for the Canterbury Crusaders in July . Assistant coach Ian Foster said: 'Dan came through really well. He had a smile on his face afterwards and the signs are really, really positive.' Asked if he and head coach Steve Hansen had seen enough to convince them Carter was ready to start ahead of Aaron Cruden, Foster added: ‘It was a good first step for him and we're delighted with that. 'I thought he looked half a yard off the pace early on but I think we started to see him get back in to the right sort of tempo as the game finished. We'll make an assessment when it's time this week.'

"Dietmar Hamann believes Wayne Rooney will have to work harder and 'live like a top player' if he wants to be regarded in the same bracket football's elite players. The former German international, who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005, thinks that Rooney's work ethic is holding him back. 'You have to live like a top player,' Hamann told Perform. 'If you want to be the best, you have to live like the best. Skipper: Wayne Rooney was named as Manchester United captain by Louis van Gaal . Determined: Cristiano Ronaldo's hard work has made him one of the best in the world, said Dietmar Hamann . 'And if you like to party on the weekends and drink beer or a glass of wine too much that could be negative for your performance and I think that's the big difference between Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. 'Rooney always knocked on the door to be world class but never did the final step. And Ronaldo overtook him because he's obsessed. He's a real hard worker. The way he shoots his free kicks is the result of years of training. That doesn't come overnight. 'As I said, often the really talented players tend to do a little bit less because they can get away with it and the others are not as talented as they are. But if you have the talent, the morale and if work really hard just then you'll become a Ronaldo or a Messi.' Despondent: Rooney's United side were beaten 2-1 by Swansea in their opening Premier League game . Roney was named Manchester United captain by new manager Louis van Gaal, and Hamann thinks that this is the England striker's last chance to shine. 'Van Gaal made him the captain. He knows that it's his last chance - he is 28 or 29,' Hamann said. 'Rooney needs to perform now, he has three or four years left to play at the highest level. Van Gaal is a coach who gets the best out of players - or he sends them away. 'He made him captain, the relationship seems to be good, and that is good for Manchester United and for Wayne Rooney. I am expecting a lot from him this season, but we have to wait to see whether the team is good enough.'","Hamann said Rooney needs to 'live like a top player'

"Michael Schumacher has made it home - 254 days since smashing his head on to rocks in a freak ski accident in the Swiss Alps. He returned to his family home at Gland on Tuesday, according to Germany's biggest newspaper Bild, way ahead of a schedule set by doctors at a rehabilitation clinic in Lausanne who predicted he might be home by Christmas. 'He is back home again!' the newspaper trumpeted on its website. Scroll down for video . Discharged:  Michael Schumacher has made it home - 254 days since smashing his head on to rocks in a freak ski accident in the Swiss Alps . Round-the-clock care: The former Formula 1 ace is massaged for hours each day to stimulate muscle mass shed during his long sleep . Although his wife Corinna, 45, and children Mick, 15, and Gina-Maria, 17, are ecstatic, it is understood he remains mute and unable to move apart from random fluttering of his eyelids. Concern: Some critics have questioned the wisdom of bringing a man who lay in a coma for almost six months home from the clinic so soon . The scene on the slopes at Meribel when Michael Schumacher was airlifted to hospital after his skiing accident . 2013 . December 29 – Schumacher, while skiing with his 14-year-old son Mick, fell and hit his head on a rock. 2014 . March 14-28 -  German magazine Die Aktuelle published a picture of the star smiling together with his wife Corinna above the headline 'awake', Inside, however, were stories of people who had awoken after a coma. April 4 – Schumacher's agent reported that he was showing ‘moments of consciousness’. June 16 – Schumacher  left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland. June 22 – Schumacher’s medical records – a 10-page dossier – stolen and offered to media in Britain, Germany and France for 60,000 Swiss francs (£40,000). July 24 – Corinna Schumacher put the family’s private jet, a $20 million (£12m) grey Falcon 2000EX, upfor sale. August 5 – A man suspected of stealing the medical records arrested for violating patient privacy and medical secrecy. He was not named but was thought to be a manager at Swiss helicopter company Rega. August 6 – The suspected thief committed suicide in his police cell. September 9 – Schumacher left the University Hospital (CHUV) to return to his family home. Schumacher was taken in June to the clinic after 189 days in a medically induced coma. 'He relies on the help of strangers 24 hours around the clock. No one dares make a prediction about How long it might take until he has regained motor skills such as language and memory,' said Bunte magazine last week, a publication which is noted for having close contacts with the Schumacher family. Two months ago it reported how work has been going on at his £35million mansion at Gland, a short drive from the rehabilitation clinic, to build a care facility for him in the grounds that is wheelchair accessible. The magazine and a Swiss newspaper also reported that another building has been constructed for his father Rolf to move into from his home in Germany. The prognosis is that Schumacher, whose life was catastrophically changed by a low-speed ski accident on December 29 last year, will need years of therapy and, most likely, will always remain a shell of his former self. The summer makeover of his home was no mere re-decorating project, but one intended to turn this trophy, glitzy Downton-of-the-Alps into a singular care facility, one dedicated to giving back as much of life as it can to the monarch who built it. 'The mansion is being remade to become the sanctuary which, it is hoped, will remake him,' said a family friend. Some critics have questioned the wisdom of bringing a man who lay in a coma for almost six months home from the clinic so soon, but Professor Peter Vajkoczy is not one of them. 'If financial resources allow for someone to create their own home rehabilitation facility complete with gym, and to bring the necessary medical staff and therapists to it, then that is certainly a possibility,' said the professor who heads the neurosurgical clinic of the world renowned Charite Hospital in Berlin. Schumacher was transferred to the University Hospital Lausanne, in Switzerland, on June 16 to begin rehabilitation . The wherewithal to finance the move was never in question. A decade ago the financial bible Forbes Magazine in America listed him as the second highest-paid athlete in the world while the following year Eurobusiness magazine identified him as the world's first dollar billionaire athlete. The fortune remains intact and has grown with lucrative advertising and sponsorship deals which sometimes earned him over £100million a year on top of his race winnings in the last few seasons of his career. Schumacher, 45, remains hooked up to complex machines that feed him, enable him to breathe for long periods of sleep, remove waste from his body and monitor vital signs. He is massaged for hours each day to stimulate muscle mass shed during his long sleep and assessed by the hour to see if his awareness of his environment is rising, waning or static. Someone who has been a friend of the family for 25 years said: 'Corinna is happy at the progress he has made so far and optimistic that much more can be achieved. She is counting the successes one by one and ignoring the likelihood that he will make anything other than a full recovery. 'He didn't die in the accident and he didn't die during the two emergency operations that followed it. He came out of the coma and he has had periods of awakening where he is able to make the smallest of nods. He was deemed well enough to be released from the hospital and may be fit enough to sit in a wheelchair by autumn's end. All of this is positive and Corinna takes each small dose of good news as it comes. Corinna Schumacher, wife of the former racing driver, and French professor Gerard Saillant arriving at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire hospital in Grenoble, France, where Michael was first sent . 'The question remains, however, about how much improvement can be expected the coming months and years. Will he speak again? Will he walk again? Will he be able to feed and dress himself? The doctors don't know. No-one can know. The probability is that he will never be the man he was before the accident, that much is starkly clear.' As of now, Schumacher lies in a state of what is termed 'minimal consciousness' in which he can briefly move eyes toward persons or objects, experiences sleeping and waking cycles and has been known to react to loud sounds with a startled look. But he is unable to follow instructions, has no speech or other forms of communication and no purposeful movement of his limbs. According to the source a thin buzzcut of down has regrown over the savage dragon's-teeth scars crisscrossing Schumacher's skull, the evidence of the lifesaving operations performed on him at Grenoble where, initially, he was not expected to last the night after the accident at Meribel. He is moved every two hours to prevent pressure sores by carers who are required to hand in their mobile telephones before they report for duty in case the temptation to take a photograph of him proves too much. And a tent has been constructed at the back of his ward to prevent long-lens paparazzi shots of him when he is moved outside, as he is from time to time.

"A British couple on holiday in Los Angeles have told how they drank, showered and brushed their teeth with water from a rooftop tank at a hotel – where a woman’s body had been decomposing for three weeks. It was only when the bloated body of 21-year-old university student Elisa Lam was discovered this week that they found out why the hotel water tasted ‘funny’. Sabina Baugh, 27, spent eight days with husband Michael, also 27, at the Cecil Hotel in downtown LA. 'Sick to the stomach': Michael and Sabina Baugh said the water at the hotel 'tasted funny' The area has one of the highest crime . rates in the city, so rather than go in search of bottled water at . night, they drank from the tap. Yesterday Mrs Baugh, a piano teacher, . said: ‘The water did have a very funny, disgusting taste. We never . thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.’ Mr Baugh, a guitarist and music . teacher, added: ‘The moment we found out, we felt sick to the stomach, . quite literally. We’re not well mentally. It’s the psychological stuff. If you think about it, it’s not good.’ The couple also said water at the . £52-a-night hotel, given a two-star rating on review site TripAdvisor, . had been trickling from the tap. Other guests reported flooding. The . couple, from Plymouth, are now staying in another part of the city and . the authorities are testing the water in the area for contamination. Mystery: Los Angeles fire fighters peer down at the water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil as they try to figure out how to remove the body of a young woman found inside .

"What started out as a New York City food phenomenon has spread, and it now taking over Asia. South Koreans are the latest to catch the cronut-bug with incarnations of Dominique Ansel's original rings of deep-fried croissant dough being sold at Dunkin' Donuts franchises in Soeul. DD South Korea is calling their versions of the crispy layered pastries 'New York Pie Donuts.' The donuts are being sold at shops in Seoul, and have even inspired their own epically-long lines at the upscale Gangnam neighborhood branch. Imitation: Dunkin' Donuts franchises in South Korea and the Philippines are selling their own version of the New York cronut . Cronut craze: Soeul residents love cronuts just as much as New Yorkers, with customers waiting in long lines outside of the upscale Gangnam neighborhood branch . According to Quartz, commenters on the store's Facebook page have even said that customers are only allowed two - the same ration New Yorkers get when they stand in the early morning lines at Dominique Ansel's bakery in SoHo. Dunkin' Donuts has over 3,000 stores in 30 countries outside the U.S. Their shops in the Philippines also started selling versions of the cronut. Their 'Donut Croissant' come in flavors such as Apple Cinnamon and Choco Almond. The donut chain doesn't have plans to launch a version of the cronut in the U.S. yet, according to Quartz. Made in Manila: Dunkin' donuts shops in the Philippines are also selling cronuts in flavors like Apple Cinnamon and Choco Almond . Since Dominique Ansel copyrighted the named 'cronut' in May, copycats in the U.S. have had to come up with their own names - like 'doissants' and 'croughnuts' - for their pastries or face cease and desist letters. In June, the bakery posted a message on their Facebook page explaining their need to copyright the name, while at the same time taking no credit for inventing the pastry. 'Our desire to protect the name is not an attempt to claim or take credit for all cooking methods associated with the recipe or all croissant and doughnut products in general,' the statement said. 'Instead, it offers the bakery and Chef protection against un-granted affiliations with the bakery or confusion from customers.' A spokesman for the bakery seemed unfazed by all of the cronut pretenders, in a statement to MailOnline. 'As an artisanal production, we believe customers can tell the difference between our products and what is mass produced, in the same way that they can differentiate a fresh-baked baguette made by a baker's hands and heart from a supermarket aisle product packaged in factories.' But that hasn't stopped bakeries all over Asia, trying their best to create their own flaky bite of heaven. A list on Buzzfeed includes bakeries in the Philippines, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Japan peddling their versions of the donut. Island style: Mixed berry croissant-donut at Wildflower bakery and double chocolate Belgian 'croughnuts' from Le Coeur de France, both in the Philippines . Citrus twist: Lemon meringue 'crodos' at Gastronomia in Singapore .

"A testy exchange between IRS commissioner John Koskinen and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan broke out during a Ways and Means hearing on Friday, with Ryan shouting at the IRS chief at one point, 'I don't . believe you! This is incredible!' The explosive back and forth came after Koskinen testified that emails belonging to Lois Lerner and six other IRS officials were not . necessarily 'lost' forever and claims made otherwise by Ways and Means chairman Rep. Dave Camp were 'inaccurate.' 'At this time it is too early to know whether any of the emails have been lost on any of those hard drives,' he said. Koskinen told committee members that his agency isn't certain yet that it can't retrieve old emails from employees caught up in a scheme to target conservative organizations, which is why he didn't tell Congress that several hard drives containing copies of the emails had crashed until he was about them on Monday. 'This is not being forthcoming. This is being misleading again,' Republican Rep. Paul Ryan shouted IRS Commissioner John Koskinen during a House Ways and Means hearing today . Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner John Koskinen said during testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee today that it is still 'too early' know if Lois Lerner and other IRS officials' emails are irretrievable . At issue throughout the committee hearing was whether the IRS purposefully kept the missing emails and crashed hard drives a secret for months. Koskinen did not inform the Ways and Means committee until last Friday about Lerner's computer crash despite having knowledge of it since February. He did not tell the committee about the computer crashes affecting the emails of the other six IRS officials until the committee directly asked him for the information on Monday, even though the Department of Treasury sent him a letter last spring encouraging him to tell Congress about the situation as soon as possible. 'You say that you've lost the emails, but what you've lost is all credibility,' Camp said during his opening remarks. During his testimony Koskinen said that in reviewing the emails his agency does still have on hand from Lois Lerner, the IRS found out that IRS tried to have the data from her damaged hard drive extracted - including her emails - before it was recycled and destroyed, but she was informed by employees on the IRS' technical team that it was 'unrecoverable.' He also claimed it wasn't shocking that multiple employees within an agency as large as the IRS had computer malfunctions. After Koskinen finished with his initial statement, Camp angrily told him, 'What I didn't hear was an apology.' 'I don't think that an apology is owed,' Koskinen fired back. 'Not a single email has been lost since the start of this investigation.' Every email has been produced or will be produced, he said. The IRS chief blasted Camp for putting out a press release this week claiming that emails from the Chief of Staff for the former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, Nikole Flax, had been lost after her computer crashed. If Camp had waited, Koskinen said, he would have found out that Flax had two computers - a work computer and a laptop. 'So it turns out that none of her emails were lost,' he said. 'Why should anyone believe you?' Rep. Kevin Brady asked Koskinen during his allotted Q and A period. 'This is the most corrupt and deceitful IRS in the history,' Brady said . 'You say that you've lost the emails, but what you've lost is all credibility,' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp told Koskinen in his opening remarks . After Koskinen had been badgered by a handful of Republican members of the committee, including Brady, Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia, apologized to the IRS head for his colleagues' behavior, and Lewis yielded his time for questioning to Koskinen so he could defend himself. 'To say that this is the most IRS corrupt IRS in history ignores a lot of history,' Koskinen said during his borrowed time. When the questioning by Republicans resumed, Rep. Paul Ryan exploded at Lewis and Koskinen. 'This is unbelievable! The apology that ought to be given is to the American taxpayer, not to a government agency that is abusing it's power!,' he said. 'Nobody believes you!' Ryan confronted the IRS head about not telling Congress about the six other crashed computers, to which Koskinen retorted, 'We told you on Monday.' 'Because we asked you,' Ryan fired back. Koskinen tried to explain himself, but Ryan kept interrupting and shouting at him until another Democratic Rep. Sander Levin butted in. 'Will you let him answer the question?' Levin asked Ryan. 'I didn't ask him a a question!' Ryan shouted at his colleague. 'I am not yielding time, I control the time!' Other members of Congress were hard on Koskinen during the hearing, but none as confrontational as Ryan. Among Koskinen's defenders was the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Sander Levin, who posited that Lerner's computer crash wasn't a 'conspiracy' by the IRS to cover up malfeasance. 'There has not been any evidence of political motivation or White House involvement' in the targeting of conservative political groups, he said. 'The prevailing conspiracy in this matter is that of the Republicans’ desire to stir their base, tie the problem to the White House and keep up this drum beat until the November election,' Levin claimed.","Republican Representatives on the House Ways and Means Committee grilled IRS commissioner John Koskinen during today's hearing .

"A student who ended up stuck in a tree after plummeting 3,000 feet when his parachute failed to open has spoken about his terrifying near-death experience. Liam Byrne, 18, walked away with only a few cuts and bruises after he narrowly missed a church, a metal fence and other obstacles on his first-ever parachute jump. The Northumbria University student said: 'It was my first jump ever - I don’t normally like heights. ‘It’s mad. I could have died.’ Near-death experience: Firefighters rescue Liam Byrne who landed in a tree after his parachutes failed to deploy properly . Mr Byrne, who is originally from Doncaster in South Yorkshire, had recently joined the Northumbria University Parachute Club and was jumping at the Peterlee Parachute Centre in County Durham. He described how his first chute got entangled and then, after instructors used a radio to tell him to deploy his second chute, that got tangled up with the first. He said: ‘Everything was going OK but then after the parachute came out, my hand got caught up in it. ‘I managed to free my hand but as I looked up, the strings had twisted around the main parachute. To the rescue: The team of firefighters spent 45 minutes working to disentangle Liam Byrne . Stuck: The teenage parachutist narrowly missed a church, a metal fence and other obstacles on the way down before a tree broke his fall . ‘I tried kicking out to get them to unravel but I just started spiralling out.’ Mr Byrne, who had completed just eight hours of training the day before, performed the emergency procedures and tried to get rid of the main parachute to no effect. He added: ‘Both parachutes were open but only one had inflated - and that is the one that was caught. There was no way I could do anything. ‘I couldn’t stop and started to spin again. I knew I had lost control. Fortunate: Emergency services said Mr Byrne was lucky to survive such a fall . After falling 3,000 feet and getting stuck in a tree, he finally starts to descend after his terrifying ordeal . ‘I had no idea how bad the landing was going to be as I didn’t know how low I was. ‘The parachute collapsed in on itself and I pulled myself towards a tree. ‘I was suspended up in a tree, and I was swinging towards the trunk. ‘I had no idea how big the tree was or whether it would be able to hold my weight.’ Ian Rosenvinge, a former soldier, who runs the Peterlee Parachute Centre said that Mr Byrne had done a six to eight hour training course before doing the jump. He explained: 'We familiarise them with the exit position, which they practise a number of times. 'They need to be in an arched position so that they move away from the deploying parachute when they jump. Miraculous: Despite falling a huge distance at speed, Mr Byrne managed to walk away with only a few cuts and bruises (pictured) 'Unfortunately Liam did not adopt the arched position. 'This happens from time to time when due to nerves, jumpers do not do it properly. 'When the parachute opened the lines became caught under Liam’s arm. 'On occasion parachutes can become . tangled so we teach people how to disentangle - but unfortunately Liam . did not realise that he was tangled. 'When people are struggling we have a cut off point where we have to get involved and do something about it. 'Over the radio we told him to deploy the reserve parachute. 'He did and the reserve worked fine. 'But the first parachute was still trapped under his arm.' He added that Mr Byrne was unable to . control the reserve chute because it had become tangled up in the first . chute which was wrapped around his body and flapping in his face. He said: 'Because two of the parachutes were open, even though one was tangled, Liam . travelled slightly more slowly than he otherwise would have done. 'But speed was not the issue... The problem was he had no direction control.' Lucky: Liam (left) managed to walk away from the incident unscathed with only minor injuries (right) He added that Liam had probably been . travelling at around 20 miles an hour when he landed. Mr Byrne was left suspended 30ft above the ground until emergency services arrived to free him. It took firefighters forty-five . minutes to rescue him and when he finally touched ground, there was a . round of applause from onlookers. John Robson, from Country Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘He was fortunate, there’s no doubt about it. 'You’ve got everything from a church to fencing and all sorts of stuff round there. He was very fortunate.’ Safe and sound: The fire brigade and paramedics acted quickly after Liam's (pictured) fall . Mr Byrne was left with just a bruise under his arm and a scrape to his hand, which was caused by the tree he landed in. His jump came just a day before Felix Baumgartner, 43, performed a 128,000ft jump from the top of the stratosphere to break the sound barrier, making it the highest and fastest skydive in history. He said: ‘It’s pretty cool how this happened to me the same weekend that Felix broke the record. ‘I didn’t realise it at the time but when I watched his jump last night, I thought it was quite funny it was the day after I nearly died from parachuting from a much shorter distance!' The life-defying experience has not deterred Mr Byrne from having another go at parachuting in the future. He said: ‘I’m planning on going again, it’s the only way to do it I think or I’ll never get back up there.’","Liam Byrne, 18, landed in a tree after missing a metal fence and a church .

"He called himself 'Florian the Fuhrer' and delighted in making his classmates give him the 'Sieg Heil!' - Heil to victory - salute beloved of his idol Adolf Hitler. Florian, 15, has emerged as one of two ringleaders of a class of grammar school children in Germany who worshipped at the dark side - disciples of a regime that vanished in fire and blood nearly seven decades ago. Florian and his cohorts are the stuff of nightmares for modern-day democrats in Europe's most economically powerful country: educated, middle class, kitted out with the latest in Smartphones and teen-fashion who nonetheless prefer the darkest days of their nation's past as a source of inspiration for the future. A pupil raises his right hand in the Hitler salute at Landsberg Grammar School in eastern Germany . Landsberg in eastern Germany has become the town of 'The Nazi Class', a group of 29 youngsters who authorities say some - or even most - worshipped at the shrine of Hitler. Recently their sordid world blew apart when the photos the 15-year-olds of class 9A of the Landsberg Grammar School posted on the WhatsApp social media site were published. Florian can be seen raising his right hand in the Hitler salute, his face obscured with a stuck-on Hitler moustache. He and a pal called Leon - who nicknamed himself 'Julius' after Julius Streicher - are now under the microscope of the authorities. Streicher is the infamous Jew-baiting pervert of Nazi Germany who was hanged at Nuremberg after the war for his crimes in conditioning an entire nation to think and act anti-Semitically at all times . All 29 children in the class were signed into the WhatsApp chatroom where the lurid messages of support for Hitler and his henchmen, along with vile anti-Jewish slurs, were traded on a daily basis . In the chatroom the students glorified Hitler and shared Nazi greetings, slogans and the odd anti-Jewish joke . All 29 children in the class - who had visited a concentration camp in Germany to learn about the crimes of the Third Reich - were signed into the WhatsApp chatroom where the lurid messages of support for Hitler and his henchmen, along with vile anti-Jewish slurs, were traded on a daily basis. MailOnline travelled to this tiny, shell-shocked town of 12,000 people, which is now the centre of a full-blown criminal probe because the adulation of the Nazis, and the public display of their symbols and salutes, is a grave crime in modern-day Germany. It seems that the warning signs were either ignored or misread by teachers of the Nazi-virus growing within their young charges. Another youngster from the 9A class makes the Heil Hitler salute in an image shared on social media . Lurid messages of support for Hitler, along with vile anti-Jewish slurs, were traded on a daily basis . A school insider, a clerk in the administration office, said: 'Shortly before the holidays the teacher gave the class an art lesson and they were allowed to paint what they wanted. 'When she returned she was horrified to find many of them had chosen to paint portraits of Adolf Hitler.' In the chatroom the students shared Nazi greetings, slogans, the fact that Hitler was a 'great man' and the odd anti-Jewish 'joke'. One of the last postings before authorities shut down their account was the picture of a clenched fist surrounded by a ring of stars and the words: . 'Bock auf Nazis' - In the mood for Nazis. School headmaster Lutz Feudel said the entire school had been shocked about the secret Nazi sympathisers . They routinely greeted each other in cyberspace with 'Heil Hitler!' They used words like 'Ayran' and 'Volk' - the racist speak of the Nazis - and they lauded recent racist attacks in Germany, such as the firebombing of a synagogue in Wuppertal, as 'acts of resistance.' A German dad has filed a complaint with police asking them to investigate 'The Nazi Class' A legal complaint was made by Jewish man Eli Gampel, 54, who has a son in the class. Gampel, the former head of the local Halle Jewish Community, added: 'I thought it was a bad dream when I opened newspapers and read the article. 'My boy told me that on the hood of his jacket someone had stuck a far-right NPD [National Democratic Party] sticker. It was well-known it seems that he was Jewish. 'It was on this basis that I have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation. He said however that he was equally surprised that his son had not discussed the matter with him, and added that there had been tremendous peer pressure to stop anybody in the class mentioning what they were up to. He added: 'Even after I read about it, I found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on. It was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true.' Herr Gampel knows about the blind, unreasoning, ignorant hatred of the far right because it was visited upon the family home only recently. The Gampels awoke to find slogans dating back to the Reichskristallnacht - the -so-called Night of Broken Glass of November 9 1938 - daubed upon the walls of their house. Crystal Night was the beginning of the end for the Jews of Europe. It started with the ransacking of Jewish property and the burning of synagogues, and ended with the burning of people, some six million of them, in places like Treblinka, Sobibor and Auschwitz. That is why for Eli Gampel, and for all the good burghers of Landsberg, it is so incomprehensible to think that their children could be attracted to the politics of the Nazi beasts from so long ago. 'Only after intense discussion did my son acknowledge that, in principle, the newspaper articles are correct,' he said with a sad shake of his head. According to police sources the Sieg Heiling! and Heil Hitlers! Went far beyond mere larking about. One officer said: 'They spoke about being ""pure Ayran folk"", which is something straight out of the Nazi lexicon, and said they wanted to work towards building a Fourth Reich.' School insiders say the writing has been on the wall for years. East Germany in general remains blighted by higher unemployment and lower opportunities than the rest of the country - a fertile breeding ground for far-right parties like the NPD which has been trawling outside the school gates in recent years to sign up youngsters to their twisted cause. And one told MailOnline that in a mock classroom ballot earlier this year, meant to emulate the European Parliament elections, a 'worryingly high' number of 9a pupils voted for the NPD - a party that wants to kick out all foreigners from Germany and promote the kind of 'folk superiority' that the original Nazis did all those years ago. Sachsen-Anhalt, the state in which Landsberg lies, has had a neo-Nazi problem for years. The state elections in 2011 saw close to 50,000 people voting for the NPD which only narrowly failed to enter parliament. Media commentators say the police and government authorities have not done enough to combat right-wing extremism, which has festered especially in depopulated rural regions of the east where neo-Nazis sit on town councils, organize local sports festivals and youth activities and are even trying to staff kindergartens. Lutz Feudel, the director of the Landsberg school, is said by friends to be 'devastated' by the antics of class 9A. 'Now everything is on the table and we must find out who wrote what, who photographed what, who uploaded what and so on,' said Herr Feudel. But he said he did not want to instantly accuse the children, adding: 'Breaking taboos is part of young adulthood. I don't believe that they wanted to actively promote neo-Nazi ideology.' Prosecutor Andreas Schieweck, 59, has confirmed that they are investigating allegations of glorifying the crimes of the Third Reich and that an investigation was currently underway into at least four pupils in the class. Germany regards any glorification of the Third Reich including the use of Hitler salutes as illegal and punishable by jail terms, though in this case the age of the pupils is also expected to be taken into account. After intense pressure from parents and the school, the children of class 9A issued an apology on Facebook for their actions. A pupil raises his right hand in the Hitler salute, his face obscured with a stuck-on Hitler moustache . They said: 'We, as class 9a from the Landsberg Grammar School, apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage, and that which is still to come. These were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for. 'Furthermore, it was not the whole class which was responsible. That's why we would like to apologize, even to our uninvolved classmates.' They accused the BILD newspaper in Germany, which broke the story, of 'twisting' facts 'but want to apologise for these anyway, even if they were not meant seriously. And we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again.' It was signed on behalf of 'all those responsible'. But the reasons for the allure of history's most murderous regime remain, so far, unexplained.

"A doctor who panicked when a spider fell into her lap as she was driving lost control of her car and crashed head-on into an oncoming vehicle, killing its elderly driver, a court has heard. Dr Amy Elizabeth Walpole, 38, who suffers from arachnophobia, went into a ‘blind panic’ when the creature fell from the sun visor. The GP was seen waving her arms frantically behind the wheel of her red sports car as she tried to brush it off before she swerved and smashed straight into 87-year-old John Evans’s car coming the other way. Crash: GP Amy Walpole, pictured, killed a pensioner after losing control of her car when a spider fell in her lap . Mr Evans, who suffered fractures and damage to his heart, was able to walk from his car to an ambulance after the crash but died the following day. Walpole, who pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, was spared a jail sentence. Mr Evans’s family had asked for her to be treated leniently because of her ‘good reputation’ as a GP. She was instead banned from driving for 12 months and told to carry out community service and pay a fine. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years in prison. Sentencing the family doctor at Llanelli Magistrates’ Court, Judge David Powells said: ‘What we are dealing with is a tragic accident.’ He told the court there was no suggestion Walpole had been driving irresponsibly, adding: ‘This is not a case for prison.’ Fatal: But Walpole was spared jail after her victim's family called for leniency thanks to her 'good reputation' Car: The doctor was driving a red Mazda MX5 similar to this one at the time of the fatal crash . Arachnophobia – a combination of the Greek words for spider and fear – affects almost 80 per cent of young British adults to some degree, according to the Zoological Society of London. When sufferers see a spider, they can become extremely upset, have trouble breathing, sweat excessively or even experience heart problems. Women have been found to be more than twice as likely to be scared of spiders as men. And in a recent poll, 52 per cent of women said not being afraid of spiders was the sign of a ‘real man’. Famous arachnophobes are said to include singer Justin Timberlake, former England rugby player Lewis Moody and author JK Rowling – who included giant man-eating spiders in her Harry Potter series. A YouGov poll last year revealed that arachnophobia was the fourth most common phobia in the UK. It was beaten by a fear of heights (acrophobia), a fear of snakes (ophidiophobia), and a fear of public speaking (glossophobia). In 2013, NHS England endorsed an iTunes app which claimed to help cure arachnophobia by exposing sufferers to increasingly realistic photographs of spiders. Despite the crippling fear they arouse in millions of people, just four of the 40,000 types of spider in the world are deadly to humans – and none of them can be found in the UK. He also paid tribute to Mr Evans as a well-respected local man ‘who drove with confidence and caution’. Walpole, of Penymynydd, near Llanelli, South Wales, was driving her red Mazda MX-5 to work around 9am on November 11, 2013, when she crashed into Mr Evans’s white Suzuki Alto on a rural road in Carmarthenshire. A witness saw her ‘waving her arms around before the car swerved across into the oncoming lane’, the court was told. John Allchurch, defending, said Walpole was incredibly afraid of spiders, adding: ‘It was a large spider which she was terrified of and tried to flick out of the window.’ Prosecutor Vaughan Pritchard Jones said: ‘An eyewitness following in the car behind Walpole said there was nothing untoward about her speed and the conditions were good. The road was not wet. A collision investigator said that could not have been the cause for the accident.’ Mr Pritchard Jones continued: ‘Walpole [said] a spider had dropped from the sun visor, landing in her lap. She has a fear of spiders and tried to throw it out of the window. ‘As a result of the situation with a loss of concentration she drifted across the road causing the collision.’ The prosecutor also told the court it was the second head-on collision Walpole had been involved in over the last five years. On the previous occasion she was working in Europe and forgot which side of the road she was meant to be driving on. She was not charged for that incident. Practice: Walpole works at this GP surgery in the village of Pontyates, near Llanelli in South Wales . As well as the year-long driving ban, Judge Powells ordered Walpole to carry out 80 hours of community service and pay court costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge. Arachnophobia can be disruptive for sufferers. They often become extremely upset when they see a spider and can also experience physical symptoms of panic, such as nausea, trouble breathing, chest pain and a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). In November it emerged that 34-year-old Aggie Dabska has kept the windows of her home in Cardiff shut for three years because there are spiders living in an outside tree. Last year, a 44-year-old businessman who had part of his brain removed to treat his seizures was also inadvertently cured of his fear of spiders.","Amy Walpole, 38, was driving Mazda MX5 when a spider fell from sun visor .

"The Leaning Tower of Pisa is more than a degree straighter than it used to be when it got its name. But luckily, there is another iconic Italian landmark ready to take its place in the wonky hall of fame. Rome's world famous Colosseum is now around 40cm (16 inches) lower on the south side than on the north. Gladiatorial struggle: Experts have been monitoring the sight for several months to see if urgent repairs are needed . Concerned authorities are investigating whether it needs urgent repairs, after experts noticed the incline about a year ago. Rossella Rea, director at the 2,000-year-old monument, revealed in Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Sunday that officials have been monitoring it for the past few months. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, another of the country's most popular attractions, was reopened in 2001 after being shut for more than a decade as engineers worked to prevent it from falling over and to make it safe for visitors. Restorers' efforts to clean off centuries of grime from the Tuscan landmark helped stabilise the historical building by removing soil from beneath one side of its foundations. Before and after: The Pisa landmark's lean was straightened by just over a degree from 1990 to 2001, though there is still a significant - but not dangerous - tilt, as shown on the right . The tilt was reduced from 5.5 degrees from the perpendicular, to only 3.99 degrees away from perfectly straight. Now Ms Rea has asked Rome's La Sapienza University and environmental geology institute IGAG to launch a study into the Colosseum, with investigations to be concluded in a year. Tests have also started to observe the effects that traffic on nearby busy roads may have on the monument. Professor Giorgio Monti, from La Sapienza's construction technology department, warned there may be a crack in the base below the amphitheatre. Off-kilter: There are fears over Big Ben's stability as the tower's title of 0.26 degrees is said to be visible to the naked eye . 'The slab of concrete on which the Colosseum rests, which is like a 13-metre (yard)-thick oval doughnut, may have a fracture inside it,' he told the newspaper. He said intervention along the lines of the stabilisation work carried out in Pisa could be necessary if the concerns are confirmed, but he added that it was too early to judge what kind of intervention would be most suitable. The Colosseum - famous for hosting bloody gladiator fights in the days of the Roman Empire - attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and is usually packed with visitors.","City's authorities looking at making urgent repairs .

"Set free: Monsignor William Lynn was released from prison Thursday after winning an appeal of his landmark conviction in the priest-abuse scandal . A Roman Catholic priest who won an appeal of his landmark conviction in the priest-abuse scandal left state prison today after 18 months behind bars. Monsignor William Lynn left the prison in Waymart in northeastern Pennsylvania, prison spokeswoman Terri Fazio said, and was being taking by the Philadelphia Sheriff's Office to a city jail, where he would be fitted with an electronic monitoring device. After that, he'll be released, probably to the custody of a family member, one of his lawyers said. The attorney, Thomas Bergstrom, declined to say where in Philadelphia his client will live while prosecutors appeal the Superior Court ruling. Lynn, 62, was the first U.S. church official ever charged for hiding complaints that priests were molesting children. He was the point person for those complaints in Philadelphia from 1992-2004. Prosecutors charged him with felony child endangerment. But the appeals court said the law that existed at the time didn't cover people who don't directly supervise children. Lynn's lawyers, including Jeffrey Lindy and Alan Tauber, had made that argument even before his 2011 indictment, but Common Pleas Judge M. Teresa Sarmina sent the case to trial. Lynn was sprung from the Waymart prison just hours after the Roman Catholic Church helped him post 10 per cent of his $250,000 bail. District Attorney Williams criticized the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for putting up the money for Lynn's bail. Outraged: District Attorney Williams criticized the Archdiocese of Philadelphia for paying 10 per cent of Lynn's $250,000 bail . ‘It is disgusting that they would pay to free this man,’ Williams said at a news conference Tuesday, Philly.com reported. Williams, who described himself as a practising Catholic and former altar boy, said he was 'shocked and overwhelmed' by the decision of the church to help bail out Lynn. The prosecutor has vowed to appeal the Superior Court decision by next month's deadline. ‘William Lynn is no patsy. He is no fall guy,’ Williams said. ‘He is a cold, calculating man who endangered the welfare of countless children for decades by moving known predators throughout the Archdiocese of Philadelphia.’ The Philadelphia archdiocese has been in the crosshairs of city prosecutors since 2002, when the priest-abuse scandal broke in Boston. Lynn, Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and other church officials — accompanied by lawyers — were grilled for days by an earlier grand jury that issued a damning report in 2005 but concluded that no charges could be filed. Lynn (left) leaves Philadelphia Criminal Justice Center for a lunch break on March 26, 2012 in Philadelphia during his trial on covering up pedophile abuses . Prosecutors tried again under District Attorney Seth Williams, who charged three priests with new sexual assault allegations in 2011 and Lynn with protecting the accused predators by hiding complaints in secret files. Bevilacqua, by then frail and elderly, was a potential witness in Lynn's case but died before trial. By that time, his mild-mannered successor, Cardinal Anthony Rigali, had been replaced in Philadelphia by dynamic Archbishop Charles Chaput. Chaput has twice visited Lynn in prison and has said that no one person should become the scapegoat for the abuse crisis. Bergstrom, his attorney, said Lynn has become just that. ‘There's clearly some reason to believe that that's what happened here,’ Bergstrom said. Public outcry: Bob Hoatson, of West Orange, N.J., and with Road to Recovery, demonstrates outside the criminal justice center December 30 . Lynn, at his July 2012 sentencing, told Sarmina he tried his best to address the festering sex-abuse problem. He also voiced regret over his climb up the archdiocesan hierarchy. ‘I am a parish priest. I should have stayed [one],’ Lynn said. Sarmina acknowledged that Lynn sometimes sent accused priests for therapy, but she said he ultimately protected the church's reputation over the souls of children. She sentenced him to three-to-six years in prison. Lynn's conviction stems from the transfer of accused priest Edward Avery to a new parish, where he was later accused of raping a former altar boy in the church sacristy. Defense: Lynn's attorney Thomas Bergstrom (left) said his client (right) has become a scapegoat for the sex abuse crisis . Avery pleaded guilty and is serving 2 1/2- to five years in prison, although he denied the assault when called to testify at Lynn's trial. Lynn remains a priest in good standing with the church, and could return to ministry. He last served as pastor of St. Joseph's in Downingtown, an affluent suburban parish whose members supported Lynn at his trial. A spokesman for the archdiocese did not immediately return a phone message Thursday.","Monsignor William Lynn, 62, oversaw hundreds of priests in the Philadelphia Archdiocese .

"German football star Marco Reus has been fined more than £427,000 pounds - for driving his luxury Aston Martin without a licence. It is the highest motoring offence fine ever handed down in the country.

German football star Marco Reus has been fined more than £427,000 pounds for driving his luxury Aston Martin without a licence . 'I decided back then to take that road but the reasons I did it are something I cannot really understand today,' Reus told German daily paper BILD. Dortmund's prosecutor's office said the fine related to incidents from 2011 until this March. It is not uncommon in Germany for wealthy people to be hit with mammoth financial penalties because authorities take the view they can afford to pay them. 'Today I know that I was too naive and that it was stupid. I have learned my lesson and this will not happen again,' Reus said. The club could not be immediately reached for a comment. The 25-year-old winger was stopped by police several times and received speeding tickets on at least five occasions since 2011 before authorities twigged he had been driving without a licence . According to Bild he got stopped for the final time in March this year when he was en route to a training game in Dortmund and a police patrol pulled him over. A quick check on the computer showed he had no licence - and never had one. He was blitzed by speed cameras on the autobahn five times for going too fast and each time he paid the fines - but police then did not know he had never passed a test. Henner Kruse of the Dortmund prosecutor's office said: 'Six times between September 2011 and March 2014 he was stopped and so the fine for driving without a licence is very high.' Reus is estimated to earn around £150,000-a-month.

"An American woman spent 61 years of her life living in an iron tube that breathed for her after polio left her paralysed. Martha Mason lay immobile in the tube  - dubbed the iron lung - that worked as a type of ventilator, increasing and decreasing the air pressure to expand and contract her lungs because her own muscles were too weak. She lay horizontal the 7-foot-long, 800-pound iron cylinder that encased all but her head. Martha Mason spent 61 years of her life living in an iron tube that breathed for her after polio left her paralysed. (She is pictured with professor and documentary filmmaker Mary Dalton, from Wake Forest University) Martha Mason lay immobile in the tube  - dubbed the iron lung - that worked as a type of ventilator, increasing and decreasing the air pressure to expand and contract her lungs because her own muscles were too weak . Ms Mason had had become paralysed at just 11 years old after suffering polio – very shortly after the disease had killed her brother Gaston, Oddity Central reports.

In a book she wrote,  “Breath: Life . in the Rhythm of an Iron Lung (thanks to the introduction of voice . recognition software), she said: ‘I knew that I had polio.

Those who have written about her life say her curiosity and desire to live as normal life as possible were the key to her longevity. Despite her being in a situation most people would consider horrific, Ms Mason, who was born in 1937 and lived in Lattimore, North Carolina, graduated from high school with the highest hours and hosted dinner parties. In the video, she said:  ‘It [living like this] has become such a normal thing for me – I don’t even think about it – I really never give it a lot of thought.

"A study's shown that a husband's 'agreeable personality' and good health plays a key role in preventing conflict (illustrated) in a marriage . The stresses and strains of modern living mean that plenty of people seek a divorce. And a new study has shown that a husband’s ‘agreeable personality’ and good health plays a key role in preventing conflict and an enduring marriage. Scientists believe the same characteristics in wives play less of a role in limiting conflict between couples who have been together for a long time, however. ‘Wives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health,’ said James Iveniuk, PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. ‘If the wife is in poor health, there doesn't seem to be any difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband,’ he said. The study is based upon a U.S. survey analysing the relationships of 953 heterosexual couples who are either married or living together. Participants ranged in age from 63 to 90 years old and the average length of their relationships was 39 years. The survey of older adults participating in the National Social Life Health and Aging Project, which ran the survey, compared the characteristics of the husbands to the characteristics of their wives. Each person was interviewed and asked to describe themselves. Mr Iveniuk and his co-authors found many gender differences when they examined personality traits including openness, experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and anxiety. They added a new measure called ‘positivity,’ which was an overarching characteristic described as a person's overall desire to be seen in a positive light. 'Wives report more conflict if their husband is in poor health,' said James Iveniuk, PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. The study quizzed men and women who ranged in age from 63 to 90 years old who are in a relationship that has lasted for an average of 39 years . A husband's good healthy plays a key role in preventing conflict in a long marriage. Wives report more conflict if their husband is ill.If a wife is in poor health there is little difference in terms of the quality of the marriage for the husband. Similarly, wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict in the marriage but their positivity had no association with their husband's perception of problems. ‘Wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict. However, the wives' positivity had no association with their husbands' reports of conflict,’ he said. Co-author Linda Waite, Lucy Flower Professor of Urban Sociology at the university, said the study's measurement of marital conflict could be summarised as, ‘How much does your spouse bother you?’ They found that clashes are not primarily about fighting or violence, but whether one spouse criticises the other, makes too many demands, or generally gets on the other person's nerves. It also revealed that men who describe themselves as neurotic or extroverted tend to have wives who complain more about the quality of the marriage. Men with self-described neurotic wives may consider worrying to be a more ‘gender-appropriate’ role for women, according to the study. Husbands reported more criticism and demands from their wives overall, but also higher levels of emotional support. 'Wives whose husbands show higher levels of positivity reported less conflict (illustrated). However, the wives' positivity had no association with their husbands' reports of conflict,' according to the study . Professor Waite said: ‘Several previous studies have been about the implications of marital status on health. ‘This research allows us to examine individual marriages and not “married people.” We have the reports on the quality of the marriage from each person, about their own personality and their own health.’ The researchers suggest that future studies might examine the question of whether low levels of conflict in marriages require not only the absence of factors, such as poor health and negative traits, but also a better balance of emotional responsibilities between husbands and wives. They believe some of the differences between husbands and wives may change as researchers study younger couples entering later life, compared to the current generation of older couples who may have more conventional gender roles. Married women are 28 per cent less likely to die from heart disease than unmarried women - and it's all down to nagging. Researchers say that even though marriage makes no difference to women's chances of developing heart disease, they are more likely to get treatment early is a partner constantly encourages them to. They also believe that getting married can lead to lifestyle changes and mean women are more likely to take medication. The scientists behind the study admit they do now know the reasons for this difference. However, Dr Sarah Floud and colleagues at Oxford University's Cancer Epidemiology Unit suggest one explanation could be that the partners of married women may encourage them to seek early medical treatment for symptoms. 'Married women were no less likely to develop heart disease than women who were not married, but they were less likely to die from it,' Dr Floud said. 'This means that, over 30 years, about three in 100 married women would die from heart disease compared with about four in 100 women who are not married or living with a partner.' Other studies have also shown that partners tend to encourage their spouses to take medication and make changes in unhealthy lifestyles. The findings come from the latest analysis of data from a large UK study of women's health run by Oxford University researchers, the Million Women Study.","University of Chicago study found a husband's good health plays a key role in preventing conflict between couples who live together long-term .

"Great Britain's European 100 metres champion James Dasaolu insists athletes can not afford to be distracted by the doping allegations engulfing their sport. A programme broadcast by German TV station ARD revealed allegations of systematic doping and cover-ups in Russia and it was announced on Tuesday that Dick Pound, the hard-hitting former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), would head an independent three-man commission investigating the damaging claims. Dasaolu's event has been tainted by doping, with the fastest man in the world in 2014, Justin Gatlin, a two-time drug cheat. Tyson Gay, the second fastest man in history, returned to the track this summer after a reduced one-year suspension, while former world record holder Asafa Powell also came back to competition after his enforced absence for testing positive for a banned stimulant. James Dasaolu hopes British athletes cannot afford to be distracted by doping allegations . On Gatlin, Dasaolu said: 'The sport has allowed him back in, he's served his time and he's come back. All you can do is just get on with it and train and control what you can control as an athlete in your performances. 'I think I raced him once and I think he said, 'good luck' to me or something like that, but apart from that I didn't really converse with him.' Asked about the latest drug scandal to hit the sport, Dasaolu added: 'I'm just an athlete, I just focus on myself, focus on competing, focus on training and that's all we can do as athletes - as opposed to focusing on the politics within the sport. That's a distraction, you can only focus on yourself. 'I'm pretty sure the sport will be cleaned up and all things will be good eventually.' Dasaolu's training partner Asha Philip, one of a crop of exciting young British women sprinters, said: 'If we're worrying if (other competitors) are on drugs, that means they are affecting us, they will be draining our energy and we wouldn't be concentrating on what we came to a championships to do.' Philip has joined Dasaolu's Loughborough-based training group under Steve Fudge and both athletes will compete at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham in February, with the European Indoor Championships taking place in Prague the following month. Great Britain's Dasaolu wins the men's 100m final during day two of the 2014 European Athletics Championships in Zurich . The Birmingham meeting is the same one at which Dasaolu earlier this year suffered the hamstring injury which ruled him out of the World Indoors and denied him the chance to compete at the Commonwealth Games. But the 27-year-old, whose career has been hampered by injury, said he was not taking a risk with his fitness by doing another indoor season. 'There is no risk at all, I believe I am over my injuries and that's that,' said Dasaolu, who added that a decision had yet to be made over whether he would compete in Prague. '(My fitness) been very consistent this winter, I've had no hiccups.' The Londoner is also hopeful of playing a greater role in the 4x100m relay team next year, having not been part of the quartet which won gold at the European Championships in Zurich in August, despite being the individual 100m champion. Stephen Maguire has replaced Rana Reider in charge of the relay programme. 'I was always involved with the squad, I just unfortunately never got the opportunity to run, but I definitely will be involved with the relay (in 2015),' Dasaolu added. 'As a team, bringing in the additions of myself, I'm sure we'll be able to contend for global medals now.' :: Watch the world's best athletes compete at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix on Saturday 21 February.

"Anyone with any knowledge of military history knows the golden rule – don’t mess with a Gurkha. But the knife-wielding mugger in this drama clearly had no idea what he was messing with. He pushed Taitex Phlamachha, a former member of the famous fighting force, up against a wall and demanded money. Father-of-two Taitex Phlamachha recovering in hospital following the attack which left him serious injuries to his left arm . In the fight that ensued, a knife blade was buried in Mr Phlamachha’s arm, but he still managed to get the better of his attacker. The 38-year-old shop owner was taking an evening walk with his wife Asha when they stopped to look in the window of a health shop in Maidstone, Kent. Suddenly he was hurled against a wall and allegedly told to ‘hand over the money’, or be stabbed. The former soldier and black belt in karate and taekwondo warned his attacker: ‘Don’t mess with Gurkhas. We’re trained to fight.’ The pair fell to the ground where the mugger knelt on Mr Phlamachha’s chest and tried to stab him. Mr Phlamachha blocked the attacks and at the same time even managed to throw his mobile phone to his wife so she could dial 999. An X-ray picture the six inch blade left stuck in Mr Phlamachha's arm.

The Iraq and Afghanistan veteran had no idea he had a blade in his arm until he saw the knife handle on the road. Medics rushed him to Maidstone Hospital before he was transferred to Tunbridge Wells Hospital, Pembury, where surgeons removed the blade. The heroic ex-soldier said: ‘I tried to warn him – don’t mess with Gurkhas. ‘I did say, “You need to know who I am”. But he didn’t listen. ‘My wife was terrified he was going to kill me.

"US President Barack Obama admitted he should have expected to be criticized for hitting the links on the same day that he addressed the beheading of American journalist James Foley and spoke with his family. 'Part of this job is also the theater of it,' he told NBC News' Chuck Todd. 'Well, it's not something that always comes naturally to me. But it matters. And I'm mindful of that.' He added: 'I should have anticipated the optics' of playing golf. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama acknowledged he should have antipicated that it would look bad to go for a round of golf on the same day he addressed the killing of James Foley . Obama, who was on vacation at the time of Foley's murder, was heavily criticized for heading to the golf course at Martha's Vineyard where he was vacationing on August 21. He said he was 'heartbroken' over Foley's death and that it was hard for him to hold back tears while speaking with his family. Obama blamed the contrasting images partially on how the press follows him everywhere, even while he is 'supposed to be on vacation'. He said there's always potential for bad news to occur, and sometimes it'll happen while the president is on holiday.

The president also said during the interview that he would address the nation on the threat posed by ISIS militants on September 10, a day before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. 'What I'm going to be asking the American people to understand is, number one, this is a serious threat,' Obama said about the speech, which is not expected to be a prime time address. 'The strategy both for Iraq and for Syria is that we will hunt down [ISIS] members and assets wherever they are. I will reserve the right to always protect the American people and go after folks who are trying to hurt us wherever they are.' He said he would not definitely not advocate for the deployment of US ground troops to deal with the threat, saying it would be a 'profound mistake'. The Ebola outbreak was another subject discussed during the interview, with Obama calling it a 'national security priority'. The US has a responsibility to give countries without sufficient public health infrastructure the resources they need to contain the virus, he said. Obama also warned the virus could mutate if not controlled and could become dramatically more threatening for the world and even for the US. 'If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates,' he said. 'It becomes more easily transmittable. And then it could be a serious danger to the United States.' Obama said it was essential the US keep spending money on public health aid in developing countries and chastising those who have opposed it. 'I have no higher priority than keeping the American people safe. I think I've done a very good job during the course of these last -- close to six years doing so,' he said in defending his policies overall.","He said he should have 'anticipated the optics' of playing golf on the same day he spoke to Foley's family .

"A scale model of Noah’s Ark has been built based on a blueprint drawn up in ancient Babylon 4,000 years ago. The expert behind the Biblical undertaking rocked the world last year with his controversial theory that the fabled ark was round and made of reeds. Now such a coracle-like vessel has been constructed according to exact instructions marked on clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia, now modern-day Iraq. Scroll down for video . The replica ark and its original design was based on a coracle and the vessel (pictured) has been constructed according to exact instructions marked on clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) Dr Irving Finkel, assistant keeper of the Middle East department at the British Museum, said the scaled-down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘well behaved animals’. He first discovered the description, written in cuneiform – the first script in human history - years ago when the tablet was found by a member of the public and worked for 20 years in deciphering it. It says the ark is round and is the first record of the famous Babylonian flood story, which was later recorded in the book of Genesis. Dr Irving Finkel, assistant keeper of the Middle East department at the British Museum said the scaled-down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘well behaved animals’. Its design was based on an ancient Babylonia tablet that he first deciphered five years ago . Dr Finkel explained the ark has two levels - a house on the upper deck - and space for animals below (pictured). He suggests that with careful organisation, it would have been theoretically possible to provide a home for lots of local species - even though he does not think the ark was built to its original huge design . What a revelation: According to the ancient Babylonian writing, Noah's Ark was a 220ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six London buses - with walls 20ft high. However, Dr Finkel does not think such a vast vessel would have been possible, having supervised the building of the smaller replica . The text describes god speaking to Atram-Hasis, a Sumerian king who is the Noah figure in earlier versions of the ark story. He says: 'Wall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall! Atram-Hasis, pay heed to my advice, that you may live forever! Destroy your house, build a boat; despise possessions And save life! Draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design; Let its length and breadth be the same.' The ancient Babylonian text describes the ark as a round 220-ft diameter coracle with walls 20-ft high. According to the tablet, the ark had two levels and a roof on the top. The craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections. The 60 lines of text, which Dr Finkel describes as a 'detailed construction manual for building an ark', claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof. The tablet specifies that the Ark’s floor was the area ‘of one field’ and its sides were constructed from 30 ribs and 3,600 stanchions, covered with ‘one finger of bitumen,’ The Times reported. Experts say the ‘real’ Ark would have been half the size of a football pitch in area and built with enough rope to stretch from Edinburgh to London. Dr Finkel concluded that the Ark could never have been built to that size, based on its structural integrity as well as the vast amount of materials needed. Historians specialising in Middle Eastern boat design, used computer models to test whether a full-size vessel could theoretically have sailed. Dr Finkel told MailOnline they found that ribs and planks large enough for the design couldn’t have been found anywhere in the natural world and concluded that the Babylonians didn’t have the technology to splice wood, making the full-size ark impossible to build. Despite this, a team  built a small replica in Kerala, south west India over four months. Their efforts are the focus of a forthcoming television programme called The Real Noah’s Ark, which will be aired on Channel 4 at 8pm on Sunday. Dr Finkel said that the team was able to stick to the ancient recipe in the way it was intended. The ark they produced weighed around 35 tonnes and required the right kind of materials to be imported or sourced locally and transported by elephant. The team didn’t cheat by using modern power tools, glue or nails, but instead used just wood, bamboo, palms and reed to secure the joints, as people may have done 4,000 years ago. Indian bitumen was used to waterproof the replica ark was was hard to work with (pictured). Dr Finkel said that if the waterproofing had gone better and superior quality Iraqi bitumen had been used, the ark could sail across the Atlantic and stay afloat because it was so stable . Experts say the ‘real’ Ark would have been half the size of a football pitch in area and built with enough rope to stretch from Edinburgh to London. A more traditional image of Noah's Ark is pictured, that shows the vessel as a ship with a bow and house structure at its centre . The tablet tells the familiar story of Noah's Ark, complete with detailed instructions for building a giant round vessel known as a coracle — as well as the key instruction that animals should enter 'two by two.' The artefact was discovered in the Middle East by Leonard Simmons, who indulged his passion for history while serving in the RAF from 1945 to 1948. The relic was passed to his son Douglas, who took it to Dr Finkel to translate. It is now on display at The British Museum. It is light brown, about the size of a mobile phone and covered in the jagged cuneiform script of the ancient Mesopotamians. Dr Finkel, said: 'It was really a heart-stopping moment [seeing the tablet for the first time] — the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat,' said Dr Finkel, . He believes a round boat makes sense. Coracles were widely used as river taxis in ancient Iraq and are perfectly designed to bob along on raging floodwaters. 'It's a perfect thing,' Finkel said. 'It never sinks, it's light to carry.' The team said the hardest part of the reconstruction was coating the outside and inside of the vessel with sticky bitumen, which was used to keep it watertight. ‘In ancient Mesopotamia this was the easy bit, for the best quality bitumen bubbled out of the ground like healing springs elsewhere,’ Dr Finkel explained. Instead the team had to make do with Indian bitumen which dries very fast and re-melts in the heat, making it incredibly difficult to work with. He arrived in Kerala to inspect the finished handiwork, remarking that it looks like it had ‘floated right out of the Bronze Age’. Sadly, however, the Ark was not as perfect as it seemed and when launched, water began leaking into the hull. A pump was used to keep it afloat. Despite this, Dr Finkel said that the inferior bitumen was to blame, but the Babylonian design was watertight and produced a stable vessel. ‘There would have been room for lots of well-behaved animals on the lower floor and with the right bitumen, we could have floated to New York,’ he said. Dr Finkel hailed the Babylonian design ‘extremely effective’ and said that it was extremely stable to be aboard. ‘If we could use Iraqi bitumen and plastered it on carefully, we could drift towards New York without trouble,’ he said. The expert compared watching the launch of the scale-size ark to watching the birth of a child. He told MailOnline: ‘I couldn’t do anything to help and was pacing but it was beautiful when it went in with a splash and floated. Really marvellous. ‘What was amazing was that we had a 4,000-year recipe and with some head scratching, we found we could do what it said.’ The coracle-like vessel has been constructed according to exact instructions marked on clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia, now modern-day Iraq, marked on this map showing ancient cities, including Babylon . The ark they produced weighed around 35 tonnes and required the right kind of materials to be imported or sourced locally and transported by elephant.The team didn’t cheat by using modern power tools, glue or nails, but instead used just bamboo, palms and reed to secure the joints, as people may have done 4,000 years . Dr Finkel said that the story of Noah’s Ark was an oral narrative for a long time, based on a destructive flood in around 1750BC. The poet who wrote on the tablet recounted the tale and possibly took his inspiration for the shape of the ark from what was outside his window floating along the Euphrates or the Tigris – coracles. ‘Coracles were frequently seen and were efficient craft made from bamboo, wood and bitumen, holding two to three people,’ he said. ‘They were a daily type of water transport and that when waterproofed won’t sink, so they keep their content – people and maybe goats – safe. He explains that when enlarged, the coracle turns into Noah’s Ark as a life-reserving raft with a roof. The measurements describes on the tablet are gigantic, but in proportion to those used to make the small coracles. Dr Finkel said that the poet was satisfying locals by recounting familiar details of the tale, while also pleasing fishermen and helping people to imagine the ark more accurately by providing measurements. ‘Someone added real data. He must have got information from local coracle makers and scaled it up. The numbers are accurate and sensible and that’s fascinating from a scientific point of view.’ ‘It’s a mythological story with a high adventure element, with the poet stopping to give you dimensions so you could build one,’ he said. He doesn't think the tablet provides evidence the ark described in the Bible existed.

"Neo-Nazi thugs were left stunned as an Adolf Hitler impersonator waved and addressed them from a balcony - before taunting the mob and driving away. The stunt in the town of Brandenburg, near Berlin, happened by chance as an actor filmed a bleak comedy imagining the return of the fascist leader to 21st century Germany. Even police officers escorting the skin-headed protesters did a double-take when 'Hitler' exited his car, dived inside a nearby building and appeared on a balcony to tell the demonstrators: 'I'm back!' Double-take: Neo-Nazi activists in a town near Berlin had a run-in with actor Oliver Masucci, who was dressed as Hitler for a comedy film and waved to them from a balcony (above) before insulting them and driving away . I'm back: The impersonator is thrusting his Hitler character into real-life situations - but did not expect the rally . He then got back into his car and snarled: 'You're all pussies!' before driving off with one last wave. It prompted hurried calls by police into their walkie-talkies to see if the Hitler lookalike had breached strict postwar rules governing all-things-Nazi. He was in fact being played by Oliver Masucci - who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time but decided to hit back at the protest on Saturday. The actor was filming the movie 'He's Back,' a comedy based on the bestselling book of the same name about a Fuhrer who wakes up from a long sleep to emerge into modern-day Germany. It is said to be using the same tactics as Sacha Baron Cohen's hit film Borat, which placed his offensive character in real-life situations among unsuspecting members of the public. 'He was making fun of the right wingers,' said a set insider. 'He knew it would plunge them into confusion if they saw their hero on a balcony just like in the days of old'. Balcony: Hitler addresses Nazi soldiers at a rally. The stunt was to taunt the crowd of neo-Nazi protesters . Hotel employee Henry Wendrich said the actor looked 'deceptively real'. Police feared the protesters could have turned violent after the coincidental meeting, but in the end it all passed off peacefully. 'It was unfortunate that the shooting coincided with this rally,' said Dietlind Tiemann, the local mayor. The protesters were members of the far-right NPD party, which the government has sought to ban several times in recent years because of its anti-immigrant, anti-tolerance agenda. The party won a seat in the European Parliament earlier this year despite a fresh bid to have the party outlawed for stirring hate in what is generally a liberal country. Nazi symbols including the swastika are banned in Germany, and politicians have beefed up laws in recent years to stop neo-Nazi marches near sensitive sites such as Berlin's Holocaust memorial.","70  activists in Brandenburg from NPD party, which Germany is trying to ban .

"Michael Schumacher is 'fighting', the former Ferrari racing boss has said, adding that he believes the ex driving ace will get better. Jean Todt spoke on Schumacher's condition shortly after visiting him at his Swiss mansion where he is being cared for in a purpose-built medical suite.

Fighting back: A former racing boss has said Michael Schumacher, pictured in December 2013, is 'fighting' Schumacher spent time in the rehab clinic after coming out of his medically-induced coma following a ski accident in the French Alps on December 29 last year, which left him with catastrophic brain injuries. 'What's important is that he lives and that his family is with him. We really believe that things will get better. He needs time and to be left alone,' Jean Todt said. 'We can say that he can probably never again drive a Formula 1 car. But he is fighting.' President of the International Automobile Federation Jean Todt, said that Schumacher will never drive a Formula 1 car again . Accident: Schumacher, pictured with wife Corinna, suffered severe brain injuries after a ski accident in December last year and was put in a medically induced coma . 'In the past weeks and months, he has made progress in relation to the severity of his injury,' said Todt, now president of the International Automobile Federation after visiting him last week. 'But a long and hard road is in front of him. Hopefully things will improve. His family is close to him. He needs time and peace.' Schumacher is being cared for by a team of 15 experts at his home. It is understood he remains immobile and unable to speak. The team at Gland, where a purpose-built mini-clinic has been constructed inside the Schumacher mansion, consists of 15 people, most of them provided by the Lausanne clinic. His care at home is estimated to be costing his family 100,000 pounds per month. At the end of the year his father Rolf is moving from his home in Germany into a specially constructed residence built for him in the grounds of the 35 million pound Schumacher mansion at Gland, on the shores of Lake Geneva.","Michael Schumacher 'will be able to recover from his injuries', says F1 boss .

"Details of a bizarre Nazi plan to breed giant Angora rabbits in concentration camps to provide fur-lined clothing for Hitler's armed forces has been unearthed in a German archive. 'Operation Munchkin', as it was known, was the brainchild of sinister S.S. chief Heinrich Himmler who was had a career as a trained chicken farmer before he became the architect of the Holocaust. He ordered a breeding programme for the rabbits and specified that they were to be raised in luxury just yards away from the where the most terrible crime against humanity was taking place. Bleak: French prisoners at Nazi concentration camp Dachau, near Munich, which was the first camp to have a rabbit breeding station . While prisoners were starved, beaten and tortured to death in Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen and Dachau, the rabbit hutches in these and 27 other camps camps were spacious and heated. The furry residents were also given a daily supply of fresh vegetables -probably more than the human inmates who were forced to tend them saw in a month. The idea was for the rabbits to produce enough fur to make lined coats for Luftwaffe pilots, cosy socks for U-Boat personnel and warm undergarments for the infantry in winter according to the German newspaper Der Spiegel. The plans were detailed the 'Angora book' which was discovered hidden at his home on the fringes of the Tegernsee lake in Bavaria in 1945. Keeping cosy: Himmler's dream was to collect the rabbit fur in order to provide warm coats for Luftwaffe pilots and even socks for U-boat personnel . Valuable: The Nazis treated their Angora rabbits very humanely and considered them a valuable resource in their plan to protect their troops from the harsh cold of winter . Apparently he deliberately hid it there for fear that it would fall into enemy hands. It contains 150 photos of fluffy rabbits, some being cared for by concentration camp prisoners in their trademark striped 'pyjama' uniforms. Some of these inmates were even executed if their S.S. overseers believed they were not treating their rabbit charges with enough respect. Partners in crime: Himmler, notorious head of the Gestapo, stands with Hitler to observe a Nazi parade in 1940 . The breeding programme began in 1941 shortly after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Himmler got the idea for utilising rabbits for wool production after reading of a small-scale scheme that was started during the First World War. He wrote at the time: 'Throughout Europe it is my intention to establish breeding stations in concentration camps' and even decreed that they should be kept in pens where they had 'plenty of space.' Often their hutches were just yards away from barrack huts designed for 200 where upwards of 800 prisoners lived. In Dachau, the first such camp and the one which became a model for all that followed, he ordered the cultivation of peppers which were intended to feed the rabbits. Himmler, who was also obsessed with creating the perfect blonde, blue-eyed 'Aryan' master race of Germans, immersed himself in every aspect of the plan. But like many other Nazi ideologies Himmlers plans failed to match up to reality. A chart in his book counted 6,500 rabbits by the end of 1941 and 25,000 by 1943. But by that year, when the project finally stopped as the war began to turn disastrously against Germany, the total amount of wool collected amounted to less than five tons. When the camps were liberated many empty hutches were found but the rabbits were long gone. Jack DeWitt, one of the liberators of Dachau near Munich himself 'liberated' a fur-lined jacked which he found on a pile in a storeroom at the camp where 36,000 people were murdered between 1933 and 1945. He called it his 'bunny coat.'","Starving inmates of concentration camps were forced to grow fresh vegetables to feed the animals .

"Philip Benwell, 38, has been jailed for a year after he knocked into a girl at a pedestrian crossing . A cyclist has been jailed for a year after he fled the scene when he almost killed a young girl. Philip Benwell, 38, crashed into nine-year-old Leila Crofts at a pedestrian crossing when the lights were on red in Bournemouth, Dorset, last July. Leila was knocked unconscious in the collision as she headed to the beach with her au pair. But Benwell continued cycling as the girl was taken to hospital with serious head injuries and fought for her life in intensive care. Benwell, who was cycling downhill at the time of the crash, came off his bike but then picked it up and walked off. Witness Louise Barber had to use the au pair's mobile phone to telephone Leila's mother and inform her of the accident. She tended to Leila along with lifeguards from the beach before the girl was rushed to hospital. Mrs Barber, 42, said: 'The au pair couldn't speak English too well and was asking for me to speak to the child's mum on the phone. 'I spoke to her mum and told her I was sorry to say this, but her daughter had been in an accident - it was awful.' Leila, now aged 10, is recovering well from the crash, and is back at home in Sandbanks with her parents Chanine Boulton, a nursery owner, and IT consultant Darren Crofts. When police launched an appeal to find the missing cyclist, Benwell, from Bournemouth, handed himself in the day after the incident.

"Theresa May today echoed Margaret Thatcher with a stark rallying cry to Tory activists to defend British values from Islamist extremism. The Home Secretary said the country needed to ‘face down extremism in all its forms’ in the wake of the murder of British hostage David Haines by a UK-linked ISIS terrorist. She said: ‘We must stand up for our values. Because, in the end, as they have done before, those values, our British values, will win the day, and we will prevail.’ The remarks are reminiscent of Mrs Thatcher’s famous address to the Tory conference in 1984 after the Brighton bomb attack. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May said British values would 'prevail' in the fight against Islamist extremists . Mrs Thatcher said the threat Britain faced from the IRA was ‘probably the most testing crisis of our time - the battle between the extremists and the rest’. She told the Conservative conference: 'We are fighting, as we have always fought, for the weak as well as for the strong. We are fighting for great and good causes. 'We are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them. 'This Government will not weaken. This nation will meet that challenge. Democracy will prevail.' Mrs May’s speech today – 30 years after Mrs Thatcher’s – sparked huge cheers in the conference hall. She also hit out at stop and search laws and the ‘outrageous irresponsibility’ of Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg in blocking greater surveillance powers for the police and security services. The Home Secretary – tipped as a future Tory leader – said fundamentalists rejected British and Western values, including democracy, the rule of law, and equality between citizens. She said: ‘They believe that it is impossible to be a good Muslim and a good British citizen. And they dismiss anybody who disagrees with them - including other Muslims - as non-believers. The Home Secretary's address this afternoon came before the London mayor Boris Johnson this afternoon . Mrs May - famous for her 'kitten heals' - wore black shoes with a gold pattern on the heel on the third day of Tory conference today . Theresa May will force through new laws to limit police stop and search powers if officers keep stopping black youngsters illegally. The Home Secretary said abuse of stop and search was 'hugely damaging to public confidence in the police'. She said: ‘It’s difficult for most of us here in this hall to really appreciate the effects of stop and search. You see, most of us are white. Most of us are of a certain age. ‘But imagine walking home, or driving to work one day, and being stopped by the police. Imagine, having done nothing wrong, you are patted down, you have your pockets turned inside out, and your possessions examined. ‘Imagine you ask why you’re being searched and you’re told it’s “just routine” even though the police need “reasonable grounds for suspicion” that you’ve broken the law. ‘Imagine growing up and the indignity of this happening to you twenty, thirty, forty, even fifty or sixty times. And imagine what it’s like to feel, deep down, that this is only happening because you’re young, male and black.’ Mrs May said it the abuse does not stop should would pass new laws to make it happen. ‘This hateful ideology has nothing to do with Islam itself. And it is rejected by the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Britain and around the world. ‘So let the message go out from this hall that the extremists will never succeed in dividing us. Let the message go out that we know Islam is a religion of peace and it has nothing to do with the ideology of our enemies.’ Mrs May’s day had begun with controversy over her plans to ban preachers of hate from attending public meetings or spreading their bile on Twitter. Civil liberties groups accused her of infringing free speech. But she shrugged off the criticism to warn of the perils of not confronting Islamic extremism in the UK. She said fundamentalists rejected British and Western values, including democracy, the rule of law, and equality. Mrs May pledged to ‘undermine and eliminate extremism in all its forms’. She said: ‘Across the country, there are concerns about the way Shari’ah law is being applied, the way women are told to live and the intolerant attitudes shown to people of different beliefs and ways of life. ‘We must not sleepwalk into separation, segregation and sectarianism. ‘We must be clear to people that the United Kingdom is a great place to live. We choose to live here, immigrants come to live here, and many dream of building a life here because we have a free society. ‘We celebrate different ways of life, we value diversity, and we cherish our freedom to lead our lives as we choose. ‘All British people – including British Muslims – are free to practise their faith, and wear whatever clothes they choose. They are free to establish their own faith schools and give their children - including their girls – the best education possible.’ But she added: ‘You don’t just get the freedom to live how you choose to live. You have to respect other people’s right to do so too. ‘And you have to respect British values and institutions. The rule of law. Democracy. Equality. Free speech. And respect for minorities. These are the values that make our country what it is. These are our values. There is no place for extremism here.’ She said Britain was not a ‘moral vacuum’, adding: ‘We have to stand up for our values as a nation.’ Mrs May ended her speech with a triumphant declaration that British values would 'prevail' against extremists . Mrs May's speech clearly resembled the former Prime Minister's 1984 address to the Conservative Party conference after the 1984 Brighton bomb . 'The nation faces what is probably the most testing crisis of our time, the battle between the extremists and the rest. We are fighting, as we have always fought, for the weak as well as for the strong. 'We are fighting for great and good causes. We are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them. This Government will not weaken. This nation will meet that challenge. Democracy will prevail.' 'We know the overwhelming majority of British people want to be free. Free from danger. Free from fear. Free from prejudice. Free from discrimination. Free to practise their religion... Free to get on with their lives. 'We must confront segregation and sectarianism. We must face down extremism in all its forms. We must stand up for our values. Because, in the end, as they have done before, those values, our British values, will win the day, and we will prevail.' Mr May added that the ‘overwhelming majority of British people want to be free’, adding that the UK must not become a country where this is no longer possible. Mrs May added: ‘We must confront segregation and sectarianism. We must face down extremism in all its forms. ‘We must stand up for our values. Because, in the end, as they have done before, those values, our British values, will win the day, and we will prevail.’ In 1984, after the Brighton Bomb attack, Mrs Thatcher said the country was in a 'battle to uphold the rule of law'. She said this demanded 'the resolve and commitment of the British people'. ISIS terrorists could get their hands on nuclear weapons to attack the West, Theresa May warned today. The Home Secretary said the terror organisation, which has carved out vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria, posed a direct threat to Britain. She said: ‘They have made clear that they want to go on attacking Western targets. That is why it’s right that we are part of the international coalition dedicated to ISIL’s destruction.’ The Home Secretary's address today enhanced her growing reputation within the Conservative Party . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling attacked 'crazy' human rights judgments, in his set-piece speech at the Tory conference today. The Cabinet minister said reforms to human rights laws would be introduced ‘shortly’, suggesting the plan may be announced by the Prime Minister tomorrow. Mr Grayling had been expected to unveil the Tory plan for a British bill of rights to replace Labour’s human rights act. He said: ‘It is crazy that someone who poses a terrorist threat to this country should be able to claim their human rights to stay here. 'It is unacceptable that human rights laws should back those who break our immigration and planning rules, and yet all too often ignore the rights of our own people.’ He said Britain should not be told to give prisoners the vote ‘by an international court accountable to no one in this country’. Mrs May added: ‘If ISIL succeed in firmly consolidating their grip on the land they occupy in Syria and Iraq, we will see the world’s first truly terrorist state established within a few hours flying time of our country. ‘We will see terrorists given the space to plot attacks against us, train their men and women, and devise new methods to kill indiscriminately. ‘We will see the risk, often prophesied but thank God not yet fulfilled, that with the capability of a state behind them, the terrorists will acquire chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons to attack us. This is not somebody else’s battle. ‘They have made clear their ambitions. And they have made us their enemies. ‘ . Mr May said enemies should be taken at their word that they want to attack us. But she added: ‘We must not flinch. We must not shy away from our responsibility. We must not drift towards danger and insecurity. While we still have the chance, we must act to destroy ISIL.’ The Home Secretary said ‘at least’ 500 British nationals had gone to Syria and Iraq – including the suspected killers of those who murdered David Haines. She said in the case of ISIL the danger was ‘clear’. Mrs May said: ‘They have already murdered British and American citizens in the most brutal and cowardly manner possible.’","Top Tory said the country needed to 'face down extremism in all its forms'

"A disheveled and puffy-eyed Robert Hughes has been convicted on a tenth child sex offence on his second and final day in court of jury decisions. Brought into Sydney's Downing Centre District Court by prison officers, 65-year-old Hughes looked teary but managed to mouth 'I'm OK' from the dock to his wife. Celebrity agent Robyn Gardiner asked for a vacant seat in the public gallery so she could be closer to her husband during the jury's verdict on the final two of 11 child sex charges. Scroll down for video . Robyn Gardiner, the partner of actor Robert Hughes (right), looked in shock as she left Downing Centre District Court on Monday after he was convicted of a string of child sex charges . The jury convicted Hughes on Monday of nine offences, returning on Tuesday after agreeing on just one of the remaining charges. They found Hughes guilty of committing an act of indecency towards a child. The jury was discharged after not being able to reach a verdict on the charge of inciting a 15-year-old to commit an act of indecency in 1988. Ms Gardiner approached her husband in the dock and whispered to him before kissing Hughes, as two prison officers stood behind him. And on Tuesday night the Nine Network revealed that the other members of the Hey Dad! cast - Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, Christopher Truswell, Simone Buchanan and Sarah Monahan - would appear on A Current Affair on Wednesday night. The network would not reveal what Hughes's former colleagues were prepared to say on the show. Robert Hughes in Hey Dad!: During his trial for child sex offences against the children of family friends and a Hey Dad! cast member, the court heard from a number of Hughes' former colleagues who accused the former star of repeatedly exposing himself . Secret on set: Robert Hughes'  sexual behaviour on set which included appearing naked and molesting Sarah Monahan was discussed among cast members, clockwise from centre front: Hughes, Simone Buchanan, Christopher Truswell, Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, and  Monahan . Hughes' court appearance came after his first night in Australia's largest maximum security prison tonight. Hughes, 65, was taken to the Silverwater Remand and Reception Centre in Sydney's western suburbs on Monday afternoon following his conviction for nine child sexual assault charges brought against him. The Hey Dad! star was handcuffed and driven from a central Sydney court in a prison van to the jail, where he was subject to standard procedure when entering a prison - strip-searched, photographed, and relieved of all personal belongings except his wedding ring and clothed in a green prison tracksuit and a pair of white sandshoes. Hughes has now been found guilty of ten child sex offences, including two counts of sexual assault and seven counts of indecent assault against three women, who were aged between seven and 15 when the assaults took place. Hughes, pictured arriving at Downing Centre Local Court in March, was convicted of 10 child sex offences  committed between 1983 and 1991 . After being found guilty of the first few offenses, Hughes began crying in the dock while shaking his head and repeating 'no, no', reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Following the verdict on nine charges, Hughes stood up in the court room and yelled 'I am innocent!' Hughes was accused of a number of molesting three girls aged from six or seven up to 15 years, between 1983 and 1991. The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault. The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial. Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed. Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her her to swim between his legs and trapping her there. Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself and, in one case, tried to grope them. Hughes denied all the allegations. The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations.","Celebrity agent Robyn Gardiner asked to be seated near her husband .

"Sam Boon (pictured) died in 49C heat when he collapsed and medical aid did not get to him for two hours . A teenager who died in extreme heat during a school expedition to Morocco was being supervised by a rookie instructor, an inquest heard. Sam Boon, 17, collapsed in front of classmates on a five-day trek in temperatures of 120F (49C). Newly qualified trek leader Stephen Bates tried to resuscitate him, but failed, the hearing was told. It took two hours for an emergency vehicle to arrive – and when Sam eventually reached a medical centre he was pronounced dead. The emergency vehicle was a minivan, rather than a fully equipped ambulance, his father Ken, 55, said before the hearing. Sam, a student at the Business Academy of Bexley, in Kent, had raised more than £1,000 to join the 17-day trip to Morocco organised by the World Challenge company. The itinerary was to include a trek to Amezmiz in the High Atlas foothills and a few days helping to build a school. The cause of his death has not yet been determined but it is thought he may have suffered heat exhaustion. Yesterday Ben Compton QC, for the Boon family, told Bromley Coroner’s Court that during an assessment, team leader Mr Bates had been advised to stick to an ‘easy lead’ trek becase of concerns that ‘he might have difficulty communicating with young people’. He asked Sam’s teacher William Pemberton, who helped to organise the trip in July 2012: ‘Would it have concerned you if you had known that Stephen Bates had only recently qualified as a student leader, that  in fact he had never been to Morocco – this was his first expedition?’ Mr Pemberton said: ‘Absolutely. We were told by World Challenge that their expedition leaders had knowledge of the areas.’ Sam died during a trip to Morocco where he was helping to raise funds to renovate a school . The inquest heard Sam, who was . studying for A-levels in maths and physics, took medication to prevent . bed wetting before he died. Users of the drug, Desmomelt, must drink no water for an hour before use and limit intake for eight hours. Sam’s . mother Karen, 51, said he had suffered from nocturnal enuresis, or bed . wetting, but this had significantly improved in recent years. Coroner Selena Lynch asked if he would have told anyone on the trip. Mrs . Boon replied: ‘No, not on that trip. He used to carry a couple [of . pills] in his wallet but he did not  necessarily take them.’ Sam, who lived in Abbey Wood, . South-East London, was 6ft 2in and over 20st, but while he would have . been classified as obese his teachers said he was fairly active and . healthy. His mother said World Challenge gave little information on fitness training, although the company denies this was the case. Sam Boon's mother insisted her son, who was 6ft 2in and weighed more than 20 stone, had been physically active ahead of the Morocco trip . She . said parents had been assured that there was helicopter evacuation . available for emergencies, adding: ‘I knew it wouldn’t be like it is . here. But I thought there would be some sort of protective bubble.’ But she admitted Samuel's written application for the trip had not included details of his medication for bed-wetting. She found three DesmoMelt tablets were missing when his belongings were recovered after his death, the court heard. 'If he took any he would have taken them in the hotel because he was sharing with two other people,' Mrs Boon said. Eleven . pupils from the Business Academy in Bexley, south east London, went on . the trip, and had raised funds to support the expedition. They had been due to work on a rural project for seven days after the trek, but the trip was cut short after Samuel died. At the time of his death, temperatures in the region were reported to have risen as high as 49C. Mrs . Boon told the court that her son, who was classed as obese with a Body . Mass Index (BMI) of 36, walked regularly before going to Morocco and . often played golf with his father. 'He was up for going out with friends,' she said. 'He walked to school every day, which was 20 minutes to half an hour each way, and he walked our dog most days.' 'He was not a couch potato?' coroner Selina Lynch asked. Sam died during a trek to Amizmiz in Morocco . 'No,' Mrs Boon replied. 'We knew he was going to be walking five hours a day. I didn't think that would be a problem with breaks.' Mrs Boon told the court that a presentation she attended from the trip's organisers had placed an emphasis on safety. Organisers . had claimed a satellite telephone, emergency beacons and a helicopter . evacuation would be available in emergency situations, she said. Before . today's hearing, the teenager's father, Ken Boon, said in a statement: . 'Sam collapsed on the second day of the trek and had to wait for two . hours by the roadside in extreme heat for evacuation, which came in the . form of a minibus rather than an ambulance. 'Whilst . the expedition leader and the school staff did everything they could on . the ground to try to save him, they, along with our son, were badly let . down and we hope the inquest will answer our questions as to why this . happened.' Mrs Boon told the . court her son, who was studying Maths and Physics A levels, was an . 'easy going, laid back young man' who had previously stayed away at V . Festival with his friends in 2011. The inquest continues.","A level student was in Morocco to raise funds for a school in the country .

Co-conspirators: Daisy Gutierrez, 19, left, is charged with first degree murder for luring a man to his death. Her father Salvador, 56, right, is charged with helping hide the May 21 crime . Both father and daughter made their first court appearance at a Sunday bond hearing. 56-year-old Salvador Gutierrez is charged with concealing a homicide for watching as the unnamed murderer dismembered Reyes’ body. It was a grisly end to a brutal crime. Prosecutors say Gutierrez’s unnamed new boyfriend smashed in the bedroom door as Gutierrez began to take off her clothes. He then allegedly stabbed Reyes and hit him with a pipe before decapitating the man, whose official cause of death was ‘multiple sharp force injuries’ and ‘assault.’ Grisly: Police say Jose Reyes, 30, was brutally slain and dismembered by a vengeful new boyfriend of Daisy Gutierrez on May 21 . Tricked: The 30-year-old Honduran had moved to the U.S. five years before his brutal murder. Police say he was lured to his death by Daisy Gutierrez . Police say Salvador Gutierrez spent three hours digging a hole in his backyard and watched as the killer placed the body parts in plastic bags into the hole. Daisy Gutierrez and the still-unnamed killer then fled to New Jersey. Reyes' body was found by police on Friday after they searched the home. It is unknown what prompted detectives to look for Reyes at the Gutierrez residence. It is also unclear what prompted Daisy Gutierrez—a mother of three who is also three months pregnant with her new boyfriend’s child—to admit to the crime along with her father.# . Scene: Police say this house on the South Side of Chicago was the site of the unthinkable crime . Buried: Investigators found Reyes' dismembered remains in plastic bags in the backyard. 19-year-old Gutierrez and her father reportedly have admitted to helping facilitate the murder . Her bond was set at $2 million Sunday. Her father’s was set at $500,000. Sally Daly, a spokeswoman for the Illinois state’s attorney’s office, said that the boyfriend has been taken into custody for questioning in New Jersey. Daly declined to identify him because he had not yet been charged. Police say they also found human body parts in jars in the house. They have no yet determined whether those remains belong to Reyes or to someone else. Authorities say Reyes had taken an interest in Daisy Gutierrez. He knew her because two of her young children was with his brother. Assistant state’s attorney Heather Kent said Gutierrez has a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old with Reyes’ brother. Relentless: Reyes was the brother of Gutierrez's ex-boyfriend and had apparently taken a liking to the 19-year-old himself before her jealous lover stabbed him, bashed him with a pipe, and sliced his throat . On Sunday, father of those two boys and the grieving brother of the victim spoke for the first time. 'My sons can't stay with people like that,' Jorge Moncada said in Spanish. 'I'm going to fight for them.' He also said these tragic events are entirely surprising. 'She threatened me and my brother several times, she planned this,' said Moncada. According to her public defender, Gutierrez’s third child, a three-year-old, is with another man. She is now three months pregnant with the new boyfriend’s child. Police say Reyes’ attraction to Gutierrez infuriated the new boyfriend. On May 21, she conspired with the new lover to kill Reyes, police say. She asked her family to leave the house so that she could have Reyes over. After the killing, she allegedly told her father that she had 'fixed the problem.' After their arrests on Friday,  Kent says Daisy and Salvador Gutierrez admitted to the crimes in a video recording. Neighbors of Reyes' are already starting up a collection to help the family repatriate his body to Honduras. 'He was a wonderful person, a really hard worker, really nice. Like a neighbor he always helped,' a neighbor said.","Police say 19-year-old Daisy Gutierrez lured Jose Reyes, 30, into the deadly clutches of her jealous boyfriend using a striptease .

"A flying saucer took to the skies over Hawaii on Saturday as Nasa tested a new vehicle that could one day be used to transport people to Mars. The test drive of the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator, which was carried 120,000ft (23 miles) into the sky by a helium balloon, was considered a success despite the parachute not fully working. Cheers in the control room as the vehicle launched from the island of Kauai quickly died down however, when it became clear that the new inflatable braking system had failed to property unfurl. Scroll down for video . The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD), landed off the coast of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii after being dropped from a balloon 120,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean at the time of the drop. The low-density supersonic decelerator could one day be used to take astronauts to Mars, and is shown here before the test . The Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD) is a large, doughnut-shaped first deceleration technology that deployed during the flight. The second is an enormous parachute (the Supersonic Disk Sail Parachute). Imagery downlinked in real-time from the test vehicle indicates that the parachute did not deploy as expected, and the team is still analyzing data on the parachute so that lessons learned can be applied for the next test flights, scheduled for early next year. 'We are thrilled about the test,' said Mark Adler, project manager for LDSD at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'The test vehicle worked beautifully, and we met all of our flight objectives. 'We have recovered all the vehicle hardware and data recorders and will be able to apply all of the lessons learned from this information to our future flights.' NASA officials were still pleased with . the flight for the $150 million experiment, and said it was a . pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver . heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to Mars. The . space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the . same parachute design in use since the twin Viking spacecraft landed on . the red planet in 1976. Saturday's launch over Hawaii was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no-fly zones. Technology needs to advance, or else humanity won't be able to fly beyond the International . Space Station in low-Earth orbit, according to Michael Gazarik, head of space . technology, at NASA headquarters. 'Technology development 'is the surest path to Mars,' Gazarik said at a June briefing. Viewers around the world followed . portions of the mission in real time over the internet thanks to cameras . on board the vehicle that beamed back low-resolution footage as it . ascended over the Hawaiian island of Kauai. After . taking off at 11.40am from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, the . balloon boosted the disc-shaped vehicle over the Pacific. Its rocket motor ignited, carrying the vehicle at supersonic speeds to an altitude of 34 miles above the surface. The environment this high up is similar . to the thin Martian atmosphere, where NASA still uses 1970s technology . to bring rovers and other devices onto the Martian surface. The test vehicle hardware, black box data recorder and parachute were all recovered later in the day after the craft was dragged aboard a Nasa ship . A graphic shows the proposed flight path and touch down for the flying saucer mission . 'We want to test them here where it's . cheaper before we send it to Mars to make sure that it's going to work . there,' project manager Mark Adler of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory . said during a pre-launch news conference in Kauai in early June. When . it prepared to drop back the Earth, a tube around the vehicle was . supposed to have expanded like a Hawaiian puffer fish, creating . atmospheric drag to dramatically slow it down from Mach 4, or four times . the speed of sound. The parachute, which on this occasion failed to fully unfurl, is used to guide the vehicle to a safe ocean splashdown. At 110ft in diameter, the parachute is twice as big as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover through the Martian atmosphere in 2011. Engineers planned to analyze the data and conduct several more flights next year before deciding whether to fly the vehicle and parachute on a future Mars mission. In flight: The saucer-shaped vehicle hovering Saturday over Kauai, Hawaii, during an experimental flight high in Earth's atmosphere . Saturday's test: This image shows the launch of the high-altitude balloon carrying a saucer-shaped vehicle for NASA . The vehicle splashed down in the ocean at approximately 11:35 a.m. HST (2:35 p.m. PDT/5:35 p.m. EDT), after the engineering test flight concluded. The test vehicle hardware, black box data recorder and parachute were all recovered later in the day. In order to get larger payloads to Mars, and to pave the way for future human explorers, cutting-edge technologies like LDSD are critical. Among other applications, this new space technology will enable delivery of the supplies and materials needed for long-duration missions to the Red Planet. 'This entire effort was just fantastic work by the whole team and is a proud moment for Nasa's Space Technology Mission Directorate,"" said Dorothy Rasco, deputy associate administrator for the Space Technology Mission Directorate at Nasa Headquarters in Washington. 'This flight reminds us why NASA takes on hard technical problems, and why we test - to learn and build the tools we will need for the future of space exploration. 'Technology drives exploration, and yesterday's flight is a perfect example of the type of technologies we are developing to explore our solar system.'","The Saturday launch over Hawaii took the spacecraft 23 miles above the surface and into the Earth's atmosphere .
Conditions at that altitude are similar to those on Mars .

"At a reputed £10,000 a day, this lawyer certainly doesn’t come cheap - and even the smallest victory in court still counts as a win for him. So it was to Nick Freeman that £75,000-a-week England footballer Danny Welbeck turned when he faced a speeding charge. And sure enough the 55-year-old lawyer, known as ‘Mr Loophole’ for his ability to get celebrities off driving charges, struck a victory for Welbeck - by having his speeding fine cut by £5. The sum is what the star earns in 40 seconds. 'Mr Loophole': Nick Freeman (left) managed to save £75,000-a-week footballer Danny Welbeck (right) £5 off a speeding fine - what the star earns in 40 seconds . Mr Freeman represented the Manchester United striker after he was caught doing 82 in a 50mph zone. He had refused a fixed-penalty notice and decided to go to court. There, Welbeck, 21, escaped a ban and was ordered to pay a fine of just £65 for the offence in the Northenden area of Manchester last November. However the standard fine is £60, so Mr Freeman went back into court where the district judge admitted his error and reduced the penalty. Welbeck, who recently signed a four-year contract at Old Trafford, was pulled over when an officer spotted him speeding in his Range Rover. The policeman followed the striker, on the day after his 21st birthday, and recorded him travelling at speeds between 72 and 82mph. Courts must consider disqualifying drivers caught doing more than 66 in a 50mph zone, but the striker decided to sign up Mr Freeman to help. Welbeck was said to have declined to accept the offer of a fixed-penalty notice at the roadside and the case went before a district judge yesterday. International star: Danny Welbeck (left) celebrates scoring for England against Sweden at Euro 2012 in Kiev in July 2012 with Andy Carroll (right) Mr Freeman told Manchester Magistrates’ Court that a recording taken by the officer’s car proved Welbeck was not told what he was being offered. He said the striker thought he was . getting a ‘producer’ document, which would have made him hand over his . driving documents at a police station. But Welbeck could not do this because his brother - who looks after administration - had lost the paper section of the licence, Mr Freeman said. District Judge Jonathan Taaffe accepted his argument, fined Welbeck £65 and issued three points - almost the same penalty that was originally offered (with a £60 fine). He then reduced the fine to £60 following Mr Freeman’s intervention, but Welbeck was also ordered to pay costs totalling £365. Speaking on behalf of Welbeck, who is away on international duty with England, Mr Freeman said the player was sorry for his actions. He told the court: ‘He (Welbeck) would like to express that he very much regrets his involvement in this incident. 'He would like to express that he very much regrets his involvement in this incident. He regards himself as a role model and believes that in practising what one preaches. He takes his responsibilities extremely seriously' Lawyer Nick Freeman on Danny Welbeck . ‘He regards himself as a role model and believes that in practising what one preaches. He takes his responsibilities extremely seriously.’ Mr Freeman is known as ‘Mr Loophole’ for exploiting holes in prosecution cases against many celebrities (see below). His previous clients include Welbeck’s manager at Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson, and former Red Devils and England star David Beckham. Welbeck, from Hale, Greater Manchester, is set to play tonight as England open their World Cup 2014 qualifying campaign in Chisinau, Moldova. Sir Alex was last week in the headlines after banning the club's young stars from driving flashy sports cars from new sponsors Chevrolet. It offered first-team players a choice of luxury cars, but the Scot decreed no player under the age of 23 should be allowed to order a sporty model. Colin Montgomerie Nick Freeman helped him avoid a driving ban because the golfer has a fear of flying and lived far from his children . Jimmy Carr . Cleared of using a mobile phone while driving after Freeman argued that . Carr had used the dictation setting of his iPhone to record a joke as . he drove and that using the phone for such a purpose was not illegal . under current law. Jeremy Clarkson . After being loaned a car by Alfa Romeo, the vehicle was caught doing . 82mph in a 50mph zone. Alfa Romeo sent the ticket to Clarkson, who was . acquitted and awarded costs because the prosecution did not offer . evidence as to who the driver was at the time of the offence. Andrew Flintoff . The former England cricket captain was caught on camera doing 87mph in a . temporary 50mph zone. Freeman pointed out that the prosecution notice . was sent two days later than the law allows and Flintoff was let off. Ronnie O'Sullivan . Freeman accused the magistrate of winking at a journalist. The . magistrate replied: 'Why would I wink at anybody? Do you think I'm gay . or something?' Freeman subsequently had the trial stopped. At the . retrial, the court accepted the explanation that O'Sullivan was 'too . depressed' to provide a urine sample. Wayne Rooney .

"Saviour? Chinese researchers say the lemon and lime fizzy drink may help quell a hangover . It has long been a strong coffee or even a Bloody Mary that a worn-out reveller has turned to the morning after the night before. Now, however, experts say that Sprite may be best thing to lay your hands on. Chinese scientists examined 57 beverages - ranging from herbal teas to fizzy pop - before concluding that the lemon and lime drink performed the best. They first decided to look at what causes a hangover and discovered that rather than the alcohol itself, it could be the process of the body breaking down the alcohol that causes symptoms such as nausea and headache. When we drink, our livers . release an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which breaks down the . ethanol in alcohol into a chemical called acetaldehyde (so less the alcohol enters the bloodstream). This is then broken down into another chemical called acetate by an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). While acetate is usually considered harmless - and has been linked with some of the health benefits of alcohol - being exposed to the more potent acetaldehyde is what causes hangover symptoms, the researchers found. With this in mind, the researchers at Sun Yat-Sen University, in Guangzhou, tested a range of drinks, from teas, hot herbal drinks and various fizzy drinks - and examined how they affected ADH and ALDH. They discovered that a herbal drink made with hemp seeds actually increased the length of the ADH process and inhibited the ALDH process, so a hangover would last for longer. But Sprite was among the drinks that sped up the ALDH process, causing the alcohol to be broken down more quickly, thereby reducing hangover duration. 'These results are a reminder that herbal and other supplements can have pharmacological activities that both harm and benefit our health,' Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Prodessor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World. Forget the herbal tea: The researchers discovered that a herbal infusion using hemp seeds actually prolonged a hangover . Young people - and regular drinkers - produce more of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, so they don't feel the effects of alcohol as much as older people, said consultant hepatologist Dr Rajiv Jalan of University College Hospital London. The only good news is that, with age, hangover headaches become less of a problem. The headaches are the result of alcohol damaging the brain, causing it to swell temporarily and crash against the skull. But as we age our brains shrink, so there is more room for it to swell before it hits the bone. When we drink, our livers . release an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which breaks down the . ethanol in alcohol into a chemical called acetaldehyde (so less the alcohol enters the bloodstream). This is then broken down into another chemical called acetate by an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). While . acetate is usually considered harmless - and has been linked with some . of the health benefits of alcohol - being exposed to the more potent . acetaldehyde is what causes hangover symptoms, the researchers found.","Chinese scientists examined 57 drinks - from herbal teas to fizzy drinks .

"A former Scientologist yesterday claimed she was quizzed about her sex life during an ‘audition’ to be Tom Cruise’s wife. Anette Iren Johansen, 36, told how she was asked ‘very private questions’ during an interview in Copenhagen in 2005, just weeks before he started dating Katie Holmes. A senior Scientologist demanded to know if she had any ‘sexual perversions’ and whether she had previously had any lesbian affairs or ‘gay sex’, she alleged. 'Search for a bride': Former Scientologist Anette Iren Johansen (left) has claimed she was among a number of women 'auditioned' to be the future wife of actor Tom Cruise before he married Katie Holmes (right) The Norwegian was training to be a vet . in Denmark when she joined the Church of  Scientology in 2002 after it . promised to help her mother recover from a serious illness. As . her involvement in the church increased, she says she was pressured to . give up her studies and went on to feature in some of its training . films. In January 2005 – . a year after Cruise had separated from his girlfriend Penelope Cruz – . she was invited to what she initially believed was an audition for . another video, but which turned out to be something ‘very different’. A . film crew of four turned up along with a make-up artist and hair . stylist who made her look ‘very glam’, she told Australian magazine . Woman’s Day. ‘They asked me so many questions about my life, my family . background, everything I’d ever done in Scientology,’ she said. ‘Days . later, the man who had led the audition phoned from Los Angeles and told . me he needed to ask some “very private questions”. ‘He . asked, “Do you have any sexual perversions?”.’ During the ‘extremely . weird’  interview he also demanded to know if she had had any lesbian . affairs. Miss Johansen said . she had no idea why she was questioned until last year when a US . magazine reported how Scientology had held a number of similar auditions . of women to find Cruise’s next wife. The auditions for the role of Tom Cruise's new wife allegedly took place at the Church of Scientology's Celebrity Center in Los Angeles . She said: ‘Every little detail was the same. There is no doubt I was auditioned to be Tom’s wife.’ Cruise . got engaged to Miss Holmes in June 2005 and married her in November . 2006. The couple separated last year amid claims that she filed for . divorce because she feared Cruise would send their daughter Suri to a . Scientology ‘boot camp’. Another . former Scientologist, Marc Headley, who claims to have seen a highlight . reel of the women’s auditions, said he believed Miss Johansen’s . interview was ‘absolutely’ to assess her as a potential lover for . Cruise. He said: ‘Those are the exact same questions that they were asking the other girls. ‘The . reason the sexual question came up was that they had some girls with . histories that weren’t so great. So they were being careful.’ Miss . Johansen has since left the Church of Scientology because she claims . that ‘terrible abuse’ is being committed within the  organisation. She . now lives with her boyfriend in Oslo. British-Iranian . actress Nazanin Boniadi is said to have been similarly ‘auditioned’ and . even went out with Cruise for several months in the autumn of 2004. Last . night a Scientology spokesman said: ‘There was no project, secret or . otherwise, ever conducted by the Church to find a bride [via audition or . otherwise] for any member.’","Anette Iren Johansen joined group in 2002 while studying in Denmark .

"When newlyweds Stan and Claudia Gocman settled down to watch a video of their big day they hoped to relive precious memories. Instead they were greeted with a vile anti-Semitic rant about the bride and their guests after the cameraman accidentally recorded his racist commentary and then forgot to edit it from the tape. As he filmed the happy couple dancing at the reception, Anthony Aurelius could be heard saying: ‘I don’t think I blame Hitler.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Offended couple: Stan and Claudia Gocman were blissfully happy to be married but sat down to watch their wedding video and heard the cameraman insulting her and their guests . He also told his unnamed assistant: . ‘Some of the Jewish women are very beautiful to look at. But I can tell . you, they’d be right f****** cows. Very f****** snooty, they’d be a pain . in the a***.

His . wife, a 27-year-old fashion buyer for Ralph Lauren, said: ‘It’s . completely anti-Semitic and ignorant. Even the assistant, who is Asian, . was racist. I just don’t understand it. ‘At first, I was really upset but then I was furious.

"James Holmes is returning to court later today for two weeks of hearings focusing on what evidence prosecutors can use against him in the Colorado theater shooting case. Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 70 others in 2012. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Some of the evidence in dispute comes from two dating websites where Holmes set up accounts before the shootings. Profile: The judge overseeing the movie theater shooting case will allow prosecutors to introduce evidence from the suspect's online dating profile . Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 70 when he opened fire at a Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July . Prosecutors say that in his website profiles on Match.com and AdultFriendFinder.com, Holmes asked, 'Will you visit me in prison?' Prosecutors say they plan to use that to show Holmes knew the shootings were wrong, undercutting his insanity plea. Holmes is accused of opening fire in a crowded Aurora movie theater . during a midnight show on July 20, 2012. He faces 166 counts, including . murder and attempted murder. Evidence? James Holmes created a profile on a popular sex website just days before the massacre . According to the judge's summary of the arguments, Holmes' created the . Match.com account in April 2012 and the AdultFriendFinder.com account . just 15 days before the shooting on July 20. Both were last accessed two . days before the shooting. Photos posted to both accounts showed . Holmes with the orange-dyed hair made infamous in his first court . appearance after the shooting. The titles associated with Holmes' postings on both sites were, 'Will you visit me in prison?' Loner: Holmes set up profiles on two dating websites just weeks before the shootings occured . Holmes created the profile on AdultFriendFinder.com on July 5, just two weeks before the shooting and included a picture of himself with reddish, orange hair. Holmes, who used the screen name classicjimbo included a cryptic message on the top of the profile which read, 'Will you visit me in prison?' In his profile, he described himself as he's 6'0"" and single with an athletic body. He said he was a 'light/social drinker', however in the section where he's asked if he smokes or does drugs, he answered, 'I'd prefer not to say.' He also states his penis size as 'short/average'. Disguised: Holmes was wearing body armour during the shooting and police initially thought he was one of them . 'A reasonable inference may be drawn that the user of the accounts posted the question because he anticipated doing something that he was aware would warrant prison time,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour's wrote. The judge also wrote that evidence from both dating sites could be used in the trial in relation to the identification, sanity, intent, deliberation and culpable mental state of the suspect. Samour overruled several distinct objections defense attorneys made in their attempt to have this evidence barred. That included objections about online dating posts' relevance, timing and the direct connection to the suspect. The judge has already rejected one defense attempt to suppress the website evidence. Lawyers for the shooter, James Holmes, have challenged the admissibility of almost all the key evidence in the case — from photos found on Holmes' iPhone to explosives seized in his apartment to statements he made to police after his arrest. Defense attorneys argue that investigators seized the evidence without establishing a proper legal foundation, initially entered Holmes' apartment without a warrant and questioned Holmes after he asked for an attorney. Prosecutors contend the evidence was seized properly and that their methods were justified by ongoing fears for the public's safety even after Holmes was arrested. The judge's decision on the evidence could impact prosecutors' ability to argue that Holmes knew what he was doing was wrong — a key element in disproving Holmes' insanity plea. A trial is scheduled for next year.","James Holmes set up profiles on two adult dating websites in the weeks leading up to the shooting .

"Hands in pockets and casually dressed, he looks like a typical teenager as he poses with Ed Balls when he was Labour Education Secretary. Reyaad Khan, 15, was said to be thrilled when Mr Balls visited his youth club in Cardiff in July 2009 as the teenager had dreamed of becoming Britain’s first Asian prime minister. Khan also spoke of the need to rid the world of evil. But, fast forward five years, and he has become a notorious jihadi terrorist. Scroll down for video . Then: Khan (circled left) in a group picture with Mr Balls, then Education Secretary, at a youth centre in 2009 . Now: Khan aged 20 in an Islamic State recruitment video from Syria which was released earlier this year . Now 20, he is fighting for Islamic State in Syria and was featured in June with two other Britons in a propaganda video for the radicals. He has since boasted of preparing for ‘martyrdom’ and also claimed he is planning on ‘fireworks’ – sparking fears that he could be part of a wave of suicide attacks against US interests in the north of the country. The picture of him at the Riverside Warehouse youth club was still on the Shadow Chancellor’s Twitter feed this week. Last night, Khan’s mother Rukia, 41, said of the visit: ‘My son came home and was excited and said he had met a Labour minister.’ Khan is thought to have left Cardiff last year. His mother declined to say if he has been in touch since appearing in the IS video. Teenager: Before leaving for Syria Khan was outspoken politically and dreamed of being Prime Minister . Of course, Mr Balls could not have foreseen that Khan would develop a murderous hatred of anyone who opposes his bloodthirsty comrades in Islamic State. Just a year after the picture was taken, Khan spoke on a film of his wish to rid the world of ‘evil’ and of the problems of growing up in a deprived inner-city area. In an interview at the time, he argued the government wasted resources on ‘illegal wars’ and said more money ought to be spent on young people to help prevent them being led down the ‘wrong path’. Speaking in a faint Welsh accent, Khan detailed the challenges of avoiding criminality in the Cardiff neighbourhood where he grew up, claiming there were fewer chances for younger people to succeed. He said teenagers from minority ethnic backgrounds suffered stereotyping. Asked if the world was a good place, he said: ‘The world can be a lovely place but you’ve just got to get rid of the evil. If everyone could choose the good, the evil will go away.’ Propaganda: Khan, left, appeared in the recruitment video (pictured) alongside other jihadists in Syria . He sat on a local youth forum, and said on Facebook that he wanted to be the first British Asian to become prime minister. The photo of Khan and Mr Balls was taken on 23 July 2009. The then Education Secretary was escorted on the hour-long visit to the youth centre by local Labour MP Kevin Brennan. According to a local newspaper report, Mr Balls listened to rap and hip-hop music, had a go at mixing sounds on decks and tried out his keyboard skills. The South Wales Echo quoted him as saying: 'There’s so much talent and invention amongst young people. Having equipment such as the music studio and specialised support is a huge part of making Riverside Warehouse a success’. Described as a 'multi-cultural community centre', Riverside Warehouse received most of its funding last year in the form of a £69,400 grant from the Labour-led Welsh Assembly government. Until very recently it was run by Safer Wales, a charity that works on hate crime and domestic violence.","Reyaad Khan  met then-Education Secretary at Cardiff youth club aged 15 .

"Paranoid schizophrenic Phillip Simelane, 23, killed 16-year-old Christina Edkins on a bus in Birmingham three months after he was freed from prison without supervision or treatment . A girl of 16 was stabbed to death on a bus by a paranoid schizophrenic who had not been given proper  treatment for 12 years, a damning report reveals. Christina Edkins died on her way to school when Phillip Simelane plunged a nine-inch kitchen knife into her chest in a tragedy that the report says could have been prevented. Simelane, 23, was caught hours after the attack at a supermarket with the weapon in a carrier bag, and was jailed indefinitely after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Three months earlier, he had walked free from prison unsupervised despite his serious mental illness. Yesterday’s report revealed how medical staff, police and the prison service missed a string of chances to get Simelane treatment over a 12-year period. From April 2009 to December 2012 alone, he went through 17 mental health reviews or formal assessments by four organisations, involving a number of healthcare experts. Incredibly, none resulted in his detention under the Mental Health Act before Christina’s death on 7 March 2013. The report, which was ordered by Birmingham Cross-City Clinical Commissioning Group, found the tragedy on the No9 bus in the city centre could have been prevented. Review chairman Dr Alison Reed said: ‘As Christina’s death was directly related to [Simelane’s] mental illness, it could have been prevented if his mental health needs had been identified and met.’ Now a damning report has revealed that a string of social services failures spanning 12 years could have led to the fatal stabbing of Christina . The report included a victim impact . statement from the girl’s mother, Kathleen Harris, 49, who said losing . her daughter was like having her heart ‘ripped out’. The 95-page document also made 51 . recommendations to improve the way information is shared between the . NHS, prison service and police force. Christina’s family – her mother, . father Jason Edkins, 44, brother Ryan, 19, and sister Joanne, 25, from . Halesowen, West Midlands, said in a statement: ‘We agree that the fatal . attack on Christina could have been prevented. ‘A paranoid psychotic was left to his . own devices, without continued medication, a vagrant living on buses . without help or supervision from our public services.’ Philip Simelane, pictured on the number 9 bus in Birmingham on the morning he stabbed Christina. Simelane's own mother had called in police 21 times since he was 14 after a string of violent confrontations at the family home . Simelane began suffering mental health issues as a schoolboy and was known to mental health professionals in the West Midlands having served three prison sentences in 2012 . Before Christina was killed onthe number 9 bus he spent two spells inside Hewell, near Redditch, and at Birmingham Prison in Winson Green. He had been released from custody three months before the killing but was under no supervision or reporting orders . Simelane came to Britain from . Swaziland, southern Africa, aged nine. He was homeless and had served . three jail terms in 2012, but was not under any supervision orders . despite threatening his own mother with a knife months earlier. In a . statement, his family said: ‘Our heart goes out to the other grieving . family. An incident that could have been avoided has changed our lives . in a tremendous way.’ James Morris, MP for Halesowen and . Rowley Regis, and head of the all-party parliamentary group on mental . health, said: ‘It is vital the lessons in this report are learned.’ John Short, chief executive of . Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘We . fully accept the review’s findings and acknowledge that we must learn . from what happened.’ A paranoid schizophrenic stabbed a schoolgirl to death on a bus three months after he was released from prison without supervision or treatment . ‘Every morning we would walk together. She would walk to the bus stop, and I would walk to work. We would give each other a kiss and say goodbye, and she always said “love you mom”. I can’t walk that way any more. ‘Some months after her death, we had a parcel delivered – it was Christina’s exam results. She had done really well. Also enclosed was the school yearbook . . . there was a quote by her headmaster: “If a school could choose its pupils it would be full of Christinas”. ‘[When I] saw this it broke my heart. I can’t explain the feeling – it is emptiness – like someone has ripped out my heart.’ Christina’s family (including father Jason, . left, and mother Kathleen, right) said they hoped 'no other family has . to experience the heartache of such a meaningless and avoidable death of . a loved one'","Phillip Simelane, 23, killed 16-year-old Christina Edkins on a bus .

"David Cameron has been accused of yet another royal gaffe, after allegedly sharing a joke with MPs at the Queen’s expense. The Prime Minister apparently gossiped about how the monarch had to be corrected for ‘mistakenly’ claiming to have the original of a painting that hangs at his country seat, Chequers. However there was confusion last night about whether the Queen was actually wrong, with experts supporting her claim. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron told Tory MPs about the private conversations with the Queen during a visit to Chequers earlier this year . New details of David Cameron's habit of gossiping about the Queen emerged today, with the monarch unlikely to be amused . The 'family group' painting by Anthony Van Dyck is owned by the Queen, while a copy is hung at Chequers . Details of the indiscretion came just days after Mr Cameron was forced to apologise to the Queen for saying she ‘purred’ down the phone when given the results of the Scottish referendum. Mr Cameron described that incident, which took place last Tuesday in New York, as ‘embarrassing’ and vowed never to discuss conversations with the monarch again. His latest blunder is said to have occurred last Monday, hours before he flew to New York, when he invited 20 MPs to Chequers. According to the Evening Standard, the group was given a tour of the 16th-century Buckinghamshire mansion, which has been the weekend home of successive Prime Ministers since 1921. Reports of Mr Cameron's latest gaffe emerged as he was pictured enjoying himself at the Tory party conference . Samantha Cameron arrived in Birmingham tonight, ahead of husband David's speech to the Tory conference . At one point, the Prime Minister pointed out an Anthony van Dyck painting of a family then went on to recount a conversation that took place when the Queen and Prince Philip made a visit to Chequers in February. According to Mr Cameron, the Queen was taken on the same tour as the MPs. When she spotted the Van Dyck she remarked that she had the original hanging at Windsor Castle. Mr Cameron allegedly told MPs that a Chequers curator set the Queen straight – insisting that the version she was looking at was in fact the original, and hers must be the copy. The Queen’s no doubt diplomatic answer remains unknown – and the party is said to have moved on. However last night there was confusion about whether the Queen or Mr Cameron and his curator at Chequers was right. While political sources claim the PM was ‘on the money’, website Art History News insisted the Queen, who it says, ‘knows her art’ was ‘absolutely right’. The issue stems from the fact that a Van Dyck painting called A Family Group actually hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts in America. Experts think Mr Cameron could instead have been referring to another Van Dyck painting of a family, featuring children of Charles I. In an extraordinary sequence last week, David Cameron was heard talking about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the vote . Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron appears to have had no qualms about being so indiscreet about his private discussions with the head of state . In the most astonishing remark, Mr Cameron was heard to claim that The Queen 'purred down the line' In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: . 'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something.... 'She purred down the line... 'But it should never have been that close. 'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt… . 'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through. 'It was very nervous moments.' The portrait – called The Five Eldest Children of Charles I – is currently held by the Royal Collection. A copy of the painting is held by the Chequers Trust. But a spokesman for the Royal Collection confirmed to the Mail last night that the original of The Five Eldest Children of Charles I by Van Dyck is indeed currently hanging at Windsor Castle. The Art History News article said: ‘If the curator at Chequers really did not know that Van Dyck’s original was indeed in the Royal Collection, they should be sent to the Tower.’ Downing Street last night refused to comment. But a Tory MP present at the Chequers meeting said the Prime Minister had talked about his exchange with the Queen, saying: ‘The anecdote about the Queen was just a jokey thing. I’m sure he didn’t mean any disrespect by it.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the story but have no comment to make on any private conversation between the Queen and the Prime Minister.’ Prime Minister David Cameron has a reputation for speaking before he thinks . 'UKIP is sort of a bunch of ... fruitcakes and loonies and closet racists, mostly.' April 2006 . 'Too many tweets might make a tw*t.' July 2009 . 'Calm down dear.' April 2011, to Labour MP Angela Eagle . 'When you are left on your own [parenting], it's a good reminder of how difficult it is to do anything else when looking after a little one because you worry they might drown themselves in the sink whilst you're having a pee.' September 2013 . ‘I don’t buy the value stuff [bread]... I’ve got a breadmaker which I delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways.' October 2013 . 'I'm a massive fan, I’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person.' December 2013, on being on #TeamNigella during a court case where Nigella Lawson was a witness . 'I have got a piece of supermarket sociology, which is that there is something about Waitrose customers, is that they are the most talkative. I found that if I shop in Waitrose it takes me about twice as long as everyone wants to stop you, and have a chat. 'Whereas in other supermarkets I find I can dart round very quickly and get everything. It is something about your customers, they are very talkative, engaged people.' April 2014 . 'I have to say that after the events I’ve been facing over the past few day, assassination would be a welcome release.'

"Six months after Greg Pembroke launched the hit Tumblr account Reasons My Son Is Crying documenting his kids' hilarious temper tantrums, the upstate New York dad has become a published author. Pembroke's new book titled Reasons My Kid Is Crying features photos of toddlers sent to him by parents from around the world in the midst of epic meltdowns, supplemented by tongue-in-cheek captions explaining why the kids weep. One of the photos featured in the book shows a boy wailing next to a little girl sitting inside a supermarket shopping cart above a caption that reads: ‘He didn't want to share his leg hole.' Tears and laughter: Greg Pembroke, the dad behind the hit Tumblr page Reasons My Son Is Crying, has turned his online photo project into a book . Greg Pembroke started his photo project in April by photographing his sons amidst meltdowns . Another picture in the volume set to be published in the U.S. next spring shows a sullen little boy bawling because 'his aunt wouldn't let him play with an ax.' On a similar note, another page in Pembroke’s opus shows a baby dismayed that his dad would not let him drown in a pond. The book published by Pan Macmillan and its imprint Boxtree will go on sale in the UK Thursday with a price tag of £9.99. The compact 192-page volume will be released in the U.S. next April, followed by a German edition. For Pembroke, it all started last April when the married father of two from Rochester, New York, began taking photos of his sons, Charlie and William, mid-tantrums, and posting them online with funny captions explaining why his boys were in tears. Best of the best: Greg Pembroke's book, out this week in hardcover form in the UK, features a compilation of photos he has received from parents along with funny taglines . American readers will be able to buy the book next April . The first image of Pembroke's sobbing 3-year-old son had a tagline that read: 'I broke this cheese in half.' At the time, the dad had no way of knowing that the image of his boy crying over a broken dairy product would end up on the cover of his book. Pembroke, who writes commercials for radio stations, initially amused himself by sharing images and captions on his personal Facebook page. But when his light-hearted hobby attracted attention from friends and acquaintances eager to spread the word about his side project, Pembroke decided to launch a Tumblr page, which he dubbed Reasons My Son Is Crying. The photo blog went viral within a week, earning Pembroke and his family an invitation to appear on Good Morning America. Other media outlets, both domestic and international, also showed interest in Pembroke's unusual endeavor. Humble beginnings: Pembroke, who writes commercials for radio stations, initially amused himself by sharing images of his weeping boys and captions on his personal Facebook page . By popular demand: Pembroke's friends were eager to share the images of blubbering babies with a wider audience, which promoted him to create the Tumblr blog . Global phenomenon: The blog has drawn media attention in the U.S. and abroad, leaving Pembroke inundated with pictures of hysterical toddlers sent to him by parents from as far as China . Speaking to MailOnline in August, Pembroke said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there.' Over the past six months, Pembroke has been receiving emails from parents from as far as Australia and China sharing pictures of their own blubbering babies.","Greg Pembroke launched Tumblr blog Reasons My Son Is Crying last April .

"It was only when she got wedged in a turnstile on the way to watch her favourite team play that  football fanatic,Tegwen Morris realised she had to do something about her weight. The 36-year-old from Caernarfon, Wales, used to weigh more than 26 stone but following the traumatic experience she decided to kick her unhealthy lifestyle once and for all. She cut back on junk food and joined Slimming World and now she describes herself as 'a completely different person', tipping the scales at a healthy 11st 8lbs and slipping into size 12 clothes. Manchester United supporter Tegwen used to weigh more than 26 stone but now weighs just over 11 stone after joining Slimming World and kicking her unhealthy eating habits . Since her transformation Tegwen now enjoys going to the gym four times a week and has taken up kick boxing, . mountain walking and aqua aerobics. She is also overjoyed that she can watch her beloved Manchester United once again, as her bulging waistline was making it difficult to access the stadium. She said: 'I’d stopped going to the football . because I couldn’t fit through the turnstiles and had to stop three . times as I climbed the 176 steps to the seats. A different person: Tegwen now enjoys an active lifestyle and came fifth in a Slimming World contest . 'I burst into tears when I got weighed for the first time, I couldn’t believe how big I’d let myself get.' In a bid to shed the pounds Tegwen stopped indulging in takeaways and started attended sessions at her local slimming club. She added: 'Since then I’ve completely . changed the way I eat.

"Stuart Lancaster's injury-hit England squad looked focused as they were put through their paces in preparation to face New Zealand in the Autumn opener at Twickenham. England welcome the All Blacks to the home of rugby on Saturday as the first of four internationals to be played this month as part of the QBE Series. And despite the squad being depleted by injury the fit and available players enjoyed a training session in the Autumn sunshine at Pennyhill Park in Surrey on Tuesday. Graham Rowntree, the England forwards coach issues instructions during the England training session held at Pennyhill Park on Tuesday . George Kruis breaks with the ball as the England squad are put through their paces on Tuesday morning . Kruis could play on Saturday should Dave Attwood not return by the weekend after leaving the camp to attend the birth of his first child . Head coach Lancaster will be without a number of notable absentees for the entire series with Joe Launchbury the latest name to pull out of the fixtures against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia with a neck injury. England are already missing Geoff Parling, Alex Corbisiero, Mako Vunipola, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Ed Slater, Tom Croft and Manu Tuilagi for the series, and Launchbury's absence will be heavily felt. Dave Attwood is set to deputise for the injured Launchbury against New Zealand, but even the 27-year-old's availability is not assured after he left the camp on Tuesday to attend the birth of his first child, but England are hopeful he will return in time for Saturday's clash. Uncapped George Kruis is on standby to line up alongside Courtney Lawes in the starting XV if Bath second row Attwood is forced to miss the QBE Series opener at Twickenham. Calum Clark looks focused as he weighs up his options after breaking away with the ball during Tuesday's session . The England players are forced to dig deep practice their scrum during the training session at Pennyhill Park . November 8th: England v New Zealand . November 15th: England v South Africa . November: 22nd: England v Samoa . November 29th:  England v Australia . 'Dave has gone home, his wife's in labour,' forwards coach Graham Rowntree said. 'They've both promised me their baby will be delivered in the next couple of days! Hopefully that will be sorted for the weekend. 'He's in his car and on his way home, so good luck to them both. 'We'll deal with this day by day. We'll assess it on Thursday morning.' Attwood has been earmarked to start after Joe Launchbury was ruled out of the autumn appointments with New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia with a neck problem. Stuart Lancaster has remained positive despite the growing list of absentees and insists the squad is in good shape . Captain Chris Robshaw was all smiles at the session as he shares a joke with a team-mate . Robshaw has a steely look of determination on his face as the 28-year-old jumps to catch the ball . If the 27-year-old's fiancee Bridget gives birth in time, he will have the opportunity to make a third successive appearance against the All Blacks after winning two caps as a replacement on the June tour. 'We're very confident in Dave. The Tests against New Zealand in the summer gave him a taste of high-class rugby,' Rowntree said. 'He enjoyed it and he's gone back, got himself very fit and shed some weight. 'His game involvement has increased sufficiently and he's played exceptionally well in Bath's pack, so I'm more than happy with him.' England's depleted second-row stocks - Geoff Parling and Ed Slater are also missing for the entire autumn - has potentially given Kruis the opportunity to shine. Forwards coach Rowntree gives instructions to the players during Tuesday's training session . Rowntree is confident Kruis is ready to win his first cap against the all-conquering world champions and views England's front-five injury crisis as an opportunity. 'George has been outstanding. We've been watching him for some time but he's come in and exceeded my expectations,' Rowntree said. 'I was a big fan to start with, but I can't praise him enough, how he's got up to speed with things. 'He's actually leading things in terms of the line-out area. 'He's exceptionally confident and fit, he's one of the last forwards to finish the endurance tests. Saracens back row Billy Vunipola releases the ball as he offloads to a team-mate during training . Uncapped Graham Kitchener bursts through with the ball as England team-mates try to force him back using pads . Attwood (pictured) left the camp on Tuesday to attend the birth of his first child, with England hopeful he will return before Saturday . 'We have some big names missing. We have virtually a pack of British and Irish Lions who will be sat at home on Saturday. 'But I've been here before and I've seen guys take their chances. 'What better time to do that than against the All Blacks at Twickenham? 'What a great opportunity for these guys to come in and give us more questions and selection headaches. I want these headaches and guys putting their hands up. This is another opportunity for that to happen.'","England face New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday in the first of four Autumn internationals this month .

"Jasmine Billington, 8, pictured with her 'twin' Simon - who was born in May last year . These are the amazing twins who were born EIGHT years apart. Jasmine and Simon Billington were conceived at the same time with sperm that was frozen but Jasmine was born in May 2005 and her ‘twin’ brother was born in May last year. As she cuddled her newborn brother in the hospital, Jasmine told her parents that she had waited such a long time for his arrival. Mother Lisa Billington, 48, a nurse, said: ‘They are theoretically twins because they were conceived at the same time - even though I gave birth to them eight years apart. ‘They were identical as newborn babies - both of them had a full head of black hair -  but when people look at them now, they can’t believe that they were conceived at the same time, as Jasmine is eight years older than her brother. ‘When he arrived, she was so thrilled. She cuddled him and told my husband and I that she was so excited as she had waited so long for him to arrive. When they are older we will tell them of their remarkable start in life.’ Mrs Billington and her husband Nigel, 50, also a nurse, who live in Sandbach, Cheshire, decided they wanted to start trying for a family in 1997, two years after they had met. Mr Billington had an operation to reverse a vasectomy operation that he’d had previously, but it wasn’t successful. In 2002 they decided to go and live in Australia for a year, and when they returned home they made an appointment with CARE fertility in Manchester. Mrs Billington said: ‘We really wanted a family and we were disappointed when the vasectomy reversal didn’t work. I’d tried other methods too - like drinking soya milk and making sure my waist didn’t go beyond 30 inches. 'I tried to have my body in as good a shape as possible to fall pregnant, but nothing was working. I thought I would never be a mum.’ In 2004, they underwent IVF treatment and 24 embryos were produced from that treatment cycle. Mrs Billington said: ‘The doctor was surprised about how many good quality eggs and then embryos we had, as my age was against me. We’d been told there was only about a 14 per cent chance of the treatment working because of how old I was. ‘So we were optimistic about the treatment.’ Lisa Billington with her two children. The mother and her husband Nigel tried IVF in 2004 after several years of trying to conceive naturally . The doctors put two embryos back into her womb and froze the remaining ones. Mrs Billington discovered she was pregnant two weeks later. She said: ‘We were thrilled when I discovered I was pregnant, but we tried not to get our hopes up as I knew there was a possibility I may miscarry because of my age.’ Mrs Billington had to have an emergency caesarean when she was 33 weeks pregnant as her waters broke and she developed an infection. She said: ‘It was frightening, but luckily the baby was healthy. I couldn’t believe it, that after all this time, I was a mum at last. It was such an emotional moment when she was born.’ The couple decided to wait several years before trying for a brother or sister for Jasmine. Mrs Billington said: ‘I wanted to enjoy being a mum to Jasmine for a while, and there is 11 years between my sister and I, so I wasn’t in any hurry.’ In 2012 the couple returned to CARE fertility for a second course of IVF treatment. She said: ‘We took Jasmine with us and the doctor was delighted to see her. They did warn us that we didn’t have a high chance of the treatment working. The thawing process combined with my age, as I was 47 by then, were all factors that would go against us. But we just had to hope that we would be as lucky as last time.’ The family pictured together at their home in Cheshire. Mrs Billington had 22 embryos frozen when she fell pregnant with Jasmine - two of which were used when the couple tried for their second child . Mrs Billington’s remaining embryos were taken out the freezer, where they had been stored for the last seven years. Only five survived the thawing process and only two were deemed good enough quality to put back into her womb. Frozen embryos are usually stored for a standard of 10 years, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority which monitors UK fertility clinics. But parents wanting to freeze eggs, sperm or embryos must sign consent forms before the process begins setting out how long they want them to be stored for and who is allowed to access them. She said: ‘We only had one remaining chance with our embryos, so we had to keep our fingers crossed and hope for a miracle.’ Amazingly she discovered she was pregnant two weeks later. The pregnancy went smoothly until 33 weeks when she started bleeding. She had an emergency caesarean four weeks later and Simon arrived into the world at Leighton Hospital in Crewe weighing 6Ib6  - exactly the same weight as a his ‘twin‘ sister eight years before. Mrs Billington said: ‘We were so surprised that they had been exactly the same weight - and they both had a head of black hair. As babies, they looked like two peas in a pod.’ Simon suffered from pneumonia when he was born and he had to stay on a ventilator in hospital for two weeks. But after his recovery he was allowed home. Mrs Billington added: ‘Jasmine’s hair has turned fair now, and people are amazed when we tell them they were born exactly eight years and 16 days apart. She’s so good with her little brother - but then as she keeps reminding us, she’s waited long enough to meet him.’","Jasmine Billington born in May 2005 and her 'twin' Simon eight years later .

"A high school Spanish teacher has had her sexy secret revealed - she once posed naked for Playboy. Cristy Nicole Deweese, 21, featured in the magazine three years ago when she was just 18 as 'Coed of the Month'. Miss Deweese, who teaches Spanish at Townview Magnet High School in Dallas, Texas, has caused outrage among parents this week over her raunchy past. Scroll down for video . Cristy Nicole Deweese (pictured left) is now a Spanish teacher in Dallas, Texas. When she was 18, she posed as 'Coed of the month' for Playboy . Miss Deweese's sexy shots are available for all to see online - including the teenage boys she currently teaches. Among her pictures are full-frontal naked shots, photos of her wearing 'winter bunny gear' and lingerie, a simulated lesbian sex scene and a 'Naked Outdoors' gallery. In a behind-the-scenes video clip from the photoshoot, when asked about her hobbies, the teenager says: 'Hunting, shooting... I shot me a buck last year.' She adds that she is majoring in Spanish and 'going to be a Spanish teacher'. One parent, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Dallas Morning News, that although her Playboy past should not prevent Miss Deweese from being a teacher, it did affect the way she is viewed by some students. Model behavior: Miss Deweese relaxes and eats beef jerky in between modeling for Playboy's 'coed of the month' in 2011 . Another added: 'Are her male 16- and 17-year-old students looking at her without picturing her nude?

"A minke whale has washed up on a Scarborough beach after it got tangled up in lobster pot ropes. Unusually, two minke whales washed up on shores at opposite ends of the country this week. Another one was found on Thurso beach, Caithness, northern Scotland, after it drowned when caught in ropes. Scroll down for video . Washed up: A dead minke whale was found on Scarborough beach with some lacerations to its tale . Dead: t is thought that the whale became tangled in lobster pots off the Yorkshire coast . The minke whale caused a stir among people in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, whose interest in the mammal caused them to be cut off by the raising tide. Sea life experts believe the whale had already died in the sea before being deposited onto sands of South Bay in Scarborough yesterday. A post-mortem carried out at the scene confirmed that the eight metre animal had drowned after being tangled in a lobster pot. Todd German, an aquarist from Scarborough Sea Life Centre, said he was alarmed by the behaviour of the people on the beach who climbed on top of the whale or became distracted and cut off by the rising tide. He said: 'They really do carry a lot of diseases which you can catch just from touching them. But even though it was a big, smelly, rotting whale people were quite happy to go up and touch it. 'Yesterday we even had people climbing up on top of the whale and riding it. You wouldn’t do that to a dead cat or dog. 'The coast guard got called out several times to people who were going to look at the whale and got cut-off. 'We want to encourage people to see whales up close when they can – it’s beautiful to see such a large animal which you only normally get a fleeting glimpse of. But we would just like to remind people to use their heads.' Unusual: Minke whales are solitary creatures, but can be curious and investigate boats . Spectacle: Onlookers snapped pictures after the beached washed ashore . Scarborough: The whale underwent a postmortem to ascertain what had happened to it . The giant mammal was removed for . incineration by a team involving the sea life centre, Scarborough . Borough Council and the RSPCA. It was first spotted by the crew of a boat floating in the sea near North Bay on Wednesday night. It underwent an autopsy conducted by the Zoological Society of London. Lindsey . Crawford from Sea Life Scarborough told Yorkshire Coast Radio: ‘With an . animal that large, you can't just take it off the beach ... The main . reason we wanted to go down was to see if there were any obvious wounds . of why it's died. ‘Body condition was quite healthy, . it's quite a nice looking animal, the only thing was a few lacerations . around the tail area, possibly made by ropes or netting. ‘People . would be very surprised at what is actually on their doorsteps. We have . some beautiful animals in our sea and Minke Whales are one of them.’ The Scottish whale is believed to be the first to be washed ashore on Thurso beach in Caithness, in several decades . A post-mortem by the Scottish Agricultural College revealed she had drowned at sea three to four days prior to washing up on the shore . The Scottish whale is believed to be the first to be washed ashore on Thurso beach in Caithness, in several decades. Senior SSPCA Inspector Audrey Gunn said: ‘I was called to a whale stranding on Tuesday evening at Thurso Beach. ‘Unfortunately, it was already dead before I arrived and had been dead for a wee while. ‘It was a minke whale measuring 7.5 meters. ‘A post-mortem by the Scottish Agricultural College revealed she had drowned at sea three to four days prior to washing up on the shore. ‘We believe she may have become caught up in rope as there was damage to her mouth and marks consistent with this. This was a very sad end for such a beautiful creature.’ Highland Council warned members of the public to stay away from the whale for health reasons, before taking it to a landfill site yesterday morning.","Minke whale found on South Bay beach, Scarborough, Yorkshire .

"The registered sex offender accused of abducting an 8-year-old from a Florida Walmart and then murdering her was denied bail on Sunday - as the mother of one of his previous victims said 'I wish he was dead'. Donald James Smith, of Jacksonville, was charged Saturday with murder and kidnapping in the death of Cherish Perrywinkle. Authorities said Smith befriended the girl and her mother while they shopped at a dollar store Friday night. Denied: Donald James Smith makes a court appearance Sunday, June 23, 2013, at the Duval County Jail in Jacksonville, Florida . Smith took them to a Wal-Mart, where he offered to buy them clothes and hamburgers, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. Instead of buying the snacks, Smith walked out of the store with the girl, the sheriff’s office said. The girl’s mother called 911 when she noticed they were missing. A tip led investigators to the girl’s body in the woods near a church Saturday morning. Police arrested Smith after stopping his van on Interstate 95. Authorities have not said how Cherish died. Smith’s next court appearance is scheduled July 16. Smith has been a registered sex offender since a 1993 conviction in Duval County for attempted kidnapping and selling obscene materials. He has been arrested several times since then, most recently in 2009 on a charge of child abuse after making obscene phone calls to a 10-year-old girl, making verbal threats, and impersonating a social worker with the Florida Department of Children and Families who claimed to be investigating the girl’s family. The body of Cherish Perrywinkle was found in front of Highlands Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida on Saturday morning after a frantic search . Mother Stephanie Thornton, whose daughter Christina was terrorized by Smith at the age of nine old told Action News Jax, 'I wish he was dead'. In 2009 Smith was accused of posing as a Department of Children and Families employee in order to get close to Thornton's daughter, Christina. 'He's sick they need to electrocute him. Three weeks after you get out of jail you've done it again and killed a child,' said Thornton. 'It's hard knowing it could've happened to my daughter and that these parents have to go through this with their 8 year-old daughter,' said Thornton. The body of Cherish Perrywinkle was found in front of Highlands Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida on Saturday morning after a frantic search.

Donald Smith has been arrested and charged with the abduction and murder of 8-year-old Florida girl Cherish Perrywinkle . Authorities had put out an Amber Alert with details of Smith's van early Saturday, hours after receiving a 911 call from Cherish's mother about the missing girl. Prior to the alleged abduction Friday night, Smith, 56, befriended Cherish and her mother at a dollar store, and ‘offered to take them to Wal-Mart and buy her family some clothes,’ said Mike Williams, director of investigations at the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. ‘They appeared to be down on their luck and he could help them out.’ After spending a couple hours inside the Wal-Mart together, Smith offered to buy hamburgers and walked with Cherish to the front of the store, Williams said. Cherish's mom agreed to let her go with the man she had only just met whilst she . took care of her other two children and continued browsing the shelves. Instead of stopping to buy the snack, Smith walked Cherish outside and the two of them got into his van, Williams said. Kidnapped then murdered: 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle was taken from a Jacksonville WalMart store last night by a sex offender. Less than an hour after she had gone missing her body was found in a nearby church . Shopping trip: Cherish was with her mother and two siblings at this WalMart store in Jacksonville when Donald Smith befriended her and asked if she wanted to walk with him to McDonalds . Looking for a victim: Donald Smith, 56, had only been released from jail three weeks ago. He befriended the child's mother in a dollar store and was captured on CCTV leaving Walmart with the girl . The girl's mother called 911 when she realized Charish and Smith were missing. Less than an hour later, Cherish was dead. 'We located the body of Cherish . Perrywinkle,' Officer Shannon Hartley said holding back tears. 'It's a . very difficult time, obviously, for everyone involved.' 'Hug your children closely right now and know where they're at,' Officer Hartley said. 'Keep them close.' Detectives say that within 30 minutes of Cherish's mom realizing she had left the store with the man, police were called. An Amber Alert was issued and police searched the area with helicopters and ground units but did not find the suspect or the girl. A tip about a suspicious van spotted in the woods near a church led investigators to Cherish's body Saturday morning. Meanwhile, an officer working at the scene of a traffic crash on Interstate 95 on Saturday morning recognized Smith's van as it drove past her and called it in.

"England finished their autumn series in memorable fashion as a powerful forward effort, guided by excellent control from the half-backs, secured a deserved 26-17 win. Attention will now turn to England's Six Nations opener against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in February as Stuart Lancaster's side look to build on this impressive display. Here, Sportsmail looks at five things England learned from the match. BACK TO BASICS IS BEST FOR ENGLAND . After stuttering displays against New Zealand, South Africa and Samoa over the last few weeks, England produced their most fluid and organised performance of the autumn against Australia. The build-up to both of Ben Morgan’s tries summed up England’s ruthless approach at Twickenham. For Morgan’s first, England drove from the lineout with Brad Barritt running straight and hard to set up a strong platform at the ruck. Ben Youngs then released the onrushing Tom Wood who supplied the deftest of passes to Ben Morgan to barrel over. Morgan powered over from close range for England’s second after the pack demolished the Wallabies at scrum time. It’s worth remembering, however, that the set-piece came about from Mike Brown’s intelligent kick and Jonny May’s superb chase that forced Quade Cooper to carry the ball into his own in-goal area. Simple, efficient and direct rugby. That’s the way forward for England. Ben Morgan powers through the tackle of Michael Hooper (right) to score England's opening try . SKELTON CAN ADD STEEL TO WALLABIES PACK . The Wallabies pack had a torrid day at Twickenham, but Will Sketon’s cameo will have pleased Michael Cheika. Auckland-born Skelton tips the scales at 135kg and used England replacement lock George Kruis as a speed bump in the lead-up to his second-half try. The 22-year-old developed under the watchful eye of Cheika at the New South Wales Waratahs and featured for the Sydney franchise against the British and Irish Lions in 2013. Skelton exploded onto the international scene with a Man of the Match display on his Wallabies debut against France in June. The monster second row barrelled over French flanker Fulgence Ouedraogo to register his first try in that game before showing deft hands to release Israel Folau for another score to cap off a sensational debut. Skelton has played a more subtle role for the Wallabies on this tour, but there is no question that he is rising talent in the global game. Amazingly, Skelton is not the biggest member of his family. His 19-year-old brother Cameron is 10kgs heavier and has recently taken up a lucrative offer with the Waikato Chiefs in New Zealand. Wallabies lock Will Skelton crashes over England replacement lock George Kruis to score at Twickenham . STUART STRIKES BIG PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOW . Less than 10 months out from next year’s World Cup, Stuart Lancaster’s England side now have a serious mental edge over the wounded Wallabies. Australia are a fabulous side to watch with Israel Folau, Henry Speight, Adam Ashley-Cooper and Bernard Foley running riot at Twickenham, but Australia’s deficiencies up front were once again exposed. These two sides will look horns again in a crucial Pool A clash in London at next year’s World Cup. If the England pack can do this to Australia now. Imagine what they can do when they get Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs, Geoff Parling and Joe Launchbury back from injury. A shuddering thought for Cheika. The Wallabies coach has a serious repair job on his hands; both mentally and technically. The England scrum will cause Michael Cheika many sleepless nights in the coming months . ENGLAND BACKROW BITES BACK . England’s backrow triumvirate of Wood, captain Chris Robshaw and Morgan have come in for heavy criticism in recent weeks. The trio answered their critics with aplomb against the Wallabies. Wood showcased his superb aerial skills fielding several kick-offs while providing England with a superb option at the tail of the lineout. The Northampton flanker also showed up well in the loose. Robshaw was challenged by the England management during the week to have more of a presence at the breakdown and the Harlequins skipper delivered in spades. Robshaw made two crucial turnovers, contributed 14 tackles and outshone his opposite number Michael Hooper which is no mean feat. Morgan has surely cemented his place for the Six Nations opener against Wales next February after this powerful display. The Gloucester number eight provided the attacking ballast that England have craved in this series and made 13 tackles to boot. Northampton and England blindside Tom Wood feeds Ben Youngs after a clean take at lineout time . Robshaw (centre) celebrates victory with props David Wilson (left) and Kieran Brookes . LAWES IS A LEADING LIGHT . All Blacks lock Brodie Retallick has recently been named the world’s best player, but Courtney Lawes is not far behind him. Lawes was everywhere for England once again at Twickenham. The Northampton Saints player has a staggering workrate and has become one of his country’s most important players. Lawes demonstrated his athleticism with a crucial try-saving tackle on Ashley-Cooper early in the first half while he also showed incredible pace to chase down Folau after the break. Lawes left the field in the 54th minute a spent force having made 12 tackles in less than an hour. He simply had no more left to give. A world-class talent.

"From the daily threat of doodlebugs to rationing and the strain of being forced to watch loved ones go off to fight, World War Two was a perilous time for Britain. And yet, for one group, the war proved an opportunity. For British ballet, once a niche pursuit, the years of grinding conflict offered a chance to show their mettle and become entwined with the cultural fabric of the nation. And as David Bintley, the director of the Royal Birmingham Ballet, explains in a new BBC4 documentary, the war years proved to be 'the making of British ballet'. Early days: Ninette de Valois with a group of students, some of the first she taught, in 1928 . The driving force behind the scheme to turn what had once been a largely foreign art form into something quintessentially British was Ninette de Valois. A former dancer herself, de Valois had enjoyed a glittering career - complete with a stint at Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, then the world's best dance outfit. She was convinced that the artistic excellence she had been immersed in during her time at the Ballets Russes could be replicated in a British ballet company, and in 1931, she set up the Vic-Wells Company with the help of the formidable theatre impresario, Lilian Baylis. 'She was one of the few Englishwomen to . dance with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and when she was in Diaghilev's . company, she was surrounded by all these great dancers, teachers and of . course, artists,' explains the Royal Ballet School's Anna Meadmore. 'She could have stayed with the Ballets Russes much longer . than she did - she was only 28 when she left - and I think she left . when she did because it had filled her so much with the absolute . conviction that we had to create in this country a school and company . that could give rise to the sort of artistry she had seen at the Ballets . Russes.' Practice: The Sadler's Wells Company rehearsing Orpheus under the watchful eye of de Valois in 1943 . Genius: The Sadler's Wells Company's Robert Helpmann (left) and choreographer Frederick Ashton (right) Star: Principal dancer Margot Fonteyn photographed at the beginning of the war in 1939 . By the mid-1930s, de Valois had put together a roster of talent that included dancers Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpman, and choreographer Frederick Ashton, who would go on to create works of such excellence, they still influence ballet today. But it wasn't until war broke out in 1939 that de Valois' fledgling ballet company truly came into its own - transforming the art from a niche pursuit for the posh into an everyman pleasure in the process. 'I think for highbrow audiences, ballet . was well established,' adds Meadmore. 'But for the man in the street, it was still very . much peripheral, exotic, something they wouldn't consider going to . themselves. 'It was for the tiara set, not mass entertainment and certainly not . understood as being part of national culture at all.' When war broke out on 3rd September 1939, de Valois decided to send her company, by now renamed after the Sadler's Wells Theatre where they were based, on tour. 'Madam [de Valois] gathered us together and said we were going . on tour,' explains Julia Farron, a dancer at the company between 1936 and 1961. ' I think it was actually the making of the company because . we were doing at least seven performances a week unlike in London where . you did two. It was hard work but that's how you learn.' V&A ballet historian, Jane Pritchard, agrees. 'Everything . changed with the outbreak of war,' she explains. Beautiful: Robert Helpmann and Margot Fonteyn star in a 1939 production of Les Sylphides . Dangerous: As this photo of Old Compton Street in Soho reveals, London life was perilous during the Blitz . 'You'd wait for this shattering crash and . you'd usually swear, as much as one could swear in those days, and then . you'd rush back up to the dressing room and get on with your make-up' 'Obviously, the companies immediately . stopped performing but that was only for a brief period because it was . quickly realised that people needed entertainment more than ever during . wartime. 'Dance companies got going and remained active as much, if not . more, than other forms of entertainment throughout the War.' Despite the need for entertainment, many of the male dancers were conscripted, as was choreographer Ashton. Nevertheless, with their scores adapted for piano by the company's Director of Music, Constant Lambert, and their repertoire reworked to omit male dancers, the company went on the road, touring the length and breadth of Britain and creating new fans in the process. Later, the company returned to a new London home, the New Theatre, or, as it's known today, the Noel Coward Theatre. But as for those elsewhere, life for the Sadler's Wells dancers was perilous. 'We had watchers on the roof and there were three whistles,' explains Gillian Lynne, a former ballerina, remembers of her time dancing during the Blitz. 'If it was one whistle, it meant take care, the doodlebug's coming. Two meant danger, go to the shelter downstairs, and three meant ""get onto the stairs!"" and you'd wait for this shattering crash and you'd usually swear, as much as one can swear at that age, and then you'd rush back up to the dressing room and get on with your make-up.' Magical: Dancers Dame Beryl Grey and Phillip Chatfield during a rehearsal for Les Sylphides . 'There was a lot of gunfire,' adds fellow dancer Pauline Clayden. 'We could hear the guns going when they tried to shoot the bombers down. That made quite a racket.' Despite the best efforts of the Luftwaffe, the company continued to dance - and tour - right up until the end of the war. Thanks to their work, ballet was no longer seen as a pursuit purely for the tiara brigade and with the help of economist, John Maynard Keynes, the dancers were about to get their reward. Keynes, then the chairman of the Council for Arts and Music, was, according to Meadmore 'determined to bring them into theatreland'. And so, on 20th February 1946, the Sadler's Wells Ballet company made their debut in their new home, the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. Triumph: George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princesses Margaret and Elizabeth watch Sleeping Beauty in 1946 . Home: The Sadler's Wells - now the Royal Ballet - has been based at the Royal Opera House since 1946 . The ballet was Sleeping Beauty and watching from the Royal Box was King George VI, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and the two princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. For the dancers themselves, it was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. 'It was terribly exciting, especially as the Royal Family were there as well,' reveals Clayden, . 'It [Covent Garden] was so huge,' adds fellow dancer, Julia Farron. 'We'd always been in some small theatre before that!' The show was a huge success and by 1956, Nina de Valois' little dance outfit had officially become the Royal Ballet, the UK's national ballet company. 'The War made people want to go and see that kind of thing, want to go and support it,' adds Gillian Lynne. 'I think the war did a great deal for ballet.'

"Threat: Unite union General Secretary Len McCluskey found to continue using 'leverage' tactics against employers . Union boss Len McCluskey defied Ed Miliband yesterday by vowing to continue with ‘bully-boy’ tactics against employers after one militant campaigner was caught on tape joking about being branded an ‘industrial terrorist’. Mr McCluskey, the leader of Unite, which is Labour’s biggest funder, vowed to continue with controversial protests at the homes of company executives, insisting they told ‘bad bosses that they have nowhere to hide’. He insisted that so-called ‘leverage’ tactics had been demonstrated to work, winning victories for his union in a series of disputes. Paddy Hill, a member of Unite’s campaign team, also defended his part in the bullying tactics employed during the Grangemouth dispute, following claims that bosses of the petrochemicals plant in Scotland were targeted by trade union activists for protests at their homes. In a recording of remarks made at meeting of a new union think tank, Mr Hill said: ‘I don’t see anything wrong with it, I won’t apologise for it, and I’ll do it again when I’m asked to do it. ‘I’m an organiser and this week an industrial terrorist, apparently.’ David Cameron has announced that the Government is considering tightening the law to prevent cases of industrial intimidation. The Prime Minister told MPs he was shocked by allegations that children of executives had had ‘wanted’ posters put through their letterboxes, while their neighbours had been told they were ‘evil’. Following the Daily Mail’s revelations about Unite’s activities, Mr Miliband also said: 'I condemn intimidatory tactics. It is not how industrial disputes should be conducted.’ But yesterday Mr McCluskey, whose union has given Labour more than £8 million under Mr Miliband’s leadership, vowed not to retreat in the face of what he said were ‘unscrupulous smears’ directed at his union. He told a Unite conference in Brighton: ‘Every day we read statements and press articles about Unite which do not come within hailing distance of the truth. ‘This shows one thing above all: Unite is making a difference. We have served notice on the establishment that fighting trade unionism is back - and the elite don't like it. ‘Of course, there is another agenda behind these attacks too. We are a proxy for smearing the Labour Party and Ed Miliband, since the same elite is now worried that a Labour government which may itself not play by the old rules is a possibility.’ Bullying: The Mail revealed how Unite thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant, pictured, in Scotland during strike action last month . The Unite general secretary challenged the Prime Minister to make recent remarks against the union, outside Parliament without the cover of parliamentary privilege. The protests which had been highlighted in recent weeks were ‘as old as democracy - free speech and the right to peacefully demonstrate’, he added. ‘For that, our members have been described as “thugs”. We will see what the law makes of that phrase. ‘It is, at any event, a lie. These protests were peaceful, mostly silent, and of course had nothing to do with intimidating families, children, or anyone. In more than two years, we have not had a single complaint about our members' conduct on such protests, nor a single police charge. ‘This union is not retreating from leverage, or from the right to peaceful protest. ‘The most important thing to say about Unite’s leverage strategy is this:  Leverage has worked.  Leverage has won… . ‘That is why it is now being attacked - because it is working. Leverage is about telling the bad bosses that they have nowhere to hide, challenging their conduct with shareholders, with clients and customers.’ Campaign of intimidation: Unite militants with their giant inflatable rat outside The Pig, one of Ratcliffe's business interests in the New Forest, during the bitter Grangemouth dispute . Raising the 'levels of hostility': The union activists protested at Lymington Town sailing club . Mr Hill, a Unite organiser in Middleborough and member of the ‘leverage’ team that ‘assisted’ with the Grangemouth dispute, shrugged off criticism of the union’s tactics by describing it as a ‘badge of honour’. Tactics employed included a reported 25 protestors blocking a family’s driveway with an inflatable giant rat. ‘By the Daily Mail printing that we’re all thugs we’re all terrorists, we’re all God knows what they said about us, it’s easy for me to brush off…me and my colleagues and comrades just thought “that’s a badge of honour pretty much”,’ Mr Hill was recorded saying. Conservative MP Priti Patel, a member of Downing Street’s policy board, said: ‘Nobody should have to live in fear of union bully boys demonstrating outside their family home – to hear them talking about it with such pride is chilling. ‘Ed Miliband refuses to condemn these “industrial terrorists” in case he upsets his union paymasters. If he is too weak to stand up to the unions his is too weak to stand up for hardworking people.’","Union groups personally target and humiliate executives of big firms .

Manchester United, who somewhat controversially allowed Pogba to leave on a free transfer in the summer of 2012, are interested in bringing the 21-year-old back to Old Trafford. Chelsea are also keen, while Barcelona have expressed their interest. Agent  Mino Raiola claims Paul Pogba will leave Juventus by the end of next season . France international Pogba opens the scoring for Juventus against Chievo on Sunday . But Pogba’s agent has warned that the midfielder will only be available for a fee in excess of £80million. 'If Paul leaves Juventus, it is for the absolute top. If it does not happen this year, it will be next year,' said Mino Raiola, who also looks after Mario Balotelli and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 'Paul is at the same level economically as the other big stars and has a similar reputation, so he could stay for another year. Pogba looks to the skies in celebration after firing his side into the lead in the Serie A game . The 21-year-old moved to Juventus in 2012 and has become one of the best young players in Europe . ‘But Paul is the only major star who is available at the end of the season. If you cannot take Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi or Zlatan Ibrahimovic, you can only go for Paul. 'If someone wants him, the market situation could see him go for more than €100m.' Pogba joined Juventus after Sir Alex Ferguson refused to match his wage demands three years ago. The France international opted to join Juventus instead of their Serie A rivals AC Milan. Raiola also claimed Inter Milan did not want to ‘create a row’ with the then United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Pogba signed for the Italian giants after leaving Manchester United on a free transfer . ‘Do you know why I told him to sign for Juventus? Milan wanted to sign him together with Genoa and then send him there on loan,’ Raiola told La Gazzetta dello Sport. ‘Inter then said they did not want to create a row with [ex-Manchester United boss] Alex Ferguson. ‘With Juventus the deal was quite simple. They signed him, gave him the wages of a first-team player and did not send him out on loan.’","Paul Pogba is being courted by a host of Europe's top clubs .

"Parents who want their children to go to one of the best state schools in England can face a bill of up to £500,000 to buy a home in the right area, a report reveals today. It shows how homes close to top secondary schools can be considerably more expensive than homes in other areas of the same county. The most extreme example is Beaconsfield High School in Buckinghamshire where the average house price is £797,000, compared to an average price of £314,000 in the rest of the county. Scroll down for video . Pictured: The biggest house price 'school premiums' in England. Beaconsfield High School  tops the list . This leaves a ‘school premium’ of £483,031, the largest one in England. The report, from the banking giant Lloyds, said the average premium is £21,000 to live close to a top school. Another example is Bishop Vesey’s Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. A home typically costs around £299,000, compared to £167,000 in the West Midlands. Researchers looked at the top 30 secondary state schools in England as well as the top ten performing secondary state schools in each region, based on last year’s [2013] GCSE data. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is under pressure to increase school places and standards . Competition for property around the highest-rated schools is most intense in the south-east, with house prices close to the top 10 state schools in the region being sold 27 per cent - or £72,314 - above the average house price in their county. Nearly all the top 30 state schools have selective entry requirements, typically taking in the top 25 per cent of children academically. But the research also found that it is possible to find good state schools in areas where house prices are not sky high. Heckmondwike grammar, in West Yorkshire, has results that place it among the top 30 state schools in the country, but house prices nearby average just £99,000. Barnet in north London also stands out as an area with some of the best state schools. But house prices are lower in the are than the average for the capital. Marc Page, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: ‘Although property values can be significantly lower in neighbouring areas, many parents don’t appear to be put off from paying a premium to ensure their child has the best possible chance to attend their chosen school.’ Many secondary schools have an ‘over-subscription’ criteria which means that those living closest to the school door will get priority if the number of successful applications exceeds the number of available places.

"A teenager has become one of the fastest British men of all time just seven months after taking up professional running . And he thinks he could run even faster at this year's Olympics - where he faces the prospect of lining up against reigning champion and world record holder Usain Bolt. College student Adam Gemili smashed the 100 metres World Junior Championships record as he won gold in Barcelona last night after just a few months of serious training. His time of 10.05sec makes him the fastest British junior of all time - even beating Dwain . Chambers' British junior record of 10.06sec in 1997 and the previous championship record set by Trinidadian Darrel Brown in 2002. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Golden boy: Adam Gemili from London ran the 100m in a remarkable 10.05second last night . Proof! Gemili stands next to his record breaking time and means he's one to watch at the Olympics . The Londoner, who is currently studying a BTEC diploma in sport at Barking and Dagenham College, only quit football last November to focus on running. Before that the teenager's sporting career seemed destined to be played out on the football pitch rather than the running track. The former Dartford Grammar School pupil -  who is of Moroccan and Iranian descent - was signed up by Chelsea when he was just eight years old and spent seven years with the European Champions before switching to his local club Dagenham and Redbridge. He spent part of last season on loan at nearby Blue Square Bet South side Thurrock, but was still training with Dagenham and Redbridge until the end of the year. Gemili said last year that football would always come first but now he is less sure. His remarkable win makes him one to watch at the London Olympics in two weeks time where he will compete in the 100 metres and the 4x100 metres relay. Talent: Adam only quit football in November last year to focus on running and he thinks he can run faster at the Olympics . Posting on Twitter this morning, Mr Gemili said: 'Literally the happiest guy in the world right now. Months of hard work have paid off and I'm now World Junior Champion!' Speaking about his surprise win yesterday, he said: 'This is a massive stepping stone. It will help me a lot. I never thought I'd be a junior world champion. 'I was nervous. A world . junior final in Barcelona, who's not going to be nervous? You've got to . try to use the nerves in a good way, try to put them towards my run - . and I did. 'I was trying to stay relaxed. I know if I tighten up I don't . run as quickly so I was trying to stay relaxed and focused and enjoy . the race'. The 18-year-old was 0.12secs . quicker than Aaron Ernest from the United States while Jamaica's Odean . Skeen came third in a time of 10.28. He also beat his previous best of 10.08, which he clocked in a low-key race in . Germany last month. The phenomenal run took place in the same Montjuic Stadium . where Linford Christie became the oldest man and last Briton to win 100m gold at the 1992 Olympics aged 32. Christophe Lemaitre is the only European athlete to beat his Gemili's time this . year, with the Frenchman running 10.04secs in Rome in May. Gemili hopes he can continue to improve and hinted he could run even faster in London. When asked if he thinks he can clock a sub-10sec time, he added: 'I . honestly do not know. I am feeling good and I am running well, I just . feel there is a whole lot more to come.' The 10-second barrier has . historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best . female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's world record is . 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt while American Florence . Griffith-Joyner holds the women's world record of 10.49 seconds.

"This is the horrific picture of a woman whose face blistered and swelled just days after using an anti-wrinkle cream. Marlene Corrall’s reaction to the cream was so severe she had to be prescribed steroids - and it took her six months for her skin to fully recover. Ms Corrall, from Barrow Upon Soar, Leicestershire, was horrified after she claims she had an extreme allergic reaction after using three L’Oreal Paris Revitalift Laser Renew anti-aging products on her face. Marlene Corrall, 66, claims she suffered a severe allergic reaction after using three L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Laser Renew anti-ageing products on her face. She claims it took her six months to recover - with the help of steroids . The 66-year-old said: 'When I went into my local chemist I . spotted the L’Oreal Revitalift range and decided to give it a try, but it . was the biggest mistake I ever made, after the reaction I had.' 'Within two days of using the creams, my face started to swell and break out in painful red blisters which spread all over my face. 'I was really frightened, especially as I have always taken great pride in my skin. 'I have been using anti-wrinkle creams since I was 35 and never had a problem. I have used a range of products on my skin and change brands every few months.' Ms Corrall claims she had to take steroids and was prescribed penicillin by her GP in an attempt to control the severe reaction her skin was having. The 66-year-old said: 'Within two days of using the creams my face started to swell and break out in painful red blisters which spread all over my face. I was really frightened, especially as I have always taken great pride in my skin' She was forced to take two weeks off work as a senior carer because her skin was so painful and it took six months for her skin to properly recover from the effects of the creams.

She added: 'I cannot believe companies still use this chemical after what it did to my skin. 'It was terrifying to have my skin react so severely and it knocked my confidence. It took so long to clear up that I have decided that life is too short, and after that happened I had enough - you never know what’s around the corner so life is for enjoying.

It has recently been blamed for a massive rise in dangerous allergic reactions. Cosmetic giant Johnson & Johnson said last month that it is so concerned, it is taking the chemical out of its best-selling Piz Buin sun cream and other products. Molton Brown is doing the same and big brands such as Nivea, L’Oreal, Clarins and Sanctuary are under pressure to take action as doctors say adverse reactions to the chemical have reached ‘epidemic proportions’. Skin experts say manufacturers should urgently remove the chemical, a preservative called methylisothiazolinone (MI), from products that are left on the skin. It can cause rashes, lumps, blisters, itchy eyes and facial swelling. Ms Corrall said: 'It was terrifying to have my skin react so severely and it knocked my confidence' In one case, a woman’s head and face swelled up so much that doctors feared she would have trouble breathing without urgent treatment. Graham Johnston, a consultant dermatologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, who treated Ms Corrall, said: 'We have been testing this type of chemical for years and it seems that companies have moved to using just one chemical, which is a preservative to increase shelf life and strengthening it. 'I’d like to see methylisothiazolinone banned or for the industry to go back to levels it was using a few years ago. “People are needing nastier drugs to cure the reaction. One patient had to have an anti-cancer drug and another an anti-rejection drug. 'They then have to make sure they avoid any product which contain the chemical.' A spokesperson from L’Oreal said: 'Consumer safety is always the highest priority for L’Oreal. The safety of all cosmetic products and their ingredients is governed by strict European laws. 'We’re sorry to hear Mrs Corrall was not happy with the response she received. We would be willing to cover costs of a dermatologist appointment for her so she can better understand her reaction.' Dr Chris Flower, a chartered biologist and toxicologist and director-general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, said: 'Consumer safety is the number one priority for the cosmetics industry . 'We have been made aware that a number of people have reacted to the preservative methylisothiazolinone (MI) in cosmetic products. 'Industry experts are working with dermatologists to try to understand why this has occurred to a preservative that has been approved for this use and to identify the best course of action in a timely manner.'

"With 23 per cent of British adults now classified as obese, it's no surprise that demand for gastric surgery is increasing. Indeed, over the last 10 years, surgeons have seen an astonishing 3000 per cent increase in Britons opting to go under the knife in a bid to lose weight. But as new Channel 5 documentary, When Gastric Bands Go Wrong, reveals, having the operation can sometimes cause more problems than it solves. Explosion: Samantha Haworth's gastric band caused her stomach to explode - with painful consequences . One woman for whom things went terribly wrong is 27-year-old Samantha Haworth who had a gastric band put in at the age of 22. Always fuller figured, after finishing university, she tipped the scales at an unhealthy 29st and was told she was at risk of an early death if she failed to lose weight. Horrified, she opted for an £8,000 gastric band and swiftly lost an impressive 15st. But a year after the band was put in, she began to suffer from crippling stomach pains which she describes as similar to a 'knife being twisted and moved around my stomach.' She was rushed to hospital and straight into the operating theatre, where surgeons made a horrifying discovery. Her gastric band had slipped, causing part of her stomach to die. But worse was to come. 'Fungus had started to grow on the gastric band which turned septic and caused my stomach to just explode,' she reveals. Consequences: Both Samantha and Rachel (right) know how dangerous gastric surgery can be . Debilitating: Rachel's surgery left her with a leaking bowel and explosive, uncontrollable diarrhoea . Gruesome: Rachel was left with a hole the size of a grapefruit after her gastric bypass went wrong . The damage was so severe, Samantha had to be placed in a medically induced coma for three days while so much of her stomach had to be cut away, she was left with one the size of a little finger. Five years after her gastric band was put in, Samantha is still struggling. Her reduced stomach can no longer absorb vitamin B12, leaving her permanently exhausted and unable to work. Another woman to regret taking the plunge is Rachel, a 40-year-old mother of one from Oxfordshire. Slim in her twenties, Rachel piled on the pounds after hitting 30 and by the age of 32, weighed an unhealthy 22st. She plumped for a gastric bypass, where most of the stomach is removed and the intestines rerouted. But although the surgery is trouble free for many, the stitches in Rachel's bowel ruptured and she was left battling intestinal failure. 'When I woke up, I had a grapefruit sized hole in my abdomen,' she remembers. And things would only get worse. A fresh round of operations aimed at fixing the problem weakened her intestines further, leaving her struggling with rectal failure which manifested itself as constant, uncontrollable, explosive diarrhoea. 'I'm 40 years old and I'm afraid to go outside in case I poo myself,' she said. 'It [surgery] was a complete disaster and I've been paying for it ever since.' When she does leave the house, it's with a 'diaper bag' containing a complete change of clothes, antibacterial wipes and fresh underwear. 'There have been a few times when I've literally binned all my clothes,' she adds. 'I've lost so much dignity and it's very, very degrading. 'The last eight years have been hell on earth. It's simple. Hell on earth.' When Gastric Bands Go Wrong airs on Wednesday 16th October on Channel 5 at 9pm .","27-year-old Samantha's stomach exploded after her band slipped .

"A copy of a 600-year-old map found in a second-hand book shop is the key to proving that the Chinese, not Christopher Columbus, were the first to discover the New World, a controversial British historian claims. The document is purportedly an 18th century copy of a 1418 map charted by Chinese Admiral Zheng He, which appears to show the New World in some detail. This purported evidence that a Chinese sailor mapped the Western Hemisphere more than seven decades before Columbus is just one of Earth-shattering claims that author Gavin Menzies makes in his new book ‘Who Discovered America?’ - out today, just in time for the Columbus Day holiday. ‘The traditional story of Columbus discovering the New World is absolute fantasy, it’s fairy tales,’ Mr Menzies told MailOnline. Mr Menzies believes that this portion of the map depicts the Chinese mapping of North and South America in 1418 - showing major rivers. Explorer: Chinese Admiral Zheng He is known to have sailed the to Europe and Africa with a massive fleet of ships. Historian Gavin Menzies says he also reached the New World . Among Menzies other claims are that the . first inhabitants of the Western hemisphere didn’t come over land from . the Bering Strait, but instead were Chinese sailors who first crossed . the Pacific Ocean 40,000 years ago. He also writes that DNA markers prove American Indians and other natives are the descendants of several waves of Asian settlers. Furthermore, . he says a majestic fleet of Chinese ships, commanded by Zheng He, . sailed around the continent of South America - 100 years before . Ferdinand Megellan supposedly became the first the undertake the task. Columbus features heavily in the book - insofar as Menzies has devoted the last 20 years to finding and laying out evidence that Columbus not only didn’t discover America - he was 40 millenia late. Mr Menzies believes that Columbus actually had a map of the world that was plotted by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He, who created the map when he sailed to the New World in 1421, more than seven decades before Columbus. Mr Menzies believes that this portion of the map depicts the Chinese mapping of North and South America in 1418 - showing major rivers. His book includes what Menzies says is a copy of that map. discovered by Beijing attorney Liu Gang in a second-hand bookshop that he says proves his theory. The document, he says, is an 18th century copy of Admiral Zheng He's 1417 map. Mr Menzies argues that it clearly shows North American rivers and coasts, as well as the continent of South America. Mr Menzie's assertion about Zheng He's voyage to the New World isn't new - he first wrote about it in 2002 - but the map is. Mr Liu had the map authenticated by . an appraiser from Christie's Auctions, who said that the document was . 'very old' and was not a newly-made fake. After Mr Liu brought the map forward, Menzies also had a team of historians analyze every word on it. He concluded that it was originally written in the Ming Dynasty - a Chinese period that lasted from 1368 to 1644. In the region of the map that Mr Menzies believes refers to Peru are written the inscriptions - 'Here the people practiced the religion of Paracas' and 'Here the people practice human sacrifice' - clear references peoples known to have inhabited Peru at the time. The map is further corroborated, Mr Menzies says, by the Chinese names of numerous towns and regions in Peru. He says old Peruvian maps show places with names like Chawan - Chinese for 'land prepared for sowing' and Chulin - 'wood or forest.' Ko-Lan - a remote Peruvian town at the bottom of a ravine translates to 'difficult passage.' Controversial: Gavin Menzies, 76, has been arguing for more than a decade that the Chinese and other Asians discovered the Ne World. 'Who Discovered America? - due out today - is his fourth book on the topic . Mr Menzies calls the story that Christopher Columbus' discovered America in 1492 a 'fairy tale' - saying he was not only not the first explorer - he was 40,000 years late . Mr Menzies has no formal training as a historian and no advanced degree from a major university - he was a submariner in the British Royal Navy - but he can no longer be called an ‘amateur.’ ‘Who Discovered America?’ is Menzie’s fourth book in which he tries to re-write history and orient it East. He has plowed millions of dollars of his proceeds from his books into continuing his world-traveling research into his theories. He has turned his north London home into a de facto research institute, employing up to six research assistants at a time. But his theories are not accepted by the mainstream academic community. In 2008, University of London history professor Felipe Fernandez-Armesto told the Daily Telegraph that his books are 'the historical equivalent of stories about Elvis Presley in (the supermarket) and close encounters with alien hamsters.' Even Wikipedia characterizes Menzies as a 'pseudo-historian.' That has not stopped him from gaining millions of readers - and thousands of followers who contribute to his website and contribute research of their own. Menzies say this map of the Ancash province of Peru shows numerous Chinese names of villages . Each of these dots represents a Peruvian town that reportedly has a Chinese name. It is claimed this is evidence of Chinese colonization before Columbus . Mr Menzies debuted his Asia-centric theories with 2002's '1421: The Year China Discovered the World.' In it, he said that the famed Chinese sailor Admiral Zheng He, who is known to have reached Europe and Africa, also crossed the Pacific Ocean to the Western Hemisphere. He claims that Zheng He not only reached the New World, he left colonies there. His fleet also sailed around the tip of South America - through the Strait of Megellan around the Gulf of Mexico and up the Mississippi. There is evidence, both archaeological and genetic, Menzies says, that Zheng He left his mark in California, Florida, Virginia and even the Outer Banks of North Carolina. In 'Who Discovered America?' Menzies focuses on theories that Asians also made it to North and South America by sea long before even Zheng He. 'It appears certain that man reached the Americas by sea at least forty thousands years ago,' Menzies writes. This Venetian map was made from information brought back from China by Marco Polo and Nicolo da Conti. Mr Menzies says it shows North and Central America - upside-down, oriented with north at the bottom . 'Doubtless this date will be continuously pushed back, probably to 100,000 BC, which was when the first peoples sailed the Mediterranean to Crete and (separately) in the south from Asia to Australia.' Most scientists believe man first widely populated the Western Hemisphere 13,000 to 16,500 years ago. The almost universally-held theory among academics is that man came to the New World by crossing the Bering Strait land-bridge between Asia and North America. 'The more I thought about the Bering Straight theory of populating the Americas, the more ridiculous it became,' Mr Menzies writes about his investigation of the topic . Mr Menzies says the idea that man was able to cross the Pacific Ocean around 40,000 BC isn't nearly as dramatic as it seems. 'If you just go out in a plastic bath tub, the currents will just carry you there,' he told MailOnline. 'They just came with the current, it’s as simple as that.' He added: 'There’s nothing terribly remarkable about. Man has been seafaring for vastly longer than convention credit has given them credit for.'","Gavin Menzies, a British historian, claims Chiense Admiral Zheng He set up colonies and sailed round South America before Columbus .

"A British witch doctor who became one of the most prolific conwomen in history may have pocketed a staggering £5m during her 12-year scam, it emerged today. Juliette D’Souza, 59, was jailed for 10 years at London’s Blackfriars Crown Court last Friday after she persuaded vulnerable 'patients' to hand over their . life savings - insisting the money would be hung from a sacred tree in the . Amazon as a sacrifice. Initially she was believed to have made around £1million from the con, which she used to pay for first class flights, antique furniture and a £3,000 Hermes handbag. But a senior police officer in charge of the investigation said the victims involved in the court case were 'just a fraction' of the elaborate scheme. Conwoman: A senior police officer has said Juliette D'Souza (pictured left when she was younger) may have pocketed £5million during her elaborate scam. The 59 year old was jailed for 10 years last Friday (right) Detective Constable Fiona Graham, from . the Metropolitan Police, said: 'That’s £1m from a handful of people, but . she’s been doing it for decades. I can easily believe it’s more than . £5m.' D’Souza, of Hampstead, was jailed for 23 counts of fraud and deception spanning from 1998 to 2010. The self-proclaimed healer told potential victims she had . helped cure John Cleese’s daughter of cancer, boasted of knowing . Princess Diana and claimed she could introduce a young . singer to Simon Cowell. Advertising her services . in Tatler magazine, she charged just £35 for a consultation but then . demanded huge sums to be used as the 'sacrifices' in Suriname, South America. The witch doctor of Hampstead: The 59-year-old (pictured leaving Blackfriars Crown Court after a hearing) spent the money on luxury goods she never used . There she claimed two other shamans would perform . rituals around the money before it was sent back with all the victims' problems resolved - but the money was never returned. Police fear the bogus shaman healer may . have used links to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead and a Camden . Council care home to target dozens more vulnerable victims. The hospital has confirmed that a staff member, who still works at the hospital, faced disciplinary action after directing a patient to D’Souza in July 2012. It allegedly led to a seriously ill Hampstead man being told he would 'die on the operating table' by D’Souza if he did not hand over more than £10,000. Ms Graham added: 'If a nurse at the Royal Free recommended D’Souza to one victim, knowing what I know, they must have genuinely believed in her. 'There could be a whole other group of victims.' D’Souza has also been investigated for two other high value fraud schemes. One involved allegedly cheating Filipino immigrants seeking UK visas which may have earned her another £1m. She has also been connected to a police probe linked to the Branch Hill care home, where her parents lived. Ms Graham, of the Met Police, admitted police were wrong to dismiss the case in 2007, when many of D’Souza’s victims first visited Holborn Police Station. The senior officer, who along with Detective Constable Linda Kernot was highly praised by the trial judge, said: 'It was the wrong decision - and the judge confirmed it was the wrong decision. 'However, I can understand why that decision was made.' Ms Graham said there was a lot of evidence of more victims, including one who allegedly gave D’Souza £600,000, but did not want to take part in the court case. 'I believe she’s been defrauding people for decades,' she said. 'I believe it’s a natural thing for her to do and that she won’t even be able to stop herself in prison. 'There are many more victims out there and we’re actively encouraging any further victims to come forward.' Judge Ian Karsten, QC, branded D’Souza the worst confidence trickster he 'had ever heard of'. He said she not only 'ruined' victims financially, she 'dominated' them and 'wrought havoc' on their lives. Victims: Hampstead osteopath Keith Bender, left, referred clients to D'Souza in the belief she could help. Opera singer Silvia Eaves handed over £256,000 for help with stomach problems and to invest in a clinic in Peru . As he . jailed her, he said: 'It is the worst case of confidence fraud that I have ever . had to deal with or indeed that I have ever heard of. 'The . most serious aspect of this case is that you wrecked the lives of a . number of your victims and you have done it out of pure greed.' Following . a five-week trial the jury took only an hour to convict the serial . conwoman of all 23 charges of fraud and obtaining property by deception. Judge . Karsten said D’Souza had ripped off her victims by making strange . claims of cash 'sacrifices' hanging from a sacred tree in the Amazon . jungle in Suriname. She . funded a luxury lifestyle by extracting huge sums from desperate people, . some with terminal illnesses or cancer-stricken relatives. Her victims were so much under her . spell during the 12-year scam that one woman, who cannot be named, had . an abortion because D’Souza told her to. And another, Ruth Fillingham, even sold her home after being told that it was 'spooked'. Judge Karsten also condemned D’Souza for trying to pin the fraud on her osteopath friend Keith Bender. And, . by failing to plead guilty, she forced her terrified victims to give . evidence to the court and 'relive the extremely unpleasant experiences' while lacking the courage to go into the witness box herself. Voodoo dolls: D'Souza's con was exposed when Mr Bender and property manager Keith Mcmahon grew suspicious and broke into her four flats at Willoughby Road in Hampstead, north London . The . judge said there were undoubtedly further victims, including one 'who . is no longer alive' - a reference to the aborted child. 'You were able to exercise considerable influence, indeed a spell over these victims,' said Judge Karsten. 'They . did exactly what you required them to do. They were terrified, in many . cases, of the consequences of disobeying your instructions. 'They . lost all their autonomy and they became entirely dependent on you. You . saw to it that they were cut off from their own friends and family. 'You managed to dominate these individuals and make them bow to your will.' D’Souza’s . web was finally untangled in 2007 as she made a series of mistakes . which aroused her victims’ suspicions. She claimed to have attended St . Hilliard’s College, Oxford, which does not exist and got the name of . Princess Diana’s sister wrong. Far from having a university education, she was a former . cleaner, receptionist and temp. The . woman who had an abortion realised she had been scammed and went to . Hampstead police station in north London, but said officers ‘laughed in . my face’. This left her . so angry she forced her way into D’Souza’s home with the help of Mr . Bender, who was paying the rent on that property, and three others. Inside they found bags of shopping, an abandoned monkey and a voodoo treasure trove – which included . drawings of an ‘evil eye’, burned photos and a brand new barrister’s . wig. D’Souza would give her 'customers' detailed instructions about how the money was to be paid - always in . cash and in a brown envelope. Part of her system was to demand a full-length photograph from each victim. Pet: Mr Bender had been visiting one flat to feed D'Souza's pet monkey, Joey, but did not dare enter the remaining flats for fear they were cursed. The monkey was later adopted by the TV comic Stephen Fry . One . victim - who was told to pay £18,000 or her partner would die - said: . 'I was absolutely terrified. I was living in fear and doing what I was . told.' Another was 82-year-old former opera singer Sylvia Eaves, who was duped out of more than £350,000 by D’Souza between 1998 and 2010. The widow, whom the judge described as a 'delightful lady', handed over the money for various reasons including help with a stomach problem and to 'save' her ill sister. 'I’m relieved that she won’t be doing it to anybody else,' Mrs Eaves said at her sentencing. 'I feel terribly sad that somebody who is so clever would resort to that, especially as she was a friend of mine. I feel terribly let down that she could behave like that. 'She relieved me of a lot of money but I’m still here. I was gullible, I suppose, but my sister was very ill at the time.' A mother of a ten-year-old boy with . Down’s Syndrome who was also conned out of £42,000 when D’Souza claimed . she could cure his behavioural problems. Other victims included retired solicitor Richard Collier-Wright, who paid £7,000 to cure his terminal leukaemia, while former photographer Jocelyn Bain-Hogg, who handed D’Souza thousands to improve the health of his mother who was having heart surgery. A couple, who cannot be named, gave tens of thousands to the fraudster after she claimed she could help with their child’s disability and behavioural problems. Another victim, Geoffrey Wheeler, handed over around £160,000 to 'protect' him from being made redundant but was left in financial ruin. Her barrister, Stephen Fidler, told the court D’Souza’s elderly mother had been unwell for a considerable time and she visits her every day. But the judge told her: 'I find no mitigating factors in your case at all.'

"The man who set himself alight on Washington's National Mall last week has been identified. He has been named as John Constantino, 64, from Mount Laurel, New Jersey, police said today. According to witnesses, Mr Constantino gave the Capitol building a crisp military salute, before igniting the fuel he had doused himself in and then setting the blaze using a lighter just before 4.30pm. Scroll down for video . The man who set himself on fire on Friday in downtown DC has been identified as John Constantino, 64, from Laurel, New Jersey . Important place: The incident occurred in full view of the U.S. Capitol as tourists looked on in horror . Shutdown: The Capitol is on high alert in spite of the federal shutdown after  a woman slammed her car into one of the barricades following a high-speed chase . The horrifying moment was captured on camera by tourist Javier Soto who continued to take pictures as the flames engulfed the man. ‘I didn’t know what to do in that moment,’ Mr Soto, 39, said. The . entire sequence of events lasted about a minute as other people arrived . and used their clothing to try and smother the flames. Police said he had been conscious and breathing when he was airlifted to MedStar Washington Hospital Center. He was taken to hospital in a semi-conscious state with burns covering most of his body. He later died. Trouble in Washington: The man who set himself on fire on the National Mall last Friday has now been identified as a 64-year-old from New Jersey . Possible . motives for the self-immolation are being investigated, but Lieutenant . Pamela Smith said she was unaware that he carried any signs or had . articulated a cause. Witness . Katy Scheflen said she saw a tripod up near the man but that she did . not hear him say anything intelligible before he set himself on fire. It was also unclear if the man was filming the incident. Some . reports say that two male bystanders initially tried to put the fire . out using their own shirts while others put the number of Good . Samaritans at closer to five or six people. 'I . didn't hear a word from him,' witness Adam Stifel told CNN. 'He had . already doused himself with gasoline, I saw his gas can.' Dangerous: The motivation behind the horrifying self-immolation remains a mystery . The incident took place near the Air and Space Museum and although his motive is not known the chosen location hints that it was a demonstration. The Mall is a national park, making it . one of the hundreds of such sites across the country that have been . closed as a result of the government shutdown. U.S. Park Police sources told MailOnline that the shutdown didn't play into the rescue. Response: Emergency crews were on the scene in minutes . Commotion: The fire incident came just one day after a woman was shot and killed by police after ramming her car into a White House barricade . 'There is no indication that the government shutdown impacted the way anyone responded to this. DC Fire/EMS had people on the scene in, literally, three minutes, and a helicopter transport was there minutes later,' the source told MailOnline. 'We are the lead agency in this investigation, but it will be awhile before we give out details to anyone.' The incident happened a day after a woman was killed by police after she rammed her car into a barricade leading to the White House.","John Constantino, 64, from Mount Laurel, New Jersey saluted Capitol, witnesses said before setting himself alight .

"A teenager has killed himself after he became the victim of a webcam blackmail plot. Daniel Perry, 17, from Dunfermline, Fife, took his own life after a Skype conversation with someone he believed to be a girl the same age as him. However, a gang then hijacked the chat and threatened to show the video to his family and friends, unless he paid them off. Child welfare charities have warned that they are getting dozens of calls every week from suicidal children as young as 11 caught in the same trap. Daniel Perry was targeted by online blackmailers who told him they would hand a video to police of his chat with who he thought was a girl of his own age . He was targeted by people who it is believed found his Skype address when he tweeted it . In the most extreme cases blackmailers even ask for naked pictures or . strip teases after threatening to post the lewd images or videos on . their school's Facebook site or Twitter feed, experts have said. In this case apprentice mechanic Daniel Perry was ordered to put cash in a specific account or he 'would be better off dead'. Within an hour of the threat and fearing for the repercussions he went to the Forth Road Bridge where he jumped to his death last month. A source close to the family said: 'Knowing him as I do, he has felt embarrassed, horrified and has thought he's let everybody down. The teenager was an apprentice mechanic in Dunfermline, Fife, where he lived . 'He was coming up for his 18th birthday so it's not as if we could have been checking what he was doing on his laptop.' She continued: 'However he wasn't doing anything wrong, just what anyone his age might do, but this scam is all about exploiting young people. 'Even if he came to me and said he needed money we'd have helped him but we knew nothing about any of it.' She added: 'He was not the type of person who let things get him down. He was a happy laddie, not depressed and the last type of person you would think would take their life. 'We're a very close family and I just wished he had come to me and said something. I would have gone on the computer and told them to P-off.' On the day of his death, Daniel had posted his Skype details on his Twitter account telling followers to 'skype me.' Shortly before killing himself, the youngster had asked the blackmailers via his laptop 'what can I do to stop you showing this to my family?' He was then told to pay funds into a named bank account or his life would not be worth living and he 'would be better off dead'. He replied 'bye.' Later that day he sent a text message to his Nan telling her he was on his way home but instead he ended his life. He was still alive when rescued by a lifeboat crew about an hour later but died a shortly afterwards. His mother said: 'When I feel strong enough I want to do something to stop this happening to other young people. I'll go to the high schools and tell them what can happen. Daniel died on July 15 after jumping from a bridge just an hour after receiving the threat from the blackmailers . 'If I can stop this from happening to other young people then I feel I'll have done something for him. She added: 'He was the type to laugh things off. I still can't believe this has happened and expect him to walk in the door any minute.' In a tribute from his family they said: 'You will be sorely missed ‘wee man' loved and missed by everyone.' Hannah Smith had allegedly suffered months of abuse from online trolls on the website Ask.fm . The news comes in the wake of the death of teenager Hannah Smith who was found hanged in her bedroom after allegedly suffering months of abuse from online trolls on the website Ask.fm. The 14-year-old, whose funeral is due to be held today, had allegedly been bullied on the website but it has also been reported she sent herself the majority of the abusive messages. Her father, Dave, said those claims had not been proved and even if they were true still meant that there were a small percentage of people who had written his daughter abusive messages and had not been named. Ask.fm was forced to defend its site and stated 'we do not condone bullying of any kind' after it was criticised for not doing enough to prevent abuse. The website yesterday said it will delay announcing the findings of a safety review as a mark of respect to the schoolgirl because it was planned on the same day as her funeral. The site engaged a team of lawyers to carry out an audit of its site and safety features following her death two weeks ago. It is alleged she died after suffering months of abuse from online trolls on the question-and-answer website where members can be anonymous. At Daniel's funeral, held at the Dunfermline Crematorium, £700 was raised for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the family thanked the Queensferry Units rapid response team paramedics for their help.","Daniel Perry, 17, was ordered to pay money after conversation was hijacked .

"Farce: 37stone Les Price had to reason with staff who allocated his two seats rows apart . Before he boarded the plane, 37stone Les Price had already been forced to pay for an extra ticket. The airline’s rules for passengers weighing more than 20stone required him to buy two seats  for himself. But when he got on board, insult was added to injury. For a dismayed Mr Price found his seats for the flight to Ireland were not even next to each other – they were either side of another traveller’s seat. And on his return journey the situation was even more farcical, with his allocated places two rows apart. Mr Price, 43, had booked his tickets in advance of the flight. But he said the unnamed airline’s employees did not seem to understand its policy on heavier passengers. ‘When I got to the airport I had to explain to all the staff why I had two tickets,’ he said yesterday. ‘They didn’t have a clue. When I finally got on the plane one was an aisle seat and the other was by the window – in a three-seat row. 'On the way back from Ireland one seat was in row 17 and the other in row 19.’ Mr Price, of Brynithel near Newport, South Wales, said the incident was one of many everyday difficulties he has faced since he began struggling with his weight. The unemployed widower, who sleeps on the ground floor because he cannot manage stairs, said: ‘From the age of about ten I put on around a stone each year it seemed. ‘But I was the same as everyone else, working, playing rugby, training, so I wasn’t inactive. I’d work 70 or 80 hours a week and play rugby on a Saturday. I wasn’t a layabout.’ Mr Price then injured his back in an accident. He added: ‘I lost my mobility, developed sciatica and I didn’t get out of the house for three months. ‘Even if the boys took me out they would pick me up and drop me off  and when I was at the pub they’d go to the bar and get my drinks for me.’ Mr Price, 43, pictured at his home in Blaenau Gwent, south Wales, was coming home from Ireland . He was forced to book two seats on the flight as the airline does not cater for obesity but charges extra instead . When his wife Zeruiah died from cancer in 2009 he admits he turned to comfort eating. ‘I fell into a depression,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t be bothered to cook, would eat takeaways and want to treat my step-daughter Charlie because her mother had died. ‘When I was working, I had to get the calories in. I’d be up at 5am and have a cooked breakfast later. I also worked for a bakery, which involved physically hard lifting, moving things around.’ Earlier this year a travel expert advocated a ‘pay-what-you-weigh’ airline pricing scheme because heavier people cost more in fuel to fly. Passengers weighing above a certain threshold would pay more for their plane tickets and lighter ones would be charged less under plans put forward by Norwegian scientist Dr Bharat Bhatta. Writing in the Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management, Dr Bhatta said weight and space should be taken into account when airlines price their tickets. Mr Price said he is cutting down on his calories and attending an NHS weight management clinic. He said: ‘I want to be out there working. 'I feel guilty my partner is out there working all she can. Christmas is coming up and I feel awful I can’t do anything to help. 'I know a lot of people work the benefits system – but I want to be out there, not stuck at home.’","Les Price, 43, needed to pay for extra space because he is over 20stone .

"A Sergeant and a Corporal have been given lengthy military jail sentences after a soldier died when he was shot in the neck during a training exercise. Corporal Colin Bell and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price have also been thrown out of the army following Fusilier James Wilkinson's death in Kenya. A judge today ruled that the death of the serviceman from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers had been 'wholly and utterly avoidable'. Fusilier James Wilkinson, pictured with his new wife, was killed when he was shot in the neck during a training exercise . Fsl Wilkinson, pictured with his step-son, had only recently been stationed in Germany when he was shot . When he died, Fsl Wilkinson, 21, and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops. Bell had taken the barrel of a machine gun that had become jammed and while inspecting the weapon it fired, hitting Fsl Wilkinson in the neck. The court heard that Bell, 29, and Price had failed to follow procedure by failing to call an armourer to fix the weapon. He removed the barrel as it pointed directly at Fsl Wilkinson when he was just a few feet away when the weapon went off, hitting the father-to-be who was described as having 'long term potential'. Mrs Wilkinson told the court: 'I felt that James had been my fairytale ending but all the hopes and dreams we shared can now never happen' Price, of the . Adjutant General's Corp, attached to the Scots Dragoon Guards, was a . safety supervisor on the Ex Askari Thunder exercise. He failed to intervene and was found guilty of negligently performing a duty. Bell pleaded guilty to the same charge at an earlier hearing. Judge Advocate Michael today sentenced Price for 14 months and Bell for 21 months in military detention. Judge Elsom said: 'The tragic death  of this young soldier should never have happened, and only happened because you two failed to carry out your duties properly. 'Nothing can ever bring that young . husband, father and son back to life, nor can this court do anything to . lessen the impact of loss on his family. 'Both of you will live for the rest of . your lives knowing that what you did on that fateful day led to the . wholly and utterly avoidable death of a young soldier. 'You have both served a long time in the army and know the dangers of potentially unsafe conditions. 'Safety supervisors have primacy on ranges and should not defer to anyone, regardless of rank. 'We have found you equally culpable in . what occurred. Each of you have substantial experience as soldiers and . held the rank of non-commissioned officers. 'You, Price, could have prevented what . happened if you carried out your duties properly. Each of you . demonstrated a high degree of negligence which resulted in tragic . consequences.' At the time of his death, Fsl Wilkinson's widow, Sarah, was pregnant with their first daughter and they had only got married five months earlier. She welcomed the sentence and today said: 'This is the best possible outcome we could have got, that James could have got. Corporal Colin Bell and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price have also been thrown out of the army following Fusilier Wilkinson's (pictured) death in Kenya . 'To hear that the judge and panel really took it seriously, when they could have written it off as a mistake, felt really good.' Fsl Wilkinson joined the Army in February 2010 and was trained at Catterick, North Yorkshire, before being stationed in Germany where he lived with his new wife for just three days. Mrs Wilkinson, who has a son called Connor who doted on Fsl Wilkinson, told the court: 'I felt that James had been my fairytale ending but all the hopes and dreams we shared can now never happen. 'James had often talked about seeing our unborn daughter take her first steps on the beach in Cyprus. 'I deeply regret that our daughter never got to meet her wonderful father and he has missed seeing her first steps and hearing her first words. 'The moment my daughter first wrapped her fingers around my finger it was heartbreaking knowing he will never get to do that. 'I do not get excited about anything and feel my life was taken away from me the day he died.' Fusilier Wilkinson's parents Jan and Rob Wilkinson say they 'cannot accept' their firstborn son's death on exercise. Mrs Wilkinson said: 'Since he died all the days have blurred into one. I cannot differentiate one from the other - grief has overtaken us all. When he died, Fsl Wilkinson, 21, and a fellow serviceman were manning a general purpose machine gun for more than 100 troops . 'We still cannot believe the ranks and responsibilities of the senior soldiers involved: a Staff Sergeant and a Corporal, not junior and inexperienced troops. 'I appreciate that a lot of work has gone into bringing these two men to justice but whatever sentence they receive will never be enough. 'I cannot accept how James died. If he had died in operations I could understand. The exercise should have been stopped three times but no one took the trouble to stop it.' Mark Ashley, mitigating for Bell, said the married father-of-two was 'deeply sorry' for his 'mistake', but he had acted to allow the exercise to carry on. Bell, who served for 11 years, placed the machine gun on his knee, pointing at a bank of earth, to deal with the fault but it slipped off his knee, Mr Ashley said. He was sentenced to 14 months in a military detention centre. Price, who served for 25 years, was due to be promoted to Sergeant Major later this year. he was sentenced to 21 months. He failed to stop the gun being moved and the original drill, Andrew Jackson said in mitigation. Sarah Wilkinson met James at a party in March 2010. Their daughter Annabel was born in February last year.","Cpl Colin Bell and Sgt Patrick Price have both been kicked out of the Army .

"How do you forget to be a chimp? Well one ape at Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire seemed to have completely forgotten her animal ancestry after she was raised by humans. Choppers, a 42-year-old ape, became one of the stars of the PG Tipps tea adverts in the 1970s. Scroll down for video . Choppers, the last surviving chimpanzee of the PG Tips television adverts is finally learning how to be an ape at Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire . Handler: One of the PG Tipps monkeys with handler Molly Badham . The 'family' were dressed up in human clothes and made to perform sketches which were dubbed to create everyday, human scenarios. In the series of adverts, the group would undertake furniture removals, DIY and even do housework all while enjoying a cup of tea. Famous actors and comedians of the day, including Peter Sellers, Bruce Forsyth, Kenneth Williams and Bob Monkhouse, did the voiceovers. But there could be hope yet for Choppers, the last surviving member of the Tipps clan, as she appeared to join a grooming circle in the chimpanzee circle at the zoo. PG Tips Chimp Choppers in one of the PG Tipps adverts that aired during the 1970s . Adverts: Choppers, a 42-year-old ape, became one of the stars of the PG Tipps tea adverts in the 1970s. She lived in a cage at the zoo with co-star Louis (pictured right in the advert) until he died at the age of 37 last July . The Express reports she has found interacting with other apes hard but this incident appears to be a breakthrough. The popular ads were loved by the public but the unnatural upbringing for the chimps changed their behaviour. Zoologist Desmond Morris said he noticed the animal's lack of natural instinct when he saw them out in London with their handler Molly Badham. The author of The Naked Ape said he did his best 'chimpanzee greeting' but the apes were baffled and shook his hand like a human. He told the paper: 'I thought it was hilarious and Molly thought it was funny too – but it showed how far those chimps had gone to becoming humanised.'

After her TV fame, Choppers retired to the Leicestershire zoo and ended up sharing a cage with co-star Louis until he died aged 37 last July. Sharon Redrobe, chief executive of Twycross Zoo, said she tried to get Choppers to mix with other apes again after his death. Over three years, the zoo carefully retrained her to be more chimp-like than human-like which was not an easy task, says Ms Redrobe. Problems they had to overcome included Choppers' smiling which is a friendly human response but to a chimpanzee it shows agression. She said it makes her 'cringe' to think of chimps being made to act as humans but people 'didn't know better'.","Choppers at Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire had forgotten ancestry .

"A senior Pentagon official has flatly denied any plan to ransom Bowe Bergdhal, the American soldier held by the Taliban, after claims a conman disappeared with the cash. The allegation was raised by a member of Congress, who said that Department of Defense tried to pay ransom to win the release of Sgt Bergdahl from the terrorist Haqqani network in Pakistan, but was duped. California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter made the extraordinary allegation in a letter to Chuck Hagel, the Defense Secretary. But Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary has now firmly denied any ransom plan, military.com reported. 'There was no ransom offered, there was no ransom paid – nor was there an attempt to do so that failed,' he said. Rep. Duncan Hunter (center) is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who is pressing the Pentagon for details about a failed plot to ransom Bowe Bergdahl through a middleman who disappeared with the money . A triumphant President Barack Obama announced Bergdahl's release in May, offering no suggestion that his administration had tried to ransom him before opting for a 5-to-1 prisoner swap instead . AWOL? Bergdahl's former platoon-mates said he walked away from his post in Afghanistan and should have been court-martialed instead of reintegrated into the military . However there was no clear attempt to address whether money had been paid - and disappeared. 'I'm not aware that any money changed hands,' Kirby said. But on the issue of payments to intelligence sources he added: 'There are such exchanges.' The carefully worded statements don't appear to rule out the possibility that money was sent but never reached its target. Joe Kasper, the press secretary to , told MailOnline on Thursday that the Pakistanis holding Bergdahl 'wanted to deal. They were desperate to deal.' Official denials from the Obama administration, Kasper said, are par for the course but likely deceptive. 'We know better than to believe that,' he explained. 'That's what they're going to say, and that's fine. We should expect that. But where there's smoke there's fire.' 'They can deny it all they want,' added Kasper, speaking of the administration's official spokespersons. 'But there are people within the Defense Department itself who are saying otherwise. Their own people. ... We know who discussed this issue within the Pentagon. We know who briefed the secretary.' He said the government is in the habit of entertaining ransom plans, but always through third-parties that will give the United States deniability. 'We don't pay a ransom in the sense that the U.S. government officially makes payments to a foreign entity,' Kasper said, emphasizing the word 'officially.' 'The way we've been doing this for a long time is through a workaround.' Rep. Hunter, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served two combat tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan after the 9/11 terror attacks, is among Capitol Hill's most persistent military bloodhounds. Pentagon officials flatly told the congressman this year that there was no consideration of a cash swap for Bergdahl, Kasper said. 'They told him categorically that, no, it never happened. That's when we decided to press down on the accelerator. And the information we got back was resounding.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday that the Obama administration flatly opposes the idea of paying for the release of Americans held captive overseas. 'It's not in the best interests of American citizens to pay ransoms to any organization, let alone a terrorist organization, that is holding an American hostage,' he said. 'And the reason for that is simple: We don't want to put other American citizens at even greater risk when they're around the globe, and that knowing that terrorist organizations can extract a ransom from the United States if they take a hostage only puts American citizens at greater risk.' Hunter dropped a bombshell in a Nov. 5 letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, claiming that America's Joint Special Operations Command 'did pursue at least two lines of effort for Bergdahl: a kinetic rescue operation, if necessary, and; a payment to the Haqqani Network to gain Bergdahl's release.' 'It has been brought to my attention,' Hunter wrote, 'that a payment was made to an Afghan intermediary who 'disappeared' with the money and failed to facilitate Bergdahl's release in return. The payment was made in January-February 2014.' Hunter also seemed to understand the careful parsing of denials that often follows inquiries – from both congressmen and journalists – into sensitive national security matters. 'I recognize the reluctance to describe a payment as a ransom,' he wrote, but claimed the botched payment was made – 'regardless of how the transaction is described.' In a separate letter to the directors of the FBI, the CIA and U.S. Special Forces Command, he expressed his understanding that 'a transfer occurred that possibly included payment to Haqqani from the Taliban for the receipt of Bergdahl.' Accusation: Hunter's press secretary told MailOnline that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was briefed on the failed ransom plan, which had to involve third parties in order to give the White House deniability . TALIBAN FIVE: The Afghans released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Bergdahl were among the most senior members of the Taliban held at the prison camp, including one who had direct ties to Osama bin Laden . According to The Washington Times, unnamed officials said the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force anti-terrorism squad handled the Bergdahl ransom mission. 'The FBI also was involved in the ransom payment attempt and was waiting inside Afghanistan's border with North Waziristan when the release failed,' the Times reported, 'confirming that it had been a scam.' The USA Patriot Act makes it a crime to give payment or assistance to terror groups that could boost their support, and hostages' family members have said publicly that the federal government warned them against raising money for their loved ones' safe return. But retired Lt. Col. Oliver North told WMAL radio in Washington in June that he had direct knowledge of the negotiating process and was sure the Haqqani network had asked for a cash payment. Bergdahl, he said, 'was never regarded as a – quote – 'prisoner of war.' They all thought of him as a hostage and that's the way they presented it. All they wanted was money.' Earnest's statement on Wednesday came in response to questions about a government-wide review of U.S. hostage policies, requested this summer by President Barack Obama. Bergdahl is back on active duty now, after five years of captivity . The Pentagon completed a review of his case in October but has yet to release it, citing the need for an internal review. Angry Republicans including some on the House Armed Services Committee claimed in the days before the midterm election just weeks ago that Democrats were holding it back for political advantage. The self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, a militant terror group that now controls large sections of Syria and Iraq, has executed three American hostages this year in gruesome beheading videos distributed via online social media. That group has reaped at least $20 million this year in hostage ransoms, according to Treasury Undersecretary David S. Cohen, but often decides that the propaganda value of videotaped killings outweighs the value of money. Bergdahl was released in May after the Obama administration made a different kind of trade – not for money, but for five high-value Taliban terrorists who had been held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba military detention facility. The enlisted soldier came under fire for allegedly deserting his U.S. Army unit in Afghanistan before he was captured by Taliban fighters. That group reportedly sold him to the Haqqani network, a notorious crime syndicate with centuries of history trading hostages for gold, opium and other commodities. The Haqqanis held Bergdahl for five years. He is now back on active duty and serves at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.

"A judge has recommended a six-month suspension for a Los Angeles attorney who posted doctored photos on her firm's website that show her with high-profile people such as President Obama, Kim Kardashian and George Clooney. In an 18-page decision this month, Judge Donald Miles said Svitlana Sangary failed to remove the images after a State Bar warning that they were false advertising; disregarded the disciplinary process and responded to the charges with a 16-page soliloquy that had little or nothing to do with the case. The California Supreme Court will decide on the recommendation. Scroll down for video . Los Angeles attorney Svitlana Sangary (left) stands accused of photoshopping herself into pictures with more than 50 celebrities, and posting the images on her law practice website. One of the pictures above she posted on her firm's website, with Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and Nick Cannon . The photo that Sangary posted online looks very like this one taken in October 2007 but instead of Nicky Hilton sitting at the front row fashion show it is Sangary . The attorney says she was photographed with 'talented and successful people' at charity and political events and provided a photo link. State Bar Court Judge Donald F Miles says the photos posted on Sangary's law practice website 'were created by taking original celebrity photos and then overlaying (Sangary's) image in order to make it appear as though (Sangary) was in the presence of that celebrity'. In some of the photos, Sangary even uses the same picture of herself. 'Friends' in high places: The images were still up on Sangary's website as of today. Pictured above with actress Anne Hathaway . Sangary put this photo online of her posing with actor George Clooney . Punishment: The California bar association is recommending that Sangary's law license be suspended for six months, and that she be put on probation for three years. Pictured above with Donald Trump . When confronted about the pictures two years ago, Sangary didn't even trouble herself to take the photos down from the site. According to her website, Sangary practices deals in business, real estate, foreclosure, insurance, employment and personal injury litigation . They still appeared there today, under a tab titled 'publicity'. In fact, Miles says Sangary responded to the charges in a '16-page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges at hand'. In one particularly strange excerpt, Sangary goes on a tangent about Natalie Portman's performance in the 2010 ballet-drama 'Black Swan' The passage reads: 'Also, with regard to false statements and misleading advertisement, none other than Natalie Portman comes to mind. The online media extensively covers the controversy surrounding Natalie Portman's performance in the film Black Swan. 'The ballet dancer who performed in the Black Swan, Sarah Lane, has come forward to revel [sic] a 'cover-up' and says that Natalie Portman's head was superimposed on to Sarah Lane's body, and that Natalie Portman lied.' She also includes an email from President Obama in the response, in which he allegedly asks her to donate to the Democratic party. According to the State Bar of California, Sangary graduated from Pepperdine University’s School of Law. She was admitted to the State Bar in 2004. A selection of the photos on the website - they are still online for the public to view . Legends: After being confronted about the images two years ago, Sangary refused to take the photos down.

Politicians: She wrote a 16-page response to the allegations in which she goes off on several strange tangents, including one passage about Natalie Portmans' acting in the 2010 film Black Swan.

Thanks to software editing programs it is easier than ever to pretend you are with someone you haven't met or visiting a place you have not traveled to. There are instructions across the internet on how to fake a photo with a celebrity such as this one by Wiki How. 1. Choose a celebrity photo. Find an image with a celebrity that is not likely to have been seen all over the internet and people will recognise- a casual photo is best. Make sure it's high resolution and then save it to your computer. 2. Choose a photo of yourself. Try to find an image that will blend well with the celebrity picture you have selected - eg if there is a spotlight coming from the right on your celebrity image, choose a photo of yourself where there is a strong light source on the right. 3. Software. Open both photos in the editing program of your choice. Photoshop is popular but you can also find free online editors that work just as well. 4. Remove the background from your photo. Use the Magic Brush or Magnetic Lasso Tool to cut yourself out of your picture then use a remove brush to 'erase' the background. If the  background is a light white and gray checked background, this means that you are removing any background which will make it lay on top of the second photo better. 5. Drag the newly-cut image of yourself onto the celebrity picture. To make sure the image does not look too obviously faked there are certain tweaks that can be made. Use the eraser tool to get rid of extraneous pieces of background that came along with the image of yourself. Look at height difference - you made need to tinker with your size next to the celebrity so you are not too tall or small - ie shrink or enlarge the image of yourself. You may also need to adjust the lighting or contrast of the photo.

"For years, Sarah Mowbray tried in vain to track down the daughter she had been forced to give up for adoption as a toddler. But with only first names to go on and no idea of the surname of the adoptive parents, she drew a blank. As a last resort, she typed the name Kayleigh Marie into Facebook – and found herself looking at profiles of hundreds of women with that name. Reunited at last: Sarah Mowbray, 41, with her long-lost daughter, Kayleigh Marie Watts, 22 . Recognition: The pair were reunited after Sarah spotted a photo of her daughter on Facebook . Although . it seemed like an impossible task, she sifted through each one until, . astonishingly, she stumbled upon the picture of a twentysomething woman . who bore an uncanny resemblance to her own younger self. Convinced . that Kayleigh Marie Watts could be the toddler she gave up for adoption . 19 years ago, 41-year-old Mrs Mowbray sent her a friend request – and . within five minutes of messaging on the site the pair had confirmed . their remarkable connection. Mrs . Mowbray and Miss Watts have been inseparable since meeting for the . first time a week ago and yesterday celebrated their first Mothering . Sunday together since 1995. The . delighted mother said: ‘I had been searching for Kayleigh for seven . years but didn’t know the surname of her adoptive parents. In . desperation I started searching for plain Kayleigh Maries on Facebook. ‘When . I saw Kayleigh’s picture I thought she was the spitting image of me. As . soon as we met I hugged her so tight I almost broke her neck. I can’t . believe I’ve finally found her.’ Miss . Watts, who had been living in Throckmorton, Worcestershire, less than . 20 miles from her birth mother’s home in Malvern, said: ‘It’s fantastic, . like we have never been apart. ‘I . had started searching for my birth mother three months earlier. I . always knew we would be reunited, I just never imagined it would happen . so soon.’ Mrs Mowbray gave . Kayleigh up for adoption after social workers intervened because she was . in a violent on-off relationship with the girl’s father. She went on to have a son, Daniel, with another partner before marrying former farm worker Terry Mowbray, 39. Mrs . Mowbray, a full-time carer for her disabled husband, did not know what . her daughter looked like when she typed ‘Kayleigh Marie’ into Facebook’s . search facility last November. Stunned by Miss Watts’ close resemblance . to her own appearance two decades earlier, she showed the picture to Mr . Mowbray, who urged her to make contact. Mrs . Mowbray had also commissioned a tracing agency to try to track down her . daughter. The agency had found a possible address and was writing to . Miss Watts when Mrs Mowbray sent her a friend request. Separated: Kayleigh Marie was taken from Sarah when she was just two and placed in foster care . Identical: The profile pictures Kayleigh posted on Facebook looked exactly like photos of Sarah at the same age . Miss . Watts accepted the following morning and the pair began messaging. Minutes later, the connection was made when Mrs Mowbray said she was . waiting for some important news about the daughter she had not seen for . 19 years. Miss Watts asked . what the daughter’s name was and was told it had been Kayleigh Marie . Thomas but that she had been adopted. Miss Watts then simply replied: . ‘Mum!’ She followed it with . another message: ‘I’m Kayleigh Marie. My last name was Thomas but then I . was adopted’, and the pair then confirmed Miss Watts had the correct . date of birth. Relieved: Sarah says she now has the chance to be the mother she's always wanted to be to Kayleigh Marie . They spent . five months messaging and texting each other until Miss Watts, who now . lives in Worcester, plucked up the courage to meet her mother last week. Miss Watts, a care worker, said she has a strained relationship with . her adoptive parents but gets on better with her older adoptive brother. She . bought Mrs Mowbray a purse, chocolates and candles for Mothering . Sunday. She said: ‘It has been very emotional, it’s taken me six months . to pluck up the courage to meet her and I’m so glad I did. ‘I’ve found my biological mum and we have loads in common. It was crazy to see that picture that looked just like me.’ Mrs Mowbray said: ‘I’m over the moon to have my daughter back. I now can hopefully be the mum I always wanted to be.’ Miss Watts’ adoptive parents declined to comment.","Sarah Mowbray, 41, from Worcestershire, last saw Kayleigh Marie in 1995 .

"The full extent of the Unite union’s campaign of bullying and intimidation against senior managers during the bitter Grangemouth oil refinery dispute is revealed today. In a disturbing echo of the union militancy of the 1970s and 80s, Unite leaders deployed a dirty tricks squad to personally target and humiliate executives of the Ineos chemical company and their families. The sinister unit – known as the ‘Leverage team’ – sent mobs of protesters to the homes of senior figures in the firm. One director last night said he had . feared for the safety of his wife and his two young children after 30 . Unite protesters descended on his drive during the school holidays. Bullying: The Mail revealed how Unite thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the Grangemouth petrochemical plant, pictured, in Scotland during strike action last month . Police were called after the group approached his neighbours, telling them he was ‘evil’ in an apparent attempt to coerce him into giving in to their demands. The daughter of another company boss had ‘Wanted’ posters denouncing her father posted through her front door hundreds of miles away in Hampshire. The union agreed to call off the Leverage team only as part of the settlement of  the dispute. Yesterday, . an unrepentant Unite spokesman said such activities were ‘legitimate in . the context of an industrial dispute’, adding that ‘bad employers . should have nowhere to hide’. Stephen Deans, the Unite organiser at the heart of the dispute . Details of the bully-boy tactics were revealed yesterday as David Cameron branded Stephen Deans, the Unite organiser at the heart of the dispute, a ‘rogue trade unionist’ whose behaviour nearly sank the plant. Ineos threatened to close the Grangemouth plant after Mr Deans and Unite refused a new pay and pension package designed to save the business. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey brought the dispute to crisis point by launching strike action. Unite finally caved in last Friday and Mr Deans resigned on Monday after being told he would be fired for spending a quarter of his working hours on Labour party business. Mr Deans was also chairman of the Falkirk Labour party where he had become embroiled in a Labour vote-rigging scandal. The Prime Minister said of Mr Deans: ‘Frankly, we have a real problem with a rogue trade unionist at Grangemouth who nearly brought the Scottish petrochemical industry to its knees.’ One Grangemouth boss, who as asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, called the police after 25 Unite members working for the union’s Leverage team protested on his driveway with flags, banners and an inflatable rat for about 90 minutes on October 18. The director was called by his wife, who was out with her children and had been phoned by a friend to say a mob had arrived on their doorstep. He rushed to the scene said he was overcome with ‘bloody anger’ when he saw they had targeted him. ‘It was a mob, a threatening mob,’ he . said. Children as young as seven who were playing on the street were . coaxed into joining the mob. ‘They . were trying to humiliate me,’ the director said. ‘Trying to portray me . as a nasty boss, a nasty capitalist. To portray me as someone evil. Their intent was to have my neighbours thinking, gosh, what sort of a . guy do we have living there. Unite members protest outside the home of an Ineos director over the Grangemouth dispute . ‘It was just despicable to approach . kids and try to introduce them to a demonstration against one of their . neighbours. It’s hard to find words to describe the lunacy of their . behaviour.’ Police were . called and interviewed the director and his neighbours at length, saying . they would search out the members of the group on suspicion of being in . breach of the peace. Officers decided not to press charges. The . director added: ‘Their intent was to gain concessions. But taking it to . someone’s home, to someone’s drive, during the school holidays, is way . over the line.’ Unite admit the use of ‘Leverage’ on their website and claim it has helped secure a number of ‘landmark victories’. It says: ‘Leverage is a process whereby the union commits resources and time to making all interested parties aware of the treatment received by Unite members at the hands of an employer. ‘Those interested parties may include shareholders of the employer; competitors of the employer; communities within which the employer operates; customers of the employer and the market place of the employer. ‘We ask all interested parties to make moral and ethical decisions about their future relations with an employer who we believe is acting immorally. ‘Unite will make sure all are aware of the true facts behind an employer’s poor treatment of our members. ‘We will ask those who object to the behaviour of an immoral employer to conduct in lawful protest against the actions of the employer. ‘Where Unite members are involved in such lawful protest the union will use  its best endeavours to ensure such  members are aware of their rights of  lawful protest. Leverage is not a call for unofficial action. ‘Leverage is about the democratic right of the union to ensure that immoral employers cannot hide behind veils of secrecy and must conduct their business in an open and transparent fashion and accept the consequences of the moral judgements that may follow. ‘It is in no way a replacement for  collective strength. The development of industrial power remains vital if workers are to have the ability to win long-term. ‘Leverage does not offer a solution that excludes the critical need to organise workers.‘Leverage has secured landmark  victories including: . ‘Honda – defeat of de-recognition at the CAC.‘BESNA – defeat of the so-called BESNA 7 – construction industry ‘majors’ – who were seeking to rip up industry agreements and impose inferior contracts on thousands of workers. ‘London Buses – a supplementary payment gained following a dispute over additional workload caused by London’s hosting of the Olympics.’ The director and his wife now fear for the safety of their children, who are both under ten. ‘It . had quite an impact on my kids,’ he said. ‘My wife is very concerned . that they could turn up at any time again. They know where I live. It’s . in the back of my mind.’ Leaflets denouncing company owner Jim Ratcliffe were also posted through the doors of homes in the town where he lives. Union protests were also held outside . dozens of businesses which trade with Ineos, including their bankers . Lloyds and customers Sainsbury’s and Asda, in a effort to pressurise . them to cut their ties with the firm. Another . Ineos director said: ‘They have send flying squads of protesters to . dozens of businesses we have links with. The put leaflets through the . door of pretty much every house in Lyndhurst where we have our . headquarters. My daughter received a poster explaining what a terrible . person I am. ‘This behaviour smacks of totalitarianism. The way they have been behaving is frankly insane.’ The Mail has seen an email, sent from Mr Deans’ email account last Wednesday, acknowledging that the Leverage unit went on the attack. The message, written by Mr Deans’ fellow Unite convenor Mark Lyons to Calum MacLean and Declan Sealy, the two Ineos negotiators, offered the company a deal. In addition to accepting the ‘survival plan’ and ‘pensions proposals’, the Unite point man also says union bosses will ‘ensure withdrawal of leverage strategy’. On Unite’s website, the union boasts that it uses ‘leverage’ to put pressure on ‘shareholders of the employer, competitors of the employer, communities within which the employer operates’ and ‘customers of the employer’. ‘Leverage is about the democratic right of the Union to ensure that immoral employers cannot hide behind veils of secrecy.’ The behaviour of the Leverage team appears not to violate union laws banning secondary picketing since protests are allowed if they do not prevent employers of the firms they targeted from going to work. But the Tories last night branded the revelations ‘extremely sinister’ and called on Ed Milibad to reopen Labour’s inquiry into the activities of Unite. A Unite spokesman said: ‘All the activities referred to are both legal and legitimate in the context of an industrial dispute. Bad employers should have nowhere to hide. ‘Of course all campaigning in the context of the Ineos dispute has now ended. ‘However for the workers and their union to be described as “bullies” is beyond satire.’ Last night Len McCluskey denounced Mr Cameron after he used Prime Minister’s Question Time to criticise Mr Deans. ‘The Prime Minister’s conduct today was disgraceful,’ said Mr McCluskey. ‘His rush to smear a good and honourable man will appal decent-thinking people. He should apologise at once.’","David Cameron branded Stephen Deans, the Unite organiser at the heart of the dispute, a ‘rogue trade unionist’ whose behaviour nearly sank the plant .

"Sales of celebrity cookbooks have risen by 250% this year alone . Hairy Bikers knocked E.L James off number one bestsellers lists . Jamie Oliver is Britain’s second biggest-selling author since records began – with total book sales of £126m . From Nigella Lawson's food porn bibles to silver fox Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry baking up a storm on The Great British Bake Off, cooking has never been cooler. But while sales of celebrity cookbooks have risen by 250 per cent this year alone, one in 10 Brits admit to never even opening the ones they buy. Half say that they own more than four books but only pull them off the shelf when they need to make ‘something special’. Although sales of cookbooks are on the rise, one in ten of us admit to never even opening them . And a time-poor five per cent claimed . that while they own a mountain of cookbooks, they don't spend any time . in the kitchen at all. But despite the fact their spines remain unbroken and their recipes untested, it transpires that these beautifully designed, mouthwatering reads are beginning to eclipse other bestsellers. The diet cookbook from The Hairy Bikers, for example, has aroused enough interest to knock Fifty Shades Of Grey off the bestsellers lists. Jamie Oliver is now the second most valuable author of all time, missing out to just J.K Rowling . But despite half of Brits showcasing impressive cookbooks on their shelves, findings reveal that the meals most regularly cooked are traditional classics like spaghetti bolognese (60 per cent), meat and two veg-style roast dinners (54 per cent) and sausage and mash (48 per cent), with only a handful of Brits regularly taking on more exotic dishes such as Thai curry (16 per cent) or paella (10 per cent). The nation's favourite cuisines ranked as Italian (20 per cent), Indian (18 per cent), British fish and chips (17 per cent) and Chinese (15 per cent), however, only 30 per cent of those polled had tried to cook one of their favourite cuisines at home - and a naughty one in ten lied to friends about trying a certain cuisine or ingredients.

After identifying the condition he isolated himself in a ward at the treatment center in Liberia. He is now being treated at a hospital in .

But that did not stop the good doctor from treating his sick patients . A potion with purpose: Dr. Brantly makes chlorine solution for disinfection at the case management center on the campus of ELWA Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia in this photograph courtesy of Samaritan's Purse . In an email sent to his former work colleague in Texas, Dr Brantly asked people to also pray for Nancy Writebol, a missionary who was the second American infected with the disease. 'I'm praying fervently that God will help me survive this disease,"" Dr Brantly said in the email to Dr David McRay, the director of maternal-child health at John Peter Smith Hospital in Texas, where Dr Brantly worked for four years. Dr McRay said Dr Brantly was ""terrified"" of the disease progressing further and that he wanted people to remember that hundreds of people are suffering with the disease, and that he is no different than any of them. In the email seen by MailOnline Dr Brantly wrote: . “David, I think what I would like to say is thank you for all the prayers and messages of encouragement. I am praying fervently that God would help me survive this disease.

Helping hands: Generally patients who enter the second stage of the Ebola virus do not survive.They die an agonizing death . Incredible man: Close friend KellumTate posted several photos of the hero medic saving lives in Africa on her Facebook page. She wrote next to the photos that she had spent five weeks working with him in Tanzania in 2012 and paid tribute to an 'incredible man' In a statement posted to the Samaritan’s Purse website, Amber said Kent remains ‘physically weak’, but Kent ‘his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal.’ ‘We have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support,’ she said. She added that her family ‘appreciate so much all the words of comfort and acts of kindness.’ 'As people with a deep faith in Jesus, we sincerely thank the thousands of people worldwide who have lifted up Kent and this dreadful situation in prayer,' she wrote. 'We continue to lean on that faith and take great consolation in our God in these times.' Amber is in the US with her children and asked for prayers and privacy. She said she and her family 'continue to believe that God will deliver Kent from this deadly virus.' A close friend of Dr Brantly's, nurse Kellum Tate, posted several photos of the hero medic saving lives in Africa on her Facebook page. She wrote next to the photos that she had spent five weeks working with him in Tanzania in 2012 and paid tribute to an 'incredible man', 'whose compassion, endurance, and love for mankind are humbling to an unfathomable degree.' The nurse wrote: 'I thought a few pictures of this wonderful man doing the things he loves most - being with his family and working tirelessly to treat patients - would be appropriate. 'If you're a praying person, pray for him. If you're not a praying person, pray for him anyways.' Dr Brantly and missionary Nancy Writebol are now entering a ‘critical’ phase of their treatment, the head of the charity which sent them to Liberia has revealed. Keeping the faith: In a statement posted to the Samaritan's Purse website, wife Amber said Kent remains 'physically weak', but 'his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal' Bruce Johnson, President of SIM USA, told MailOnline that within the next few days we will know if Kent Brantly is likely to survive. He said that Ebola could turn for the worse within hours and that both the patients may soon begin to show signs of internal bleeding which could be fatal. Dr Johnson also warned that unless the international community does more to stop what has become the most serious outbreak of Ebola in history then it will spark a ‘tsunami of destruction’ in Africa - and maybe beyond. Last week Dr Brantly was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects. Mrs Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second. The condition update will be agonizing for both their families - not least Dr Brantly’s wife Amber who is in the US with their two young children. Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol were in Liberia with SIM USA and Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian aid charity. Dr Brantly was treating the sick whilst Mrs Writebol was disinfecting medics as they left isolation wards. Words of gratitude: Dr. Brantly wrote in a new email: 'Please continue to pray along with me, and pray for my friend Nancy, who is also very sick, and for the doctors who are taking care of us. Thank you all so much. Peace, Kent' Mr Johnson told MailOnline that both were being treated in isolation private houses at the SIM compound near the Liberian capital Monrovia. Mrs Writebol was still in her home and her husband David has had to move out. Mr Johnson said he spoke to Dr Brantly on Monday and that he ‘wasn’t as good as he had been’.He said: ‘The situation is so fluid. One day it’s up, one day it’s down. He was up working on his computer, talking with people this is not a bed ridden situation. ‘He is moving, he is active. He is interactive and we are pleased with that’. Mrs Writebol is suffering from diarrhea but is talking and in touch with family via her computer on Skype and via email. Mr Johnson said: ‘Her husband David seems strong. He is handling this with faith but he is also realistic with Nancy and Kent. ‘This is not a light situation. This is a very serious situation but we are encouraged by how they are doing so far. ‘The next few days are critical in assessing the recovery of both of them’. SIM spokesman Palmer Holt said that the coming days are so important because symptoms would start to show that would indicate that the disease had entered its second, more serious phase. The first stage is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea. The second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body. Prayers: Dr Brantly asked people to  pray for Nancy Writebol, here with her husband David. She is a missionary who was the second American infected with the disease . Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red. They die an agonising death. Generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive. Mr Johnson said that SIM USA had not yet identified how Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol had become infected but said that they take ‘extreme safety measures’ and follow guidelines from the Centre For Disease Control. He said: ‘Our hearts just break for them’. So far more than 600 people have been killed in the outbreak across West Africa that has infected more than 1,200. Liberia has closed its borders to help stop the disease amid fears that it could spread after a patient suffering from Ebola took a flight to Lagos in Nigeria. Mr Johnson said: ‘What we have here really is the potential for this to become a tsunami of destruction for the country of Liberia and that why we are calling on the international community to now respond. ‘It’s grown to such proportions that it’s overwhelming Samaritan's Purse and SIM and it needs others like the US to help. ‘It’s like a wildfire in the Western US. It’s like what happens to a small fire that continues to grow and no-one is trying to put it out. ‘This is preventable but right now SIM is the only care center for Ebola patients in Liberia and that has to change’. Today the CDC issued an alert warning to travelers to avoid hospitals with Ebola patients and funerals for those patients in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea due to the outbreak. The United States is considering raising the alert to discourage ""nonessential"" travel to those three countries, a U.S. government spokesman said.","American doctor and dad-of-two Kent Brantly was treating Ebola patients in Monrovia, Liberia when he recognized he had the symptoms .

"The 19-year-old Florida cheerleader charged with carrying on a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl has claimed that she had no idea that she was breaking the law. Dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, Kaitlyn Hunt sat down with a NewsChannel5 reporter Tuesday for her first jailhouse interview since entering a plea deal late last week. On Thursday, Hunt pleaded no contest to battery, interference with child custody and contributing to the dependency of a child. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Kaitlyn Hunt (left) sat down for her first jailhouse interview since entering a plea deal late last week to discuss her relationship with her 14-year-old ex-girlfriend . Sense of betrayal: Hunt said while she still cares for her young ex-paramour, she no longer has the same love for her she had had before the scandal . 'I never was educated on dating laws and ages and stuff so I still was confused about everything,' the 19-year-old insisted during the interview. 'I didn't know why I was in trouble.' Miss Hunt was charged in February with having sex with a 14-year-old student at Sebastian River High School. Hunt was 18 at the time and also attended the school. A previous plea deal was withdrawn in August following allegations that Hunt exchanged thousands of explicit texts with the girl and sent her nude photos - a move she has since come to regret. ‘I trusted her as not only my friend but my girlfriend too.  I felt I got set up in multiple ways and I got hurt by her.’ Hunt said. A judge revoked her bond, sending her to jail. Prosecutors added a charge of transmitting material harmful to a minor. Addressing her feelings toward her former flame, Hunt said that she still cares for the girl ‘as a person,’ but she no longer has the same love for her she did before. Hunt also expressed regret that she had never gotten the chance to speak to her ex-girlfriend’s parents about their relationship. ‘I would have respected their wishes and I would have sat down with them and had a conversation with them and it would have been different,’ she said. The young woman, however, insisted that her 14-year-old paramour’s family do not deserve an apology from her. Under the terms of Thursday's deal, Hunt will be released just in time for Christmas. Together: Hunt is pictured with her alleged 14-year-old victim, who has not been identified . Former life: Another image shows Hunt cheerleading at her school, where she met the younger teen . After regaining her freedom December . 20, Hunt plans to go back to school to study nursing. She will have to . serve three years’ probation, including two years of house arrest. The . 19-year-old also wants to spearhead a campaign with her attorney meant . to overhaul state laws that pertain to relationships between high . school-age teenagers. In an earlier interview with Good morning America, Hunt has insisted that the 14-year-old was not a victim, even though her parents claimed the girl was feeling threatened. 'The . threatening tone... put her in a place where she felt she had to . abide,' the father of the victim, who has not been named, told GMA. But Hunt defended her messages to the 14-year-old, explaining that it had been a tough time for her. If she sticks to the conditions of the deal, she will not be a convicted felon per Florida law. She would then have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years. The case . has garnered national attention as the teenager's supporters have . claimed that the younger girl's parents only contacted police about the . relationship because Hunt is gay. She was charged with two counts of . lewd and lascivious battery in February and jailed before posting . $5,000. She was banned from contacting the younger girl, whom she had . met at high school. Under . Florida law, even if the relationship was consensual, it is illegal for . anyone over the age of 18 to have sexual relations with anyone under . that age. At the time of their relationship, Hunt was 18. 'Threatening tone': The victim's father said his daughter felt pressured by Hunt's text messages . Arrest: Hunt was arrested again in August after prosecutors allegedly discovered she had sent 20,000 text messages to her victim since March, including some of a sexual nature. She has been in jail ever since . Third chance: Hunt, pictured in court on Wednesday, has been offered . a third plea deal which would see her in jail until December 20. She would then have to spend two years under house arrest . But court documents in August accused Hunt of 'covertly . contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to . the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it. The new evidence indicated Hunt and the . girl, until July, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day . at Sebastian River High School in March. Hunt also allegedly sent more than 25 lewd photos of herself . which show her nude or 'masturbating while moaning'. They . also allege that Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith, may have helped her . daughter cover her tracks by messaging the girl, urging her to delete . all trace of their contact. According . to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend told detectives about the continued . illicit contact and how Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location . where they would have intimate physical contact.' Happier times: Kaitlyn maintains the relationship with her female classmate was consensual . New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her . On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship. 'F**k you…you're stupid,' she wrote. 'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you . snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. Bye.' But the pair continued their contact - and Hunt's mother found out. 'Delete . EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete . everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.' The younger girl's parents have remained adamant that Hunt should be prosecuted as a sex offender.","Kaitlyn Hunt pleaded no contest last week to battery, interference with child custody and contributing to the dependency of a child .

Offensive: This New York City cop was filmed making an obscene gesture and using vulgar language . When the vendor, who has asked to remain anonymous to avoid reprisals, called her a maniac and asked why she was acting that way, the cop yelled: 'What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?'. The ice-cream seller is then heard saying: 'You gotta stop acting up like this,' prompting the cop to become abusive. As she makes an obscene gesture, the cop can be heard saying: 'Blow me b*tch,' as she walks away. The behavior is a far cry from NYPD's motto of 'Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect,' Gothamist commented.

"Jellyfish are growing in numbers around the world and cost marine industries millions every year. But a South Koren scientist may have found a way to combat the problem, by producing a killer robot which shreds the fish up and destroys them within seconds. The machine called JEROS (short for Jellyfish Elimination Robotic Swarm) can kill 900kg of the gelatinous creature in an hour using its deadly propellers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Killing machine: The robot hunts for jellyfish using a GPS system which is attached to the pulverising propellers . Trapped: The jellyfish are hunted down by the system's cameras and attract them into a net . The robot patrols the seas for the fish using a GPS system attached to motors below the surface and can plan its attack using cameras. According to the website Fast Company, the deadly system then traps the animals in a submerged net before ingesting them through the blades. Hyun Myung, director of the Urban Robotics Lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, designed the system so three robots could travel together and act as one. He started to think of a way to kill them in 2009, when the South Korean marine industry lost an estimated $300 million because of the creatures. During a test run, one system shredded 900kg of jellyfish in one hour, a sign that the killer robots could provide a way to combat the growing jellyfish population. The system, which is cheaper than trapping them in a net, would save millions for marine industries every year and could save lives. Earlier this year, a five-year-old Japanese boy died after he was bit by a jellyfish while on holiday with his family in Borneo. No return: The creatures are then sucked towards the propellers . Destroyed: The fish is then shredded to death as it passes through the blades and is pulverised with no trace left . Finished: The JEROS then pulverises the rest of the swarm before it continues to search the ocean . Earlier this week, a large cluster of jellyfish forced one of the world’s largest nuclear reactors to shut down after it caused a blockage in the pipes. Oskarshamn nuclear plant closed its third reactor for the second time in one weekend after a giant wave of jellyfish clogged the pipes that bring in cool water to the plant's turbines. It was not the first time operators at Oskarshamn have been forced to close reactors due to jellyfish, and marine biologists say could become more common across the globe. Lene Moller, a researcher at the Swedish Institute for the Marine Environment said: 'It's true that there seems to be more and more of these extreme cases of blooming jellyfish. ‘But it's very difficult to say if there are more jellyfish, because there is no historical data.’ Moller said the biggest problem was that there's no monitoring of jellyfish in the Baltic Sea to produce the data that scientists need to figure out how to tackle the issue. Blocked: The Oskarshamn nuclear power plant in southeastern Sweden was closed after jellyfish clogged surrounding pipework .

What remained: Just moments after the children were taken out of the car, it flipped over completely and waves tore through it . Emergency responders: The Good Samaritans led the charge but then beach patrol took over . 'The children were in the back seat, . they were buckled in and were not in distress. Although the sergeant . said she looked like she had some mental illness, she did not fit the . criteria for going into custody under the Baker Act.' 'If . she made any statements that she was suicidal or homicidal officers . would have taken her into custody,' said Volusia County Sheriff Ben . Johnson. The Florida . Mental Health Act, commonly known as the Baker Act, allows authorities . to involuntarily take people into custody if they seem to be a threat to . themselves. Two . hours after the police stop, Wilkerson drove into the ocean. Bystanders . and officers helped pull her and her children — ages 3, 9 and 10 — from . their minivan as it was almost submerged. Help: The woman's sister called police and . warned them that she was talking about demons, prompting them to do a . welfare check but they released her because she was lucid . The . children were turned over to welfare authorities. The Volusia County . Sheriff's Office said Wilkerson was undergoing a mental evaluation. Sheriff Ben Johnson said it's too early to say whether Wilkerson will . face criminal charges. 'They have been through a very rough ordeal,' Florida Department of Chidren and Families spokesman John Harrell said. 'We would not want to have the children placed in an environment in which they would not be cared for.' Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that the 31-year-old mother was physically able to escape the vehicle. In video taken by Simon Besner, a . tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards . try to pull her children from the vehicle. Witnesses . described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children . remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her . under the van. 'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner. In the video several men frantically . try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's . side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan. The small child is eventually pulled to safety. Hearing the call: Stacy Robinson said that he didn't know what was going on and then heard children screaming . Defending their actions: Sheriff Ben Johnson said that his deputies had to let her go because they had no legal justification to hold her . Another tourist described watching with horror. 'My . friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the . beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin . visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6. 'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.' 'That's . when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out . two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and . brought a little toddler out of the car'. Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident. 'When she first was drifting into the ocean, we thought maybe an accident,' Donna Pratt told the broadcaster. 'But . when the bystanders went to help, she clearly went deeper into the . ocean. She drove right toward it, so it's hard to believe it was an . accident.'","Good Samaritans Tim Tesseneer and Stacy Robinson saw the children in distress in the car and ran to help them out .

"When he was born at 24 weeks, it was almost impossible for Finley Devonshire's parents to imagine the tiny addition to their family would survive. But, despite weighing just 15ozs - less than a bag of sugar - he is now five months old and has finally been allowed to go home. His mother, Gemma Haskey, has spoken about how she started suffering headaches and high blood pressure which doctors told her was pre-eclampsia. Finley Devonshire has finally been allowed home five months after he was born weighing just 15ozs . Parents Gemma Haskey and Graham Devonshire were faced with the agonising option of whether to abort the pregnancy when she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia . It is clear how small Finley was when he was born from this image taken while he was in an incubator in hospital . She was given the agonising option of aborting the pregnancy because the baby could be brain-damaged. A scan showed that Finley was healthy and so she vowed to continue to carry him. But . just a day later Finley's father, Graham Devonshire, 40, got a call . from the Nottingham City Hospital telling him Gemma's condition had . deteriorated and they had no choice but to deliver the baby. Doctors . said Finley had only a ten per cent chance of surviving the Caesarean . section. Incredibly, he responded well after being rushed to a neonatal . intensive care unit for treatment. Gemma was also rushed to intensive care after the birth and only saw her son for the first time four days later. Gemma fell ill during the 23rd week of pregnancy and delivered Finley a day after being admitted to hospital . But . on the same day mother and baby met for the first time Finley started . bleeding on the lungs and was given just 24 hours to live. Gemma . said: 'I can't remember much of that first week. I just wanted to know . he was okay and the nurses were great at giving me updates, but I don't . think we really understood how poorly he was. 'They took us into a room and said he's got this big bleed on his lungs and he was very poorly. 'We . said as long as he wants to fight we want to fight with him, so they . gave him an aggressive form of ventilation and we just had to wait and . see. We just stayed positive. 'My philosophy from day one was ""whatever happens, happens"" and that got me through.' Finley responded to the ventilation and surprised medics by beating the bleed on his lungs. After . 16 days he was transferred to the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, . where he was fitted with a Broviac line to supply nutrients. It was a further 17 weeks before Finley - now five months - was finally allowed to go home with his parents on August 14. Gemma said: 'It was the one question I never asked. We only found out a week before he came home that we could take him. 'It's the best feeling ever. From day one he had this amazing fighting spirit and I think he even amazed the doctors sometimes. 'I can't even put in to words what he's been through. There's a lot of adults that wouldn't be able to go through it.' Gemma can barely remember the first week of Finley's life and she did not get to see her son until he was four days old . This picture shows just how small Finley's feet are - barely twice the size of a £1 coin . Graham and Gemma, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, were told last year they could have children again following Gemma's major transplant surgery. Graham urged other families with premature babies not to give up hope. He said: 'We didn't dare allow ourselves to think past the next hour and just took everything day by day, even hour by hour to begin with.' 'What he was going through, the treatments, he was being given the highest intensive care they could give, so he was very sick and we just had to hope. 'It's always at the back of your mind that something would happen but you just have to keep going. 'For any other family going through this - don't give up. We didn't and if Finley can get through it, there's always hope.' The couple were told Finley will probably suffer from sight problems in the long-term but it is too early to say if there will be any other health complications. Doctors yesterday hailed Finley as a miracle and said he had defied the odds to make it. Consultant, Bernard Schoonakker, said: 'He's one of the smallest babies we've looked after. 'The fact his mother was so unwell, how early he was born - he really is a little miracle for us.'","Mother faced with aborting Finley after suffering pre-eclampsia .

"Chief Coroner dismissed excuse because she'd been there before . Lindsay tweeted that she was 'sorry for confusion' and was stressed . She turned up in an $80,000 Porsche . Lindsay intends to arrive on time to the morgue later today to report for her community service . This is the moment Lindsay Lohan cruised up to her community service at a morgue 40 minutes late. Despite the gravity of her ongoing legal problems, the actress made a splashy entrance as she pulled into the LA County Morgue's car park in a $80,000 Porsche Panamera, before being turned away due to her tardiness. And after finding herself with her day unexpectedly free, Lohan decided to put her time to good use by attending a last minute therapy session. Lindsay posted on Twitter: 'With all of . the stress and pressure from yesterday and today, I've never been so . happy to go to therapy!!!! Also, I'm sorry for the confusion that I may . of caused to those at the Coroner's office. Won't happen again, now I . know where to go! Thank you for your help.' Too late! Lindsay Lohan's Porsche is turned away from the Los Angeles County Morgue yesterday morning after arriving 40 minutes late for her community service . Although the LA Coroner's spokesman said Lohan was 40 minutes late to her 8am appointment, she claimed she was 'approximately 20 minutes late'. But after her 'confusion' over what entrance to use on Thursday, her publicist insisted the actress would report to the morgue on time later today. Her publicist Steven Honig said: 'Lindsay arrived at the . morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for . orientation tomorrow. 'Her lateness was due to a combination . of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the . media waiting for her arrival. Well the rest of the day is free now... Lindsay Lohan made use of her free time by going to the dentist to get her teeth whitened . Getting her Hollywood smile back: Lohan is hoping to have pearly whites when she turns up at the morgue later today . 'Lindsay . spoke with the supervisors at the morgue. They showed her how to get in, . and everything is all cleared up.' Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter, . however, is unconvinced by Lohan's excuse, telling reporters that she . has been to the morgue before so should have known where to go. And she may not just be able to turn up today without the judge's permission. Winter added: 'Ms. Lohan has to have permission from the probation department and/or . the judge, that she can come back. 'I haven't heard from the probation . department or the judge about whether or not Ms. Lohan will be allowed . to come back.' However, Lindsay still believes she is on track. 'She is going to . orientation tomorrow unless the Court tells her otherwise, which has not . happened,' Steve Honig, Lohan's spokesperson told Radar. Where's Lindsay? Camera crews wait for Lohan's arrival at the morgue yesterday when she arrived late . Clean-up duty: Lohan has been ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue before her next court hearing on November 2 . Lohan will face the wrath of Judge Sautner on her next court appearance on November 2. The actress was ordered to undertake 16 hours of morgue duty on Wednesday before her November court hearing. So long as she manages to complete these hours in the next two weeks she is not in violation of her probation. However, the Coroner's Office will . notify the Probation's Volunteer Center - which monitors Lindsay's . probation - of Thursday's drama before the judge is formally told. Long arm of the law: Lindsay seen here arriving for her court hearing on Wednesday . Finding her feet: Lindsay tweet from yesterday apologising for the confusion at the morgue and suggesting she had got lost . Lohan is already skating on thin ice . with Sautner, who on Wednesday blasted the Mean Girls star for not making . an effort to complete her probation. The judge is incensed the actress has . barely scratched the surface of the 480 hours of community service she . was ordered to complete as part of her sentence for the theft of a gold . necklace earlier this year. Lohan only did around a . day-and-a-half at the Downtown Women's Centre in LA - and failed to show . up nine times, resulting in her being rejected from the programme. This week she did some volunteer work . for the Red Cross - but Sautner ruled it as void because it was not . part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier . hearing. Sautner said only time completed at the women's centre and the morgue counted. In a further development, LA County . Sheriff Lee Baca has told Fox 11's Good Day LA that the overcrowding . issue will not keep Lohan out of jail. He told the show that if Lindsay is . sentenced to jail time he will make sure he finds room for her, adding . she needs at least 60 days inside to be rehabilitated. What a twit: She also tweeted that she was pleased to be going to therapy after a stressful day yesterday and in court on Wednesday . Rejected: Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter tells reporters Lohan arrived late for her court-ordered community service and was sent away . The news comes after Lohan's father Michael spoke out, alleging his daughter was back on drugs and needs help. He said the recent photos of her . discoloured and apparently rotting teeth was down to her smoking . methamphetamine or crack cocaine. Lohan posted $100,000 bail on Wednesday following her court hearing. Meanwhile, the beleaguered star's mother is set to blow the lid on her daughter's alleged drug and alcohol use in a memoir she's currently shopping around Hollywood. Website TMZ has obtained the draft of a prologue for Dina Lohan's memoir, which Dina's spokesperson is pitching to the literary world. An excerpt from the prologue allegedly written by Dina says: 'I blamed her friends, her career and her handlers for an (sic) newfound lifestyle of partying excessively. 'Drinking, drugging and behaving irresponsibly became Lindsay's way of daily living--and it tore me up inside.' Lead away in cuffs: Lindsay was taken into custody after being blasted by the judge.

"Louis van Gaal hailed the first complete performance of his Manchester United reign after the 3-0 win against Hull City at Old Trafford on Saturday. 'This is the first match that we have dominated the game from the first minute until the last, in a way that I like,' he said. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Manchester United 3-3 Hull City . Van Persie of United receives a hug from team-mate Rooney after scoring their third goal at Old Trafford . 'We knew in advance that they come with five defenders and a full midfield. We trained to play the ball quick and we did it, but also we didn't give the ball way unnecessarily. That was an improvement from the Arsenal game last time.' Robin van Persie will grab the headlines after ending his poor form by scoring United's third goal with a left-foot thumper. Van Gaal and Van Persie give a wave to the crowd after the 3-0 win against Hull at Old Trafford on Saturday . A pleased van Gaal said: 'Every striker needs a goal when you haven't score for two or three matches. So I am very pleased and happy with him for his goal, but he can still play better. 'In the beginning of the game, he played No 10 and not No 9. When I was forced to put him in a striker's position because of the injury to Angel di Maria, he played better. 'I am pleased he scored and had an influence of the game.' Rooney (left) shoots to score their second goal during the  Premier League match between United and Hull . Van Persie himself admitted: 'I am glad I scored - I needed that.' The only downside was a hamstring injury to Angel di Maria who asked to be replaced after 14 minutes and will miss the home game against Stoke on Tuesday while he is assessed. Wayne Rooney, scorer of United's second goal on Saturday, was also hobbling at the end after hurting his calf and knee but the striker is keen to play in the next game.","Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal hailed 'dominant display'

"Foam: A new acne drug trial produced no side effects, unlike those on the market (posed by model) A foam that’s squirted on to the skin could be a radical new treatment for acne. It contains small amounts of a drug called minocycline, an antibiotic that’s long been used to treat the condition. The treatment works by destroying the bacteria that lead to acne breakouts. Although minocycline is effective when taken as a tablet, it can have nasty side-effects such as vertigo, dizziness, diarrhoea and mouth ulcers. However, it’s hoped the new foam, which is gently rubbed on to spots and is absorbed within seconds, will slash the risk of adverse effects because the drug does not have to pass through the body before it reaches its target. Early trials show the experimental foam, called FMX101, is as effective as the drug in pill form, with a once-daily application reducing the number of spots by around 72 per cent over a three-month period. Crucially, none of the 150 patients who took part in the trial reported major side-effects. Acne affects eight out of ten teenagers and more than half of women over 25. Hormonal changes cause the sebaceous glands in the skin to produce increased amounts of an oily substance called sebum. Together with dead skin cells, the sebum blocks hair follicles, trapping bacteria that usually live harmlessly on the skin, where they actually help to protect against infection by a wide range of organisms. The main bacterium involved is Propionibacterium acnes, or P. acnes, and, like others found on the skin, it needs a constant supply of oxygen to flourish. But trapped inside the skin, rather than living harmlessly on the surface, it is starved of its normal supply and starts to attack healthy skin cells in an attempt to access the oxygen that is circulating in the blood. Meanwhile, the immune system, sensing the body is under attack, sends out white blood cells to try to ward off the bacteria. The result is the inflammation and swelling that leads to an angry-looking spot that can become itchy and sore before eventually erupting and, in some cases, scarring the skin. Treatment: Acne affects eight out of ten teenagers and more than half of women over 25 (posed by model) Treatment ranges from creams and gels for mild acne with no underlying inflammation, to powerful antibiotics — such as minocycline — to kill bacteria in the skin. Israeli firm Foamix Inc developed the foam as an alternative to tablets. Unlike gels, ointments or creams, it disappears rapidly and leaves less of a sticky residue on the skin. The foam is due to enter the final stages of clinical trials next year and could be available within two to three years. Dr Tony Chu, consultant dermatologist at Hammersmith Hospital in London, says using foam to deliver drugs to affected areas of the skin was potentially a good idea. But he warns: ‘Minocycline can cause unsightly pigmentation in scarred areas of the skin — even when taken as a tablet. ‘Another issue is the development of antibiotic drug resistance, which is increased if antibiotics are used on the skin.'","FMX101 contains minocycline, an antibiotic long used to treat condition .

"Tragic: Jojo John, who was operating a boat that crashed on the Hudson River, has been charged with vehicular manslaughter and three counts of vehicular assault . The driver of the speedboat that crashed on Friday night killing a bride-to-be and best man is a party boy Wall Street banker who has previous convictions for drugs, it emerged today. JP Morgan Chase employee Jojo John, 35, was drunk when he crashed the boat into a barge - allegedly at high speed - and has been charged with vehicular manslaughter and vehicular assault. A friend of Johns said that he would often go speeding around local waterways with friends after first having several drinks. The body of Mark Lennon was pulled from the Hudson river yesterday, one day after bride-to-be Lindsey Stewart, 30. Her fiancé Brian Bond is in hospital with the serious injuries he sustained in the crash. None of them were wearing life vests. Brian, who was knocked unconscious and suffered a fractured eye socket, was said to be inconsolable when told the news about the deaths. John is in Westchester Medical Center recovering from his injuries and is said to be devastated and 'stunned into silence' at the news his friends are dead. A source told the New York Post: 'He’s pretty messed up right now. He knows he’s in trouble with all the charges, but right now he’s more devastated that his friends are dead.' Though authorities have said he was drunk at the time of the crash, they are still waiting for toxicology reports to discern how much alcohol he consumed and if he had taken drugs. The Lennons described Mark as a lover of the outdoors who had recently hiked the Appalachian Trail and traveled in Africa. 'He’s at peace,' his mother, Dympna Lennon, told The Journal News.

"Rolf Harris has been axed by cruise giants Cunard after being charged with child sex offences. The former TV host and artist was one of several painters whose work was displayed in galleries on board the firm’s luxury liners, including the £300 million flagship Queen Mary 2. He also travelled on board the QM2 from Southampton to New York last November to host master classes. The luxury cruise ship giants refused to reveal how many of the former TV presenter's portraits were on display throughout the ships . A Cunard spokesman said: ‘When allegations regarding Rolf Harris first came to light some time ago, we felt it was appropriate to remove his pictures from display in the art galleries on board.’ Cunard refused to say how many of the 83-year-old’s portraits were on show across its three liners. Harris’s agent did not return calls and emails. The artist and TV presenter's portrait of the Queen on her 80th birthday, which was commissioned by the BBC, has also disappeared. The portrait, for which Her Majesty posed in person, hung in the Queen’s Gallery, attached to the south-west wing of the Palace, until 2007 when it was loaned to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool for several years. Harris painted a portrait for the Queen on her 80th birthday which has gone missing since he was charged with indecently assaulting two under-age girls in the 1980s . The painting left the gallery in August last year and has been unaccounted for ever since. Harris is among several television personalities who have been questioned by Operation Yewtree detectives in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Harris was charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four of making indecent images of children in August. He has not commented on the charges.

"President Barack Obama welcomed his newly-elected counterpart Francois Hollande to the White House today – while his wife Michelle hosts the French president’s twice-divorced girlfriend. When the leaders of the G8 nations gather at Camp David tomorrow, Mrs Obama will treat their spouses to a tour of the White House and a meal made from produce grown in her White House vegetable garden. Then leaders and spouses will de-camp to Chicago for the largest Nato summit in the organisation's history – some 60 countries will be represented. The spouses will get a tour of the Gary Comer Youth Center on the South Side, where Mrs Obama grew up, and a dinner at the Art Institute of Chicago. Touchdown: Valerie Trierweiler arrives at Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia with French President Francois Hollande . During last year’s G8 summit in Deauville, France, it was a pregnant Carla Bruni-Sarkozy who received the wives, and one husband, of the heads of states and governments. This time in Washington and Chicago all eyes will be on Valerie Trierweiler. A journalist and a twice-divorced mother of three teenage boys, Trierweiler, 47, was hosting a weekly interview show on a minor French TV network until just a few months ago. She is best known as a political writer at the magazine Paris Match, where she has worked for two decades. When she appeared for her boyfriend’s swearing in at the Elysee Palace, clad in a black chiffon dress, nude tights, high heels and white coat, she drew comment for outshining the relatively dowdy Bruni. When the wind caught her split skirt to reveal an eye-catching glimpse of thigh, it was clear that the Bruni era was over every bit as much as the Sarkozy one following Francois Sarkozy’s defeat by the socialist Hollande. Although Michelle Obama was a high-powered lawyer and hospital executive in Chicago and understands the pressure of juggling work and family life, her background is very different from that of Trierweiler.

Smiling: President Barack Obama shakes hands with French President Francois Hollande during his first visit to the U.S. Brothers in arms: President Barack Obama embraces French President Francois Hollande in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington Friday . Hollande broke up with Segolene Royal, his political ally lover for 30 years and the mother of his four children, after she discovered his affair with Trierweiler. Married just once, with two daughters rather than four sons, Mrs Obama’s life has been a model of stability compared to Trierweiler’s. It remains to be seen whether Mrs Obama will miss Bruni, whom she bonded with so strongly that she apparently felt comfortable enough to confide that she found life in the White House ‘hell’ – though aides on both sides of the Atlantic denied she ever said this. Mrs Obama and Trierweiler share humble beginnings. The fifth of six children, Trierweiler was raised in a council house. Her father, a clerk, had lost a leg after standing on a landmine in 1944 when he was 12. The father of the future First Lady of the United States was a city water plant employee who suffered from multiple sclerosis. Her mother, who now lives in the White House and looks after her grand-daughters, was a catalogue store secretary.

Greetings: French President Francois Hollande waves to supporters as he leaves the White House next to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Friday . Both women have been passionate defenders of their other halves. Mrs Obama once confronted black talk show host Tavis Smiley after he had moderated a debate to demand: ‘Why are you messing with Barack?' ‘You were unfairly tough on Barack. You should know as a black man what he’s up against and what he’s trying to do.’ During the French election, Trierweiler was dubbed ‘the Tweetweiler’ because of her use of Twitter to deliver frequent barbs. She has also hit back at the way she has been portrayed. When her own magazine put her on the cover with the headline ‘Hollande's Charming Asset’, she tweeted: ‘Bravo Paris Match for its sexism, my thoughts go out to all angry women’. After a New York Times reporter’s book recounted disputes inside the White House involving a feisty and impatient First lady, Mrs Obama gave a television interview protesting about being characterised as an ‘angry black woman’. Carla Bruni-Sarkozy (left), wife of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is greeted by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama (right) at the Pittsburgh G20 Summit in 2009 . The two husbands may have got off to a rocky start, as Mr Hollande confirmed that France would withdraw from the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan by the end of the year. The announcement was apparently no surprise to Mr Obama, who nodded along but did not otherwise respond to the news. Mr Hollande insisted: 'We will continue to support Afghanistan in a different way. Our support will take a different format. 'I'm pretty sure I will find the right means so that our allies can continue with their mission and at the same time I can comply to the promise I made to the French people.' The declaration means that means France, one of the top contributors of troops to the war, will be removing the combat forces a full two years before the timeline agreed to by allies in the coalition. That could shift more of the burden to those allies and give them reason to hasten their own exit. Hollande later told reporters that some 'residual' number of France's current 3,300 troops will remain in Afghanistan after this year to provide training and to bring home equipment.",Leaders could clash over French plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan .

"Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said there were times, including at airports and in schools, where a full religious veil was not appropriate . Religious veils should not be allowed in the classroom, Nick Clegg suggested today as Lib Dems called for a national debate on the issue. The Deputy Prime Minister said it was ‘inappropriate’ for students to wear a full veil during lessons because teachers needed to see their faces. And Downing Street went further, saying David Cameron believed bans could be imposed in 'other institutions'. It came after Tory MP Sarah Wollaston called for a ban in all schools because 'they make women invisible. The issue has erupted after a college’s U-turn last week on banning students wearing veils. A judge is due to decide today on whether a Muslim woman can stand trial while wearing one. Mr Clegg was careful to say he did not want a legal ban on the wearing of religious items of clothing. He told the BBC: ‘I think there is a debate going on already in households and communities up and down the country. ‘My own view, very strongly held, is that we shouldn’t end up like other countries issuing edicts or laws from parliament telling people what they should or should not wear. Scroll down for video . ‘This is a free country and people going about their own business should be free to wear what they wish. I think it is very un-British to start telling people what pieces of clothing they should wear. ‘I think there are exceptions to that as far as the full veil is concerned - security at airports for instance. It is perfectly reasonable for us to say the full veil is clearly not appropriate there. ‘And I think in the classroom, there is an issue of course about teachers being able to address their students in a way where they can address them face to face. I think it is quite difficult in the classroom to be able to do that.’ 'I do think there is an issue with teachers in the classroom…that might be an area where a full veil might be inappropriate.' Home Office minister Jeremy Browne suggested the Government should consider banning Muslim girls and young women from wearing the veil in public places. His intervention was sparked by a row over the decision by Birmingham Metropolitan College to drop a ban on the wearing of full-face veils amid public protests. A student at Birmingham Metropolitan College wears a full veil after the college reversed its position which previously banned students from wearing niqabs so they could be 'easily identifiable at all times' Mr Browne said he was ‘instinctively uneasy’ about restricting religious freedoms, but he added there may be a case to act to protect girls who were too young to decide for themselves whether they wished to wear the veil or not. ‘I am instinctively uneasy about restricting the freedom of individuals to observe the religion of their choice,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘But there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol, smoking or getting married. ‘We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression.’ Number 10 said the Prime Minister believes that schools should have the right to set their own uniform policies. At a regular Westminster briefing, the spokesman suggested other institutions could also look to ban veils. He said: 'I actually think there is a position of principle here, which is around the ability of institutions such as schools, to set a, in the case of schools, clearly a uniform policy, so I think that is already there. He added: 'The Prime Minister doesn't take the view, doesn't believe, that Parliament should legislate on what people do and don't wear on their local high street. 'Nonetheless, that is not incompatible with institutions having dress codes. Schools are an example but it is for institutions to take those decisions. 'There are legal frameworks within which all institutions operate.' Last week, Birmingham Metropolitan . College was forced to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils . on its campus after a protest. A 9,000-name petition saw its principal . back down on its policy after it was accused of ‘Islamophobia’. The ban stopped Muslim pupils wearing . the niqab, the full facial veil in which only the eyes are visible, or . the burqa where the eyes are covered with mesh. But the college was . attacked for its stance by local councillors, MPs and the National Union . of Students. However Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said some women found the niqab ‘deeply offensive’ and should not be accused of being bigoted for criticising them. The Tory MP posted a string of controversial tweets in light of recent events concerning full-face veils . She made the comments on Twitter following a college’s U-turn last week on banning students wearing veils and before a judge is due to decide today on whether  a Muslim woman can stand trial while wearing one. Dr Wollaston, the MP for Totnes in Devon, said: ‘The niqab should be banned within schools and colleges; how on earth do they promote equality when they collude with making women invisible?’ She also wrote: ‘A general ban on the niqab simply won’t happen in the UK but that doesn’t mean that it should be endorsed by schools or courts.’ Her comments were met by a backlash from supporters of the veil, but she stood her ground against the angry criticism. The MP said her view was ‘not bigotry’ and that this accusation was ‘the cudgel used to repress debate’. She added: ‘Feminists should be allowed to say that they find the niqab deeply offensive without being accused of being bigoted or Islamaphobic.’ Among the tweets hitting back at the MP’s comments were from Muslim commentator Mohammed Ansar. He said: ‘Poor Sarah Wollaston’s twitter feed has become a total car crash of bigotry, Islamophobia, historical ignorance and exceptionalism.’ He added: ‘Do you accept and support the right of a woman to dress as she wishes?’ One woman asked the MP on Twitter: ‘How about asking a woman who wears niqab what she thinks about her freedom? Or does her opinion not matter?’ Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said there needed to be a national debate on the issue of veils . The wearing of veils in public faces another test in court today. A judge at Blackfriars Crown Court in London allowed a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to plead not guilty while wearing her veil last month. She argued she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons, but as a compromise she allowed a female police officer in a room next to the courtroom to lift it to check her identity. The judge will now decide on whether she will be able to wear her veil during her trial for intimidating a witness, as he feared jurors would not be able to see her facial expressions during questioning. A veil ban at the Birmingham college had been in place for eight years without protest. But an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper, saying that she was being discriminated against, and the publicity sparked an online campaign. Birmingham Metropolitan College is believed to be the only  college in the UK to have banned the niqab. Some 43 per cent of its 44,000 students come from ethnic groups that are non white. An online petition was signed by 9,000 people, amid rumours that the college was also planning to ban prayers on its premises. The college was forced to amend its policy, which also covered hoodies and hats, which had been brought in to make sure students were always ‘easily identifiable’.","Deputy Prime Minister said veil is also not appropriate at airport security .

"A heroic 63-year-old Texas man with two surgically repaired knees came to the rescue of a young woman who was being mauled by pitbulls. Monica Garza was literally being torn apart by two raging dogs as she jogged along a hiking trail behind Charles Jordan's Houston home on Wednesday morning. His wife heard Garza's terrified screams and Jordan, who has to use a walking stick, hurried to help and jumped on-top of her - but not before the dogs had bitten their victim 56 times.

Suburban scene: This is where Jordan rushed to Garza's aid after his wife was alerted by the sound of her screams . Rescue: This is Monica Garza with family friends - the Houston jogger was lucky to escape with her life when two pitbulls attacked her on Wednesday morning . 'I just kept kicking that dog and kicking that dog and it wasn't going to stop,' said Jordan about the unrelenting dogs. 'They were determined to get to that girl.' 'One had her by the arm and the other had her by the leg and they were just pulling her apart,' he said to ABC 13 in Houston. The attack, which took place along the South Belt hike and bike trail, lasted for more than 10 minutes before the dogs tired and left. 'I’m fine. The dogs didn’t want me. They were fixated on her.' 'I said, 'You are safe. There is nothing else going to happen to you today.' She just put her head down and started crying and that is when I broke down, too,' said Jordan. Garza was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery and one of the responding EMT's turned out to be a close family friend of the victim. Uncertain fate: These are the dogs that are facing being destroyed for their attack on Monica Garza on Wednesday morning in Houston . 'I didn’t recognize she was wet and bloody,' said Miguel Cantu to KHOU. 'She recognized me and said, please help me.' The dogs were tracked down and seized by animal control where they are to be quarantined for 10 days.

'I thought it was some kid on the walking trail screaming as they rode their bike,' said Sharon Jordan to KHOU. 'It kept going and wouldn’t go away.' Jordan denied he was a hero, but Garza's father, Jeff Mack disagreed. 'I firmly believe he saved her life by risking his,' said Jeff Mack. Jordan, who is a grandfather, said he would risk his life again to do the same thing. 'She’s too young,' said Jordan. 'Young people don’t need to be hurt. I’ve got kids. I’ve got grand kids. Don’t hurt them.'","Charles Jordan, 63, saved jogger Monica Garza on Wednesday from being mauled by two pitbulls on her morning run .

"Members of the Saudi Arabian royal family have attacked a new film which portrays the founder and first king of their country as a bloodthirsty womaniser. Prince . Talal bin Abdul-Aziz, the twentieth son of Ibn Saud, whose rise to power is shown in the film King of the Sands, said the film could 'tarnish' his father's name and said he would try to have it banned. But the film opened amid controversy in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Thursday 12 December, attended by hundreds of high-profile guests. Scroll down for video . By the sword: King of the Sands shows Ibn Saud, who founded modern Saudi Arabia, leading a bloody military campaign . Amorous: The film also portrays the Saudi king-to-be as a womaniser . The premiere took place despite the civil war in Syria, though several mortar shells were said to have exploded not far from the venue during the screening. Showing the film so publicly has been said to mark a low-point in relations between Syria and Saudi Arabia, with Saudi royals attacking the Assad regime for allowing the film, and Syrian ministers accusing the Saudis of funding rebel fighters. King . of the Sands is directed by Najdat Anzour, one of Syria's best-known . producers and most acclaimed directors, who is also a supporter of President Assad. The . film, which purports to show events leading up to the creation of Saudi Arabia in 1932, was also shown at a private screening in London on 11 September, a date which some has said was chosen to highlight alleged links between Saudi Arabia and the 9/11 terror attacks. In . the film, King Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, later commonly known as Ibn Saud, is portrayed as a merciless ruler . who kills opponents in sword fights, orders that thieves have their hands cut off, stones those who have pre-marital sex, takes multiple wives for himself and deflowers virgins. In one scene, the character, played by Italian actors Fabio Testi and Marco Foschi, asks: 'What's . wrong with blood? A kingdom is only taken with blood.' War: The film shows some of the fierce fighting which led to the foundation of the Saudi state . Controversy: Director Najdat Anzour says he has received death threats as a result of the film . Taboo: The film is especially controversial as the Saudi rulers are rarely criticised publicly in the Middle East . He then says: 'The sultan will . never be obeyed but by the sword.' Meanwhile a narrator says: 'A sword was raised for the sake of the kingdom and the sultan making the sand soaked with blood'. Elements of the film also imply that Ibn Saud was susceptible to British influence, particularly after oil was discovered in Saudi Arabia. The film is especially controversial because the Saudi rulers are not generally criticised in public in the Arab world. The Saudi king is also a significant figure in Islam, as he is custodian of Mecca and Medina, the religion's two holiest places. Reputation: Children of Ibn Saud, shown here in 1934, have said the film must not be allowed to 'tarnish' his memory . In response to the screening, which has been promoted on Syrian state television, Prince . Talal bin Abdul-Aziz Tweeted a statement explaining that he was trying to persuade President Assad to ban the film. He said: 'I hope he . responds positively in honouring King Abdul-Aziz as a person. We cannot let such unsuccessful works tarnish the . image of a great historical figure like King Abdul-Aziz.' Fadia . Kiwan, a political science professor at St Joseph University in Beirut, . said the screening may bring Syria-Saudi relations 'to the point of no return.' Since the Syrian rebellion began in 2011, the two powers have been particularly fiercely opposed. The Saudi government led criticism of President Assad's treatment of protesters in Damascus, while Syria has complained to the UN about its alleged support for rebel fighters. Last . month, President Assad was quoted by state media saying: 'Saudi Arabia is . leading the widest sabotage campaign in the Arab world.' He also accused them of paying rebels $2,000 a month each to fight government forces. Ali Haidar, a Syrian cabinet minister, said: 'Personally, . I strongly encourage this movie. Relations might mend once Saudi . Arabia corrects its policy, halts its support of terrorism and . apologizes for what had happened in Syria.'","King of the Sands, by Najdat Anzour, premiered in Syria on 12 December .

"German statesman Helmut Kohl has launched an 11th-hour bid to stop the publication of a new book in which he pours scorn on his protege Angela Merkel. The controversial book by journalist Heribert Schwan is based on extensive interviews with the former chancellor, who during his 16-year tenure oversaw the reunification of his country. In it, Mr Kohl reportedly claims Mrs Merkel could 'barely hold a knife and fork properly' while saying that at state dinners, 'she loitered around so much I had to repeatedly tell her to pull herself together.' Former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his second wife Maike Richter-Kohl, pictured in 2012. The author of the book Mr Kohl is trying to ban says Mrs Richter-Kohl is at the heart of his dispute with the former chancellor . The 84-year-old also branded former labour minister Norbert Blüm - who was instrumental in exposing the slush funds which nearly ended up with him being sent to jail in 1999 - a 'traitor', and Christian Wulff, who went on to become president of Germany under Merkel before being forced to resign over alleged improprieties, a 'loser' and a 'zero.' Mr Kohl, who has retreated from public life in recent years since suffering a bad fall, has instructed lawyers to call an emergency session at the nation's Supreme Court to halt the book entitled: 'Legacy: the Kohl transcripts.' He fell out with Mr Schwan, his former biographer, after the pair conducted more than 600 hours of taped interviews in 2001 and 2002, the year his wife Hannelore killed herself after suffering from a devastating allergy to light. In August a court told Mr Schwan he must return the tapes to Mr Kohl, but the journalist was able to delay handing them over until he was able to make full transcripts of the conversations. It is not known whether the publication of the book, set to be unveiled at the Frankfurt Book Fair on Wednesday, is even legal. But excerpts have already been published by news magazine Der Spiegel. 'The girl': Mr Kohl reportedly claims Mrs Merkel could 'barely hold a knife and fork properly' while saying that at state dinners, 'she loitered around so much I had to repeatedly tell her to pull herself together' As well as trashing Mrs Merkel - the politician he formerly referred to as 'the girl' - Mr Kohl also argues against overestimating the role of East Germany's civil rights movement, which faced off against the communist regime in 1989 in a series of protests which became known as the 'Velvet Revolution.' 'It would be wrong to pretend that the Holy Ghost has suddenly descended over Leipzig and changed the world,' Mr Kohl said in reference to the protests. Instead, he said the fall of the wall was the result of the Soviet Union's sclerotic economy. 'Gorbachev went through the books and had to concede that his game was up, and that he could not prop up the regime,' he said. 'Gorbachev's legacy is that he called time on Communism, partially against his will, but de facto he finished it off. Without violence. Without bloodshed. 'Beyond that I am struggling to think of much else in terms of real legacy.' Mr Schwan claims that he was sacked as Mr Kohl's biographer and ordered to return the tapes after falling out with his new wife, Maike Kohl-Richter. Critics say Mr Kohl, was angry that his political life was over after the 1999 slush-fund scandal, and hit out at Merkel and others in frustration at his perception that he was no longer needed on the world stage.","Helmut Kohl was German Chancellor between 1982 and 1998 .

"Sir Jimmy Savile's campaign of alleged child abuse took place over six decades . Jimmy Savile's alleged campaign of child sex abuse could include as many as 60 victims spanning over six decades, investigators have revealed. Police have trebled their original estimates of the number of preyed upon youngsters, after soaring numbers of alleged victims have come forward in the wake of the scandal. Detectives said the figure accounts for 'predominately' teenage girls. Today it was also reported Savile was previously investigated by police six times after a series of sex abuse claims, the first one taking place as early as 1958. And fresh allegations have come to light that the alleged child molester was 'given the keys' to Broadmoor secure hospital around 1988, when cabinet minister Ken Clarke was Health Secretary. It was claimed the predatory paedophile molested a 17-year-old patient at the high security mental hospital, Broadmoor, which he was given the gold-plated keys to as a reward for his volunteering. The Department of Health (DoH) has been dragged into . the scandal over its decision to appoint Savile to lead a 'taskforce' overseeing management restructuring at the hospital. The department will carry out an investigation into how he was given the position and the DoH could be sued by victims as it was running the place at the time. Mr Clarke was forced to defend himself last night, saying: 'I have no recollection of ever having met Jimmy Savile and no . recollection of these events. 'The DoH are rightly now investigating to . establish the facts.' A spokeswoman for Mr Clarke said that as he only became . health secretary in July 1988, Savile's appointment to the role at Broadmoor . may have been instigated by someone else. In a statement, the DoH said: 'We will investigate the . Department of Health's conduct in apparently appointing Savile to this role. 'In hindsight he should very obviously not have been . appointed.' Scroll down for video . There are now reports of alleged abuse starting in 1959 up to and including 2006, the year in which Savile is pictured, right. The former DJ is pictured left in 1960, two years after the first police investigation . There are growing . fears NHS bosses turned a blind eye to sick and disabled children being . attacked by the former DJ because he raised so much money for them. Scotland Yard detectives are now in contact with 14 other forces investigating the Jim'll Fix It  star's abuses, with police pursuing 340 lines of inquiry across the country. So far 12 allegations of sexual offences have been officially . recorded but this number is increasing. Savile was allegedly investigated by police during a series of sex abuse inquiries since 1958 but each time he evaded justice. Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, left, was reportedly Health Secretary when Savile, right, was given the keys to Broadmoor hospital where he allegedly abused a 17-year-old girl . He was first investigated by police 'for interfering with young girls' when working as a nightclub manager in Leeds as long ago as 1958, his former bodyguard told The Sunday Telegraph. In the late 1960s there was an inquiry into underage sex taking place in the Top of the Pops changing rooms, according to the show's then producer. Police reportedly interviewed BBC staff but did not pursue a case. There was an allegation in 1971 that the late TV host was involved with a 15-year-old dancer on Top of the Pops, who committed suicide. And there were claims Savile was abusing patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the late 1970s, allegations which were reported to police but there was not enough evidence to proceed. In the past five years there were two further police investigations. These included one in 2007, in which Surrey Police questioned Savile over allegations of child sex abuse in the 1970s at Duncroft school. But the case was dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence. A spokesman for the force said: 'In 2007 Surrey Police received an historic . allegation of indecent assault which is alleged to have occurred at a . children's home in Staines during the 1970s. The allegation was investigated . and an individual was interviewed under caution. 'The matter was referred to the . Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was . insufficient evidence to take any further action.' A senior member of staff at the BBC revealed he questioned Savile, pictured, over rumours about his private life more than 20 years ago . Meanwhile, photographs of Savile in the act of grooming vulnerable girls at the school for fragile children have emerged. One of the photos shows him looking surprised to be captured as he holds a private conversation with five girls. The other photo, obtained by the Sunday Express, snaps the paedophile in a cheesy pose with his arms open, surrounded by eight teenage girls. One of the girls is pictured lifting her skirt to show a garter. One of his victims, pictured in the photo, was a pupil aged just 14 when she was abused by Savile in 1977. She summoned up the courage to report him to her head teacher but instead of the police being called she was sent to her room and deprived of food, she claimed. She said: 'He came to the school a couple of times a year, bringing presents of records and magazines and was far too tactile with the pupils, who saw him as a superstar.' After being invited into an empty office with him at the age of 14, she claims he molested her for several minutes, ignoring her protests. She recalled: 'I said to him ""Get off, you can't do that"", but he wouldn't listen. In the end I had to push him off and then I ran into a nearby bathroom and locked myself in.' Last Tuesday police were investigating claims Savile abused 20 victims and this figure doubled to 40 potential victims on Friday. The alleged cases of abuse took place in studios, care homes, schools, hospitals and nightclubs. Commander Peter Spindler, head of MPS Specialist Crime . Investigations said: ‘We can now confirm that we have received information from . the public that suggest allegations against Jimmy Savile span six decades with . reports starting in 1959 up to and including 2006. ‘Having now had the opportunity to review progress one week . on I have revised my estimate of the number of likely victims to be about 60. ‘Once again I want to thank those who have come forward and . reassure them, and anyone else who contacts us, they will be listened to.’ The scandal emerged when ITV screened a documentary . in which five women alleged they were abused by the late DJ and broadcaster. The BBC came under fire after it was revealed Newsnight abandoned an investigation into the alleged abuse in December 2011. And a senior member of staff at the BBC revealed he questioned Savile over rumours about his private life more than 20 years ago. The property Savile would stay in when visiting Broadmoor Hospital, to which he was given the keys in 1988 . Derek Chinnery, who as Radio 1 controller from 1978 to 1985 was Savile's boss, admitted that he quizzed the presenter directly about the rumours of suspected abuse. Mr Chinnery told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House: 'I asked, ""what's all this, these rumours we hear about you Jimmy?'."" 'And he said, ""that's all nonsense"". There was no reason to disbelieve (Savile).' Savile worked at Radio 1 from 1969 to 1989 presenting a show of chart songs from previous decades. Speaking about his acceptance of Savile's denial, Mr Chinnery told the BBC: 'It's easy now to say how could you just believe him just like that.' He added: 'He was the sort of man that attracted rumours, after all, because he was single, he was always on the move, he was always going around the country.' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the corporation has lessons to learn following the allegations, saying, 'they must never ever, ever happen again'. He told Sky News the revelations were 'appalling', adding: 'The BBC in particular has to learn . lessons from this, I think they've come forward with the right approach, . saying we will investigate, we'll do it properly'. Sir Michael Lyons, who was chairman of the BBC Trust from 2007 to 2011, told Sky News: 'There may well be lessons here to learn about the way that we tolerate the behaviour of predatory men, particularly when they are in powerful positions. 'And there may be lessons to learn - I am sure there - about the license that we sometimes allow to celebrities. This goes well beyond the BBC although there are issues for the BBC to address.' The veteran DJ in 2001 when he said he didn't care about his legacy in an interview . The late TV presenter said he did not care if he was remembered as a conning pervert and abuser when he died. When asked the question by a reporter in an interview in 2001 when he was 74, he said: 'If I’m gone that’s that. B******s to my legacy.' Savile's shameless attitude emerged when grilled about accusations he was a psychopath and paedophile, according to The People. Instead of denying the claims, he said: 'Whatever is said after I'm gone is irrelevant'. After being asked if he was 'into little girls', he said: 'I’d rather not even opinionate on this. I’ll leave it to the psychologists to sort out the psychology of child abuse.' He then reportedly joked about the issue, claiming he hated children.","Police estimate of alleged victims trebles from 20 to 60 in less than a week .

"Bryan Smith, 58, pleaded guilty to five offences of unlawfully engaging in consumer credit business, one of money laundering and one of acquiring or using criminal property, namely the proceeds of unlicensed money lending . A loan shark who lent £300,000 at interest rates of up to 255 per cent has walked free from court. Bryan Smith, 58, claimed his customers’ normal repayments, which he charged at around 60 per cent, were far cheaper than those demanded by pay-day loan firms. However, one woman who borrowed £300 had to repay £850 – an APR of 255 per cent. Smith, who began lending when he worked as a TV installer, did not have a consumer credit licence – a legal requirement. He made small loans so clients could buy white goods and other household appliances, Gloucester Crown Court heard. When police and trading standards officers went to his home in April they found almost £24,000 in cash, three diaries and several hundred handwritten A4 sheets of paper detailing the loans. Analysis of his bank account showed his only income appeared to be pension credits of £375 a month. But he was paying his mortgage in cash and rarely withdrew money, said prosecutor Simon Mortimer. ‘He lived his life in the cash economy,’ said Mr Mortimer. Smith was licensed when he began money lending in 2008. However, he did not renew his licence when it expired in 2011 – but continued to lend, going on to agree loans worth £304,330. Customers had no paperwork, making it hard for them to keep track of their debt – and easy for that debt to get out of control. Jeremy Barton, defending, said Smith had a heart condition and simply did not get around to renewing his licence. Mr Barton said a market-leading pay-day firm offered an annual percentage rate of 2,000 per cent, adding: ‘Another has an APR of 5,000 per cent. My client’s charges were less than what is being asked for by regulated, respectable businesses. ‘He is not a well man. He is remorseful and wishes he had given his attention to regularising his business. Smith was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) to 14 months in jail, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 250 hours unpaid work . ‘He loaned money to people in need of it.’ Smith, of Cheltenham, admitted five offences of unlawfully engaging in consumer credit business, one of money laundering and one of acquiring or using criminal property. Jailing him for 14 months, suspended for two years, and ordering him to do 250 hours of unpaid work, Judge William Hart said his rates were exorbitant, but not as high as well-known high street money lenders.","Bryan Smith, 58, loaned more than £300,000 to his customers .

"Dina Asher-Smith’s backpack is sagging under the weight of Early Modern Europe (medieval history) and several other hefty tomes but she bounces up the grand stone staircase at King’s College London, passing a pair of marble statues of the Greek dramatist Sophocles and philosopher Sappho. The 19-year-old remarks excitedly that she chose to study here partly because of the air of consequence in the hallways. The history undergraduate had her pick of universities. A number of establishments tried to woo her to study in the United States because, as well as being a brilliant young academic, Asher-Smith is Britain’s fastest woman and one of the world’s top sprinting talents. Dina Asher-Smith has been juggling her studies with her athletics - both of which she is excelling in . Winning 100 metre gold at the World Junior Championships in Oregon this summer by the biggest margin for 14 years alerted hundreds of university recruiters on the other side of the pond, where sporting prowess is prized above all. Asher-Smith was flattered but chose to remain at her training base in Bromley, south London. ‘Harvard University and Florida State showed interest,’ she says. ‘You get messages and emails from quite a lot of places. 'But I want to do athletics and academics at a high standard and it’s hard to match up the two. At Harvard, athletics training might not be as high a standard as Florida State, where it’s not as good for studies.’ We are talking in the staff room of the Strand campus building after a morning of lectures and before she heads home to write an essay ahead of training at Blackheath and Bromley Athletics Club. Asher-Smith (left) celebrates winning the IAAF World Junior Championships in July and the 19-year-old (right) pictured at a Macmillan Cancer support event in October . Asher-Smith is all smiles as she speaks to Sportsmail about her ambitions on and off the track . ‘Today I did the Protestant Reformation,’ she says, ‘I do medieval history, early modern Europe and the British Empire. I like early modern history best, learning about the ideas of enlightenment and renaissance. ‘The volume of work is insane. I’m here three days a week and we have 200 pages of reading to do for each day. Then I have six training sessions a week. ‘I’m always quite tired, but I knew I had to be a bit more organised than most students. You can’t really afford to just sit there and sleep. 'I’m paying £9,000 a year to be here so I can’t go to a seminar without doing my reading. Even if I don’t say much I want to know what they’re talking about.’ In one incredible day in August, Asher-Smith learned she had achieved the results required to get into King’s, a minimum of three As at A-level — she modestly refuses to reveal the exact results because she doesn’t want to look ‘big headed’. She also set a new British junior 200m record of 22.61sec to get to the final at the European Championships in Zurich. Asher-Smith waves to the crowd at the medal's ceremony for the women's 100m at the IAAF World Junior Championship earlier this year . Her season ended abruptly as she broke down with a hamstring tear coming round the corner in the 200m final, but there was little wallowing time. ‘I couldn’t shed a tear because it was the day after results, I had modules to pick,’ she says. ‘If I’d just had athletics I might have been despairing. ‘Having two focuses you because it puts everything into perspective. Athletics is great but we are entertainers and the industry is fleeting. 'You might be at the top of the country right now, but next year you could be injured or not performing. You’ve got something else to ground you and give you another possibility in life.’ Asher-Smith’s coach John Blackie, who claims she would have broken the junior 200m record again in the final but for her injury, has known Asher-Smith since she was eight. He is happy she has decided to go to university but claims it can take athletes 18 months to get back on track. 'Dina has reduced the potential obstacles by choosing to live at home so there won’t be the issue of diet changing. But there are small things like maybe she used to walk to school and now she doesn’t. Asher-Smith (left) beams after competing in the women's 200 metres at the European Athletics Championships in August, and (right) holds some of her study material while at King's College London . ‘But this mix is definitely right for Dina. She’s very intelligent and needs to be exercising her brain to have that outlet. 'Not to denigrate anyone else, but it’s helpful to have an intelligent athlete because they understand the reasons behind you doing certain things in training.’ Now in the thick of winter training, Asher-Smith has recovered from her hamstring injury and is ‘moving really fast’, according to Blackie. Her 100m personal best of 11.14sec achieved earlier this year puts her fourth on the British all-time list, behind Montell Douglas, Kathy Cook and Laura Turner-Alleyne. Asher-Smith flies the Great Britain flag high on day two of the IAAF World Junior Championships . With plenty of improvement still to be made, there are many who believe she could be Britain’s next big athletics star, including Pace Sports Management, the company which looks after Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, who rushed to add Asher-Smith to their books. No longer a junior, Asher-Smith will focus on the Under 23 and senior championships next season, including the World Championships in Beijing. The Rio Olympics in 2016 is also on the horizon. ‘I set the bar quite high for myself but what other people think and expect goes straight in one ear and out of the other, not to be rude,’ she says, ‘I’m not the same as (Montell or Kathy). I might achieve the same or I might do more . . . ’ As she leaves to catch the bus, Asher-Smith strolls by the faces of notable alumni, including Olympic champion rower Katherine Grainger, printed on the side of the university building. You would not bet against Asher-Smith herself being up there one day.","Dina Asher-Smith is currently Britain's fastest women .

"A German nurse on trial suspected of murdering 150 patients in his care told police after he was arrested: 'I got bored.' Nils. H., 38, is being tried for just three specimen murders by injecting patients with a dangerous medicine. Some of his alleged victims were on the mend, others seriously ill. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said he was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills. Nils. H. (pictured left concealing his face as he arrives for his trial) is being tried for just three specimen murders by injecting patients with a dangerous medicine . According to the prosecution, if the first attempt at resuscitation was a success, H. would sometimes make a second attempt. H., whose full name is withheld under German privacy laws, used Gilurytmal, a medication which should only be used by doctors under strict supervision, it was said. Side effects include an irregular heartbeat, a drop in blood pressure and uncoordinated functioning of the heart muscle. Though H. is facing charges in three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor has said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths. In cooperation with the police, the state prosecutor is currently investigating the deaths of 174 patients who died during H.'s shifts from 2003 to 2005 at a clinic in Delmenhorst, near Bremen. Prosecutors in the district court of Oldenburg said Nils. H. (pictured) was bored and wanted to practice his 'excellent' resuscitation skills . The investigators will also look into deaths at H.'s previous jobs in Oldenburg and Wilhelmshaven and dozens of bodies will have to be exhumed. In 2008, Nils H. was previously sentenced to seven-and-a-half years for the attempted murder of another patient. He gave his patient an overdose of heart medication, though the man narrowly escaped death. The death rate in the Delmenhorst clinic nearly doubled in the time H. worked there, and use of the heart medication also increased dramatically. But it took nearly a decade before an investigation was launched, angering relatives of the dead who are demanding information. Though H. is facing charges in three murders and two attempted murders, the state prosecutor has said he could be involved in more than 150 deaths . A senior doctor who gave evidence in September said H. was a 'passionate medic' who made a good impression on staff at the clinic. But the doctor added: 'I found it strange that he was always on hand when patients were being resuscitated, often helping younger doctors with intubation - inserting a breathing tube into a patient's airways.' 'No one wants to believe that a colleague would rather kill patients, instead of helping them,' said Erich Joester, a lawyer for the clinic. He said that the increased death rate had been attributed to a number of causes rather than a rogue individual. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","German nurse Nils.

"Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that his Department of Justice will focus on a 'bias reduction and procedural fairness' program in the wake of mob riots touched off when a grand jury refused to indict a white police officer for the self-defense killing of a black 18-year-old who had attacked him. The DOJ, Holder said during a six-minute speech, has two separate investigations underway – one into the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown at the hands of Ferguson, Missouri policeman Darren Wilson, and another into the Ferguson Police Department. 'The department's investigations will continue to be thorough, they will continue to be independent, and they remain ongoing,' he said. 'They will be conducted rigorously and in a timely manner.' Following a night of flame-engulfed stores, looted inventories and first-responders fleeing gunfire, Holder said his agency's chief goal would be to 'restore trust, to rebuild understanding and to restore cooperation between law enforcement and community members.' Scroll down for video . TWO INVESTIGATIONS: Holder said the DOJ is investigating both the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown and the Ferguson Police Department's handling of the case, hinting that hsi agency is looking for evidence of racial bias . 'Disappointed': A restrained Holder spoke Tuesday about anti-race-bias efforts but had no harsh condemnation for rioters and looters . The shooting, he declared, 'has revealed, I think, a deep distrust between some in the Ferguson community and its police force.' Holder said five hours of lawlessness left him 'disappointed that some members of the community resorted to violence rather than respecting what I felt were the truly heartfelt words of Michael Brown, Sr. and the wishes that he expressed about how he wanted his son's memory to be honored – with nonviolence.' The elder Brown had said Monday afternoon as a grand jury decision seemed near that he wanted his son's death 'to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone.' 'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' he said. Brown, along with the slain teen's stepfather Lesley McSpadden, issued a statement after the 'no-bill' decision was returned. ''While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change,' they said. 'We respectfully ask that you please keep your protests peaceful,' the two added, while asking for a renewed emphasis on the need for law enforcement officers to have body-worn cameras while on patrol. 'Answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction,' they said. But hours earlier McSpadden was videotaped towering above a sea of protesters as they realized Wilson would not face prosecution. 'Burn this b***h down!' he shouted multiple times. Holder did not mention that remark. On Air Force One, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters Tuesday afternoon en route to Chicago that President Barack Obama and his aides 'are all deeply worried and disappointed – and concerned . about the violence, any sort of violence, and that's why the . president went out and spoke about it last night.' Obama's nine minutes of remarks were played nationally on cable news channels whose split-screen broadcasts juxtaposed his plea for calm with real-time pictures of a city in flames. But 'again I would remind you,' Schultz said, 'the vast majority of protests in . Missouri and around the country were peaceful and constructive.' CHAOS: Ferguson, Missouri became a war zone on Monday night as angry protesters fired shots, set fires, destroyed police cars and looted businesses all night . 'A NATION OF COWARDS': Holder famously rendered that judgment about Americans' attitudes toward race, and the Ferguson shooting has put inner-city racial animus back on the front burner . In Washington, Holder pledged to work toward 'isolating the criminal element from peaceful protesters' in Ferguson and in other communities where African-Americans believe largely-white police forces are stacked against them. 'The reality is that what we see in Ferguson is not restricted to Ferguson,' he said. 'There are other communities around the country that have these same issues that have to be dealt with.' Holder also praised Ferguson residents who risked their lives to intervene in attempts to stop looters and arsonists on Monday. They 'are in fact heroes, to my mind,' he said. He also plugged the DOJ's 'Building Communities of Trust' program, a new effort aiming for 'bias reduction and procedural fairness' in police departments nationwide. 'Our focus will be national in scope and appeal,' he pledged.","Eric Holder, the outgoing US attorney general, sidestepped lingering questions about whether Michael Brown's stepfather set off a night of arson and looting with his 'burn this b***h down!' screams .

"The mayor of Calais yesterday begged David Cameron to come to France and tell migrants that Britain is no El Dorado. Natacha Bouchart also repeated her threat to blockade the town’s port to make the UK change its ‘generous’ welfare and asylum policy. ‘Everyone who comes to Calais, comes because they believe they will be looked after if they get to Britain,’ said the tough-talking politician. Scroll down for video . Showdown: Natacha Bouchart demanded David Cameron come to Calais to deliver an ultimatum to migrants . ‘Under British rules they get free accommodation, they can work on the black market easily and they are given money. ‘For poor people from Africa this is very attractive. Britain is too soft on migrants. ‘I demand that David Cameron comes to Calais and gives the migrants a strong message that Britain is not an El Dorado.’ Migrants – many from Eritrea – began their attempts to overwhelm the ferry terminal last month. French authorities believe they keep trying because they know of friends who have reached Britain. Mrs Bouchart said the number of migrants in Calais was intolerable and the town was suffering alone. ‘Britain is ignoring us,’ she added. ‘No one has ever come to visit, no one answers my letters. We are fed up with the British attitude. ‘If the UK government does not listen I will block the port. We are 75,000 people. If we all go to the port together we can block it. ‘This is illegal but is it fair to leave us as we are?’ Shock: Footage yesterday showed a huge crowd of men attempting to storm a cross-channel ferry at the port . Mrs Bouchart also demanded the dismantling of Britain’s border control at Calais and financial compensation for the cost to the town of the immigration crisis. She said: ‘If we move the border back to Dover you [the UK] will have to deal with the problem of migrants.’ Mrs Bouchart wants to open a Sangatte-style centre in Calais providing shelter, food and information on asylum to migrants determined to reach the UK. And yesterday she repeated her call for welcome centres across France giving migrants advice on claiming asylum in Britain. Jean-Marc Puissesseau of the Calais Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which runs the port, said: ‘The situation is unacceptable, the port is under siege.’ Yesterday hundreds of migrants at a sprawling camp close to the port vowed to reach Britain, or die trying. Almaz, 23, from Eritrea, said: ‘Every night I try to get into a truck going to England. Chaos: The moment was also caught on film by lorry driver Mark Salt, who said: 'There's loads of them' ‘I have been arrested by the police many times, beaten and had gas sprayed into my face. But I will get to England or die trying.’ Mustafa, 24, also from Eritrea, said: ‘I have lived through a year of hell to get this far. ‘I am not going to stop now. I have crossed the desert, been jailed in Libya and crossed the sea to Italy in a small boat. ‘But I will forget it all when I get to England. I will be safe and free.’ Last night there were growing calls for action from British politicians. ‘We need to strengthen our border force at Calais,’ said Philip Hollobone, Tory MP for Kettering. ‘And we need to stop these people before they reach Calais and before they reach the UK.’ One 24-year-old living near the port, who gave his name as Mustafa and said he was from Eritrea, said: 'I have lived through a year of hell to get this far. I am not going to stop now. I have crossed the desert and been jailed' French authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift camps and squats in and around the town. The number of migrants found hidden in vehicles in Calais in 2014 is expected to reach 30,000. The influx dramatically increased earlier this year when the crisis in Libya allowed migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan to reach Europe from the North African coast. Armed gangs fight pitched battles for control of the best vantage points from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover. The worsening security situation has led haulage firms to advise drivers to avoid Calais. But migrants are now targeting other Channel ports too.","Natacha Bouchart said migrants to UK 'can work on the black market easily'

"Dianne Parr was left paralysed on the operating table - having been given no anaesthetic . A woman who went in to hospital for routine dental surgery has described the hell of being left paralysed on the operating table - having been given no anaesthetic. Dianne Parr had been admitted to have two teeth extracted after developing abscesses. The nature of the operation meant she had to be given drugs to paralyse her entire body. But a breakdown in communication between doctors meant the general anaesthetic she also required was not given properly. By the time she realised she had no pain relief, she was powerless to move or scream for help. Mrs Parr says the 40-minute experience was so horrific she feared she would die of a heart attack on the operating table. Fully awake - but with her eyes taped shut and with no pain relief - she listened in horror as she heard surgeon asking for the scalpel. As it cut into her gum, she passed out with what she assumed was shock. Telling her story on ITV's This Morning, she said: 'It was supposed to be a routine procedure. I had a couple of abscesses on my lower jaw and needed two teeth extracted.' Because the procedure was urgent, her dentist referred her to her then local hospital in Yorkshire. 'I was assured it was a standard day case and I'd be home by the evening. 'In fact, it was a catalogue of errors,' she told presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden. Minutes before going into theatre, the anaesthetist had administered something into a tube in the back of her hand and she felt a woozy, relaxed feeling wash over her. 'I began to feel floaty, but then I was aware of being wheeled into theatre,' she said. 'I thought ""I'm not asleep"", but at the same time I couldn't move - or see. 'Then I heard the surgeon approach the table and ask the nurse for a metal clamp to keep my mouth open.' She screamed - but paralysed by muscle-relaxing drugs, she made no sound. 'I could feel the surgeon leaning over me and push down on my body before pulling up. At this point, he realised her tooth was cracked and coming out in pieces. 'That was when he asked for the scalpel,' she recalled. 'It felt as if my tooth was coming out of my foot, not my mouth. A searing pain shot up my body.' Mrs Parr, from St Teath, Cornwall, added: 'I heard the surgeon declare: ""It's a toughie"". Using every fibre of strength in her body, she desperately tried to get the surgeon's attention. The nature of the operation meant Mrs Parr had to be given drugs to paralyse her entire body. But a breakdown in communication between doctors meant the general anaesthetic she also required was not given properly, she told  presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden . 'He was standing over my right side and I thought if I could just move my right arm to touch him, he would instantly know I was awake. 'I thought I was going to die - not because of the pain, but the fear. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.' Worryingly, had observations of her pulse and blood pressure been done during the operation - in accordance with the Royal College of Anaesthetists' guidelines - staff would have realised what was going on. But Mrs Parr, now 50, later discovered not all the observation equipment in theatre was working properly - hence her horrific situation went unnoticed. It also later emerged that the anaesthetist had administered only a dose of atracurium - a commonly used muscle relaxant. This was because her mouth needed to be clamped open to extract her teeth. Professor Michael Wang, a clinical psychologist at the the University of Leicester,  counselled Mrs Parr for months after her ordeal. He estimates between 50 and 80 per cent of patients who are awake during surgery suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. It is, he says, similar to being tortured. 'Anaesthesia awareness has caused some of the most severe cases of post-traumatic stress disorder I have seen,' he said. He added it does not matter whether the operation is a major or minor one. Mrs Parr told This Morning: 'I initially assumed I must have fainted on the operating table. 'But Professor Wang says it is common for the brain to erase extremely traumatic images and events such as this.' The anaesthetist had assumed, wrongly, that because it was a dental operation, the surgeon would apply a local anaesthetic to the mouth. The surgeon, however, drafted in at the last minute because of a list change, had assumed Mrs Parr had already been given a full general anaesthetic. After 37 minutes, the operation ended and she was given another injection to reverse the relaxant. 'I shot up, desperate to get the ventilator tube out of my throat - I just wanted to gag. I was trying to rip it out. 'As soon as it was out, I screamed ""I don't know what you think you were doing, but I was awake the whole time"". A hospital inquiry found the anaesthetist negligent and she received a £15,000 out-of-court settlement for the incident in 2002. But the mother-of-one said the experience had changed her life forever. 'I changed from an outgoing, laid back person into a woman angry with the whole world,' she said. 'Thankfully my family, my husband Tim, they have all been incredible. I was just in pieces. 'All the time I was on that operating table, thinking they were my last minutes, I was thinking of them. 'I pictured Tim's face, my daughter Dawn's face. Tim is a massive Beatles fan - and we sing together - so I was trying to to remember the words of songs. Anything to take my mind off the pain.' Earlier this month, shocking results from a study led by Royal College of Anaesthetists and Association of Anaesthetists were made public. But Mrs Parr, now 50, later discovered not all the observation equipment in theatre was working properly - hence her horrific situation went unnoticed. The research revealed that 150 people a year in the UK and Ireland report they have been conscious during surgery  - despite being given general anaesthesia. Around six million general anaesthetics are administered in the UK each year. According to the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCA), between one and two people in 1,000 experience some degree of anaesthetic awareness. 'Anaesthesia is a scientific balancing act,' said Dr Keith Myerson, an RCA spokesman and a consultant anaesthetist. 'You have to try to ensure pain relief and loss of consciousness while minimising the side-effects of the drugs, such as a reduced supply of oxygen to the blood and the brain. 'But anaesthetists are highly skilled and while incidents of awareness do happen, they are extremely rare.'","Dianne Parr had gone into hospital to have two teeth extracted .

"These pictures show hundreds of thousands of pounds of gold jewellery that police have recovered over the last six years. The haul, which has been recovered from across London, has been valued at £510,000 and detectives are hoping to reunite the valuables with their owners. There is an array of Asian gold rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches - many of which are believed to have been taken as a result of handbag thefts. Asian gold jewellery is often bought as it is seen as the safest way to store wealth as it keeps its value better than property, currency and other investments. Gold worth a total of £510,000 has been seized from thefts across London . Most of the gold is believed to have been taken from people's handbags . The pieces of jewellery have been snatched since 2007 and were seized by officers from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Detective Constable Stewart Walker said: 'It's an impressive haul which had been built up over many years through handbag thefts in the London area. 'We believe the hoard of gold was intended to be used by the offenders as a pension pot, allowing the criminals to continue to fund their lavish lifestyle for many years to come. 'We would now like to reunite as many items of jewellery with their rightful owners as possible.' Thieves often take advantage of Asian households during religious celebrations when the jewellery is more likely to be out. Tahir Maher, from Earley, Reading, last year spoke about the crime in the Thames Valley area. He said: 'I know someone who lost close to £50,000 of jewellery. Another lady whose only savings were her jewellery, went out shopping, came back and found she had lost everything. Ornate necklaces, rings and bracelets were among the haul retrieved under the Proceeds of Crime Act . These bracelets were found with gold pens by Kent and Essex serious crime directorate . 'With us it started during Ramadan when a lot of people were going to each others' houses to break the fast, and then going to prayers the houses were empty and it was a prime target for jewellery. 'People get dressed up for Eid or parties they are being invited to and put their jewellery on, so they get the jewellery out, you leave it about. The police said the thieves can go through your house in and out in 14 minutes.' Thefts have increased as the price of gold has rocketed in recent years, going up as much as 14 per cent in 2011 to about £1,133 an ounce. Although jewellery shops are supposed to keep a log of transactions and ask people selling gold for their ID, some unscrupulous ones do not follow the rules, according to DCI Brown. He said: 'An unscrupulous jeweller can buy gold worth £20,000 for about £4,000 if it’s stolen. Some gold has been returned but now police want to reunite the rest of the jewellery with its owners . Jewellers have also been the victims themselves of thieves, with attacks carried out on several of Slough’s 33 shops selling gold. Another problem facing households with large amounts of valuable gold jewellery is the scarcity of deposit boxes in banks. Coun Maher said 'When robberies were happening last summer gold was ridiculously high, my parents’ generation, any spare cash they had they would put into buying gold, and this would be an investment. 'One bank, when we pressurised them, allowed us a deposit box, but then it filled up within days.'","Police hope to reunite the jewellery with its owners after thefts in London .
Among stolen jewellery are rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches .
Theft of Asian gold increases around the time of religious celebrations ."
"A siege ended yesterday with police marksmen shooting dead a man who was holding a knife to his lover’s throat. He had been keeping the woman hostage after smashing his way into her garden flat. A hostage negotiator was brought in to try to persuade the 40-year-old knifeman to come out of the basement property. Scroll down for video . Guard: The knifeman was shot dead inside the basement flat of the property on leafy Sheperton Road . Forensic experts were seen coming and going from the property yesterday morning after he was shot dead . Crime scene: Armed officers shot a 40-year-old man dead in Shepperton Road (pictured) in Islington after he broke into a house and threatened a woman with a knife . Police had sent a negotiator and armed officers to the scene at 11.19pm yesterday following reports the man had broken into a house . Forensics wearing protective suits (left) have arrived at the scene yesterday morning as an investigation gets underway while police remain on guard . But the talks broke down and, fearing for the woman’s life, the officers opened fire. Police and paramedics immediately tried to resuscitate the man but he died 20 minutes later on his way to hospital. Last night neighbours in Islington, North London, asked why the knifeman could not be Tasered or even overpowered by the dozens of officers at the scene. The independent police watchdog is also examining what contact, if any, police had with the couple before the shooting. A pair of shoes could be seen on a window ledge at the house, which has been surrounded by blue and red police tape . The man and woman involved are believed to have known each other, police said, and there was not believed to be anybody else in the house at the time . The incident unfolded on Shepperton Road in Islington, London, which is lined with pretty Georgian houses . The drama began shortly after 11pm on Thursday when neighbours dialled 999 to report the man had broken into the flat. Officers arrived to discover he was armed with a knife and apparently holding the woman hostage inside. Residents said the street was transformed into a ‘war zone’ with dozens of police cars and specialist marksmen dressed in black and wearing earpieces. Neighbours heard the woman screaming repeatedly and refusing to allow police inside as the man swore and shouted ‘stop pointing that light at me’ at police. The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards were informed of the incident 'immediately' and attended the scene, a police spokesman said . Neighbours said they heard 'four or five' bangs before seeing police vehicles and ambulances descended on the scene . Forensic investigators have been examining the rear of the Georgian terraced property where bandages and first aid wrappers could be seen on the ground . A negotiator was brought in and sat on the garden wall – just yards from the flat’s front window – making contact by telephone. But the man grew increasingly angry, shouting at police to ‘get the f*** out of here’. Neighbours felt he was drunk or had taken drugs. At 1am – after a period of relative quiet – a volley of up to five gunshots, ‘like fireworks’, was heard as armed officers stormed inside. Eyewitnesses said stun grenades were used. City worker Lyssa Barber said: ‘I was woken up to shouts and immediately afterwards to what sounded like four or five bangs. They were gunshots. Investigation: The road was cordoned off while the two-hour stand-off unfolded overnight . Deadly force: A number of shots were fired during the incident at around 1am and the 40-year-old knifeman died 20 minutes later while on route to the hospital . The woman involved in the two-hour siege was not harmed during the ordeal but is being treated for shock. Forensics are continuing to investigate today . ‘I heard five gunshots, but a gunshot in real life doesn’t sound like it does on TV. It sounded like loud bangs on a door.’ Another resident said: ‘He sounded angry, his voice was that of someone from the East End. He must have been high on drugs or drink to be so angry. ‘I got up to make a cup of tea and suddenly I heard a gunshot, it was a cracking noise. My boyfriend shouted “get down” and we crouched on the floor. ‘There was a pause then there were three more gunshots. Afterwards I went to the window and I saw smoke billowing. ‘I could see paramedics leading him out the house on a stretcher. They were doing CPR but I could see it wasn’t working, he was already dead.’ A forensic officer ducks under some of the police tape near the scene as investigations gathered pace yesterday morning . The man's next of kin have yet to be informed. Police say he is a 40 year old black man, thought to be born in Islington . The terrified woman was taken away by paramedics wrapped in a bright pink blanket and treated for shock. She is believed to be a 56-year-old mother-of-two who moved into the local authority flat six months ago. She worked for a tool hire company until recently. Kenneth Seddon, 82, who has lived in the road for 40 years, said he helped the woman move in. He said: ‘She has a little Yorkie dog she walks twice a day in the park. I don’t think she was in work. I felt a bit sorry for her. She was a bit vulnerable.’ Police have descended on the leafy road, near Islington's fashionable Upper Street . Neighbours said police cordoned off the street last night and were stopping some residents from returning to their homes . Speaking about her boyfriend, he said he often saw them drinking and dancing inside the flat which had recently been refitted by the council. Yesterday, the scene of the shooting, opposite a large nursery school, remained sealed off for forensic examination. Commander Neil Basu, of the Met, said the shooting will be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and professional standards officers. ‘These events do demonstrate the challenging nature of the work that our firearms officers – and all our officers – have to perform on a daily basis,’ he said. Scotland Yard confirmed the drama was not caught on body-worn video cameras. They are being rolled out among firearms officers after the controversy that followed the shooting of gangster Mark Duggan more than three years ago. Retired Met firearms officer Roger Gray said: ‘They would have been forced to act very, very quickly. Split-second decisions.’","A 40-year-old man has been shot dead by Scotland Yard firearms officers .

"Ed Miliband was today accused on live TV of being out of ‘touch with reality’ after underestimating his family's weekly food shopping bill. The Labour leader, who has attacked the government over the cost of living, claimed he spent around £70 or £80 a week on groceries. But he appeared taken aback when told the average bill for a family of four is more than £100, as he claimed his £140,000 salary meant he was ‘relatively comfortably off’. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband appeared taken aback as he was challenged about the cost of a weekly shop . Mr Miliband was put on the spot on ITV's Good Morning Britain about whether he understood times were tough . Mr Miliband admitted he was 'relatively comfortably off' but insisted he could still tackle the problems the country faces . Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband claimed the ‘cost-of-living crisis is the biggest issue that our country faces and I am determined we tackle it’. But . he was put on the spot about how much it really costs to feed a family . of four. Asked about the average weekly household grocery bill, Mr . Miliband responded: ‘It depends on how much you are spending.’ Pressed . on his own family's bill, Mr Miliband said: ‘We probably spend £70, £80 . a week on groceries at least, probably more than that. ‘The . point is that different families will have different costs that they . face but what I am clear about is that there is a crisis facing so many . people.’ But TV presenter Susannah Reid took him to task for appearing out of touch. She . told him: ‘The average weekly bill for a family of four is more than . £100. So you are going to be spending significantly more than £70 or . £80. ‘People . will say one of the problems with politicians is they are actually . talking about something but not in touch with reality.’ ITV presenter Susannah Reid suggested Mr Miliband's answer showed he was 'not in touch with reality' Inflation rose for the first time in 10 months in April, stalling hopes for a pick-up in real terms wages. The . Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation ticked up to 1.8 per . cent after hitting a four-year low of 1.6 per cent the month before, the . Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Latest . figures show annual wage increases were stuck at 1.7 per cent meaning a . hoped-for sustained period of pay rising faster than the cost of living . has yet to materialise. Today's . widely-expected inflation figure still means it has been at or below . the Bank of England's 2 per cent target for five months in succession - . with the rate expected to remain low for some time. But it ends a period over which CPI fell for six straight months. Mr Miliband earns £139,000 as leader of the opposition, and his wife Justine is reported to earn £200,000-a-year as a lawyer. The couple live in a £2million family home in north London with their sons Daniel and Samuel. But . Mr Miliband insisted he understood how people were struggling: ‘Sure, . lots of people are facing real struggles and I’m relatively comfortably . off but what l know is that there are deep issues that need to be . tackled and we’re determined to tackle them.’ He went on to admit that he does not face a cost of living crisis himself. ‘I . don’t but I can deal with it and I can tackle it and I am determined we . do and I recognise it as I go around the country and I see the . difficulties people are facing and that is what I hear and that’s what I . am determined to tackle.’ Mr . Miliband later admitted that his shopping estimate may have been on the . low side, saying he had been thinking of the bill for 'basic . groceries'. Speaking . on BBC Radio Oxford, the Labour leader said: 'Well, I said this morning . it was on the basic groceries, the basic fruit and vegetables, about . £70 or £80 - the total shopping bill was slightly higher than that, . obviously. 'On the basics, I was saying it was about £70 or £80 but the overall shopping bill would obviously be higher.' A . Tory source said: 'It’s the same old economic incompetence from the . Labour party that gave Britain the biggest peacetime deficit in history. 'They have no long-term plan to fix the economy and Ed Miliband can’t even get the numbers right for his political gimmicks.' The blunder is a fresh setback for Labour’s cost of living campaign, particularly on the sofa of an ITV show aimed at mothers. Labour was ridiculed for this advert attacking a VAT rise which included fruit and vegetables which are not covered by VAT . Mr Miliband has repeatedly attacked the government for its policies, which he claims have left people worse off. But the party faced ridicule for an attack ad which claimed a VAT rise to 20 per cent had added £450 to the average bill. It featured pictures of fruit and vegetables which are not covered by VAT, raising doubts about who signed it off for public release. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who is in charge of the party’s economic policy, distanced himself from the advert. ‘Look, these campaigns are busy times and there’s always lots of things going on…’ Mr Balls said.","Labour leader put on the spot on live TV about what his family's spending .

"Tens of thousands of young children are suffering from rotting teeth caused by drinking fruit juice and squash, a major study has revealed. As many as one in eight children have suffered tooth decay by the age of three – although in some parts of England the rates are as high as a third. Senior dentists say the problem is often caused by well-meaning parents giving toddlers sugar-laden drinks in bottles and beakers. They are now urging families to restrict children to milk and water. Scroll down for video . Middle-class parents who buy expensive organic juices in the belief they are healthier have been warned they can contain as much sugar as a glass of coke. One health official observed: ‘Posh sugar is no better than any other sugar.’ Earlier this year health officials urged the public to cut their sugar intake to between five and seven teaspoons a day to prevent rising levels of obesity and rotting teeth. A 200ml glass of organic apple juice contains 20 grams of sugar – nearly five teaspoons – only slightly less than the same amount of coke, which has 22 grams. Experts, including the chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, have called for a tax to be slapped on sugary drinks to deter the public from buying them. In the first study of its kind, officials at Public Health England – a Government agency – examined the teeth of a sample of 53,640 three-year-olds at nursery schools. They found an average of 12 per cent – one in eight – had tooth decay ranging from small holes, needing fillings or having teeth extracted. If the trend is repeated across England, then nearly 85,000 three-year-olds have rotten teeth. Leicester has the highest rates, with 34 per cent of three-year-olds having rotten teeth. Others included the relatively affluent boroughs of Hillingdon, West London, at 25 per cent, and Charnwood in Leicestershire at 29 per cent. Sandra White, director of dental health for Public Health England, said: ‘The biggest culprit is fruit juice. Organic apple juice sounds healthy on the packet, but actually it’s packed with sugar. Sweets for my sweet: A single glass of orange juice packs a whopping 30.4g of sugar . ‘Posh sugar is no better than any other sugar. ‘Parents think they are doing good, but fruit juice needs to be restricted to one small glass a day. ‘Our key advice for under three is just have water and milk, that way they won’t get a taste for the sweeter liquids that cause decay.’ Many parents give children fruit juice or squash in bottles and beakers to comfort them or before bed. They may suck them for hours on end – with the sugar slowly eroding their teeth. Officials say if children must have juice it should be from a cup which is drunk quickly, causing minimal harm to their teeth. Although the decay affects children’s milk teeth, which fall out naturally, experts say it also harms their gums making them more prone to infection in adulthood. This is the first time such a survey has been carried out so it is impossible to know if the problem is getting worse. But NHS figures published in July showed the number of children being admitted to hospital with tooth decay had risen by 14 per cent in three years. Dr Christopher Allen, chairman of the British Dental Association’s dental public health committee, said: ‘Parents may feel that giving sugar-sweetened drinks is comforting, but in reality it’s more likely to cause pain and suffering as it is the major cause of tooth decay in toddlers.’","In some English regions as many as a third of children have rotten teeth .

"Some armed with swords, some carrying hockey sticks, defiant Sikhs stood guard outside their temples last night. More then 700 men, some in their 80s, took to the streets to protect the homes, businesses and places of worship in Southall, West London. The residents rallied together in a show of unity against looters echoed in other parts of the country as ordinary Britons attempted to reclaim the streets. Resistance: Dozens of Sikhs stage a display of defiance against the rioters outside London's largest temple in Southall yesterday . 'Protection': A large group gathers on the streets of Eltham as crowds form intent on warding off looters in London . On patrol: The Met Police have been forced to warn people against forms of vigilante justice following the crowds of people forming intent on 'protecting the streets' Pictures of the crowds emerged as the Met Police today urged the public against forming groups intent on vigilante justice. Many of those who gathered in the late night public patrols had done so after becoming frustrated by the lack of police response to the riots. A survey of British adults has revealed that one in three would support the police's use of live ammunition on rioters. The poll of over 2,500 adults also . showed that nine out of ten Britons believe police should be able to use . water cannons to deal with the growing unrest. The YouGov survey for the Sun showed widespread support for the various police tactics available. Over three quarters 77 per cent) of those surveyed also support using the army ho help deal with the situation. And worryingly for the government, over half (57 per cent) think David Cameron has handled the riots badly. A massive 85 per cent are also convinced that the majority of rioters will go unpunished. It was only on Monday night that police tactics changed and armoured vehicles called Jankels were used to disperse the crowds. Large groups gathered in . Enfield, north London, and Eltham, south east London, last night and joined . police in patrolling the streets. One video filmed in Enfield shows a huge crowd surge through the streets near the London suburb's Southbury Road station. But while many pictures this week have shown crowds clashing with police in destructive stand-offs, the video clearly shows officers and crowds running in the same direction in a bid to ward off looters. However, Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh told Sky News: 'What I don't need is these so-called vigilantes, who appeared to have been drinking too much and taking policing resources away from what they should have been doing - which is preventing the looting. 'These are small pockets of people. They're frustrated, they're angry, and that's totally understandable. 'The sadness of those images through the night and the night before last will affect everyone. 'But the support that we need is to allow those officers to prevent looting and prevent crime. 'I have personally spoken to members of our community and business owners, who have lost their livelihoods. I want communities to engage with us, and support us. 'We have seen some outstanding acts of courage, youth workers, community leaders, teachers and alike taking to the streets with our officers to stop those people out there from breaking the law and persuading them to go home. 'Ironically, when you see those images with no police available, the police are now having to go and do the vigilantes as well as the other problems that they've got. That needs to stop. Not in our town: Large groups of people run through Enfield, north London intent on 'protecting the streets' from rioters . Reclaiming the streets: The group made their way through Enfield flanked by police officers during the late night patrol . David Cameron's statement today praised 'the best of Britain' who have cleaned up looted towns and pledged to support the Met Police. The Prime Minister described society as 'broken and sick' before giving the go-ahead for police to use water cannons on rioters. Mr Cameron also used his speech to highlight the 'big problem with gangs in our country'. He said that 'nothing is off the table' when it comes to options for restoring law and order. Mr Cameron said: We have seen the worst of Britain but I also believe we have seen some of the best of Britain: the million people who have signed up on Facebook to support the police; communities coming together in the clean-up operations.' The Facebook group 'Supporting the Met Police against the London rioters' had just just under 900,000 members on Wednesday lunchtime. 'I do not support vigilantism and we do not want to see more violence on our streets. I would urge everyone to remain calm.' One of those involved in the Enfield . patrol, Nick Davidson, told Sky News: 'We've had enough of the police . just standing there... while people are looting and ruining the whole . area. 'Everybody here pays tax and we've all had enough of it. We're sickened by the police doing absolutely nothing. 'They're not policing our streets, we have to police them.' One . man in his 20s, who would not give his name said: 'We won't stand for . it. If anyone wants to come down here and start looting tonight, let . them try - we'll be ready for them. 'We're here to protect the town. What went on last night was a disgrace. It shouldn't be allowed.' In Southall, the locals rallied to . keep the rioters at bay following reports of a planned attack on the . area. It is just a few miles from Ealing, which was targeted on Monday . night. Each of the Sikh temples was guarded by around 200 men. Amarjit Singh Klair from nearby Hounslow, who helped rally the men, said: ‘We are working along side the police, they’re doing what they can but they are stretched. ‘Why shouldn’t we defend our homes, businesses and places of worship? This is our area. There’s lots of talk about it kicking off here. But we’re ready for them.’ Hooded youths could be seen scouting the area but appear to be have frightened off. Only a handful of police could be seen patrolling the area. The Sikh community were running a military style operation to protect themselves after almost 100 rioters tried to attack the heart of the area early on Tuesday. With few police around, elders at London’s largest Sikh temple in Havelock Road resorted to telephoning male worshippers for help. Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Should BlackBerry Messenger be banned after 'inciting' the riots? Now share your opinion . Last night groups of Sikh men stood guard at different parts of the town, keeping in touch via their mobiles.

"Almost 60 Australians are fighting for the Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria, according to the Federal Government. Attorney-General George Brandis has warned radical Australians fighting abroad is the greatest domestic security problem in many years. 'This is the government's number-one national security priority,' he told Sky News on Tuesday night. Scroll down for video . Senator George Brandis says there are 58 Australians fighting for Islamic radicals in Iraq and Syria . Senator Brandis said the latest intelligence reports indicate about 58 Australians were fighting in Syria and Iraq. But he said about 150 Australians were being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight. Senator Brandis will meet with six imams on Wednesday morning to discuss cooperation on curbing the radicalisation of young men. His comments come just days after Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir disappeared, believed to be on his way to Iraq. About 150 Australians were also being monitored for supporting terrorist organisations, recruiting fighters or preparing to travel overseas to fight . It is thought he had been brainwashed into making the trip after watching Jihadist recruitment videos posted online. One such video was released almost two weeks ago by the extreme terrorist group, Insurgent group Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (ISIL) - also known as ISIS. Sydney's Abdullah Elmir is the third Australian teenager believed to have taken off to Iraq this month . It featured Australians calling on their fellow countrymen to join them in their fight in Syria and Iraq. About two weeks ago, Abdullah told his parents he was going fishing, but never returned. The 17-year-old is the third Australian teenager to walk out on his family this month bound for Iraq. So far, 10 Australians have died in Syria and Iraq. The latest being a 22-year-old Sydney man, Zakaria Raad, who appeared in a recruitment video for terrorist group The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) shortly before being ambushed in Syria. Australians involved in extremist activity have been warned by Prime Minister Tony Abbott that the Government would crackdown on home-grown terrorists. 'The Government that stopped the boats will stop the jihadists,' he said. Mr Abbott said while there would be no new invasion of Iraq to quell the violence in the country's north, Australia would re-double its efforts to protect its national security.","Attorney General George Brandis says there are 58 Australians fighting .

"The U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division is paying $544,000 for a shiny new LinkedIn profile, in the wake of a partial government shutdown that followed a top Democrat's assurance that 'the cupboard is bare, there's no more cuts to make.' While Congress was wrangling in December over how many billions to trim from future budgets, Washington bureaucrats were spending like teenagers with their first credit cards. According to the 'Google for government' website FedBizOpps.gov, the federal government has issued more than 1,300 procurement contracts since the beginning of December, including six-figure outlays for valet parking, portable toilets, expensive lamps, and special boxes to ship fruit flies from one government facility to another. The DOJ Criminal Division will soon have a new LinkedIn page complete with an easier way to attract job-seekers -- who could presumably find USAjobs.gov if they were motivated . Anchors aweigh! Marines will be able to go anywhere -- literally -- now that the government has requisitioned an expensive set of porta-potties . 'More awesome, less suck' -- the firm contracted to publish the government's flagship environmental science journal is a specialist in social media targeting female consumers . The LinkedIn contract, first reported in the Washington Free Beacon, includes 'Work With Us' banner ads and 'gold'-level user pages commonly purchased by private companies, all designed to drive job-seekers to Attorney General Eric Holder's law enforcement agency. The DOJ provided its contractor, the Reston, Virginia-based Carahsoft Technology Corporation, with a not-so-helpful table of prices for LinkedIn's services, in which all the costs were listed as $0. The agency contracting officer responsible for the award did not respond to a request for an explanation. Uncle Sam is also busily spending on other projects, from portable toilets to valet parking. The Department of Veterans Affairs green-lighted $450,000 for valet parking at VA Palo Alto Health Care System buildings in California. Broken Xerox machines at the Department of Labor will keep cranking this year, thanks to a $252,000 copier repair contract with a Minneola, New York company.

The Bureau of Prisons is spending $68,000 on disposable, biodegradable food trays to feed inmates. The Treasury Department's Bureau of Printing and Engraving must be shredding a lot of worn-out currency, judging from the $791,000 contract it issued last month for hauling away trash and recyclables in Texas. Which lamps will the Department of the Navy buy? The $498,000 purchase order doesn't say . And the Department of Agriculture has agreed to spend more than $284,000 on an order for 5,400 shipping boxes to send fruit flies across the country from one facility to another. 'Each box consists of one (1) Fruit Fly Shipper, one (1) Fruit Fly Shipper Liner, two (2) Fruit Fly Scored Pads, two (2) Level Stands, two (2) Level Separators, and one (1) Top Level Separator,' according to the contract.' The finished boxes are to be delivered to the government's 'fruit fly production facility' in Waimanalo, Hawaii. In California, the Department of the Navy is set to pay $409,000 for portable toilets at the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command in the town of Twentynine Palms. The contract is 106 pages long. The same agency is spending $498,000 on lamps, and sending $196,000 to Lockheed Martin for '8GB flash memory' – thumb drives – and other computer parts. The most expensive contract among those MailOnline flagged from December was an $11 million outlay from the EPA for a company to publish Environmental Health Perspectives, the agency's academic journal. Arrive for that x-ray in style: The Veterans Affairs Department will shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for valet parking attendants at California hospitals . How much does a recruitment ad on LinkedIn cost? Don't ask the Justice Department -- it appears to think they're free . Federal prisoners are eating off of these disposable and biodegradable food trays -- instead of something that can be washed and reused -- judging from one 68,000 contract . The Michigan company that won the contract, Brogan & Partners Advertising Consultancy, advertises itself online as an expert in social media marketing to women with the tagline, 'More awesome, less suck.' Environmental Health Perspectives was accused in 2012 of participating in a human-experimentation study that exposed 41 people to airborne particles that the EPA says can cause death just hours after exposure. One subject was taken to the hospital after experiencing hart trouble during the experiment.

"U.S. Soccer is standing by its decision to allow goalkeeper Hope Solo to continue to play while she faces domestic violence charges. Solo is charged with two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault in Washington state stemming from a June 21 altercation with her sister-in-law and 17-year-old nephew at a family gathering. She has pleaded not guilty and the case is scheduled for trial on November 4. She faces up to six months in jail if convicted. Scroll down for video . U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo is facing two misdemeanor charges of domestic assault following the incident . Solo, 32, denies assaulting her 17-year-old nephew and her sister-in-law following an incident on June 21 . Police arrived at the scene after they received reports of a woman who was hitting people . The 32-year-old goalkeeper is also a victim of the celebrity nude photo hacking scandal that has hit other female stars such as Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Watson and Kirsten Dunst. Solo, who has been with the national team since 2000 and recently set the team record for the most clean sheets, continued to play for the United States in exhibition matches and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, following her arrest. U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said Monday the organization will let her play until the legal matter is settled. 'U.S. Soccer takes the issue of domestic violence very seriously. From the beginning, we considered the information available and have taken a deliberate and thoughtful approach regarding Hope Solo's status with the national team,' Gulati said in a statement. 'Based on that information, U.S. Soccer stands by our decision to allow her to participate with the team as the legal process unfolds. If new information becomes available we will carefully consider it.' Solo, left, is married to former NFL star Jerramy Stevens, right, who was arrested before their 2012 wedding . Gulati's statement comes after U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Officer Scott Blackmun said he was disturbed by the charges against Solo. But in a statement to USA Today he did not say whether he believes she should face disciplinary action, such as suspension, before the matter plays out in court. 'The allegations involving Ms. Solo are disturbing and are inconsistent with our expectations of Olympians,' Blackmun said. ' We have had discussions with U.S. Soccer and fully expect them to take action if it is determined that the allegations are true.' Solo is expected to start in goal for the U.S. women when the team plays next month in the CONCACAF championship, which will be played in four U.S. cities with the final scheduled for October 26 at PPL Park in Pennsylvania. The event serves as a qualifying event for next summer's Women's World Cup in Canada. According to the court documents in the abuse case, Solo's 17-year-old nephew told police Solo was upset and appeared to have been drinking when she arrived at a family gathering. Following an argument, she and her nephew got into a fistfight, according to court documents. When the boy's mother tried to break up the confrontation, Solo punched her in the face, the documents said. The report also said that the nephew broke a broom over Solo's head and pointed a broken BB gun at her to try to get her to leave. Solo was released without bail. She was ordered not to have contact with the alleged victims and to not drink alcohol. 'Hope is not guilty of any crime,' her attorney Todd Maybrown said in an email to The AP following her arrest. 'In fact, our investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and injured during this unfortunate incident. We look forward to the opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter behind Hope very soon.' Solo married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens in 2012. He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged. Maybrown also represented Stevens in that case. Solo issued an apology following her arrest via social media. 'I love my family dearly. We, like all families, have our challenges but my sincere hope is that we are able to resolve this situation as a family,' she wrote. 'Adversity has always made us stronger and I know this situation will be no different.' In an exhibition match against Mexico in Sandy, Utah, earlier this month, Solo recorded her 72nd clean sheet in an 8-0 U.S. victory. She passed Briana Scurry (1994-2008) on the career list. Solo, 32, has played in 154 international matches and was with the U.S. team that won gold medals at the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics.

"Mirco Antenucci scored twice and Leeds scratched a nine-year itch against Derby as the Championship pace-setters were beaten 2-0 at Elland Road. Prior to today United had failed to defeat the Rams since September 2005, some 12 games ago in their rivalry. That Derby won 10 of that dozen made it an all the more frustrating record for the Whites. One win in 10 against anyone before this hardly inspired confidence either but Antenucci's double powered Leeds on as Steve McClaren's men were rattled in a way they rarely have been this season. Mirco Antenucci (right) scores his first of two goals for Leeds as they won 2-0 against Derby County . Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant (centre) was unable to keep the shot out . Leeds players celebrate after Antenucci put them ahead with a goal on 43 minutes . Leeds: Silvestri, Byram, Bellusci, Cooper, Warnock, Bianchi (Austin 68), Cook, Mowatt, Tavares (Tonge 95), Antenucci, Doukara. Subs not used: Pearce, Sharp, Berardi, Taylor, Dawson. Goals: Antenucci 43, 50 . Derby: Grant, Christie, Keogh, Shotton, Forsyth, Hendrick, Mascarell (Bryson 66), Hughes, Ibe (Dawkins 66), Martin, Russell (Thomas 66). Subs not used: Buxton, Eustace, Coutts, Roos. Referee: Mick Russell . Att: 26,028 . Derby looked the better bet in the opening quarter but, once Leeds started to dominate in midfield, the home side took control. That had not appeared likely early on as McClaren's men - with six wins in seven on the road - settled the quicker of the sides. For all that, though, their best early offerings were a shot wide from Jeff Hendrick and a couple of half-openings for Chris Martin in the wake of defensive lapses. Giuseppe Bellusci also had to be pinpoint with a last-ditch tackle on a clean-through Jonny Russell, before the hosts started to impose themselves. In a fiery opening 30 minutes they had three men booked but, once they started tackling cleanly and keeping the ball, they looked markedly better. It was soon Derby's players swinging and missing, two of their men having their names taken, with Omar Mascarell one of those booked as he tried in vain to take down Alex Mowatt who forced Lee Grant into a smart save. With Mowatt and Lewis Cook first to the ball, more Leeds chances came and 43 minutes in they scored. Will Hughes lost out to Mowatt, his ball found Souleymane Doukara and his pass from the left of the box was tucked in by Antenucci. The same man was on the spot six minutes after the break too, adding a second. Captain Stephen Warnock got down the left, pulled the ball back and Antenucci showed terrific composure to beat Grant.

Will Hughes of Derby (right) controls the ball as Leeds midfielder Alex Mowatt (left) closes him down . Sam Byram went in pursuit of a third and was denied by Grant after a mazy run on the right, while Derby felt they had a penalty shout on the hour mark. Liam Cooper - already booked - brought down Cyrus Christie on the very edge of the box. Referee Mick Russell validated the decision with his assistant, stuck to his original call and the free-kick was cleared as Derby protested. McClaren made a triple change to try to pep up his men but Leeds continued to press, Antenucci denied a hat-trick as Grant got down well to shove away a low drive. Derby should have made a fist of it with 10 minutes to go, Kwame Thomas wildly off target from 10 yards after a brilliant Warnock clearance off the line, and with that their chances went.","Leeds record first victory over Derby since 2005  with 2-0 win .

"It was a blunder more normally associated with politicians arriving in Downing Street. On the eve of the World Cup, after weeks of painstaking closed training sessions, England coach Gary Neville may just have given the game away. The former Manchester United star was photographed carrying what appeared to be coaching instructions for the England team – ahead of  their eagerly awaited opening World Cup clash against Italy on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . Master plan? Gary Neville with notes saying 'When ball goes into central zone team must make at least three passes before hitting the CF [centre forward]' and '2 MFs [midfielders] try to get in and support for a 3v2' Error: The faux pas comes days after an FA whiteboard was photographed inside the team's dressing room . The notes, which are normally confidential, hardly contained anything earth-shattering. But they might just have been handy for England’s opponents seeking any clues as to their tactics in the competition, which begins in Brazil tonight. The faux pas comes days after an FA whiteboard was photographed inside the team’s dressing room at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, where they played a pre-tournament friendly against Honduras. In blue ink, under a series of tactical points, had been written: DON’T ANSWER QUESTIONS ON FALKLANDS!!! The latest paperwork, pictured as Neville was walking out to take a training session, suggested the England team have been working hard at their beachfront base in Rio de Janeiro under manager Roy Hodgson. The notes, scribbled in blue ballpoint pen on a team sheet, referred to the side ‘supporting midfield players’ and includes the penetrating insight that if the opposition win the ball they might ‘counter straight away’. Blunder: Gary Neville with sheet in hand (left) - and Pugh's tips for a successful England campaign in Brazil . Opinion was split last night on whether these would be England’s tactics in the vital game – or just the sort of training ground routines used by football clubs up and down the country every week. There was even a suggestion the notes might be a double bluff by Neville and Hodgson as the pair prepared their players for their vital first game on Saturday night. On the whiteboard photographed in Miami the words: ‘We are ready for Italy!!!!!’ were also present. With temperatures expecting to reach 34C (93F), and 83 per cent humidity, England’s opening game is likely to be incredibly draining on the team. Whatever the notes Neville was holding – and whatever the tactics finally employed in Manaus – the 39-year-old’s actions will keep opponents Italy guessing right up to the 11pm kick-off on how England will approach the match.","Former Manchester United star photographed carrying detailed notes in Rio .

"Christian Eriksen was a visitor to the Steel City on Wednesday evening but it was he who showed the people of Sheffield a true cutting edge. His first goal was a thing of beauty, a sublime free kick that bounced into the top corner off the post, a strike the game’s true artists would be proud of. But increasingly it is his ability to deliver in the heat of the furnace that impresses. Sure, he’s a fine player, but can he do it on a snowy Wednesday night in South Yorkshire when there’s a League Cup final place at stake and time is ebbing away? An acutely angled finish in the 88th minute to avoid extra time and secure a Wembley showdown with Chelsea proved he can. It was the fourth time this season Eriksen has scored a winning goal in the 88th minute or later. He credits the work Mauricio Pochettino did on his squad’s fitness levels in pre-season with a propensity for late goals – the Argentine is said to demand so much from his players in training that they require ‘two hearts.’ Christian Eriksen (centre) is mobbed by his Tottenham team-mates after their win at Sheffield United . Eriksen has certainly hit his stride working under Pochettino. With every passing match, the £11million Tottenham paid for him in August 2013 is appearing to be more of a bargain. That wasn’t always the case. Although there were glimpses of his undoubted talent - he won the club’s player of the year award in his first season - he didn’t burst onto the Premier League stage in the way his reputation suggested he might. The 22-year-old from Middelfart, Denmark arrived in England from Ajax with high expectations attached to him as one of the most highly rated youngsters in Holland’s top flight. Eriksen began playing football as soon as he could walk and was soon marked out as one of the most gifted players in Middelfart, a town of less than 15,000 people on the island of Funen. It wasn’t long before he was picked up by OB, the biggest club in Odense, the largest city on the island. Uffe Pedersen, the head of talent for OB, remembers a special player. Eriksen curls home a sublime early free-kick to give Tottenham the lead on the night at Bramall Lane . The Dane coolly slots past Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard to send Spurs on their way to Wembley . ‘You could tell already he was something special. Every time Christian moved to a higher level he needed just one or two games to cope with that and then become the best player,’ Pedersen told The Guardian in 2013. He often played a couple of years ahead. ‘He steps up easily, this young guy taking over the whole game, setting the speed and shape of the game. Christian could play anywhere with good players.’ The playmaker flourished at OB and was named ‘the best technical player’ in a major tournament in Denmark as a 13-year-old. Representing Denmark through the age groups, he piqued the interest of Europe’s biggest clubs. Pedersen accompanied Eriksen as he travelled to Chelsea, Barcelona and Milan before he finally opted to join Ajax. Eriksen celebrates a goal against Manchester City during his Ajax days in October 2012 . Although he was skinny and relatively small – he is now 5ft 10in – when he arrived at Ajax, Frank de Boer who was in charge of youth development at the time was instantly impressed. ‘He's always on the move. Quick thinking. He has eyes in his back,’ he said, ‘When you think he doesn't see you, he sees you.’ In 2010, aged just 18, Eriksen was the youngest player at the World Cup in South Africa, appearing twice as a substitute before Denmark exited in the group stages. The next year, he was named Dutch Talent of the Year as Ajax won the title. Even when his team loses, Eriksen possesses skill that makes him sparkle. When Denmark lost 2-1 to England in 2011, English fans were preoccupied by the debut of Jack Wilshere but Eriksen, one month the Arsenal star’s junior, put him in the shade, repeatedly stealing the ball from under his nose and dictating the pace of play. Eriksen takes on England's James Milner during an international friendly in Copenhagen in February 2011 . Liverpool and Chelsea were interested in signing him but it was Tottenham who secured his services, moving for him after their pursuit of Willian came to nothing. This term, he has been the club’s standout performer and with eight goals is the Premier League's top scoring midfielder, alongside Eden Hazard. His rich vein of form has been noted by many of Europe’s elite clubs. Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund are all thought to be interested in luring Eriksen to the contintent. Domestically, Liverpool and Arsenal are also keen on the midfielder. Spurs' chances of holding onto him would surely improve if they can secure Champions League football next season with a top four finish – and how they would dearly love to keep him at White Hart Lane.","Christian Eriksen scores twice as Tottenham Hotspur beat Sheffield United .

"Ed Miliband today issues the stark threat that manned border posts could be introduced if Scotland backs independence in next week's historic vote. With just 11 days to go until the referendum - and polls showing growing momentum for Alex Salmond's nationalists - the Labour leader has urged voters to face up to the consequences of severing the 300-year-old Union. 'If you don't want borders, vote to stay in the United Kingdom,' Mr Miliband said in an interview with today's Scottish Mail on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Passport please: Our artists' impression of a road border between England and Scotland post-independence . Asked whether that would mean him introducing border guards and passport checks if he was Prime Minister, Mr Miliband warned: 'It would have to be looked at.' And Mr Miliband's spokesman added last night: 'The last time I looked there were two sides to the border - and we would be in charge of one of them. It would be up to us, not Mr Salmond, to secure our northern border.' The prospect was raised as a shock poll showed that 51 per cent of Scots would vote ‘Yes’ to going it alone with just 49 per cent saying ‘No’. The results of the YouGov survey means that the ‘Yes’ campaign has overturned a 22-point lead within a month. Until now, Mr Salmond’s SNP has insisted that a separate Scotland would be part of a common, free movement area with the rest of the UK and Ireland. Guards on the border: Where the controls could be placed if Scotland wins independence in 11 days' time . But a Downing Street source backed Mr Miliband, saying: ‘All the research shows that if there is a material difference between the immigration policy adopted by an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK, then border controls would have to be introduced.’ It raises the extraordinary prospect of drivers having to stop at manned barriers on the borders to show their passports. Soccer pundit Alan Hansen and a ‘squad’ of great Scottish footballers from all eras of the game have called on ‘every patriotic Scot’ to vote No to independence. The other players who signed up to a statement are: Alex McLeish, Jim Leighton, David Moyes, Willie Miller, Paddy Crerand, Davie Provan, Barry Ferguson, Bertie Auld, Denis Law, Ally McCoist, Derek Johnstone, Murdo MacLeod, Ian Durrant, John Brown and Frank McAvennie. With the latest opinion polls showing Mr Miliband on course to win May’s General Election, a Labour Government could be in charge of negotiating Scotland’s passage to independence by March 2016 if the referendum returns a ‘Yes’ vote. The SNP dismissed the idea of border controls as a ‘scare story’, but Mr Miliband’s advisers say it is not an idle threat: a secret memo drawn up by the Foreign Office in 2009 warned that a secure border would have to be established to protect the ‘remaining UK’ if an independent Scotland applied to join the EU. All new EU members are obliged to accept the Schengen open borders scheme, meaning travellers from the continent would be free to fly into Scotland without immigration checks. But Britain has opted out of the scheme, and erects border controls to vet travellers from Schengen countries, raising the prospect of a new Hadrian’s Wall between the two nations. New border posts would cause chaos for travellers and prove to be hugely damaging to business. The 95-mile border, which runs from Lamberton on the east coast to the Solway Firth in the west, cuts through 21 roads, including two major trunk routes, the A1 and M74. No idle threat by Mr Miliband: A memo drawn up by the Foreign Office in 2009 warned that a secure border would have to be established to protect the ‘remaining UK’ if an independent Scotland applied to join the EU . A total of 23 million vehicle crossings a year are made on the roads, in addition to seven million passenger journeys on the West Coast and East Coast railway lines. If controls were set up, immigration staff could man barriers on the roads while the train terminals would have to install checks similar to those adopted by Eurostar. Last night former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett echoed Mr Miliband’s warning by referring to last week’s riots in Calais when immigrants attempted to storm a ferry. ‘Were the Scots to vote “Yes” to separation, the issue of border controls and the threat of entry through Scottish ports and airports would take on serious proportions,’ Mr Blunkett told The Mail on Sunday. Support for Alex Salmond's camp has soared, with a poll last night putting the Yes vote  on 51 per cent . ‘This is one issue that has not yet emerged as a key part of the debate over Scotland’s future. There is much at stake and little sign of Government action in response.’ Panic spread through the ‘No’ campaign last week after an opinion poll showed that its lead over the nationalists had shrunk to just six points, with support for Mr Salmond’s position up by eight points in a month. Mr Cameron is happy to let Mr Miliband make the running for the pro-Union campaign as Labour supporters make up a large proportion of the ‘undecided’ voters. The Prime Minister paid his annual visit to the Queen at Balmoral yesterday, but accepted the advice of Palace aides not to join her at the Braemar Games in case it was seen as ‘politicising’ the Monarch. It is also in Mr Miliband’s interest to defeat the nationalists: if Scottish voters had been excluded from the last Election, Mr Cameron would have won a clear Westminster majority without the need for a Coalition. The scale of Labour fears over a possible ‘Yes’ vote was laid bare yesterday when the party’s English and Welsh MPs were told to get up to Scotland to save the Union. In an email to all Labour MPs, Chief Whip Rosie Winterton revealed that Labour had booked scores of train tickets to get them to go north of the border before the referendum. In his interview, Mr Miliband also mentioned his ‘personal connection’ with Scotland – his father, Ralph, was stationed at Inverkeithing, Fife, during the Second World War. ‘The rest of the UK would be much weaker without Scotland. It matters for reasons of heart and for head,’ he said. Former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy urged fellow ‘No’ campaigners to hold their nerve, saying: ‘There is a flavour of detail and substance being swept aside in a tide of emotion and exclusive patriotism. It is a dangerous time for the No campaign.’ Asked about Mr Miliband’s remarks, a spokesman for Yes Scotland said: ‘There will be no border posts between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK. ‘The No campaign will say anything to try to scare people into throwing away this unique opportunity to put our future into our own hands. They’ll always put what’s right for Westminster above what’s best for Scotland. Border posts manned by guards take the prize for one of the sillier scare stories.’ By MARTIN BECKFORD, MAIL ON SUNDAY HOME AFFAIRS EDITOR . The centuries-old union between Scotland and England was in jeopardy last night, as for the first time an opinion poll showed a majority of referendum voters backing independence. In a result that shocked Westminster, 51 per cent of Scots questioned by YouGov said they would vote ‘Yes’ to going it alone with ‘No’ down to 49. With ‘don’t know’ responses included, ‘Yes’ was still ahead 47 to 46 with 7 per cent undecided. The survey for The Sunday Times is the first independent poll to put the nationalist camp ahead and follows a series of results that indicated growing support for independence. The Yes campaign has overturned a 22-point lead in the space of a month. In the first week in August, the No campaign had a 22-point lead – 61 per cent against 39 per cent. Week by week since then the camps have converged. Now those supporting the union find themselves behind for the first time. The momentum appears to have swung behind Alex Salmond after he was declared winner of the second televised debate with Alistair Darling, chairman of the increasingly nervous Better Together campaign. Alarm bells started ringing a week ago in the No camp when a poll showed their lead had shrunk to six points. With only 11 days to go before the historic referendum, politicians and business leaders backing the union will have to redouble their efforts to win over undecided voters. David Cameron and the Queen – said to have a ‘great deal of concern’ about Scotland breaking away – will appear in public at church in Balmoral this week. Gordon Brown last night blamed the Tories’ unpopular policies for the closeness of the vote. Mr Darling said last night: ‘The polls may conflict, but the message I take from them is clear: If you want Scotland to remain part of the UK family you have to vote for it on 18 September. Separation is forever.’","Labour leader revealed passport checks 'would have to be looked at'

"Blair Cowan may have been born in New Zealand but he insists he will be the proudest Scot on show if he is given his BT Murrayfield debut on Saturday. The son of a Scottish mother and Cook Islander father, the 28-year-old is in line to make his bow at the home of the Dark Blues when they host Argentina this weekend. The London Irish back-rower already has three caps for Vern Cotter's men after being called-up for the summer tour of the Americas. London Irish flanker Blair Cowan is looking forward to his home debut for Scotland at Murrayfield . Fiercely proud of his Scottish roots, he was already looking forward to the chance of running out at the famous Edinburgh arena for the first time. But the fact that his mum Joan - born in the small village of Blairmore near Dunoon before emigrating to New Zealand with her parents - has flown half-way round the world to see the first Autumn Test has pushed his patriotic sensitivities into over-drive. He said: 'My family are very Scottish orientated. Since coming up here and seeing the values in people, I can see where my family got it from. New Zealand-born backrower Cowan has been in excellent form for the Exiles this season . 'My grandad, my uncle, my mum - they are all based in New Zealand but are all very Scottish. They were born here and raised here. 'Don't get me wrong, I'm very proud of my father's side and where I grew up. But a lot of the stuff that has been driven into me comes from my Scottish side. 'My Scottish family are all very proud people, very passionate. I think that shows in the way I play. I wear my heart on my sleeve. 'When I call my grandad to give him some good news, he still gets a crack in his voice. That almost brings me to tears. So now it is really nice to represent Scotland on behalf of my family as well. 'My family has been the backbone to my career so I owe them a lot when I go out to play.' Scotland and Saracens stalwart Kelly Brown has been left out of Vern Cotter's squad for the November Tests . Cowan first moved to the UK in 2009 when he signed for Cornish Pirates. As spell at Worcester Warriors then led to his move to the Irish Exiles. He has even toured Scotland when his sister married her partner in Edinburgh. But the atmosphere of a packed-out Murrayfield is something he has still to savour. 'I got a taste of playing for Scotland during the summer but now I've got my eyes set on playing at Murrayfield,' said the Wellington-born flanker. Ryan Grant (right) has been invited to train with the Scotland squad after Allan Dell was ruled out with an injury . 'That would be a huge honour and probably the highlight of my career if I get the chance. 'I'm dying to get out there. My mum has just come over to visit myself and my brother. It would be the first time in six years that I have played in front of her. 'To play in front of the Scottish crowd would be huge but to play in front of my family makes it even more special.' Cowan's inclusion in Cotter's latest squad is also notable because is seems to have spelt the end of former skipper Kelly Brown's international career. But with a World Cup just 10 months away, the new man in the squad is refusing to let the fall-out of that episode ruin his big chance. He said: 'Kelly has obviously been a huge part of Scottish rugby and I have the utmost respect for him. 'But Vern knows what he wants. That's the nature of professional sport and I'm just lucky enough to be what Vern is after. 'Kelly's absence is the elephant in the room but I have put it behind me and I'm just concentrating on my job. 'I want to take the next step with Scotland. I was reasonably happy with the end-of-year tour but there was still things I could improve on. Now is a chance to show exactly what I can do if I get the opportunity to play.' Meanwhile, Ryan Grant has been invited to train with the squad after Edinburgh prop Allan Dell was ruled out with a leg injury. Grant, who toured Australia with the 2013 British & Irish Lions, is only just back from shoulder surgery himself but could end up replacing Dell after he was injured in the Gunners' 33-8 defeat to Leinster in Dublin on Friday.","Blair Cowan was born in New Zealand but is the son of a Scottish mother .

"A five year old girl is fighting for her life after she was raped by a neighbour in Gandhi Nagar, east Delhi, who held her captive for four days. The girl was kidnapped while playing outside her home and locked in her neighbour’s flat for days before someone heard her cries for help. Doctors reported finding ‘foreign objects’ inside the girl’s genitals as the details of her horrific ordeal began to unfold. Horror: The five-year-old rape victim is covered by a sheet as she is transported to a specialist unit from Swami Dayanand Hospital, Delhi, today . The five-year-old went missing from her home on Monday and was found on Thursday night by rescuers, alerted by her screams, in the home of a man who lives in the same building as the girl’s family. The neighbour is believed to have repeatedly raped the child, mutilated her genitals and tried to strangle her. Doctors at Swami Dayanand hospital in Dehli said they found foreign objects inside the girl, including a 200ml bottle and parts of a broken candle. She also suffered injuries and bruising to her chest, lips and cheeks. Terrible crime: The girl is fighting for her life after she was kidnapped by her neighbour who allegedly raped and abused her for four days while keeping her locked in a room in the same house where her family lives . Abused: Doctors said it was 'one of the worst cases' they had seen following the discovery of a broken candle and a bottle inside the little girl's private parts resulting in serious infection . Dr R.K. Bansal who examined the girl said it was ‘one of the worst cases’ he had ever seen, and that the next 48 hours will be crucial in determining her chances of survival. ‘She was scared and not fully conscious,’ he told Hindustani Times. ’Initially, she did not allow us to proceed with the examination as she was in tremendous pain.’ This is the third alleged rape of a . minor this month in the Delhi area. Earlier this week a ten-year-old was . allegedly raped on a bus after the driver, also in this case a . neighbour, lured her away from her home. Last . week another girl, also aged ten, was allegedly raped by a neighbour and then . locked in a cell by police after her family tried to report the crimes. The case triggered protests outside Swami Dayanand hospital with masses condemning the acts of the accused and condemning the government for not providing better care and the police for not acting on the parent’s missing child report. The girl’s family claim the police had tried to bribe them with 2,000 rupees (£24) to keep quiet after their daughter was rescued and refused to treat it as a rape case. Public fury: Angry protestors block the car of Delhi State Education Minister Kiran Walia, who arrived at the hospital to visit the girl's family, as public outrage spread following the incident - the third involving a minor in the past two weeks . Anger: Aam Aadmi party attack the minister's car in protest against the government's lax reactions to the recent horrific rape cases involving minors in Delhi . ‘She went out to play when she was kidnapped. The man then locked her up in his room and raped her. I want justice from the government,’ the girl's mother told The Hindu. ‘Yesterday night (a policeman came and asked me to come out. He told me nothing will happen by involving public. He told me that you should take care of the child and be with her. Public would not help you and he also handed me Rs. 2,000 and left. He said I should cover my pocket expenses from this money,’ the victim's father alleged. Delhi Police refute the allegations. Today, as the girl was transferred to All India Institute of Medical Sciences in order to be given better care, Delhji Police reported to have identified the alleged rapist. ‘The accused has been identified and a team is already on its way to arrest him,"" Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar told Hindustani Times.","Five-year-old kidnapped and raped by her neighbour in east Delhi .

"Tiring: Prince Charles has had a long wait - the longest ever . The birth of baby George, a boost in sales for Duchy's Originals - and Prince Charles has broken a record to add to his year of milestones - although this one may come with a pinch of frustration. The Prince of Wales - who has in the past joked about being 'impatient' and about 'running out of time' -  today become the oldest heir to the throne for almost 300 year, successor to Queen Elizabeth II, who at the age of 87 holds the title of oldest monarch in British history. The oldest heir apparent until today was William IV, who became monarch in June 1830, aged 64 years, ten months and five days, on the death of his father George III. William IV died without an heir in 1837 and was succeeded by his niece - Queen Victoria, who went on to become the country's longest reigning monarch, with 63 years on the throne. He still has Sophia of Hanover to beat as the oldest heir to the throne. The princess died aged 83 in 1714, a few months before Queen Anne died. Charles became heir apparent on the death of his grandfather George VI, when his mother succeeded to the throne on February 6 1952. The Prince was just three years old at the time and from a young age has been groomed to be king. Charles is already the longest serving heir to the throne having passed, a number of years ago, the previous record set by Edward VII who became monarch aged 59, when his mother Queen Victoria died in 1901. The Prince became a grandfather for the first time in July when Prince George was born to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Before the birth the heir to the throne said he was 'thrilled' and even joked about how the latest development in his eventful life had come at the age of 64. Scroll down for video . Beaten: William IV (left) was the previous oldest heir to the throne, after he succeeded George IV (right) in 1830 aged 64 years, ten months and five days . He said: 'It’s a very nice thought to become a grandfather in my old age, if I can say so.' And with the Queen still in excellent health - despite a few hospital visits - he could be in for an even longer wait. Aside from a brief hospital visit in March this year - a precautionary measure, the Palace said, while she was assessed for the symptoms of the stomach bug gastroentiritis, she has not had a hospital stay for ten years. And despite his positive comments about being an old grandfather, the Prince has in the past hinted that he is feeling the long wait. Outlived: The oldest heir to the throne, Sophia of Hanover (left), died aged 83 in 1714 - a few months before Queen Anne (pictured right, monarch from 1665 to 1714), whom she was due to succeed . 64: William IV . 59: Edward VII . 40: George VI . 37: Richard I . 25: Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II . 18: Victoria . 17: Henry VIII . 9:  Edward VI . During a visit to Dumfries House in East Ayrshire last year, he recorded a film for the Clarence House website in which the then 64-year-old heir suggested his time as monarch might be cut short. He said: 'Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes of course I am.' He added: “I’ll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffed it if I’m not careful.' And even before then, Charles made a number of comments regarding his time as heir. In 1992, on the eve of the Queen’s 40th anniversary on the throne, he attended the funeral of his father-in-law, the 8th Earl Spencer, where he is believed to have remarked to Charles Spencer, his then brother-in-law: 'You are fortunate enough to have succeeded to the title when still young.' In 2004, a Guards officer at Wellington Barracks who congratulated him on his 56th birthday got the response: 'I’m now at the age at which my grandfather died.' Royal biographer Penny Junor said: 'He is impatient, but when he becomes king, his activities and all the projects he most enjoys where he can make a difference, will be seriously curtailed. Heirs to the throne: The Queen looks out from Buckingham Palace, engaged in conversation with Prince William... while Charles, the first in line to the throne, looks on . 'He has spent an awful lot of his life searching for a role, but I think he does now feel fulfilled pursuing his various interests.' And with the wedding of Prince William to Catherine last year, Prince Charles also must cope with being sidelined by the younger members of his family. A poll in July - at the time of the birth of Prince George - named the most popular royals after the Queen as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with Prince Harry. And although 42 per cent of those surveyed by the ComRes poll said Prince Charles should be the next heir to the throne, 38 per cent were in favour of Prince William being the next king. Prime of life: At the beginning of this month, the Queen looked far younger than her 86 years as she watched a sack race at the Braemar Gathering in Scotland .","Prince Charles becomes oldest heir apparent in British history .

"They were hardly the first couple to argue over what to watch on television on a Sunday evening. So Irene Clark and her husband Richard were astonished when four police officers turned up at their front door. And they were horrified when Mrs Clark, 65, was arrested and led away – because she had swiped at her husband with a magazine during their row. Row: Irene Clark, left, spent two nights in a police cell after beating her husband James, right, with a magazine in a row over whether to watch period drama Foyle's War . The grandmother spent two nights in a police cell and now has a criminal record after a neighbour reported the ‘domestic incident’. Yesterday Mr Clark, 52, said: ‘It was a total overreaction. I did not consider myself being a victim for getting biffed over the head with a magazine after an argument over a TV programme.’ The couple, who have been married for 14 years, had the row because Mrs Clark wanted to watch period detective drama Foyle’s War, starring Michael Kitchen, on ITV1. ‘Richard wanted to see some plane programme. We were arguing,’ she said. ‘There was a Sunday magazine on the edge of the chair and it was like a swipe on the top of the head. [The magazine] was open. ‘It wasn’t even folded. ‘We started watching Foyle’s War. I was in my dressing gown. ‘The next thing we heard was bang, bang, bang at the door. Raid: A neighbour called the police after hearing the row over the period drama Foyle's War, starring Michael Kitchen, centre, and Honeysuckle Weeks and Anthony Howell . ‘Richard answered it and four police officers piled into the house. Two took him away to a bedroom and two came in with me to the living room. The policewoman said they’d had a report of a domestic incident. ‘I said, “Yes, we had an argument and I slapped him with a paper.” She said, “We’ll have to take you in now”. It was surreal. I was taken into the street and put in the van.’ Mr Clark said: ‘All I had on my forehead was a mark like I’d scratched a pimple. ‘They sent for paramedics for me and my wife was apprehended and handcuffed. It was a total overreaction.’ His wife added: ‘They said that there had been a complaint from the neighbours and they were arresting me for an assault on Richard. There was a tiny paper cut on his forehead which neither of us had noticed.’ Arrested: After a night in the cells in Cupar, pictured, near St Andrews, Mrs Clark was taken to Dunfermline and spent two nights behind bars before being 'admonished' by the courts . Because the next day was a court holiday in Scotland, Mrs Clark, a retired social worker from Tayport, Fife, spent two nights in custody. ‘I was put in a cell with just a blanket and lunatics shouting and screaming next door,’ she said. ‘I had to wait in the cells there with drug addicts and didn’t get out until 6pm.’ Mr Clark said: ‘I was very concerned for her. I phoned up continuously.’ Mrs Clark was admonished – a verbal punishment – at Dundee Sheriff Court last week after she admitted striking her husband with the magazine during the incident in July. Her solicitor William Boyle said: ‘Either the law or those applying the law have gone mad. This politically correct madness must stop.’ A Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service spokesman said: ‘Domestic abuse is never trivial and our prosecutors take it extremely seriously.’","Irene Clark, 65, beat her husband James in row over ITV period drama .

"A toddler escaped uninjured after falling 10ft down a drain when a rusty manhole cover broke under his weight. AJ Hayward, who is just 18 months old, hit his head on the side of the concrete culvert and narrowly missed being crushed by the iron cover which landed just inches away from him. He was taken to hospital after the accident on Saturday night and was treated for suspected concussion before being released the next day. AJ Hayward pictured with his father Arthur and mother Leanne Webb near the manhole where he fell 10ft . Fortunately there was no water in the bottom of the drain because of the hot weather and the manhole cover narrowly missed him after it fell . The drama unfolded in front of his father, Arthur, 36, and mother Leanne Webb, 28, during a relative's birthday barbecue in Worcester. Mr Hayward climbed down the drain, which did not have water in because of the hot weather, and lifted his son to safety. He said: 'My son could have died, if that cast-iron cover had followed him down the hole it would have killed him. It fell to the side fortunately. 'I’ve been up all night at the hospital. The doctors can’t believe he went down the manhole. He was on one manhole cover and then he stepped on to the other one and the cover lid just went. 'As he stepped on it he just went straight through. I had to climb all the way down there and climb back up to the ladder with him on my arm. 'He hit his head on the steps as he went down. I’m still in shock. Every time I close my eyes I can see him falling.' Mrs Hayward added: 'We were just talking here, we were watching him he was singing and walking around there humming to himself. The drain cover was repaired by workers from Worcestershire County Council . 'He trod on the first one and then he walked across on that one and he just disappeared. He was gone. I haven’t slept all night since it happened, we’re just traumatised.' Worcestershire County Council, which is responsible for the drains, said they had repaired the manhole cover which belonged to Severn Trent Water. Highways manager Jon Fraser said: 'As soon as we were made aware of the incident we promptly attended the location to make the area safe by fitting a utility plate to cover the manhole and put barriers around the area. 'It’s a Severn Trent Water manhole cover and this will be referred to them.' A spokesman for Severn Trent Water said: 'We are aware of an incident that took place at Troutbeck Drive that was reported to use this morning [Monday]. 'We take safety very seriously and we would like to apologise to those affected. We sent an inspector out to investigate this morning and the site has now been made safe.'","AJ Hayward avoided serious injury after his fall down the drain .

"This snappy shark was clearly not in the mood for a close-up, snatching one petrified photographer's camera straight out of his arms before swimming off into the distance with it. After posing for several pictures during a diving expedition in the Bahamas, the toothy tyrant obviously decided enough was enough. Swimming up to the horrified photographer, the Tiger shark grabbed the expensive camera in his ferocious jaws. Surrounded: The diver, pictured holding the specialist camera above, is circled by several Tiger sharks on the seabed in the Bahamas . Thief: As the other sharks move away, one stays close to the diver and eyes up the camera . It then calmly swam off with the £11,000 piece of kit. Thankfully, the photographer and guide managed to get the camera back - as the disinterested shark dropped it only 100 metres away. Fellow photographer, Miguel Lasa, watched the sly shark pinch the camera and managed to capture the commotion on camera. The 49-year-old, who works as a GP in the north east of England, said: 'The shark literally took the camera straight from the hands of our guide photographer. What's that you got there? The creature looks straight down the camera at the photographer, perhaps trying to decipher what he is holding . What are you looking at? The deadly animal gets up close and personal to the divers showing off his daunting set of teeth . 'The equipment has arms and strobes attached so it immediately attracted the attention of the shark, it's very bulky so it was easy for the shark to grab hold of. 'They are very powerful and can swim long distances very fast. 'Luckily though the shark decided to drop the camera onto the sea bed about 100 metres away. 'The guide was actually very lucky to get the camera back. 'It cost around £11,000 with the housing and it would have only taken him a few minutes to swim miles away. 'Miraculously . it was in perfect condition without so much as a scratch. It's amazing . really considering the slightest crack would allow the salt water in and . destroy it in seconds. 'It's crazy how sharks can have such sharp teeth and such a gentle bite.' It's mine now! The Tiger shark makes off with the £11,000 piece of kit held tightly in his grasp . Expensive steal: The divers said the equipment, which has arms and strobes attached, was quite easy for the shark to pick-up in his jaws . Miguel said although it was a once in a lifetime experience he was petrified of what might happen next. He said: 'At the time I was diving without a cage, it was a great experience but I wouldn't do it again as it was too dangerous. 'When I saw the shark take the camera from the photographer I rushed to try and get a shot of the extraordinary event. 'Fortunately I managed to get it. 'I was scared though. You never know when a shark is getting too close. 'They have powerful bites and could take your arm or leg off in a split second. Not bothered: The culprit thankfully dropped the equipment, in good condition, 100 metres away . 'I wasn't worried about my camera but I was worried for my personal safety. 'I've never seen anything like this before. It was an amazing event.' Tiger sharks are considered . to be one of the most dangerous shark species in the world. They are . responsible for many recorded attacks on humans, second only to the . great white shark. However, its usual prey is varied and can include anything from crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, and sea snakes, to dolphins and even other smaller sharks. The tiger shark is considered a near threatened species due to fishing by humans.","Diver Miguel Lasa, 49, was swimming without a cage when the Tiger shark approached .

"The prosecution started their portion of the Jodi Arias murder trial on Thursday by aggressively questioning her about different stories that they believe she lied about on the stand. They used her own journal entries to argue that she lied about a specific explicit sex romp with boyfriend Travis Alexander that involved Tootsie pops and Pop Rocks. He went on to attack her scandalous claims that Mr Alexander was sexually attracted to young boys, examining the timeline of the texts that they sent one another on the day that she supposedly walked in on him pleasuring himself to pictures of minors. The supposed incident took place months before shot and stabbed Alexander, killing him reportedly in self defense. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . One-on-one: Prosecutor Juan Martinez (left) aggressively questioned Jodi Arias (right) on the first day of the prosecution's turn during the ongoing murder trial on Thursday . Earlier in the trial during her questioning by her defense attorney, Arias said that the reason why she missed her friend Lonnie Dworkin's baptism was because she and Alexander were having sex and using the candy as props. Prosecutor Juan Martinez was verbally sparring with Arias as he pushed her to look at her own journal entries where she gave an alternate reason for missing Mr Dworkin's baptism. In doing so, Mr Martinez is likely planning on showing that Arias lied about her sex life with Mr Alexander to the court, bringing into question what else she lies about. At one point, he focused on her 'selective memory' because he said that she said she didn't recall certain points from the trial but was 'able to remember the drink you ordered from Starbucks five years ago'. Grilled: Martinez asks Arias a question about her diary during cross examination in Maricopa County Superior Court today in Phoenix, Arizona . 'You can tell us what kind of sex you had with Mr Alexander many years ago but you can't remember what you said yesterday or a few days ago?' he said during his quick succession of questions. She admitted that she had trouble with her memory when she was under stress. Another issue that he addressed during the first portion of the questioning was the timeline surrounding her damaged finger. Earlier in the trial, she stated that she and Mr Alexander got in a physical altercation in January 2008 when he threw her on the floor and allegedly kicked her in the ribs and finger. She told the court that she didn't want to see a doctor for fear of getting Mr Alexander in trouble so they made a makeshift splint, but the finger- her left ring finger- did not heal and is still damaged to this day. Mr Martinez showed a journal entry that was made after the alleged fight and it made no reference to the fight. He also showed a picture that was taken months after the fight where her hand does not appear damaged. After the fact: The picture on the screen was taken months after she was supposedly kicked by Alexander when he allegedly damaged her finger, but her finger does not look damaged in the picture . Alternate story: The court was also shown video of an interrogation when she told an investigator that fictitious intruders attacked her and caused the hand injury . He also used a videotaped interview . that she had with Detective Esteban Flores who was investigating Mr . Alexander's murder where she said that her finger was damaged on June 4- . the night that she killed Mr Alexander. At that time, however, she was . making up a story about how two intruders broke into Mr Alexander's . home, attacking and killing him. 'Whatever you told us in the past is somewhat suspect,' Mr Martinez said in court. Much of the afternoon was spent parsing over the texts that Mr Alexander and Arias exchanged on the day when she alleged that she caught him pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys. That allegedly occurred on January 21, 2008. The next day, she claims they had the violent altercation that she says resulted in her left ring finger being damaged. One of the main points of Mr Martinez' inquiry is her personal journal, where two days after the alleged fight and three days after the supposed discovery of Mr Alexander's alleged sexual interest in boys, she wrote: 'I haven't written because there is nothing noteworthy to report.' The prosecution comes after eight days where Arias was questioned about her relationship and eventual murder of Mr Alexander. The . questioning style was predictably nicer during that time than it was . today, however, since it was her defense attorney Kirk Nurmi doing the . asking. Her story: Arias' defense is based entirely around the fact that she killed Alexander in self-defense- which she tearfully told the court on Wednesday- and that she lied multiple times to investigators because she was trying to avoid jail . Contemplation: Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi was a much more gentle questioner when he examined Arias . Wednesday was arguably most explosive day of her murder trial, when Arias testified that there was a 'huge gap' in her memory from June 4, 2008 - the day that Alexander died at his Mesa, Arizona home. Arias told jurors that she and Alexander had been taking naked pictures in his shower when she dropped his camera, causing him to erupt in a rage, body-slamming her against the tiles and threatening to kill her. She went on to say that she does not remember stabbing him 27 times but does remember 'accidentally' shooting him.

"Risk: The EU watchdog claims eating brown toast could put you at higher risk of getting cancer (file picture of model) It's enough to make you choke on your marmalade. An EU watchdog says toast, that most British of breakfast delicacies, should be eaten only when it is a light yellow colour – not an appetising brown. And heaven forbid if you prefer your toast – whisper it – burned! The new warning from the European Food Safety Authority is designed to highlight the dangers of the chemical acrylamide, which forms in certain foods cooked at high temperatures. Putting health and safety high on our daily menus, the EU’s experts are also advising consumers not to eat dark, crunchy chips and crisps or to drink instant coffee – because of an increased risk of cancer. The chemical is mainly found in crisps, savoury snacks, chips, soft and crispy breads, biscuits, crackers, cakes, cereals and coffee. But more of Britain’s most beloved foods – such as crispy, dark roasted potatoes and jacket potatoes – could be affected as home cooks are urged to boil, steam or sautee potatoes instead of frying and roasting them. Food manufacturers and catering outlets have already been improving processes to reduce acrylamide but the watchdog is anxious home cooks across Europe should also minimise the risks. Consuming too much acrylamide has been linked to an increased risk of cancer for years but this is the first time European Commission scientists have studied the data and issued warnings to consumers. Their draft opinion states: ‘Laboratory tests show acrylamide in the diet causes cancer in animals. Scientists conclude that acrylamide in food potentially increases the cancer risk for consumers of all ages.’ The chemical forms only in starchy foods – not burned or grilled meat, for example – when they are baked, fried or roasted in temperatures above 120C to 150C (248F to 302F). This causes a process known as the Maillard reaction which browns the food, makes it crispy and crunchy and adds taste. But it also creates acrylamide which forms another substance known as glycidamide. Dr Diane Benford, who heads EFSA’s expert committee on contaminants in food, said: ‘Glycidamide is the most likely cause of gene mutations and tumours seen in animal studies.’ Advice: The European Food Safety Authority is offering advice on how to make toast without risk . An EFSA spokesman said: ‘We have published an infographic about acrylamide in food on our website to raise awareness among consumers throughout Europe.’ Britain’s Food Standards Agency already samples food products for acrylamide and levels have been decreasing. Out of 544 tests last year, only 17 products had higher levels of the chemical. But these included popular items such as Tesco’s own-brand ready salted crisps, Sainsbury’s wholegrain bran flakes, TUC Original salted snack biscuits and Hovis extra wheatgerm crackers. An FSA spokesman said: ‘Consumers are not advised to stop eating any of the foods which are known to contain acrylamide but to follow Government advice on a healthy, balanced diet to minimise exposure.’ Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘While studies have shown acrylamide to cause cancer in mice and rats, research involving people is far less conclusive, and there isn’t good evidence of a link.’","Watchdog is warning about acrylamide - substance linked to cancer risk .

"An international human rights group has accused Israel of committing war crimes during the brutal 50-day war with Gaza which left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead. Human Rights Watch has said it reached the conclusion after investigating three attacks on or near United Nations-run schools housing displaced Palestinians, in which at least 45 people were killed. The New York-based group, which carried out field research and interviews with witnesses, said no military targets were apparent in the area of the schools and some of the attacks were indiscriminate. Scroll down for video . A Palestinian wounded in an Israeli strike on a compound housing a UN school in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip,  arrives on a stretcher at the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, on July 24. An international human rights group has accused Israel of committing war crimes during the brutal 50-day war with Gaza . Human Rights Watch said its inspection of the Beit Hanoun site and photographs of munitions remnants suggested Israel fired mortars at the school, killing 13 people . 'The Israeli military carried out attacks on or near three well-marked schools where it knew hundreds of people were taking shelter, killing and wounding scores of civilians,' Fred Abrahams, special adviser at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. 'Israel has offered no convincing explanation for these attacks on schools where people had gone for protection and the resulting carnage.' Israel says the heavy civilian death toll during the war was the fault of Islamic militant group Hamas, which it accused of launching rockets, and drawing retaliation, from school yards, residential areas and mosques. The Israeli military yesterday announced it had launched its own probe into cases involving Palestinian civilian casualties during the war, including the shelling of a U.N school. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed during the war, the majority of them civilians, according to Palestinian and UN officials. Israel says the number of militants killed was much higher and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed. About a quarter of a million Palestinians displaced by the violence were seeking shelter in UN-run schools. A Palestinian man  brings a child, wounded in an Israeli strike on a compound housing a UN school in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, to the emergency room of the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya . Human Rights Watch said 45 people, including 17 children, were killed in or near the 'well-marked schools' in the strikes on July 24 in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, on July 30 in Jabalya refugee camp and on August 3 in Rafah, in the south of the enclave. In one instance, in the attack on a school in Beit Hanoun on July 24, Israel said it had fired mortars toward Hamas fighters operating near the school, in response to anti-tank fire directed at them. The military said one mortar landed in the school courtyard, which according to video footage it released claiming to show the strike, was empty. Human Rights Watch said that seven Palestinian witnesses in the territory ruled by the Hamas militants disputed the claim. On the strike on July 30, the military said it was again responding to Hamas fire from nearby. Human Rights Watch said Israel provided no evidence for the claim. 'In any event, the use of high-explosive heavy-artillery shells so near a shelter filled with civilians constitutes an indiscriminate attack,' the group said. It said the attack in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was 'unlawfully disproportionate.' The attacks on the schools had elicited widespread condemnation, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calling one a 'moral outrage and a criminal act.' The UN, which has accused both Israel and Hamas militants of violating the rules of war, has appointed a commission of inquiry to look into the fighting. Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is threatening to seek membership in the International Criminal Court in order to press charges against Israel. Palestinians walk past a damaged ferris wheel amid destroyed buildings in Beit Hanoun town, which witnesses said was heavily hit by Israeli shelling and air strikes on July 26 . The Israeli military yesterday said it has opened criminal probes into two wartime cases, including the school attack in northern Gaza. The military has beefed up its legal teams and gathered reams of evidence, including photos and video clips, meant to prove that Hamas used civilian areas for cover when firing rockets and to show that Israel showed restraint in its responses. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, told the Associated Press that the military has confidence in a system that works. 'We are doing it so that we can improve and so that if people have carried out things not in line with rules and regulations that they will pay a personal price,' he said. 'Every decision our military advocate general makes is under scrutiny from the civilian establishment.' Meanwhile, a new World Bank report today said that continued 'political instability resulting from conflict, military rule, violence, political division, and lack of free movement and access to resources and markets' is the main obstacle to economic growth in Palestinian territories.","Human rights group says it reached conclusion after investigating three Israeli attacks on or near UN-run schools housing displaced Palestinians .

"The excuses given by benefit fraudsters make ‘the dog ate my homework’ look like child’s play, a list reveals. One doctor, who was also a UFO expert, wrongly claimed £100,000 using several fake identities. But it was all right, the man told officials – he took the money for ‘fellow agents’ because he was a spy working for MI5. Scroll down for video . A worker was confronted with a form he had filled out, claiming that he had no job. Luckily he had an explanation handy: he was in a trance, having an ‘out of body experience’, when he ticked the wrong box . A builder claimed the top rate of Disability Living Allowance, intended for those who are ‘housebound’, while operating a JCB. He argued that this was perfectly fair, because he never walked a step out of his home – he was carried on and off the building site by a colleague. A worker was confronted with a form he had filled out, claiming that he had no job. Luckily he had an explanation handy: he was in a trance, having an ‘out of body experience’, when he ticked the wrong box. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform the benefits system . A woman on income support failed to mention winning £95,000 on game show Deal or No Deal. Her mother said it didn’t really count – because she had given it all away to a drug dealer. Another woman claimed to be a lone parent a few days after getting married. She said she had stopped loving her new husband, and after all, she had ‘to pay for the wedding buffet’ somehow. Yet another ‘single’ mother said her husband didn’t live with the family, but in a tent at the bottom of their garden. Her story became only slightly less believable when investigators pointed out that she didn’t have a garden. A nightclub security guard said he did not think he had to declare his work because it was at night. Another man hoped that fraud investigators would understand why he could not just stop falsely claiming housing benefit. You see, he owed his landlady some money – and she had taken to chasing him around the house in high heels, ‘brandishing a sex toy’ and demanding ‘payment in kind’. Finally, proving that sometimes the old lies are the best, one man actually told a judge his dog ate warning letters from the council. It must have been a ‘very clever dog’, the judge remarked. The list of creative excuses from the last year was released by the Department for Work and Pensions. Benefit fraud costs taxpayers some £1billion a year, but almost all of that (£940million) was recovered last year, £40million more than the year before, the DWP said. New rules mean that since April, 40 per cent of a fraudster’s gains can be reclaimed directly out of their future benefits. They also face higher fines of £2,000 to £5,000. Work and pensions minister Mark Harper said: ‘These excuses underscore the pitiable lengths some people go to trying to justify what everyone knows is illegal behaviour.’ All the cases are now closed and the claimants’ benefits stopped. Clare Norfolk, of the DWP’s fraud and error service, said: ‘Making up excuses will not help criminals avoid punishment.’","Builder claimed top rate of Disability Living Allowance while operating  JCB .

"From package holidays to second homes, Britons are now returning to Benidorm in droves. In the 1970s it was the holiday destination of choice for sun-seeking Britons. The region is the most popular on Spain’s mainland for foreign buyers, according to land registry figures which show the proportion of villas and apartments bought by overseas buyers has almost tripled in the past four years to 11.15 per cent. Holidaymakers enjoy the sun and the beach life of Benidorm during its 1970s heyday. The region went from a must-go holiday resort to a place to be avoided to now a place for people to buy a second home . A view of the Europe's tallest residential building at 650 ft high, in the eastern coastal village of Benidorm . British buyers have taken advantage of the pound’s strength against the euro. Typically, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom villa with a pool is £158,000. The area is also popular because budget airlines fly to nearby Alicante from regional UK airports and not just London ones. But there is also a sense of nostalgia for Britons returning to a region of Spain that became famous for being among the first destinations for mass market package tours. Even the name Costa Blanca for the 125-mile coastline was invented by British airline BEA when it opened a route to Valencia, the capital of the region, in 1957. Sunny ladies: Anne Bolger and Linda Limmer sunbathe on a beach in Benidorm in 1975 before it became known as a haven for drunken louts . In the following decade, newly launched cheap package holidays took off with Benidorm, Altea and Alicante being among the first places to attract hordes of British sunseekers. Unfortunately the region suffered from an image of ugly high rise hotels, parades of British pubs and legions of lager louts from Britain getting drunk in nightclubs. Kieran Byrne, the managing director of HomeEspana said: ‘The sustained weakness of the euro this year is helping to attract more British and Scandinavian buyers. ‘We don't expect a rapid turnaround in market conditions in Spain, but at least in the Costa Blanca we have seen increased buyer interest in the first quarter of 2014. ‘More second homebuyers from abroad are discovering how far their money goes here.’ Benidorm has tried to shed its image as a haven for British lager louts, although it is still portrayed as downmarket in ITV comedy Benidorm.

"Ashley Talbot, 15, was run over and killed by a school minibus at Maesteg Comprehensive School in South Wales . A teacher killed a 15-year-old pupil by accidentally running him over in the school minibus on the way to a rugby match. PE teacher Chris Brooks, 33, was driving the vehicle when he hit Ashley Talbot in the school grounds. The teenager died at the scene from his injuries. Mr Brooks, who yesterday was being comforted at home, was said to be ‘devastated’ by the accident, which also left a 13-year-old pupil with minor injuries. He said: ‘All my thoughts, wishes and prayers are with Ashley’s family.’ The popular teacher was about to drive the Year 11 rugby team from Maesteg Comprehensive School, near Bridgend, South Wales, three miles to a match on Wednesday afternoon. Police were yesterday interviewing pupils who witnessed the incident to try to establish the precise sequence of events, but the school described it as a ‘tragic accident’. Students are being encouraged to write messages about how they are feeling to put on a Christmas tree in the school atrium. The school has also cancelled a Christmas carol service due to take place tonight. Ashley’s classmates wrote a touching tribute to their friend which was read out at the school and said: ‘The gap that Ashley leaves can never be filled. ‘Every morning Ashley would make us smile, his bubbly personality was infectious. ‘He was such good company and a good friend to everyone who knew him. He was passionate about his motorbike and fixing cars. ‘Ashley would always look for the good in everyone. He will always be in our hearts and will never be forgotten.’ Chairman of governors Keith Edwards described Ashley, a keen motorcross rider, as ‘an all-round good kid’ who would be greatly missed by staff and pupils. As well as the Christmas tree messages, fellow students paid tribute on social media. The minibus that killed Ashley was being driven by school PE teacher Chris Brooks, 33 . Ashley's devastated classmates said in a tribute the gap that teenager leaves can never be filled . Darcy Hawkins said on Twitter: ‘Can’t help think how close it is to Christmas for something so awful to happen, really not fair.’ Katie Thomas said: ‘Can’t imagine how Mr Brooks is feeling, hands down the nicest man and best teacher I ever had.’ Mr Brooks is a keen sportsman who carried the Olympic torch during the national relay ahead of London 2012. Mr Edwards said of Mr Brooks: ‘He is devastated. He is the sort of person who goes the extra mile to help the pupils. ‘That’s what he was doing at the time – taking pupils away from the school for a game of rugby. Police remain at Maesteg Comprehensive School in South Wales, but said they are treating the death as a  'tragic accident.' A tow truck transports the minibus involved in the accident away from the scene . ‘He is home at the moment and we will give him all the time and support he needs. He has spoken to the headteacher about what happened and we are all cooperating with the police investigation.’ Deborah McMillan, head of education at Bridgend County Council, said pupils would be offered counselling to cope with the tragedy. She added: ‘We are going to try and make the day as normal as possible but provide some space for pupils that need some time out.’ A short statement released by the school said: ‘Our thoughts are with the family, friends and everyone who has been affected by this tragic accident.’ South Wales Police has launched an investigation into how Ashley was killed on the school grounds. A forensic test of the minibus will be carried out. The Health and Safety Executive has also been notified. A police van remained parked outside the school last night while officers continued their inquiries . Police were called to Maesteg Comprehensive School (pictured) at 3.05pm yesterday to reports of a collision .","Ashley Talbot, 15, was run over and killed by his school minibus .

"President Barack Obama said Tuesday in Chicago that while racism-related fears of some African-Americans are 'not made up' and 'rooted in realities,' there is 'no excuse' for the violence that turned parts of Ferguson, Missouri into an urban war zone on Monday night. 'A grand jury made a decision yesterday that upset a lot of people,' he acknowledged, but framed the widespread arsons and looting as the result of 'frustrations' which are 'not just about a particular incident. they have deep roots in many communities of color.' Race-based resentments in America, said Obama, the first black U.S. president, are 'not just made up. it's rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time.' But he complained about agitators and organizers who led groups in 'burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk,' instead of finding 'productive ways of responding' to a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer for shooting a black teen in self-defense. President Barack Obama spoke on Tuesday about civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo.  at the Copernicus Community Center in Chicago . HANDS UP, DON'T TORCH: Stores burned to the ground on Monday in actions that Obama condemned as worthy of criminal prosecutions . IMMIGRATION: The president was in Chicago to promote his immigration overhaul, a policy that polls show is wildly unpopular . 'That's destructive and there's no excuse for it,' he said. 'Those are criminal acts, and people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts.' But returning to the theme of black communities fearing police forces that don't match their racial make-up, he warned that 'if any part of the American community doesn't feel welcomed or treated fairly, that's something that puts all of us at risk and we all have to be concerned about [it].' Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced last week that he would leave his post when a replacement is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, reiterated Tuesday that his Department of Justice is pursuing twin investigations into policeman Darren Williams' shooting of Michael Brown, and into the Ferguson, Police Department as a whole. But Obama said it was 'not my job as president to comment on ongoing investigations.' He did offer that Holder would soon host 'regional meetings focused on building trust in our communities,' and added that there are 'very specific steps we can take to make sure law enforcement is fair.' Turning back to the violence 300 miles to the south in suburban St. Louis, he warned protesters just an hour before nightfall that 'nothing of significance, nothing of benefit results from destructive acts.' 'I've never seen a civil rights law or a health care bill or an immigration bill result because a car got burned.' 'Don't take the short term easy route and just engage in destructive behavior,' Obama implored. 'I have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities.' The president's comments on the social unrest came at the beginning of a longer speech promoting and defending his decision last week to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants by giving them temporary get-out-of-deportation-free status until the end of his term in office. Appearing in a predominantly Polish-American neighborhood and greeting the crowd with a greeting in Polish – 'Dzień dobry!' – he insisted that his action was justified by the positive contributions immigrants have made to America's social fabric. The self-declared immigrant who introduced him, however, came to the U.S. legally. Tuesday's speech, scheduled long before the Ferguson debacle, was part of a White House strategy to broaden the appeal of his amnesty strategy beyond the Hispanic community that will benefit most. Three hecklers at the Copernicus Community Center, out of a crowd estimated at 1,800, interrupted Obama, yelling that he had not done enough to stop the Homeland Security Department from sending illegal immigrants back to their countries of origin. RIOT SHIELDS AT THE READY: National Guard troops readied for deployment on Tuesday in front of Ferguson, Missouri police headquarters . DAMAGE REPORT: This was a beauty salon and a wireless phone store before some in a mob riot torched it on Monday night . Some in the crowd booed the activists and shouted for them to take their seats, according to a White house press pool report. It 'doesn’t make sense to yell at me right now,' the president told them, emphasizing that he had just unveiled an aggressive policy move in their direction. 'What you're not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law.' The supportive audience applauded, but Republicans will howl at Obama's candid admission that he had 'changed' a federal law – precisely the point of view that the White House has argued in recent days was inaccurate. 'The way the change in the law works,' he said next, 'is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration law generally.' After listening to the hecklers awhile longer, he said, 'There are other ways of engaging. Just sit down.'","President said black communities' distrust of white law enforcement is 'rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time'
But he calmly condemned violent rioters and looters, saying 'people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts'

"Britain is facing years of freezing winters because of the dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice, say scientists. Global warming means autumn levels of sea ice have dropped by almost 30 per cent since 1979 - but this is likely to trigger more frequent cold snaps such as those that brought blizzards to the UK earlier this month. And Arctic sea ice could be to blame. Cold facts: A reduction in Arctic ice is being blamed for increasingly severe winters in the Northern Hemisphere . Dr Jiping Liu and colleagues studied the extensive retreat of the ice in the summer and its slow recovery focusing on the impacts of this phenomenon on weather in the Northern Hemisphere. Information about snow cover, sea level pressure, surface air temperature and humidity was used to generate model simulations for the years 1979 to 2010. The researchers say dramatic loss of ice may alter atmospheric circulation patterns and weaken the westerly winds that blow across the North Atlantic Ocean from Canada to Europe. Edinburgh Waverley train station: Scenes like this could become increasingly common in Britain . This will encourage regular incursions of cold air from the Arctic into Northern continents - increasing heavy snowfall in the UK. Dr Liu said: ‘The results of this study add to an increasing body of both observational and modeling evidence that indicates diminishing Arctic sea ice plays a critical role in driving recent cold and snowy winters over large parts of North America, Europe and east Asia.’ While the Arctic region has been warming strongly in recent decades there has been abnormally large snowfall in these areas. Changes: A satellite image taken in September 2010  shows the level of ice extending around the North Pole was the . third lowest ever recorded.  The image on the right from September 1979 . shows a far greater ice coverage. The purple outline shows the median . ice edge . Dr Liu, of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, said: ‘Here we demonstrate the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation. ‘This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. ‘Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapour content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. ‘We conclude the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.’ In November research showed there is less Arctic sea ice now than there has been at any time in the last 1,450 years.","There is less Arctic sea ice now than there has been at any time in the past 1,450 years ."
"The pleasure of growing sunflowers is about to reach new heights – with the arrival of a new seed that guarantees 17ft plants. Green-fingered pensioner Victoria Wakefield has spent 30 years painstakingly developing a new species called 'Helianthus Giraffe' by selecting the seeds of the tallest sunflower from a crop and growing them on the following year. She repeated the process over three decades until the sunflowers grew to an average height of 17ft. Victoria Wakefield spent 30 years painstakingly developing a new species called 'Helianthus Giraffe' The main reason for the bright yellow plant's dependable growth is that it doesn't flower until late August or early September, giving it all of the summer to grow. While some other varieties have been known to grow to similar heights, they are rare and freak occurrences whereas the Giraffe variety is consistently tall. Packets of seeds of the new species, described on the packet as 'possibly the tallest sunflower ever produced', have now gone on sale for £2.99. Mrs Wakefield, 70, who is being credited with breeding Helianthus Giraffe on the packet but is not taking any royalties from the sales, who regularly opens the gardens at her Grade II listed house to the public under the National Garden Scheme. She said yesterday: ‘In September time there wasn't a lot to see, especially for children, so I decided to start growing sunflowers. ‘As each year went by I used the seeds from the tallest one and planted them again the year later. I did this for 30 years until they consistently reached 17ft. The main reason for the bright yellow plant's dependable growth is that it doesn't flower until late August or early September . ‘People are amazed at the size of them.’ Mrs Wakefield, from Bramdean, Hampshire, is a member of the Royal Horticultural Society's herbaceous plant committee and mentioned her project colleague Simon Crawford. He sent a kilogram of the seeds to a production farm in Africa where they have been mass-grown for the British climate and the seeds from the flower heads placed in packets ready for sale. Mr Crawford, 57, said: ‘Because it is sunny and dry in Africa it is great for flowers. ‘Each sunflower produced between 100 and 150 seeds so from the ones we planted we had millions. ‘The Giraffe is taller than other varieties because it only flowers when the days become shorter in September time, meaning it has much longer to grow than those that flower in June.’ Suttons Seeds in Paignton, Devon, has been given the exclusive rights to sell Helianthus Giraffe in the UK. To ensure the sunflowers reach their potential, seeds need to be planted in April and spaced two feet apart. Although the height on the front of packet states 15ft, a spokesman for Suttons said they may need to increase that figure in the near future. He said: ‘The variety of sunflowers that are usually planted in the UK are the Giant Yellow, which reach an average of around 12ft tall. ‘The Giraffe variety will reach 17ft in height, possibly more, as long as they are sown in April, given the opportunity to climb and flower, and fed and watered regularly.’ He added: ‘These sunflowers are great for wildlife as they have pollen so they attract bees and other creatures. ‘The best thing about the Giraffe sunflowers is that they are British bred, they have been specifically grown in the UK climate.’","Victoria Wakefield has spent 30 years developing a new species of plant .

"Marco Pierre White arriving at the Rolls Building in London today where he launched a £174,000 claim against his former business partners . Celebrity chef Marco Pierre White is alleged to have hidden a stake in a pub in his name during his divorce from his wife, Mati. He denied the claims at the opening of a damages claim for £174,000 against two former business partners. The 51-year-old restaurateur says he was cheated out of his share of the 17th century Yew Tree Inn in Highclere, Hampshire. It was previously known as Marco Pierre White's Yew Tree Inn and was sold in June last year for £900,000. But . Pierre White says he has not received a penny from Andrew Parton and . Peter Feathermen who say he is not entitled to anything. His former business partners' QC Max Mallin said: 'You instructed everybody to hold of [granting you the shares] pending the outcome of your divorce.' But he refuted that, according to the Independent, saying: 'Why would I do that? My wife's law firms were Withers and they are quite shrewd... My name was above the door, there were [my] artworks on the walls, I had 38 per cent. 'I had nothing to hide... I would not try to deceive my wife'. Pierre White's split from his wife hit the headlines in October when she admitted smashing up his Range Rover and daubing blood-red graffiti his west London home. The 47-year-old used a child's scooter to break the front and rear windscreens of his 4x4 causing £12,000 of damage. Mr Parton and Mr Featherman have launched a counter claim for between £400,000 and £600,000 for failing to grant them a licence to use his name. Pierre White told the court that he promoted the business on his Great British Feast TV programme as part of his claim for damages for breach of contract and deceit. Marco Pierre White (pictured with wife Mati Conjero) denies that he tried to hide his assets from his wife during their divorce . He said under an agreement he should have had 38 per cent shares in the company that ran the restaurant. He . was not expecting to be paid for the use of his name but did expect to . get dividends and a share of the business if it was sold. He claimed . business increased because of his promotion of it. His . counsel Robert Deacon told Mr Justice Morgan that the 'well known . celebrity chef and restaurateur' claims damages to compensate him for . what would have been valuable shares if his partners had kept to the . agreement with him. But his former partners claim he would . only get the shares if he granted a licence to use his name without . charge, and no such licence was ever granted. They also say the removal of his name and resulting bad publicity led to a very big drop in turnover forcing them to sell. Mr Deacon said it would be 'absurd' for the chef 'to agree to his name being used in connection with a restaurant business unless he had an interest in the business and continued to have an interest or some control over the business whilst his name was being used or some protection over the use of his name.' The 51-year-old restaurateur claims he was cheated out of his share of the 17th century Yew Tree Inn (pictured) He added that the whole point of him 'investing in the Yew Tree restaurant and agreeing to continue to do so was that his name could be used as long as he remained a major shareholder in the business. This was the underlying commercial justification for allowing his name to be used.' He alleges that when the shares were issued in the company set up to run the business his partners 'saw an opportunity to cut him out of the picture yet continue to use his name in association with the restaurant business.' Pierre White became involved with the Yew Tree in 2007 and became a director and shareholder of the company that then ran it. He claims that under reorganisation in 2009 the new company bought all the shares in the old one and he should have been given 38 per cent of the new company to allow his name to continue to be used. When he did not get the shares he demanded his name be taken off the restaurant which it was in January 2011. He then sued for damages for deceit. The hearing, set to last four days, continues.","Former business partners are counter-suing him for £400,000 - £600,000 .

"A 29-year-old Moroccan man was arrested on Friday in an FBI sting operation near the U.S. Capitol while planning to detonate what police said he thought were live explosives. Amine El Khalifi of Alexandria, Virginia, was taken into custody a year after the FBI received a tip from an informant fearful of his anti-U.S. attitude. Authorities immediately began tracking the suspect. He was eventually arrested with a fake gun and explosives given to him by undercover FBI agents he believed were al-Qaeda members. Scroll down for video . Caught: Amine El Khalifi, a 29-year-old Moroccan who appeared in court Friday evening in . Alexandria, Virginia (artist rendering, right), tried to blow up the U.S. Capitol with what he . thought were live explosives . Authorities said the suspect was closely . monitored by law enforcement, and the would-be explosives had been . deactivated, so the public was never in danger. Officials say he has recently arrived at a federal court in Alexandria, where he is scheduled to appear later this evening. Two people briefed on the matter told The Associated Press he was not arrested on the Capitol grounds, and the FBI has had El Khalifi under surveillance around the clock for several weeks. A U.S. law enforcement official said the El Khalifi was canvassing the U.S. Capitol with violent intentions, Fox News first reported. Standing guard: A U.S. Capitol Police Officer looks out over the capitol after the 29-year-old Moroccan man was arrested for an alleged terror plot to stage an attack in Washington .

He was not believed to have any known . connections to al-Qaeda, the AP reported, though NBC News said that the . man had overstayed his visa and was in the country illegally. Police are currently canvassing El Khalifi's hometown of Alexandria as the investigation continues. Officials say they believe he was acting alone. They say he was targeting the Capitol Hill Visitor Centre, though he changed his mind about the intended target a few times. 'He wanted to set off the explosives where people would be around,' an official said to NBC News. El Khalifi expressed interest in . killing at least 30 people and considered targeting a building in . Alexandria and a restaurant, synagogue and a place where military . personnel gather in Washington. Property: One of El-Khalifi's residences in Arlington, Virginia under investigation by police . Busted: Police officers stand outside another of El Khalifi's residences in Arlington, Virginia . He finally settled on the Capitol after . canvassing that area a couple of times, a counterterrorism official told . the AP. Fox News said that he had come into the country with a family member and then popped up on the FBI’s radar. The investigation that led to El . Khalifi's arrest started last January on a confidential informant's tip . to the FBI, the Associated Press reported. The informant described a meeting . inside an Arlington apartment, where a person who produced an AK-47, two . revolvers and ammunition said the war on terror equated with a 'war on . Muslims' and urged the group to prepare for battle. El Khalifi, the FBI . learned, expressed agreement. Agents said he got more extreme as time passed, and allegedly had ambitions to become the first suicide bomber on U.S. soil. Federal agents posing as al-Qaeda . operatives provided him with what he thought was a suicide vest this . morning, though the explosives were deactivated. Scrutiny: Officials are searching the suspect's Arlington, Virginia home for clues . He was taken down by federal agents outside of the FBI's Wasington Field Office Joint Terrorism Task Force, CBS News said. The news network said that El Khalifi . was praying at a mosque somewhere in Washington area Friday morning, . before the alleged mission. An official told the Post that he was arrested only a few blocks from the Capitol in an alley. The suspect will appear in federal court as early as this afternoon. At least 20 people have been arrested . by federal agents on terrorism-related charges in the past year, the . Senate Intelligence Committee told the Post. Ever watchful: A police car sits in front of the U.S. Capitol building. Earlier today the FBI arrested a man who was allegedly going to blow up the visitor's centre of Capitol Hill .

Likewise, back in November 2010, a Somali-born teenager allegedly plotted to bomb a crowded Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. He was receiving help from what he thought were jihadists, but were in fact federal agents. The foiled plot comes only a day after the so-called underwear bomber, Nigerian-born Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for his failed Christmas Day attack.

"An eagle-eyed photographer has captured these incredible pictures of an orchid that looks just like a bird. Photographer Christian Kneidinger, 50, was taking pictures in a botanical garden in Linz, Austria, when he realised he was looking at something special. Initially the software engineer was trying to focus on the colour of the flowers but after an hour he took a closer look at the pink moth orchid and noticed an optical illusion of a bird in its centre. The optical illusion of a bird can be seen in the pink moth orchid found at Botanical Garden in Linz, Austria . Photographer Christian Kneidinger from Austria could not believe his eyes when he captured the images . ‘I showed other visitors what I had captured, but no one could believe it. Everyone was so surprised, even when I showed them the orchid,’ he said. ‘I was trying to get some beautiful pictures of some beautiful plants. I never expected to see something so magical.’ ‘I came by the bird completely by chance. I thought I was seeing things, but it felt so real. ‘I knew I had to capture it before it disappeared and I'd think my eyes had been deceiving me.’ Mr Kneidinger, who lives in Austria, used a DSLR 5D Mark III camera with a Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L lens and a Macro IS USM lens to capture the stunning pictures.

The Lausanne rehabilitation clinic which Schumacher, 45, left two weeks ago to return home - 254 days after suffering catastrophic head injuries during a ski holiday - confirmed it has trained-up the experts now attempting to get the seven-times world champion to live a normal life. A spokesman for the clinic confirmed: 'A large part of the team that cares for Michael now was trained by our specialists. We are following his treatment and are still a point of contact and entirely at his disposal.' Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher has a team of 15 medical experts treating him at a special clinic built in the grounds of his mansion home in Switzerland . Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm said last week he was not moving home because his medical condition had significantly changed. It is understood he remains mute and immobile with only periodic movements of his eyes. Experts call this the 'minimal consciousness' phase of a coma awakening. Schumacher was placed in an artificial coma on December 29 last year after smashing his head onto rocks while skiing at the French Alpine resort of Meribel. He remained in the coma for 159 days and was moved to Lausanne from the University Hospital of Grenoble just weeks ago. Manfred Spitzer, medical director at a specialist brain hospital in Germany, told the country's BILD newspaper: 'I do not know the condition of Michael Schumacher, but if it is stable, then the familiar surroundings of his home can certainly help for now.

The Formula 1 legend's children Mick, 15, and Gina-Maria, 17, are said to spend hours every day at his bedside. There were so many journalists  camped outside Schumacher's house on the shores of Lake Geneva last week that Swiss police were forced to move in and shield the property. A Russian TV crew was even reportedly trying to broadcast live from outside the house.

"Militants aligned with the self-proclaimed 'Islamic State' (ISIS) boasted Monday on Twitter that the terror army was responsible for U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's ouster. 'The Islamic State has toppled the US defense minister,' one of the group's social media agitator gloated Monday on Twitter, launching a hashtag with the same message. ISIS, known for its gruesome beheading videos, was praised in a long stream of tweets featuring a Photoshopped image depicting Hagel's head being severed. Other images featured cartoons of Obama kicking Hagel in the backside and mocking Hagel with emoji for getting choked up during his farewell remarks. 'Obama: You failed,' several of those tweets read in Arabic. 'Hagel: You need to slaughter dementia.' WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . The ISIS terror army's supporters flooded Twitter with digital high-fives on Monday after US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was forced out of his job . Hagel's sentimental side showed during his remarks alongside Obama on Monday, and ISIS sympathizers were quick to mock him for it . 'Obama, the mule of the Jews, has accepted Hagel's resignation,' read another. 'The resignation of US Secretary of War has shaken the thrones of tyrants everywhere,' claimed a third. Hagel submitted his resignation Monday following pressure from President Barack Obama, multiple sources confirmed. Administration officials said Obama made the decision Friday to ask his defense secretary, the only Republican in his cabinet, to step down after a series of meetings during the past month. The scapegoating move was characterized as a summary firing in some corners of the Obama administration. 'Make no mistake, Secretary Hagel was fired,” a plugged-in senior U.S. official told Fox News. This same official discounted Pentagon claims it was a mutual decision claiming President Obama has lost confidence in Hagel and that the White House had been planning to announce his exit for weeks. 'The president felt he had to fire someone. He fired the only Republican in his cabinet. Who is that going to piss off that he cares about?' Hagel, 68, was brought into the Pentagon five years after retiring from the U.S. Senate to manage a continuing troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and oversee a shrinking Defense Department as the Obama administration managed budget reductions required by automatic cuts in the 2013 federal budget. Clearing him out of the Pentagon as America returns to more active war footing will dangle a tantalizing history-making opportunity in front of the president, with a female successor among the most logical candidates under discussion for the first time in American history. The first serious signs that Hagel had fallen out of favor emerged in August as the White House began focusing on a strategy to push back against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. GRUESOME: Hagel is depicted as an ISIS decapitation victim in a Photoshopped pictire that circulated among jihadis Monday on Twitter . KNIVES OUT: ISIS makes no bones about taunting and threatening US officials and it's taking credit for Hagel's sacking . Obama had mocked the terror group in an interview with The New Yorker in response to a question about the group's violent resurgence. 'I think the analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant,' the president said. 'I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.' In contrast, Hagel told reporters on August 21 that ISIS is 'an imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else.'

'We cannot defeat this enemy without a broad, coordinated, well-thought-out effort that has the strong support of the American people,' Boehner continued. 'Thus far, this administration has fallen well short.' Hagel's departure will likely be welcomed by some parts of America's Jewish lobby as well.

"We all know plants absorb carbon dioxide and expel oxygen, giving us the safe and clean air that  humans breathe. But now scientists have said that some invasive species of plant such as Japanese knotweed and kudzu can unbalance an ecosystem and release carbon stored in soil into the atmosphere. The researchers at Clemson University in South Carolina estimate that, in a year, the invasion of kudzu in the U.S. alone can unleash the equivalent amount of carbon from 540 million gallons (2.5 billion litres) of gasoline. A study suggests that invasive plant species such as Japanese knotweed (pictured) could be unleashing a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere, because it causes the ecosystem it inhabits to become unbalanced and releases carbon that was previously stored in the ground . The scientists examined how . invasion by exotic plant species can affect the ability of soil to store . greenhouse gases. Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians. Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days. Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways. Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn. The research could have far-reaching implications for how people manage agricultural land and native ecosystems. In . a paper published in the scientific journal New Phytologist, plant . ecologist Nishanth Tharayil and graduate student Mioko Tamura show that . invasive plants can accelerate the greenhouse effect by releasing carbon . stored in soil into the atmosphere. Since soil stores more carbon than both the atmosphere and terrestrial vegetation combined, the repercussions for how agricultural land and ecosystems are managed to store carbon could be dramatic. In their study, Tamura and Tharayil examined the impact of encroachment of Japanese knotweed and kudzu on the soil carbon storage in native ecosystems. They found that the invasion of kudzu released carbon that was stored in native soils, while the carbon amassed in soils invaded by knotweed is more prone to oxidation and is subsequently lost to the atmosphere. 'Our findings highlight the capacity of invasive plants to effect climate change by destabilising the carbon pool in soil and shows that invasive plants can have profound influence on our understanding to manage land in a way that mitigates carbon emissions,' Tharayil said. Tharayil estimates that kudzu invasion results in the release of 4.8 metric tons of carbon annually, equal to the amount of carbon stored in 11.8 million acres of U.S. forest. This is the same amount of carbon emitted annually by consuming 540 million gallons (2.5 billion litres) of gasoline or burning 5.1 billion pounds (2.3 billion kilograms) of coal. The researchers found that the invasion of kudzu (picture) released carbon that was stored in native soils, while the carbon amassed in soils invaded by knotweed was more prone to oxidation and is subsequently lost to the atmosphere. The kudzu invasion in the U.S. results in the release of 4.8 metric tons of carbon annually . 'Climate change is causing massive range expansion of many exotic and invasive plant species,' said Tharayil. 'As the climate warms, kudzu will continue to invade northern ecosystems, and its impact on carbon emissions will grow.' The findings provide particular insight into agricultural land-management strategies and suggest that it is the chemistry of plant biomass added to soil rather than the total amount of biomass that has the greatest influence on the ability of soil to harbour stable carbon. But the researchers point out there is a way to mitigate the effects. 'Our study indicates that incorporating legumes such as beans, peas, soybeans, peanuts and lentils that have a higher proportion of nitrogen in its biomass can accelerate the storage of carbon in soils,' Tharayil said. And Thrarayil's laboratory will be following up the research to gain a deeper understanding of soil carbon storage and invasion.","Researchers in South Carolina say invading species are releasing carbon .
The scientists found both kudzu and knotweed unbalanced ecosystems .
This caused them to release carbon that had been stored in the soil .

"It cost six million dollars to create bionic superhero Steve Austin. Scientists however have built a man from artificial limbs for a sixth of the price.

Scientists have built a man from artificial limbs known as Rex which is made up of limbs and organs from around the world . Built for a Channel 4 documentary exploring how far technology has developed, Rex raises ethical dilemmas. Research on advanced prosthetics and artificial organs means scientists could soon not only replace missing body parts, but improve on them . In the Six Million Dollar Man astronaut Steve Austin, played by Lee Majors, was left horribly injured after his craft crashed. The opening sequence of the 1970s TV series featured an off-camera voice intoning: ‘Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology.’ Austin was given a bionic arm and legs and an artificial zoom-lens eye. He has the technology: Dr Bertolt Meyer, who has a bionic limb, has a drink with Rex . The C4 programme’s presenter is Dr Bertolt Meyer, a social psychologist from Switzerland who himself has a £30,000 bionic limb after being born without a left hand.

George Annas, Professor of Bioethics and Human Rights at Boston University, warned: ‘I think when it comes to our bodies, the danger is we might change what it is to be human. ‘Create a new species that may turn around to bite us, similar to the Frankenstein myth, where your creature let loose in the world becomes destructive and uncontrollable.’ The bionic man is being built from $1,000,000 (£640,000) of limbs and organs by leading UK roboticists Richard Walker and Matthew Godden. There is the artificial eye, which consists of a microchip implanted into the retina that receives images captured by a camera housed on the patient’s glasses. It sends electrical pulses that are translated by the brain into shapes and patterns. Professor Robert MacLaren, from Oxford University, said:  ‘We are hoping patients who are completely blind will be able to see basic shapes and objects.’ Scientists are hoping prosthetic replacements for failing hearts, kidneys, pancreas and spleens could one day solve the worldwide shortage of donor organs. One example, the SynCardia Systems artificial heart is already saving lives, with more than 1,000 implanted. Powered by a battery, it can temporarily replace a diseased heart until a donor is found.

"Charged: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been formally charged in the Boston Marathon bombings and he will be tried in the U.S. criminal justice system . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been formally charged in the Boston Marathon bombings, officials announced on Monday. Tsarnaev, 19, was arraigned in his hospital bed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Monday by a magistrate judge, court officials said. He is specifically charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction - namely, an improvised explosive device or IED - against persons and property within the United States resulting in death, and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death, according to the criminal complaint. If he is convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of death or imprisonment for life, as well as a fine of up to $250,000. The charging documents reveal dramatic new details of the investigation and events following the bombings, including a list of items obtained from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's college dorm room and claims that during a carjacking at least one suspect was advertising his role in the marathon bombings. 'Although our investigation is ongoing, today’s charges bring a successful end to a tragic week for the city of Boston, and for our country,' U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. He will not be tried as an enemy . combatant because he is a naturalized U.S. citizen and under federal . law, citizens cannot be tried in military commissions, the White House . said Monday. Instead, he will be tried in the U.S. justice system. Tsaernaev, . who was born in Russia, is in serious condition with gunshot wounds to . his head, neck, legs and hand. The wound to his neck has made it difficult for him to speak, . according to hospital officials. He remains under heavy guard while he receives treatment for his injuries. Scroll down for video . Wounded: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, seen here moments after he was pulled from the boat where he was hiding, suffered a throat wound and a leg wound . His older brother and suspected accomplice in the bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a firefight with police early Friday morning. The twin bombings last Monday killed three people and injured more than 180. The younger Tsarnaev was captured alive following a massive manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement officials. He was eventually discovered hiding in a boat parked outside a home in Watertown, Mass. CARJACKING . The charging papers allege that the Tsarnaev brothers carjacked a man around midnight on Thursday and that the eldest of the two told the car's owner that he had carried out the marathon bombings. 'The victim stated that while he was sitting in his car on a road in Cambridge, a man approached and tapped on his passenger-side window,' according to the charges. 'When the victim rolled down the window, the man reached in, opened the door, and entered the victim's vehicle. The man pointed a firearm at the victim and stated, ""Did you hear about the Boston explosion?"" and ""I did that.""' The gunman, identified by the FBI as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, removed the magazine from his firearm to show the victim that it was loaded, then re-inserted it and said, 'I am serious.' Dzhokhar, right, and his older brother Tamerlan, left, are suspected accomplices in the marathon bombings . Tamerlan Tsarnaev then allegedly forced the victim to drive to a location where they picked up Dzhokhar. One of the suspects then got behind the wheel of the car and demanded money and an ATM card from the victim. The suspects drove to a gas station and got out of the car to withdraw money, at which point the victim managed to escape. FIREFIGHT . The stolen vehicle with the two suspects inside was located by authorities a short time later in Watertown, Mass. As police cruisers descended on the scene, the men threw at least two small IEDs from the car windows, sparking a firefight. During the exchange of fire, the older Tsarnaev brother, Tamerlan, got out of the car and was shot several times. Meanwhile, the younger brother managed to escape in the car - but not without first mowing over his brother's body. Tamerlan was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead, and authorities launched a manhunt for Dzhokhar, who apparently abandoned the carjacked vehicle shortly after making his getaway. Site: A blood stain can be seen on the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding after a massive manhunt that left the Boston area paralyzed in fear . CACHE OF EXPLOSIVES . From the scene of the shootout, the FBI recovered two unexploded IEDs, as well as the remnants of numerous exploded devices. Another in-tact device was found inside the abandoned vehicle. A preliminary examination of the explosive devices that were used at the Boston Marathon revealed that they were low-grade explosives housed inside pressure cookers with metallic BBs and nails. Many of the BBs were contained within an adhesive material, authorities said. Found: Authorities discovered a white hat and black jacket in Dzhokar Tsarnaev's (left) dormroom like the ones worn by the suspect in photos from the day of the bombings . Investigators discovered the exact same type of explosives at the scene of the firefight and inside the abandoned getaway car. MANHUNT . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was on the run for nearly a full day when authorities located him hiding in a boat parked outside a home in Watertown. He engaged in a firefight with police from inside the boat before he was eventually coaxed out of the vessel, authorities said. He had visible injuries, including apparent gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs, and hand. He was searched and authorities found several means of identification in his pockets, including credit cards and a Dartmouth student ID. 'At the end they were just making . demands of him: Show your hands, lift your shirt. And eventually that's . what he did,' Watertown Police Chief Edward Deveau told ABC News. 'He . was very slow and lethargic in every move that he made and they could . see that there was no device on his chest. They kept creeping closer to . him and then they felt it safe enough to pull him away from the boat.' Authorities initially said they couldn't question the terror suspect because of his severe throat wound. 'We . are hoping, for a host of reasons, that the suspect survives, because . we have a million questions, and those questions need to be answered,' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said. Authorities conducted a search at Tsarnaev's Dartmouth dorm, where they found a pyrotechnic as well as a white hat and black jacket like the ones he is pictured wearing in surveillance footage from the scene of the marathon bombings. MARATHON BOMBINGS . The charging documents also contain new details about the marathon bombings and allege that at least one of the suspects was using a cell phone shortly before the explosions. The documents state that at approximately 2:41 p.m. - about eight minutes before the explosions -  both bombing suspects were standing together about a half-block from the Forum Restaurant on Boylston Street near the finish line, according to footage from surveillance cameras. About one minute later, one suspect - believed to be Tamerlan Tsarnaev - appears to break away from the crowd and begin walking east on Boylston street toward the finish line. At 2:45 p.m., Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - referred to in the charging documents as 'Bomber Two' - walks in the same direction but stops short of the finish line, directly in front of Forum Restaurant. 'He appears to have the thumb of his right hand hooked under the strap of his knapsack and a cell phone in his left hand,' FBI special agent Daniel R. Genck wrote in the documents. About 15 seconds later, 'Bomber Two' appears to drop his knapsack to the ground. The suspect  stays in that position for about four minutes, occasionally looking at his cell phone and once appearing to snap a picture with it. 'At some point he appears to look at his phone, which is held at approximately waist level, and may be manipulating the phone,' the charging papers state. 'Approximately 30 seconds before the first explosion, he lifts his phone to his ear as if he is speaking on his cell phone, and keeps it there for approximately 18 seconds. 'A few seconds after he finishes the call, the large crowd of people around him can be seen reacting to the first explosion.' As others are reacting to the explosion, 'Bomber Two' 'calmly but rapidly' begins moving away from the finish line  - without his knapsack, which he had left on the ground. About 10 seconds later, an explosion occurs in the location of the discarded knapsack. 'I can discern nothing in that location in the period before the explosion that might have caused that explosion, other than Bomber Two's knapsack,' Genck wrote.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was arraigned in his hospital bed, where he remains in serious condition .

"More issues in Ferguson: Former Ferguson, Missouri correctional officer Jaris Hayden is accused in a criminal suit of having sex with a pregnant inmate and then setting her free. In a separate civil suit, the inmate says she was raped by Hayden . A former Ferguson corrections officer faces felony charges and a lawsuit for allegedly having sex with a pregnant inmate and allowing her to escape, a case that comes as the St. Louis suburb's police force is already under scrutiny following the shooting death of Michael Brown. Jaris Hayden, 29, will be arraigned December 3 on charges of acceding to corruption by a public servant, permitting escape and two counts of sexual contact with a prisoner. His attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said Hayden posted $10,000 bond and intends to plead not guilty. The incident allegedly happened October 9, 2013. Hayden was indicted by a grand jury earlier this month, and the woman filed her lawsuit against Hayden on Friday in federal court. In her suit, the woman identified as J.W. alleges the misconduct began as soon as she got to the jail, when she was booked by Hayden and he told her 'You smell good' and said 'this will teach you a lesson.' According to the woman's lawsuit, she was taken to jail for driving with expired license plates and giving the officer a false name. The suit said her boyfriend had already posted $200 bond when Hayden took her to a boiler room at the jail and forced her to have sex. But while still in the cell, J.W. says she told Hayden she'd 'do anything to go home,' but that she did not mean sex notes Buzzfeed. Nonetheless, J.W. says Hayden took her downstairs and told her to perform oral sex on him, which she did. The suit says they then had vaginal intercourse. Afterwards, Hayden allegedly set her free out a side door. A pubic hair J.W. says she took from the scene has since tested positive as Hayden's. Ferguson City Attorney Stephanie Karr said in a statement that after the city learned of the complaint against Hayden, it began its own investigation that led to his firing on Nov. 19, 2013. He had worked for the city for 18 months. Karr said city officials and employees cooperated with federal authorities in the investigation. Shocking: The alleged incident occurred at the Ferguson City Jail, where a plaintiff named only as J.W. says she was raped in the boiler room before being let out a side door . The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. The woman was only identified by her initials in the lawsuit. Bevis Schock, the woman's attorney, said the case raises renewed concerns in Ferguson. 'The numerous acts of violence against the citizenry by law enforcement of the City of Ferguson constitute a pattern,' Schock said in the lawsuit. The criminal case is different than the lawsuit in that it alleges that Hayden accepted the woman's offer to perform sex acts in exchange for allowing her to escape. Schock said the woman was raped and there was no such agreement. The suit said the woman was several months pregnant. Ferguson has been the site of protests since the 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed, was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch, said the Wilson grand jury is not the same one that indicted Hayden. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in advance the grand jury decision about whether Darren Wilson (left) will be charged in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown (right) A St. Louis County town that neighbors Ferguson, Missouri, is warning residents to prepare for potential unrest that may follow the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case. Berkeley officials passed out flyers this week urging its 9,000 residents to be prepared just as they would in the event of a major storm, with plenty of food, water and medicine on hand in case they're unable to leave home for several days. The flyer says Lambert Airport will be protected by the National Guard, but airport spokesman Jeff Lea says that's wrong. Lea says the airport will continue to be protected by its own security force. Brown was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. A suburban St. Louis school district says schools will get early notice once the Ferguson grand jury reaches a decision. A letter on the Hazelwood School District's site from Superintendent Grayling Tobias says the St. Louis County prosecutor's office will alert districts 24 hours before the media if the decision is on a weekend. If it's a weekday, Tobias says districts will learn three hours before media, so students can be sent home before potential protests. District spokesman Jack Wang says districts won't be told what the decision is.","Jaris Hayden, 29, will be arraigned December 3 on criminal charges he had sex with an inmate then let her go .

"A mother has spoken about the horrifying moment when her phone charger exploded and parts of it hit the moses basket where her five-week-old baby was sleeping. Donna Senior had bought the charger for her iPhone a few days earlier, but after plugging it in for the first time, she and her newborn daughter Ella were awoken by a loud bang in the early hours of the morning. Half of the phone charger had come away from the plug socket, leaving the connection in the wall black and frazzled. The charger, which can be used for iPhones, exploded in the middle of the night and hit a moses basket . Mrs Senior, a primary school support assistant from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, said: 'It just blew up, it was terrifying. I nearly jumped out my skin. 'It was dark in the room as it was the middle of the night and I didn’t dare look round for a minute as I didn’t have a clue what had happened. Donna Senior was asleep next to her daughter Ella's moses basket when the explosion happened . 'My little girl Ella has colic and so we are sleeping in the living room together so not to wake everyone else up during the night. 'When the charger came away from the wall it hit her moses basket, I’m surprised the whole thing didn’t go up.' Mrs Senior, 30, bought the £8 charger from The Phone Shop in Huddersfield Bus Station, West Yorkshire, on December 20, but didn’t use it until New Years Eve. However when she returned it to the shop with the blown-up charger and explained what happened, a shop worker refused to give her a refund and instead offered her a replacement. 'They didn’t seem to care what had happened, even when I explained that my baby had been in the room,' said Mrs Senior. 'It was only £8 so I wasn’t that bothered about the money, but it was more about principle. The man working there tried to sell me another one which ""had been tested"", but there was no way I was going to trust another one from them. 'It could have been a completely different story, both of us could have been killed.' A spokesman from The Phone Shop said: 'We have been contacted by Trading Standards regarding this matter and we are currently making enquiries. 'All of our products are tested by the manufacturer before they go on sale because we do not want to tell anything which is faulty, and we are very sorry to hear what has happened to this lady. Mrs Senior bought the charger from the Phone Shop in Huddersfield Bus Station . 'If she can provide a receipt for the charger, we will of course provide her with a full refund.' Tony Downham, of West Yorkshire Trading Standards Service, said they would be investigating the incident at Mrs Senior’s home. He said: 'There have been reports of house fires in London and the south east due to this sort of thing.'

"Lasha Horton was pushed through a glass panel by her best friend at her home . A woman has admitted to throwing a model through a glass panel, ending her career as a result of the injuries she inflicted. Genavese Justin attacked best friend . Lasha Horton, 23, at her home in Top Valley, Nottinghamshire, soon after . she had signed a modelling contract with Demus Castings. Justin, 24, admitted wounding with intent at Nottingham Crown Court today. After the attack, doctors tried to heal the deep wound that went across her face and it took two days for plastic surgeons to work on. She had hoped work could be done to retain her looks, but she had to give up her £15,000-a-year contract. Nicholas Demus, who runs the agency, said: 'She was due to appear in music videos with some up-and-coming artists. 'I . did have some magazines that wanted to shoot her over 2013, including . Flavour fashion magazine, but we’ve had to start re-booking after we got . the news. 'At the moment it . is going to prove to be a bit difficult with her current situation . because obviously normally facial appearance as well as physical . appearance is very important.' Justin . was told today she should expect a jail term when she is sentenced next . month. Judge Jonathan Teare said: 'The fact I am giving you bail is no . indication of sentence. These were really unpleasant injuries. 'I will only make up my mind at sentence, when I have read the victim impact statement and an up-to-date pre-sentence report.' The . disturbing attack has left Miss Horton terrified to go out and . destroyed her promising career - she needed 30 stitches to close the . appalling slash. She has been left with permanent scarring across her face and was just millimetres away from losing her left eye. But she is banishing her demons by vowing to continue her work for charity and hopes to continue helping those who need her. Miss . Horton said: 'Although I can no longer model I would like to continue . my charity work and I thought I could try to turn this into something . positive. A picture taken before plastic surgeons worked on her face show just how deep the wound was . Miss Horton said she has been left without any confidence and finds it difficult to trust people . Before the attack, Miss Horton won a £15,000-a-year with a London modelling agency but is now out of work . 'This happened in a matter of seconds but it's devastated my life. I can no longer pursue the career I wanted.' She added that people needed to realise just how much of an impact a single moment can have. She . said: 'I have lost a lot of modelling contracts that I was supposed to . do. I have not been able to work since and I do not like leaving the . house. I feel intimidated. I only go out with make-up on. 'If . my best friend can do this to me than anyone can. I have been left with . scars all over my body. I was the most confident person before the . attack. A lot of people have noticed my confidence go down. 'I've . decreased my circle of friends now and I do not trust anyone. I still . do not know why she did it. There are so many things I want to ask her. 'You give someone so much love and care and in a split second she ruined my life.'

"One year on: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is spending his days in literal solitary confinement at The Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts . One year ago today he and his brother killed three people and wounded 260 with two home-made pressure cooker bombs at the Boston marathon. Two days after the worst terror attack on American soil since 9/11 the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went to a party and acted as if nothing had happened before launching a rampaging killing and kidnapping spree across Boston with his older brother, Tamerlan. Now he languishes inside a federal medical prison, where he cannot watch television, read newspapers and is being urged to convert to Christianity by his many supporters on the outside who believe he is innocent. Imprisoned at the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, on 30 charges of terror - 17 of which carry the death penalty - Tsarnaev, 20, only receives visits from his legal team, a psychiatrist and his immediate family. He is allowed one phone call a week and one letter - three pages, double sided - and any newspapers he gets have the classified ads and letters to the editor ripped out. This is because the government fears any . coded messages to the young man who allegedly confessed to a jihad . against the United States from his hospital bed after he was shot during . his gunfight in suburban Boston four days after the bombings. Devens Federal Medical Center: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is currently languishing in near total isolation at the center while he recovers from his wounds and waits for his November trial . He has reportedly recovered from wounds . to his neck, arms, hands and legs sustained during the bloody gun battle . on Boston's streets following the murder of MIT police officer Sean . Collier. Held under special administrative measures approved by the United States attorney general, Tsarnaev is treated as one of the most dangerous inmates in federal custody and a court order bars his legal team or family from talking about anything he may have said to them. Since he ran over and killed Tamerlan during the dramatic Watertown shootout days after the bombings, the only glimpse into Tsarnaev's life has been when it was revealed he told his parents in Dagestan that 'everything is good' in a phone call. Indeed, despite his restricted communication with the outside world, Tsarnaev has been sent thousands of letters - most offering support, some protesting his innocence and others trying to convince him to convert to Christianity. Twin detonations: Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race in April last year . Surrender: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, bloody and disheveled with the red dot of a rifle laser sight on his forehead, raises his hand from inside a boat at the time of his capture by law enforcement authorities in Watertown, Massachusetts on April 19, 2013 . One such backer is Crystel Clary, a 35-year-old single mother from Wisconsin who told The New York Times she has written to Tsarnaev 10 times a month since the April 15 attacks. She writes him letters about the latest hip-hop albums from Eminem and the latest Hollywood release. She has even sent him Valentines Day cards and a birthday card - both of which have been returned. However, other letters have not been sent back - but Clary has not yet received one reply from him. Moreso, Clary is adamant that Tsarnaev did not commit the bombings and that the state is lying in its case against him. Captured: This frame grab from a video released by the FBI on Thursday, April 18, 2013, shows suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking along Boylston Street in Boston on April 15 . 'You can tell he didn’t do it,' she said. 'There is too much suspicious stuff going on in this case.' As Tsarnaev's legal team prepare for his November trial, they have begun to complain about intentionally interference from the prosecutors - who they accuse of dragging their heels on releasing their files. One reason why he is kept almost to solitary confinement is to halt any attempts he may make to recruit others. After his capture, 'Tsarnaev reaffirmed his commitment to jihad and expressed hope that his actions would inspire others to engage in violent jihad,' the Justice Department stated in a court filing in August. And it seems that these visits are not recorded without prejudice towards the 20-year-old bomber. Indeed, earlier this year, an FBI agent allegedly overheard Boston marathon suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev make a 'statement to his detriment' when his sister visited him in prison. Suspects: This combination of images released by the FBI on Thursday, April 18, 2013, shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan on April 15 on Boylston Street in Boston . Prosecutors did not reveal what Tsarnaev said, but they objected to what they called an attempt by Tsarnaev's lawyers to suppress the statement. Tsarnaev made the remark when an investigator working for his lawyers accompanied Tsarnaev's sister to a prison visit, a meeting that was monitored by an FBI agent, prosecutors said. The defense investigator started to explain to Tsarnaev's sister the rationale behind special restrictions placed on Tsarnaev in prison, prosecutors said. They say Tsarnaev, 'despite the presence of an FBI agent and an employee of the Federal Public Defender, was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent.' Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty in a terror attack at last year's marathon. Two pressure cooker bombs were placed near the marathon finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev for crimes that include using a weapon of mass destruction. Tsarnaev's lawyers say the presence of the FBI agent during prison visits by Tsarnaev's two sisters 'has thwarted the defense ability to develop important mitigation information.'","Dzokhar Tsarnaev, 20, lives a life of virtual solitary confinement one year after the deadly Boston bombings .

"A sinister airborne surveillance camera gives the U.S. military the ability to track movements in an entire city like a real-time Google Street View. The ARGUS-IS array can be mounted on unmanned drones to capture an area of 15 sq/miles in an incredible 1,800MP - that's 225 times more sensitive than an iPhone camera. From 17,500ft the remarkable surveillance system can capture objects as small as 6in on the ground and allows commanders to track movements across an entire battlefield in real time.

Autonomous Real-time Ground Ubiquitous Surveillance-Imaging System) works by stringing together an array of 368 digital camera imaging . chips.

System) strings together an array of 368 digital camera . imaging chips into a single unit . That tremendous level of detail makes it sensitive enough to not only track people moving around on the ground thousands of feet below, but even to see what they are doing or carrying. The ARGUS array sends its live feed to the ground where it connects to a touch-screen command room interface. Using this, operators can zoom in to any area within the camera's field of view, with up to 65 zoom windows open at once. Each video window is electronically steerable independent of the others, and can either provide continuous imagery of a fixed area on the ground or be designated to automatically keep a specified target in the window. Sinister: The system tracks all moving objects in its field of view, highlighting them with coloured boxes, allowing operators to track movements across an area as and when they happen . The system automatically tracks any . moving object it can see, including both vehicles and individuals on . foot, highlighting them with coloured boxes so they can be easily . identified. It also records . everything, storing an approximate million terabytes of data a day - . the equivalent of 5,000 hours of high-definition video footage. 'So you can go back and say I'd like to see what happened at this particular location three days, two hours [and] four minutes ago, and it will actually show you what happened as if you were watching it live,' said Mr Antoniades. iPad next?

Dr Steven Wein, director of optical sensor systems at BAE Systems, said: 'The ARGUS-IS system overcomes the fundamental limitations of current airborne surveillance systems. 'Very high-resolution imaging systems required for vehicle and dismount tracking typically have a ""soda-straw"" view that is too small for persistent coverage. 'Existing wide-area systems have either inadequate resolution or require multiple passes or revisits to get updates.' BAE are now said to be working on an infra-red version of ARGUS that would allow commanders total surveillance of an area even at night.","The ARGUS-IS can view an area of 15 sq/miles in a single image .

"Nicky Lovell was today jailed for 10 years after knocking down and killing Ross and Clare Simons . A banned driver who knocked down and killed a 'perfect' couple as they rode on a tandem bike had two children in his car it was revealed today as he was sentenced. Heroin addict Nicholas Lovell crashed into Ross and Clare Simons as he tried to outrun police - with a 16 month old baby and 12-year-old in his vehicle. Lovell, 38, left the couple dying by the side of the road and while awaiting sentencing bragged to other inmates that he would get away 'with four years'. The Independent Police Complaints Commission watchdog are investigating as Lovell was driving away from an Avon and Somerset Police patrol car moments before the collision. He was jailed for ten years and six months at Bristol Crown Court today after pleading guilty to causing the deaths of the couple by dangerous driving in the crash at Hanham, near Bristol, on January 27 this year. He was also banned from driving for life. He had also admitted driving while disqualified during a previous hearing. Lovell, who has a 20-year history of crime and motoring offences, admitted causing the deaths of Ross, 34, and Clare, 30, at a previous hearing. On the day they died the couple - who were about to . start IVF treatment and would this week have celebrated their second anniversary - were on their way to visit friends in Hanham, Bristol. At a hearing packed with the couple's family and friends in the public gallery Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told Lovell: 'You have a serious drug problem but your deep selfishness and disregard for others is breathtaking. 'In your system you had morphine, methadone and cocaine. 'I am going to pass a sentence on you with the very maximum term the law allows me to because I regard this offence as worst possible example.' His partner Louise Cox, 35, was jailed for twelve months for trying to cover up the fact he was illegally driving her Citroen Picasso. The judge told her: 'You were . perverting the course of public justice in very serious circumstances, . the death of a young couple before your very eyes.' Ross and Clare Simons, who died as they cycled on a tandem bike, were described as the 'perfect couple' Kelly Woodruff, sister of Ross Simons, with his father Edwin Simons, makes a statement outside Bristol Crown Court after Nicky Lovell was jailed for 10 years and six months today for killing her brother and his wife Clare . Kelly Woodruff (centre), and father of Ross Simons, Edwin,  (front, 4th right). Ms Woodruff said 'They were two amazing people and so, so loved. To have them taken away from us is heart- wrenching' In the run up to the collision a police officer in a patrol car recognised Lovell behind the wheel and knew he was banned. Lovell failed to stop when the officer switched on his blue light, disappearing from view. Prosecutor Andrew MacFarlane said . Cox's 12-year-old son, who was in the front passenger seat, told police . the speedo reached up to 60 mph before the crash. Mr MacFarlane said: 'One onlooker . described the driving as exceptionally erratic, fast and dangerous. Miss . Belinda Jones saw the car driving dangerously fast. 'No sooner had it passed her sight then she heard a ""loud, horrendous bang"", then a slightly quieter bang. Louise Cox has been jailed for a year for perverting the course of justice after providing a false name and description . 'She then saw debris appearing flying . in the air and rolling down the road from the . direction she had seen the car disappear in.' Witnesses saw Lovell get out of the steaming wreckage, followed by Cox who was cradling her baby. Mr MacFarlane added: 'One witness . said she heard Louise Cox say to Nicholas Lovell, ""wait for me, wait for . a minute"", to which Lovell said ""no"".' The force of the impact instantly . killed Ross and Clare, from Staple Hill, Bristol and left their new . tandem bike in three pieces. Lovell fled the scene and left lying Cox to tell police a mystery man in a red sweater had been driving, leading detectives on a wild goose chase before Lovell handed himself in the next day when traces of drugs were found in his body. Despite finally pleading guilty, Lovell has never apologised for causing the couple's death. He also admitted driving while . disqualified. Defending Lovell, Simon Morgan said he could offer no . mitigation other than his guilty plea. He said: 'He accepts through that plea . his genuine regret for the anxiety he has caused but accepts the . expressing of this is simply not good enough.' Edward Burgess, for Cox, said: 'All I . can say in relation to her was that she was not the driver and that the . evidence from her son put forward as a witness is not to the effect that . she encouraged dangerous driving.' Fifteen years ago Lovell warned he would either kill or be killed through his reckless driving. He already had 13 convictions . for driving whilst disqualified since 1991 and a further four for . dangerous driving since 1995 before he killed Ross and Clare. In one incident he tried to escape police by driving through a subway. On another he sped along a pavement forcing people to leap out of his way. The scene where the Mr and Mrs Simon died in January. The happy couple were described as 'two peas in a pod' by friends and family . His warning about killing came in . 1998 after a 70mph head-on crash with another car in Bristol when he . was high on drugs. Lovell only stopped then when his clapped-out Rover . lost a wheel. In addition, Lovell has been repeatedly jailed for violent . crimes to fuel his lifelong heroin habit. In 2003 he was jailed for five years for an armed robbery at a shop. In 2006 - within weeks of being released - he committed an aggravated burglary and got another 12 months in prison. In 2009 he was given yet another ban . for dangerous driving - but each time he has simply ignored the courts . and carried on as before. In sharp contrast, Ross and Clare were . described as ‘a perfect couple' by relatives who held candlelit vigils . at the scene of their. 'Although he has been given the maximum . sentence - and we thanks the judge for that - we feel cheated by the . justice system for the tragic and needless loss of their lives' - Kelly Woodruff, sister of Ross Simons . Ross's sister Kelly Woodruff said: . 'They were two amazing people and so, so loved. To have them taken away . from us is heart-wrenching. 'They were the perfect couple. They loved each other unconditionally, they were made for each other.' After the sentencing Detective Chief . Inspector Rachel Williams said: 'Nicholas Lovell is a heartless man who . has shown no remorse for the deaths of Ross and Clare. 'He needlessly took away the lives of . this innocent couple who were looking forward to a long and happy future . together. It took just a few reckless moments to snatch that away. 'Nicholas Lovell and Louise Cox both . knew he should never have been behind the wheel of the car. I am . confident Clare and Ross would be here today if he had not driven. 'The sentence passed highlights the . seriousness of both Lovell and Cox's actions. While it will never bring . Ross and Clare back I sincerely hope it brings some comfort to their . families.' Outside court the victims' families said they felt cheated by the justice system because no-one had stopped Lovell from repeatedly offending over the years. Ross Simons, 34, and wife Clare, 30 following their wedding. Family said they were looking forward to a long and happy future together . Outside court the family of the victims' (pictured on their wedding day) said they felt cheated by the justice system because no-one had stopped Lovell from repeatedly offending over the years . Relatives of the fun loving couple said 'We are not just mourning the present but the wonderful future they would surely have given us' Ross's father Edwin Simons said: 'He is going to serve three years for each of our children's lives. 'With his considerable history it needs looking into because this has gone on for years and years.' Kelly Woodruff, Ross's sister said: 'We are all totally devastated by the loss of Ross and Clare. Their lives were cut short by the result of selfish actions of a banned driver. 'Our case is made worse by the sentence handed out today, it will never be enough and it will never bring them back. 'Although he has been given the maximum sentence - and we thank the judge for that - we feel cheated by the justice system for the tragic and needless loss of their lives. 'The people who took their lives will never understand what they have taken away from us and have never shown remorse. 'We and those close to Ross and Clare have been given life sentences. 'We are not just mourning the present but the wonderful future they would surely have given us.' She added: 'We are all truly devastated by the loss of Ross and Clare. 'Their lives were cut short as a result of selfish actions of a driver who was banned from being on the roads. 'If these individuals had thought before getting behind the wheel, Ross and Clare’s deaths would have been avoided and they would still be with us today. Edwin Simons, Mr Simons’ father, thanked everyone who supported the family.","Heroin addict Nicholas Lovell jailed for ten years and six months .

"Could the brutal murders attributed to Jack the Ripper have been committed by a woman charity worker in a perverse bid to bring the harrowing conditions in the East End into the light? This is the theory put forward in a new novel about the Victorian serial killer, whose elusive identity has occupied criminologists for more than a century. During the 1888 murder spree in east London's Whitechapel, the Ripper killed women and removed their sexual and internal organs with such surgical precision that many believed he had to be a doctor. Killer queen? An author has put forward the theory that Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper was a woman . The Seduction Of Mary Kelly, by William J Perring. The author wrote the book over five years . Now author William J Perring has raised the possibility in The Seduction Of Mary Kelly, his novel about the life and times of the final victim, that it was perhaps not 'Jack' the Ripper, but 'Julia' - a Salvation Army soldier. Mr Perring, 63, who was born in east London, has been fascinated by the murders for nearly three decades and is sceptical about some of the suspects put forward by 'ripperologists' over the past century. He said: 'The majority of ""factual"" books have unlikely suspects, and I don't think in the history of serial killers there has ever been one who was famous beforehand. 'The most likely thing is it was somebody we've never heard of and certainly a woman would be ideal for this. 'My theory is more likely than many of the others. This is not just a novel but a possible solution to the Ripper mystery.' The book outlines an intriguing and unexpected motive for the female Salvation Army volunteer behind the savage killings - helping the desperate residents of Whitechapel. The five murders committed by Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel. An investigation by criminologists concluded that he lived on Flower and Dean Street . Mr Perring says the murders had an unexpected outcome - they drew the attention of the wider world to the appalling conditions endured by those living in the capital's slums. 'The Ripper murders surprisingly did a lot of good for the East End,' he said. 'Someone had shone a light on how awful the conditions were. There were all manner of social works and good deeds afterwards.' Jack the Ripper murdered five victims in 1888. Mary Ann Nichols was disembowled on Buck's Row. Annie Chapman's uterus was removed at 29 Hanbury St. Elizabeth Stride's throat was cut at Duffield's Yard, Berner St. Catherine Eddowes's uterus and kidney were removed and her cheeks torn on Mitre Square. Mary Jane Kelly was completely mutilated and her heart was removed at 13 Miller's Court. The . book follows the life of Mary Jane Kelly, who was approximately 25 at . the time of her death. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, a fair complexion . and was said to be very beautiful. Originally . from Cardiff, she arrived in London in 1884 and was believed to have . worked in a high class brothel in the West End, but through misfortune, . perhaps related to drink, she found herself in the East End. She was discovered dead in a home in Miller's Court on November 9, 1888, mutilated beyond recognition. No family member could be found to attend the funeral. The . notion that Jack the Ripper might not in fact be a man at all was first posited . by Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline, a key figure in the . investigation at the time. According . to Donald McCormick, author of the 1959 book The Identity of Jack the . Ripper, the officer raised the theory in a conversation with his mentor, . Dr Thomas Dutton after the murder of Mary Kelly. He . theorised the fact a female culprit made sense as they could stalk the . streets of Whitechapel with ease because the whole of London was looking . for a man. Mary Jane Kelly claims to have been born in Ireland – yet no record of her exists there. Her childhood was spent in Wales, where she married a miner – and yet by her early twenties, and without any known explanation, she was in London. She lived in Knightsbridge and lived a life of luxury, buying expensive dresses, riding in carriages, and visiting Paris on at least one occasion. But even more intriguing is how, from such lofty heights, she fell so low as to be living in a single room in Whitechapel, in a squalid little court off Dorset Street, then known as the worst street in London. Jack the Ripper victim Mary Nichols (left). Her injuries were many and savage. Right, victim Elizabeth Stride . A poster distributed to help with the capture of nineteenth-century serial killer Jack The Ripper . Numerous individuals have been accused of being the serial killer. At the time, police suspected the Ripper must have been a butcher, due to the way his victims were killed and the fact they were discovered near to the dockyards, where meat was brought into the city. There are several alleged links between the killer and royals. First is Sir William Gull, the royal physician. Many have accused him of helping get rid of the prostitutes' bodies, while others claim he was the Ripper himself. Another book named Queen Victoria's surgeon Sir John Williams as the infamous killer. He had a surgery in Whitechapel at the time. Another theory links the murders with Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor,  the Duke of Clarence. At one point, cotton merchant James Maybrick was the number one suspect, following the publication of some of his diary which appeared to suggest he was the killer. However some believe the diary to be a forgery although no one has been able to suggest who forged it. Other suspects include Montague John Druitt, a Dorset-born barrister. He committed suicide in the Thames seven weeks after the last murder. George Chapman, otherwise known as Severyn Kłosowski, poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903. Another suspected by polive was Aaron Kosminski. He was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum and died there. Dr Thomas Neill Cream, poisoned four London prostitutes with strychnine and was hanged. Some of the more bizarre links include Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice in Wonderland books, who taught at Christ Church until 1881 - which was at the forefront of the Ripper murder scenery. Winston Churchill's father - Lord Randolph Churchill - has also been named as a potential suspect. Crime writer Patricia Cornwell  believes she has 'cracked' the case by unearthing evidence that confirms Walter Sickert, an influential artist, as the prime suspect. Her theories have not been generally accepted. To buy The Seduction Of Mary Kelly click here.","Book about the Ripper's final victim puts forward intriguing theory .

"One of University of Virginia's most illustrious fraternities is now under investigation amid reports seven members gang-raped a female student in the house two years ago. The horrifying account was detailed in a recently-published Rolling Stone article, in which a current junior identified as 'Jackie' says she was assaulted by a group of Phi Kappa Psi brothers after accepting an invitation to a 'date night' function at the house. The article goes on to indict the southern school for hushing up victims like Jackie, steering them towards dealing with these cases within the school, in order to protect their reputation. The Charlottesville, Virginia school was also attended by Hannah Graham, the 18-year-old student who was kidnapped on campus last September and found murdered weeks later. While Jackie decided not to press charges when the incident first happened, she has now decided to go public with her story after hearing from two other women who were gang raped at the fraternity, which counts President Woodrow Wilson as one of their distinguished alumni. Fraternity house of horrors: A junior at the University of Virginia, identified as Jackie, claims she was gang-raped by a group of seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity (pictured above) in 2012. She told her painful story to Rolling Stone after hearing two other women had been victimized in similar ways at the house . Tagged: The house was grafitied on Thursday, hours after a Rolling Stone article was published detailing the gang-rape allegations against the fraternity . Still, breaking her silence was hard, and has in some cases been met with opposition by her friends at UVA. 'One of my roommates said, ""Do you want to be responsible for something that's gonna paint UVA in a bad light?""'' Jackie told the magazine. 'But I said, ""UVA has flown under the radar for so long, someone has to say something about it, or else it's gonna be this system that keeps perpetuating!' 'My friend just said, ""You have to remember where your loyalty lies.""' Jackie was just a few weeks into her freshman year at UVA when she met a a junior boy named Drew, through their shifts working as lifeguards at the university pool. When Drew asked her out to dinner and a 'date night' function at his fraternity, Jackie gladly accepted and spent three hours getting ready for the night out on September 28, 2012. Back at the fraternity house after dinner, the two spent some time at the party before Drew asked Jackie if she wanted to go upstairs where it was quieter. But when Drew led her into his bedroom and shut the door, the room was pitch black and she could hear others moving around. That's when the nightmare started. A man tackled her down and onto a glass table which shattered and tore up her back. Others held her down and for the next three hours, she lay helpless as seven men raped her while two others, including her date Drew, watched and gave direction. It was the worst night of Jackie's life, but for the men in the room it was like a sports game. They swigged beers and called each other nicknames like 'Armpit' and 'Blanket'. Ignored: Jackie told UVA's Dean Nicole Eramo (left) about the incident in 2012, but the fraternity was never put under investigation for the claims. On Wednesday, UVA President Teresa Sullivan (right) announced that the fraternity is now under investigation following 'new details' revealed in the Rolling Stone article . Jackie identified the last man who assaulted her from her anthropology discussion group, and his friends started taunting him because he couldn't get an erection, asking 'What, she's not hot enough for you?' and 'Don't you want to be a brother?' When Jackie came to at 3am, the room was deserted but the party was still going on downstairs. She fled the house in her bloodied dress, barefoot because she was too afraid to look around for her shoes. She called her three best friends at the time, two guys and a girl, who found her beaten and in shock. While her friends were distraught at her condition, they debated calling the police fearing the impact it would have on Jackie's and their reputation (the two boys  wanted to rush a fraternity). 'Is that such a good idea. Her reputation will be shot for the next four years,' the girl friend, identified as Cindy, said. 'She's gonna be the girl who cried ""rape,"" and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.' Jackie didn't get the courage to speak about the rape until the next semester, when she finally opened up to Dean Nicole Eramo, the head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board. Dean Eramo told Jackie she could go to the police with her story, or treat the incident in house by either filing a complaint with the school's Sexual Misconduct Board, or sit down for an informal resolution' with her attackers in a meeting mediated by Eramo. Jackie decided on neither option, and despite hearing the terrifying story, Dean Eramo did not open an investigation into the fraternity. Jackie is now coming forward two years later, because she recently discovered that two other women experienced similar assaults at Phi Kappa Psi. The first account came from a woman who graduated in 2013 who said she was raped by a group of men at the house when she was a freshman. The other was a first-year whose friends called Jackie one night when she came back to her apartment wearing no pants, and said she'd been attacked by four men in the Phi Kappa Psi bathroom while another watched. Scandal: The Rolling Stone article goes on to indict the school of repeatedly hushing up sexual assault victims in order to protect their reputation. An aerial view of the campus, designed by Thomas Jefferson, above . Perhaps most startling about the allegations is what Dean Eramo said in a meeting with Jackie last May. Jackie and her friend Alex went to speak with Eramo in her office, and Eramo said that she heard it 'through the grapevine' that 'all the boys involved [in the gang rape] had graduated'. Jackie believes that was false since she saw one of her attackers on a campus riding a bike recently. Alex pointed out: 'Doesn't that mean they're admitting something happened?' After hearing that Rolling Stone was publishing an article on the gang rape, the school has finally opened an investigation on the fraternity. In a statement posted to the school's website on Wednesday, UVA President Teresa A Sullivan says that the school has asked the Charlottesville police to investigate a fraternity based on new details from the article. Phi Kappa Psi is not identified as the fraternity in question in her statement. 'The University takes seriously the issue of sexual misconduct, a significant problem that colleges and universities are grappling with across the nation. Our goal is to provide an environment that is as safe as possible for our students and the entire University community,' President Sullivan writes. A day after the article came out, the fraternity house was graffitied with the words 'Suspend us!' and 'UVA Center for RAPE Studies'. A dangerous place: The school was also the focus of a recent missing persons case involving 18-year-old Hannah Graham (pictured).

"Mitt Romney had some harsh words for President Obama earlier today, criticizing him over what he believes to be the lack of a coherent strategy to combat the terrorist group ISIS. The former presidential candidate appeared on Fox News Sunday, where he said President Obama was, 'too busy on the golf course to pick up the phone and meet with the leaders around the world and to say what happens if.' Romney was referring to the President's decision to hit the links just hours after he addressed the nation regarding the beheading of American journalist James Foley by members of ISIS. Scroll down for video . Running again?: A new poll that asked how Americans would have voted in 2012 knowing what they know now found that Mitt Romney had an edge over President Obama . Moderator Chris Wallace then presented the former Massachusetts governor with the results of a July Gallup poll asking Americans how they would have voted in 2012 knowing what they know now, and pointed out that Romney had an edge on Obama of 53 percent to 44 percent. 'I think they have some buyer’s remorse about President Obama,' said Romney. 'I'm not sure how they feel about me but that’s kind of irrelevant. The real question is how’s this president doing. And frankly they recognize the president has not been engaged.' Getting back to the President's response to ISIS, Romney said, 'You know, the Pentagon was going through what if scenarios. But the president apparently wasn't. Hasn’t developed a strategy.' He then added, 'I don't know whether you can’t see reality from a fairway, but the president has not seen the reality internationally.' Slammed: Romney attacked the President, seen here golfing earlier this year on vacation in Martha's Vineyard, for hitting the links hours after addressing the beheading of James Foley by ISIS . And it wasn't just the President's foreign policy that Romney attacked, also citing growing unemployment numbers as one of Obama's many domestic policies that aren't working in his opinion. 'We’ve got what, 92 million people that have stopped looking for work that are out of work in this country? It’s unacceptable,' he said. 'The American people are struggling, having a hard time. This president’s policies both at home and abroad are hurting people and people are responding in the way they review him.' Despite his feelings however, Romney said he has no plans to run in 2016. 'I'm not running and not planning on running.'","Mitt Romney appeared on  Fox News Sunday to discuss the President's lack of response to ISIS .

"Two gunmen have been jailed for life for shooting dead an aspiring rapper in a case of mistaken identity as he sat in his car outside his family home. Umar Tufail, 25, was the victim of a South London gang's 'deliberate execution' after his younger brother Amir stabbed one of the two gunmen three months before, the prosecution told the Old Bailey today. Kyrone Daley and Sanchez Thomas, both 19 and from West Norwood were found guilty of murder. Revenge: Gunmen Kyrone Daley, left, and Sanchez Thomas, both 19, were told by the judge 'the motive for this shocking murder lies in the gang culture in South London' Victim: Umar Tufail was likely to have been mistaken for his brother who had stabbed Sanchez Thomas last year . Thomas will serve a minimum term of 25 years and Daley 22 years. In July last year, Thomas drove with Daley, both members of Bromley-based . gang Squeeze Section, to South Norwood where the . Tufail brothers lived, bent on getting their revenge. As Umar Tufail, who rapped under the name . Humuh and was also known as Rems, sat in his car the pair pulled up and a single shot was fired at . his head through the window at almost point-blank range with a .32 calibre handgun. The . pair, then both 18, sped off in Thomas’ mother’s Vauxhall . Corsa, while Tufail’s mother and brother raced out of their home to help Umar. Despite being rushed to King's College Hospital Tufail died the next day. Judge Stephen Kramer told them: 'It seems that the motive for this shocking murder lies in the gang culture in south London in which guns are readily available. 'For a perceived slight for you, Sanchez Thomas, having been stabbed in the leg by the younger brother of the deceased, I am satisfied your motive was revenge. 'Both brothers looked similar. Whether by accident or design, you took your revenge on the brother who had not stabbed you.' During the trial both Thomas and Daley attempted to blame each other for the murder. Daley in his defence said Thomas stopped the car alongside the red Vauxhall Corsa that Umar was sitting in, opened the front passenger window and 'repeatedly accused the victim of being Rems' which he denied. Grieving parents: Umar's mother Francesca Thompson, left, ran out to take her son to hospital but Umar died the following day. His father Saj Tufail, right, holds a picture of his late son. Daley then alleged that Thomas reached down below the driver’s seat and pulled out the gun and 'when Thomas established that the victim was the brother of Rems he, without any notice, shot him.' However, Thomas claimed a third person in the car, who asked for a lift earlier in the journey, was the gunman. Thomas told the court the identity of the alleged killer for the first time during the trial blaming a member of Croydon’s Don’t Say Nothing (DSN) gang called Pauser. It delayed the start of the trial but detectives found the third man had been in Maidstone on the weekend of the killing. After returning to West Norwood, Daley and Thomas took a minicab to a friend’s house in Fulham. Police examined the car and later found gunshot residue on Thomas’ top. Thomas and Daley waved to family members as they were led from the dock, while some in the public gallery applauded the killers and shouted ‘well done’.","Umar Tufail, 25, was the victim of South London gang's 'deliberate execution'

"A pageant for tiny chickens sees a bird with its puffed-out chest stand upright focusing on its posture, and strutting its rich yellow plumage for a stoney-faced judge. The chicken belongs to Mohamad Hatta who is as proud of his chicken as a father is of his children during the contest which took place near the capital of Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. 'Yes my hero, puff out your chest!' Mohamad Hatta cries out above the din of fellow fowl-owners as his $10,000 bird pranced to victory in a 'beauty contest' for serama chickens. Cocky: A judge watches as a Serama chicken struts down a judging table during a beauty contest at Kampung Pandan in Kuala Lumpur . The breed - among the smallest . chickens in the world with adults weighing less than 500 grammes (17 oz) - have been a . favoured pet in its native Malaysia for decades. According to experts, there are about 250,000 serama in Malaysia. But its popularity has spread as far as Europe and America, with enthusiast clubs popping up to celebrate the decorative breed's distinctive characteristics. These include attractive and richly coloured plumage and a unique bearing marked by a protruding, heart-shaped chest and wings that hang straight to the ground, giving the pigeon-sized bird the air of a goose-stepping soldier on military parade. Despite the Asian bird-flu outbreaks over recent years, the serama has remained popular loved by ardent enthusiasts who will pay up to several thousand dollars for a prize bird. That's my girl: A Malaysian man  prepares his prized Serama chicken 'Tokun' ahead of a beauty contest at Kampung Pandan in Kuala Lumpur - every bird likes to be pampered . Plucky: A prized Serama chicken 'Aramas' struts down a judging table during the popular beauty contest . Mohamad Hatta said: 'There are people who want to buy my bird. But I am not selling it. It is part of my family'. The bird is believed to be a cross between the Malaysian wild fowl and Japanese bantam. It first emerged decades ago as a decorative pet for Malaysia's state sultans before gaining a broader public following from the 1980s. Some believe the breed originated as a long-ago gift from a Thai king to a Malaysian sultan. Its name is thought to derive from 'Rama' - a term referring to Thailand's royalty. Many Malaysians actually eat serama, believing that they are an aphrodisiac that also fights asthma. Star bird: In this picture seasoned Serama beauty contest participant Pak Alang Ari makes final preparations to his chicken ahead of its debut . Serious contest: Judges sit out a series of tables to watch Serama chickens during a beauty contest which could pay out $10,000 . Onlookers: A Malaysian family watches during a Serema Chicken beauty contest at Kampung Pandan in Kuala Lumpur . But the bird's attractiveness and good-natured, manageable disposition has pushed it up the pecking order of Malaysian pets. Norzamini Tukiban, 54, heads the district chapter of Malaysia's serama association. He said: 'These beautiful tiny birds give you great pleasure to own. They are warm and tame and this allows you to hold them, making serama birds adorable household pets.' Ahmad Fauzi Mohamed, president of the Malaysia branch of the World Serama Federation, said the tiny bird has made its home overseas with serama clubs spring up in the United States, Canada, Belgium, Holland, South Korea and elsewhere. Bold bird: It is important for the prized Serama chicken to be able to dazzle judges with their display of confidence and good posture . 'Bootiful' chicken: This bird looks as though he thinks he'll win, standing straight with his chest held high . Dedication: Participants can spend hours preparing their Serama chickens for the beauty contest which is always taken incredibly seriously . The world federation has a membership of 35,000 and is growing by 10 per cent per year.But Malaysia remains the serama heartland and contests are held almost weekly. About 200 people turned out to the open-air community hall just outside Kuala Lumpur for a recent contest as driving tropical rain thundered down outside. Lifting the diminutive competitors onto viewing tables, judges scored contestants on posture, feather quality, colour and temperament. Hours of grooming precede shows, including embellishing plumage with additional feathers taped to the bird - which is allowed. Oils are applied to enhance the sheen of plumage that can range widely in one bird from red to white to black. A 2004 regional bird-flu outbreak gave breeders a scare, as the Malaysian government culled hundreds of serama along with other fowl to contain the contagion, though there were no reports of flu-infected serama. Ahmad Fauzi said: 'Many owners hid their birds in the jungle, trying to save the species'. But there are poultry import restrictions in the region which have hampered breeding and trade, forcing many enthusiasts to smuggle Malaysian chicks and eggs. At present, demand continues to outstrip supply, and champions can fetch up to $10,000. Fauzi Osman, a breeder from northern Malaysia said: 'Breeding is difficult and to get good-quality birds is extremely hard'. 'So die-hard enthusiasts like those from Indonesia will get someone to smuggle baby chicks for about $200 each.' Who won: The men check the scores posted onto the wall after the beauty contest and work out which serema chicken got the most points . Plucky, confident, and with a hint of bravado, the Serama originate in the Malaysian state of Kelantan. The bird is a result of cross breeding of the Malaysian wild fowl and Japanese bantam. It first emerged decades ago as a . decorative pet for Malaysia's state sultans before gaining a broader . public following from the 1980s. According to experts, there are about 250,000 serama in Malaysia. However, they are also popular in the United States and Europe where they have dedicated fan clubs. The tiny Serama are characterized by their upright posture, full breast and vertical tail feathers. However, what they lack in stature they make up for in cockiness. In Malaysia they are described as brave warriors and archangel chickens, because of their very human like appearance.However, they are the smallest breed of chicken in the world. Typically under 500g there are even smaller birds - at just under 250g - being bred in Malaysia.","The beauty contests have been taking place in .

"China's insatiable appetite for development is showing no sign of abating with the Communist superpower announcing an audacious plan to flatten 700 mountains to make way for a new super-city. In what is being dubbed the biggest mountain-moving project in the country's history the ambitious scheme will see a metropolis created 50 miles from the city of Lanzhou in the northwest of China. Demolishing the desolate mountains in the country's Gansu province will cost developers £2.2billion, but, according to the state-run newspaper The China Daily, more than £7billion of corporate investment has already been attracted. Computer generated image of the proposed new city near Lanzhou in northwestern China . The project is the first planned for the country's interior and the fifth of the so-called state-level development zones. Others include Tianjin's Binhai, where a replica of the Manhattan district is being created. China is also in the midst of building the longest manmade river ever attempted - a 700 mile concrete and steel channel to shift water for the south to the north. The scheme, which was reported in the China Economic Weekly on Tuesday, was given the green light by authorities in August. However, it has raised concerns from environmentalists who point out that Lanzhou which is home to 3.6million people who work alongside the silty Yellow River is already considered one of the most polluted places in the world. The city's main industries include manufacturing industries such as textiles, metallurgy and fertiliser production. According to the state-run newspaper The China Daily, more than £7billion of corporate investment has already been attracted for the new development .

Liu Fuyuan, who previously worked as a high-ranking official at the . country's National Development and Reform Commission, told China .

He said: 'The most important thing is to gather people in places . where there is water.' The project is due to start in October next year with the first construction due to be a new urban district of almost 10 square miles. Multi-millionaire developer Yan Jiehe's company, China Pacific Construction Group, is in charge of the work and China's second wealthiest man has dismissed suggestions that the project is flawed financially and environmentally.

He said fears that the city would be unable to prove profitable because of its sparse desert location were unfounded. In an email interview, a China Pacific Construction Group spokeswoman said criticisms of the project were unjustified. Angie Wong said: 'Lanzhou's environment is already really poor, it's all desolate mountains which are extremely short of water. 'Our protective style of development will divert water to the area, achieve reforestation and make things better than before.

"Medicare can no longer automatically deny coverage requests for sex reassignment surgeries, a federal board ruled on Friday in a groundbreaking decision that recognizes the procedures are medically necessary for people who don't identify with their biological sex. Ruling in favor of a 74-year-old transgender Army veteran whose request to have Medicare pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago, the agency's Departmental Appeals Board said there was no justification for a three-decade-old HHS rule excluding such surgeries from procedures covered by the national health program for the elderly and disabled. 'Sometimes I am asked aren't I too old to have surgery. My answer is how old is too old?' the veteran, Denee Mallon, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, said in an email interview before the board issued its decision. Medicare's Department of Health and Services review board ruled Friday, May 30, in favor of Mallon, a 74-year-old Army veteran, whose request to have Medicare pay for her genital reconstruction was denied two years ago . Denee Mallon, right, holds a banner before taking part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque . 'When people ask if I am too old, it feels like they are implying that it's a `waste of money' to operate at my age. But I could have an active life ahead of me for another 20 years. And I want to spend those years in congruence and not distress.' Jennifer Levi, a lawyer who directs the Transgender Rights Project of Gay & Lesbian Advocates and Defenders in Boston, said the ruling does not mean Medicare recipients are necessarily entitled to have sex reassignment surgery paid for by the government. Instead, the lifting of the coverage ban means they now will be able to seek authorization by submitting documentation from a doctor and mental health professionals stating that surgery is recommended in their individual case, Levi said. No statistics exist on how many people might be affected by the decision. Gary Gates, a demographer with The Williams Institute, a think tank on LGBT issues based at the University of California, Los Angeles, has estimated that people who self-identify as transgender make up 0.3 percent of the U.S. adult population. Over 49 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare. The cost of gender reassignment surgery varies, but typically ranges from $7,000 to $50,000, according to the Transgender Law Center in Oakland, California. In Friday's ruling, the appeals board said that HHS lacked sufficient evidence in 1981 when it made a 'national coverage determination' holding that Medicare recipients were ineligible for what it then called 'transsexual surgery' because the procedure was too controversial, experimental, and medically risky. Denee Mallon, second from left, takes part in the Trans March to Morningside Park in Albuquerque on Thursday . The decision recognizes sex reassignment surgeries as a medically necessary and effective treatment for individuals who do not identify with their biological sex such as Mallon . The panel went on to say that regardless of what the record showed then, studies and experts have since shown the efficacy of surgical interventions as a treatment for gender dysphoria, the diagnosis given to people who experience extreme distress due to the disconnect between their birth sex and their gender identity. 'We have no difficulty concluding that the new evidence, which includes medical studies published in the more than 32 years since issuance of the 1981 report underlying the NCD, outweighs the NCD record and demonstrates that transsexual surgery is safe and effective and not experimental. Thus, as we discuss below, the grounds for the ...exclusion of coverage are not reasonable,' the civilian panel said. The appeals board's decisions are binding on HHS unless they are appealed in federal court. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency within HHS that manages Medicare, opted not to defend the transgender surgery exclusion before the five-member board and had initiated the process for lifting it on its own before Mallon filed her complaint. The ruling does not apply to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for individuals and families with low-incomes and is regulated by the states. Some states have exclusions on sex reassignment surgeries and the sex hormones transgender people often take during their transitions, while others evaluate claims on a case-by-case basis. Transgender health advocates said that because private insurance companies and Medicaid programs often take their cues from the federal government on what is considered medically necessary, elective or experimental, the decision could pave the way for sex-reassignment surgeries to be a routinely covered benefit. Mallon was born a man and identifies as a woman. 'When I learned that Medicare denies the essential care I need, I remember saying `This is not right. They're relying on these archaic reasons to deny me the care my doctor agrees I need? I knew I had to do something to challenge that,' Mallon said.

"Arrested: Manchester United's Ryan Tunnicliffe . Manchester United soccer star Ryan Tunnicliffe has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving after crashing his £60,000 motor. Tunnicliffe, 19, was held yesterday afternoon just hours after picking up the keys to the top of the range black Land Rover. He allegedly hit a stationary van, pushing it 30ft into a wall, as he drove round an industrial estate in Heywood, Manchester. The teenager, who made his first team debut for the Red Devils just weeks ago, was breathalysed and arrested at the scene. Witnesses told the Sun that Tunniclife lost control of the vehicle when it skidded on the wet road. Part of the wall was demolished in the 2.15pm crash. Onlooker Matthew Cronshaw, 27, told the paper: 'A mate told me he'd only just picked up the keys. He hit a van and pushed it into a wall, making a terrible screeching sound. 'He's hit it with real force because both vehicles looked like write-offs. Ryan looked really shaken up.'

"Caked in dust and wading through recycled plastic, these are just some of the thousands of children who work illegally in Bangladesh. More than a million children are involved in dangerous work in the country - despite the minimum working age being 14, according to the International Labour Organisation. These compelling photographs were taken in the capital, Dhaka, a city where one year ago a garment factory collapsed killing more than 1,100 people. Stolen youth: A Bangladeshi child laborer works with his mother as they sift through empty bottles at a recycling center in Dhaka. The minimum working age is 14 . Playground: Like in a ball pit in Western countries, a toddler looks at home atop empty bottles at the recycling plant while parents and siblings sift through the waste . Youth: At 10 years old, Momen (pictured) is too young to be working at this balloon factory in Dhaka but is like many youngsters employed in small workshops . Moulds: The balloon factory is not the most hazardous line of work. Some children work in farming, spreading dangerous chemicals without adequate protection . They show children working with their parents in a recycling plant and a balloon factory - hunched over moulds, spraying coloured paint and filling bags with plastic bottles. Despite a wave of new support for factory unions in the wake of the collapse of the eight-storey Rana Plaza building last April, which killed 1,135 on the outskirts of Dhaka, many people still work in dangerous conditions. In the ready-made garment sector alone, some $24million has been put towards new safety measures by the UK, U.S., Netherlands and Canada. There are already 392 more government inspectors than this time last year. But many child labourers in the country slip under the radar, according to observers. One group, the International Labour Organisation, says at least 7.4million . children aged 5 to 17 are involved in economic . activities. Of those, 1.3million are involved in hazardous work. The minimum employment age is 14, but 93 per cent of child labourers work in small factories and workshops which allow their employers - or parents - to slip them under a radar, according to Unicef. Hard at work: A 12-year-old boy in the balloon factory. Some 1.3million children aged five to 17 do hazardous work, according to the International Labour Organisation . Cottage industry: Old and young workers exist side-by-side, often in improvised conditions. The minimum wage is around $66 a month, but children earn less . Family: Bangladeshi boys and a woman working in a balloon factory at Kamrangir Char, Dhaka. The city was home to the Rana Plaza building, which collapsed killing 1,100 . Injuries: With constant heavy lifting and bending down, many children suffer repetitive strain injuries or back pains before they have reached adulthood . Poverty often forces families to send children to work in jobs like brick-chipping, construction and waste-picking. Even though the minimum wage is around $66 a month children are paid less than adults, with many working up to twelve hours a day - often preventing them from attending school. In Dhaka alone, an informal survey found 4,000 children working in more than 1,000 types of dangerous workshops or factories. A Unicef statement said: 'Long hours, low or no wages, poor food, isolation and hazards in the working environment can severely affect children’s physical and mental health. 'Child labourers are also vulnerable to other abuses such as racial discrimination, mistreatment and sexual abuse. 'Some work, such as domestic labour, is commonly regarded as an acceptable employment option for children, even though it too poses considerable risks.' Some children work on farms, where they use dangerous tools, carry heavy loads and spread harmful chemical pesticides. Young: Ripon, a nine-year-old Bangladeshi boy, works in a balloon factory at Kamrangir Char, Dhaka. Some children drop out of school and work long hours instead . Paint: A boy dyes balloons on different sets of moulds in the factory. Such small industries can be vastly different from the huge garment factories making headlines . The world outside: Light can be seen streaming in through gaps in the brickwork of the workshop as a young worker dips balloons in pink and purple paint . In a country with little medical care, they can end up with back injuries, infections and repetitive strain injuries before they have reached adulthood. Many girls, meanwhile, work long hours as domestic servants and are subject to discrimination, harassment and sexual abuse, according to the U.S. government. Most of the dead were adults last April when the Rana Plaza building crumbled to the ground, in what became the deadliest accidental building collapse in modern history. But not all were. Last week, as relatives of the dead gathered in their memory, Aanna Khatun revealed she was just 13 when she was rescued from the building. Surrounded by dead colleagues, she survived trapped in an air pocket between blocks of collapsed concrete. Sibling love: This young boy beamed a broad smile despite having to help sift through the bottles left at one of Dhaka's recycling plants . Unicef said: 'Some work, such as domestic labour, is regarded as an acceptable employment option for children, even though it too poses considerable risks' All ages: Long hours, low wages and harsh working conditions are not limited to children. Adults often face the same hardship in order to make a living for themselves . The owner of the illegally constructed Rana Plaza building is behind bars, pending an investigation, but there has been no word on when he will be put on trial. The owners of the five factories operating inside the building also have been detained. But problems remain. Observers claim the international companies which used clothes made in Rana Plaza are not contributing enough to the trust fund for survivors and victims' families. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said: 'One year after Rana Plaza collapsed, far too many victims and their families are at serious risk of destitution.'","Compelling photographs show dust-strewn children in recycling plants and making coloured balloons in Dhaka .

"A 36-year-old who was desperate for a baby after seven years of trying to conceive has finally had a baby girl - after she was hypnotised into believing she was pregnant. Louise Cheshire, 36, who also suffered two miscarriages, decided to try hypnotherapy before embarking on IVF treatment with her partner Ian Forrest, 33. But the shop worker from Coventry fell pregnant just four weeks after attending a one-hour session with practitioner David Kilmurry last January. Longed-for baby: Louise Cheshire tried for seven years before she had daughter Aafia, who is now eight weeks old . She gave birth to daughter Aafia Rose, who weighed 6lbs 11oz, on December 3 last year at University Hospital Coventry. Louise, from Hinckley, Leicestershire, said: 'Seven years ago I had two miscarriages and then I was trying for a baby for five years after that. 'We were trying for a baby the whole time but I thought I couldn't have a baby. I was under one of the country's top gynaecologists. 'I had lots of tests and they couldn't find anything wrong. They said there was no problem with me. We were going to try IVF but I thought hypnosis was worth one last try. 'It helped me quit smoking years ago and I just thought it was worth a shot. I never expected it to work but after just one session I felt much more positive and calm.' Hypnotherapy induces a trance like state, during which the conscious mind is thought to be suppressed while the subconscious mind is opened. Practitioners stress that a patient is not put to sleep and can't be made to do something they don't wish to. During a session a therapist suggests ideas and lifestyle changes to the patient to reduce anxiety and promote wellbeing. Ms Cheshire said: 'David basically hypnotised me into believing I was pregnant and would have a baby. 'Four . weeks later Ian and I went away for the weekend and a few days later I . took a pregnancy test and it came back positive. I was thrilled. Ms Cheshire is convinced hypnotherapy helped by calming her down both before and during her pregnancy . Louise's 30-week scan while pregnant with Aafia. She had suffered two previous miscarriages . 'I'm convinced the hypnotherapy helped relax and calm me down because I was so worried about not having a baby. 'He also taught me techniques to deal with anxiety when I was feeling worried and helped me relax about being pregnant. It was the best hour of my life and I was pregnant four weeks later. 'I know it sounds unreal but I'm convinced that it really helped me because I stopped thinking about it so much and stopped worrying.' Her hypnotherapist David Kilmurry said: 'Cognitive Behavioural . Hypnotherapy (CBH) is a very powerful treatment that if administered . correctly will make you more capable of conception. 'Be . aware that when couples have exhausted all of the available options, . paid all of their hard earned money on the treatments and eventually . stop trying they will often let go of the stress around there personal . moments and will then naturally fall pregnant. 'The truth is that it is much more likely that we are predominantly ""accidents"" as opposed to ""planned"".'","Louise, from Coventry, had suffered two failed miscarriages during a seven-year battle to have a baby .

"Peter Nunn (pictured at court today) threatened to rape a Labour MP after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note . An internet troll who threatened to rape a Labour MP after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note has been jailed for 18 weeks. Peter Nunn, 33, from Bristol, retweeted posts threatening to sexually assault Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy, after she supported a bid by feminist Caroline Criado-Perez to keep a woman on a British banknote. The father-of-one also called her a witch in a 'campaign of hatred' launched last summer. Nunn's one-day trial heard that he began leaving offensive posts on July 29 last year - five days after the Bank of England revealed Austen would be the new face of the £10 note. He retweeted a threatening message sent to Ms Creasy which read: 'You better watch your back, I'm going to rape your a**e at 8pm and put the video all over.' Over the next day the part-time delivery driver sent a barrage of offensive messages to the London MP using the Twitter account @protectys. In his next message he posted: 'Best way to rape a witch, try and drown her first then just when she's gagging for air that's when you enter.' Later that evening he wrote: 'If you can't threaten to rape a celebrity, what is the point in having them?' Nunn also retweeted a 'menacing' message composed by the @eatcreasynow account threatening to rape Ms Creasy, and added the post 'Go get her, eat the meat!' He called the Labour MP an 'evil witch' and wrote: 'What's the odds of Criado and Creasy snuggling and cuddling under a duvet checking their tweets and cackling like witches (rape me says Caroline).' During his campaign of abuse, Nunn also posted six increasingly manic videos online in which he mocked campaigners. Nunn, who declared himself a 'feminist' during his own evidence, denied using Twitter to advocate violence or rape. Instead, the self-styled blogger, who, the court heard, has ambitions of studying for a law degree, claimed he sent the messages to exercise his right to freedom of speech and to 'satirise' the issue of online trolling. District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe found him guilty of sending indecent, obscene or menacing messages following a trial at City of London Magistrates’ Court earlier this month and jailed him today. He retweeted posts threatening to sexually assault Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy (left), after she supported a bid by feminist Caroline Criado-Perez (right) to keep a woman on a British banknote . She also imposed a restraining order banning him from any contact with either woman. Dressed in a grey suit with a patterned tie, father-of-one Nunn showed no emotion as the sentence was passed. Victim impact statements had been read out to the court on behalf of both women, who spoke of the 'terrifying' threats made against them. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the messages had had a 'substantial' effect on Ms Creasy, and added that she has felt the need to install a panic button in her home. She said that the incident had altered the way she interacts with people and made her more cautious. Nunn is led to a prison van in handcuffs after being sentenced to 18 weeks at City of London Magistrates' Court . Nunn's one-day trial at City of London Magistrates' Court heard that he began leaving offensive posts on July 29 last year - five days after the Bank of England revealed Austen would be the new face of the £10 note . Ms Morgan said Ms Criado-Perez's statement described the 'fear and horror' she had felt, which had manifested itself in physical symptoms such as dizzy spells. During mitigation, Nunn's defence lawyer, Helen Jones, told the court he felt great remorse for the stress and anxiety he had caused, but Judge Roscoe said she had not seen this during his trial when she had found him 'evasive'. Nunn, who declared himself a 'feminist' during his own evidence, denied using Twitter to advocate violence or rape, but has been jailed for 18 weeks . Describing his behaviour as 'egocentric', she added: 'It was really all about you and your opinions and what you wanted to do. 'Although we're only talking about six tweets, it was persistent. You moved account when one was blocked.' The judge said she had taken the defendant's good character and no previous convictions into account along with the impact a custodial sentence would have on his long-term partner and their three-year-old daughter. She added: 'However, it has to be an immediate sentence. There is no reason to suspend it. 'I'm not convinced that that would give the message that this is entirely unacceptable.' Neither Ms Creasy nor Ms Criado-Perez attended court to see him sentenced. As news of Nunn's sentencing broke, other trolls immediately took to the social networking site to lash out at the MP for Walthamstow. Some hurled abuse at Judge Elizabeth Roscoe for jailing Nunn - and suggested Ms Creasy should be in prison herself for reporting the crime. Commenting on the hearing, Ms Creasy said: 'Today's sentence for Peter Nunn is a step forward in recognising the distress and fear online harassment can cause. 'We now need to ensure our police and criminal justice services are better trained to identify the risks anyone receiving threats faces, whether these are made on or offline so that we can protect those being stalked. 'Above all, we need to send a clear message that it isn't for anyone to put up with being harassed via any medium- this is an old crime taking a new form online and should be treated as such.' Ms Criado-Perez said Nunn 'made me fear for my life - as no-one ever has before'. But she added that she felt the charge against him was the wrong one and said of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS): 'I don't feel they understood what happened to me.' Writing on her online blog today, she said: 'While what Nunn did was extremely menacing, I do not think that sending messages describes the essence of his campaign against me and Stella. I think that is better described with the term stalking.' She went on: 'I felt he was a clear and present threat to me. 'He made me scared to go outside, to appear in public. He seemed obsessed enough to carry out his threats.'","Peter Nunn, 33, from Bristol, threatened to assault the Walthamstow MP .

"Swiss right-to-die group Exit has applied for permission to change its office into an assisted suicide centre. If the plan is agreed, it will become the second DIY death centre in the country. Dignitas operates an assisted suicide clinic on the outskirts of Zurich where hundreds of people, including dozens of Britons, have ended their lives in the past few years. Exit helped 32 people in the Basel area die last year and is 'struggling to keep up with demand', according to Swiss media. Until now it has assisted in ending peoples' lives in hospitals and care homes and sometimes ships them via ambulance to the Dignitas premises. This building in Zurich houses the assisted suicide clinic. Now Exit want to alter the purpose of their office so that people can kill themselves there too . Exit's application to transform its office in Binningen, near Basel, into a second Swiss assisted suicide clinic has been met with anger from local residents who claim it will create an 'unwelcome atmosphere'. 'Local authorities are also concerned the move will increase so-called suicide tourism to the area, given the area's proximity to the borders with France and Germany,' said a Swiss news website. Dignitas, a Zurich-based organisation, helps people to kill themselves.  Candidates have to fill in an official form to prove they want to commit suicide. They also choose the music that they are going to listen to during their last moments . Exit says the fears are unfounded because the facility will only be used by a 'small number' of people registered with them to die. 'Of the 459 clients in the Zurich area that Exit helps to die each year, only 31 of them require such a facility,' reported Swiss media. A total of 172 people travelled to Switzerland from overseas in 2012, double the number three years previously, to kill themselves with the vast majority ending their lives at Dignitas. In May this year, Exit voted to extend its services to the elderly who do not have a terminal illness, allowing those with problems relating to old age the choice to end their lives. People who go to Dignitas are given a lethal cocktail of drugs to help them commit suicide . Ludwig A. Minelli, journalist, human rights campaigner and the founder of Dignitas . The president of the Swiss Medical Association criticized the move, saying: 'It cannot be ruled out that elderly healthy people could come under pressure of taking their own life.' Nine years ago, Soraya Wernli, a former worker for Dignitas, broke with the group and later went public with claims that it was a money-obsessed organisation whose members were often fleeced of their savings and possessions before they ended their lives with a lethal cocktail of drugs.","Exit helped 32 people in Basel area die last year in hospitals or care homes .

"A quick dip in the pool can sound appealing - until you realise you’ll be left wearing dripping swimwear for the rest of the day. Now one Toronto-based entrepreneur has come up with a range of swim trunks that means you can avoid leaving a trail of puddles in your wake. Inventor, Franky Shaw, has set-up a Kickstarter fund for a swimwear range which is made from hydrophobic material - a fabric that repels water. Scroll down for video . It looks like ordinary swimwear from the outside, but when it is covered in liquid, the garment instantly repels water. ‘We were tired of having to change shorts every time you leave the beach, having car seats soaked and not being able to go from the beach to a restaurant,’ Mr Shaw said. Created by Toronto-based entrepreneur, Franky Shaw, the swim trunks are made from a unique polyester-based hydrophobic material with prices starting from $47 (£28) It looks like ordinary swimwear, but when covered in liquid, the ‘Frank Anthony’ trunks instantly repels water . ‘We decided to look at different topical applications for use but shortly found out they changed the texture of the fabric and had no way of being used on garments. ‘We decided to scrap the idea and look for the perfect alternative.’ What Mr Shaw and his team came up with was a polyester-blend hydrophobic nanomaterial technology. The technology is thought to work by bonding billions of nanoparticles to individual fibres on a microscopic level. When water-based liquids hit the surface of this material they form a 150-degree sphere and roll off. ‘This fabric has proven to drastically reduce dry-times by up to 95 per cent in contrast to regular 100 per cent polyester swim shorts,’ the company claims. The technology works by bonding billions of nanoparticles to individual fibres on a microscopic level. When water-based liquids hit the surface of this material they form a 150-degree sphere and roll off . ‘This fabric has proven to drastically reduce dry-times by up to 95 per cent in contrast to regular 100 per cent polyester swim shorts,’ the company claims . Hydrophobic nanotech clothing has been around for a number of years, but it always has a limited lifespan. For instance, the Silic water-repelling T-shirt, was released last year but can only maintain its properties for 80 washes. The ‘Frank Anthony’ swimwear, however, promises that its water-repellent abilities last for the last-time of the shorts. The range comes in a variety of different colours and patterns, with trunks starting from $47 (£28). If the Kickstarter campaign is a success, Mr Shaw expects to begin shipping in July. If you're clumsy and constantly spilling food down yourself, or just lazy and don't like washing your clothes, a student has invented the answer to your problems - a T-shirt that is impossible to stain. The tops can resist any spills and splashes including Coca-Cola, tomato ketchup, mustard, milkshakes, beer, ink and even red wine. The clothing is made from polyester, which has been infused with a combination of chemicals that make it resistant to water. Despite this, the T-shirts are said to feel ‘no different to any other items that could be found in a clothing shop.’ University student Patel from San Francisco made a prototype using a spray-on chemical, but realised it would only last for one wash. He then began looking at ways to incorporate the technology into the fabric. He created a fabric that has the nanotechnology bonded to the fibres on a microscopic level. This means they won't irritate the skin. According to Patel: ‘Most liquid molecules will not be able to touch the fabric because of a microscopic layer of air that forms between the liquid and fabric. ‘This is because the fabric is layered with billions of silica particles. Water based liquids will form a 150 degree sphere and roll right off! As a result, this barrier protects your shirt from potential accidents.’ The material in the Silic shirt, pictured, created by San Fransisco-based student Aamir Patel, has billions of silica particles bonded to the fibres. Water-based liquids form a 150-degree sphere on this material and roll off .","A Kickstarter fund to sell trunks has been launched by Franky Shaw .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described stopping the boats as the 'most compassionate' thing his government could have done. Mr Abbott was trumpeting the success of Operations Sovereign Borders at the Liberal National Party state conference in Brisbane on Saturday when he made the comment, adding that secure borders were a sign of a sovereign nation. Stopping the boats meant an end to budget blowouts, saving billions in unnecessary future spending and ending deaths, the prime minister said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott described stopping the boats as the 'most compassionate' thing his government could have done at the Liberal National Party at the Annual Convention in Brisbane on Saturday . 'That's why the most decent and most compassionate thing this government has done is to ensure that for more than six months now there has been no successful people smuggling venture to our country,' Mr Abbott told the conference. 'I am not declaring victory, but my friends we are stopping those boats.' The prime ministers comments come less than a week after the High Court prevented the government from handing 153 asylum seekers back to the Sri Lankan authorities by granting an interim injunction. The action was handed out after a number barristers brought the claim before the High Court, with solicitor George Newhouse in particular speaking out against the risks asylum seekers face when being returned to their home countries where they face possible persecution. 'The [immigration] minister cannot simply intercept their vessel in the middle of the night and ""disappear them"",' Mr Newhouse told AAP in relation to a boat of 41 asylum seekers who face criminal investigation after the Australian government returned them to Sri Lanka. A member of the security team pushes an anti-government protester outside the convention a short time before Mr Abbott was scheduled to speak . 'The asylum seekers claim that they are fleeing persecution and that they're at risk of death, torture or significant harm at the hands of Sri Lankan authorities,' Mr Newhouse said. '[There's] a need for ongoing protection.' The prime minister also made no mention of the 'compassionate' state of detention centres, in which claims emerged last week about nine mothers on Christmas Island who attempted self harm in the hope their children would by allowed to stay in the country. Also contrasting the prime ministers words, dozens of people gathered outside the conference to protest against Operation Sovereign Borders and started yelling, 'Shame, Bishop, shame' when they heard Foreign Minister Julie Bishop had arrived. A member of the security team was also photographed pushing at one of the activists. But Ms Bishop said they should be supporting the government's humanitarian efforts. 'There is nothing humanitarian about encouraging criminal people to pay criminal syndicates to get on unseaworthy boats and take a dangerous journey to Australia,' Ms Bishop said. In contrast of the prime ministers words, a number of people attended the event to protest some of the government's policies, including its treatment of refugees . 'They should have been protesting when 1200 people died at sea under the previous government's policies. 'That was a disaster and we don't intend to have that happen under our watch.' Mr Abbott also admitted at the conference, that it had been an 'interesting week' in the Senate, after the Palmer United Party's last minute antics put the kibosh on the government's plans to repeal the carbon tax by Thursday. But instead on focusing on PUP leader Clive Palmer's involvement, he pointed to Labor's reluctance to to rid Australia of the tax. 'Sure Mr Palmer has three senators, but Mr Shorten has 25,' Mr Abbott said. 'And we know that Mr Palmer will change his mind by Monday, but Bill Shorten will still be there come Monday, come Tuesday, come next week, come next month, come next year, supporting putting your power prices up. Smiling every time your power bill increases.'

"The 'main player' Khalid Mahmood, 30, from Bradford, was jailed for 25 years . Five men have been jailed for a total of 109 years for smuggling more than £9m of heroin hidden in baby powder bottles into the UK. The gang would use British post offices send parcels to their accomplices in Pakistan using a tracked service. Once they arrived, the contents would be replaced with plastic bottles of Johnson's baby powder, which contained packages of heroin. The parcels were resealed and returned . to addresses in Hull and Manchester marked 'undelivered - return to . sender' or similar words, Leeds Crown Court heard. During . the ten-week trial the jury heard the smuggling came to light in 2011 . after staff at a Royal Mail delivery office in Hull, East Yorkshire, . became suspicious at the number of such parcels arriving there. Five were intercepted and found to contain an average of 1.9kgs of heroin, which would fetch £473,000 at street value. Police . identified from records that a further 94 packages had been delivered . which with a similar content meant a street value of £8.93m. They had been posted from 12 different post offices in Bradford, West Yorkshire. After . being found guilty at an earlier hearing to charges including . conspiracy to import and supply class A drugs, as well as money . laundering offenc, Khalid Mahmood, 30, from Bradford, was jailed for 25 years. Sentencing him, Judge Christopher Batty said he was 'a main player' in the operation. The . court heard Mahmood was jailed for 51 months in 2002 for his part in . the Bradford Riots and received four years in June 2008 for involvement . with a firearm. Faisal Khan, 30, (left) was jailed for 21 years after the judge described him as Mahmood's trusted ally, while Fiaz Ahmed, 31, (right) was jailed for 23 years after he was described as playing a leading role in the operation . Further evidence showed that Mahmood was the main beneficiary of the operation and lived an extravagant and opulent lifestyle. He lived in a large detached house, paying £1,000 a month in rent, and drove a succession of expensive cars. He was also found to have spent large sums of money in attempt to acquire an interest in a Manchester nightclub. Faisal . Khan, 30, from Bradford, was jailed for 21 years after the judge . described him as Mahmood’s trusted ally having made at least two trips . to Pakistan. Khan was also found to be living . beyond his means and following his arrest he was found to be in . possession of a Hublot watch, valued at more than £40,000, and £120,000 . in cash - which was later found to be contaminated with heroin and . paracetamol - a known cutting agent used in the preparation of heroin. Usman Bari, from Hull, (left)was jailed for 19 years. The judge said he had been the 'eyes and ears' at the Hull end of the operation, while Yasser Uddin, 31, from Bradford, was a postman and trusted friend of Mahmood, who used his knowledge of the Royal Mail system to keep tabs on the packages. He was jailed for 21 years . Fiaz . Ahmed, 31, from Manchester, was jailed for 23 years after he was . described as playing a leading role in the operation, dealing with the . addictive heroin once it arrived in the UK. Yasser Uddin, 31, from Bradford, was a postman and trusted friend of Mahmood, who used his knowledge of the Royal Mail system to keep tabs on the packages. He was jailed for 21 years. Usman Bari, from Hull, was jailed for 19 years. The judge said he had been the 'eyes and ears' at the Hull end of the operation. All five were found guilty by the jury of conspiracy to import class A drugs, conspiracy to supply and conspiracy to launder the proceeds. Parcels that were sent to Pakistan had their contents would be replaced with plastic bottles of Johnson's baby powder, which contained packages of heroin . The smuggling came to light in 2011 after staff at a Royal Mail delivery office in Hull, East Yorkshire, became suspicious at the number of such parcels arriving there . A sixth man, Mahmood’s brother Azhar, 28, from Bradford, was convicted on a money laundering charge and given a ten-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to do 200 hours unpaid work. The court heard he was under surveillance when he went to Leicester and collected £38,000 in cash. Speaking at Leeds Crown Court on Friday, Judge Batty said: 'Heroin is a highly dangerous addictive substance. 'People who peddle it can expect long sentences, . those who import it and flood the streets of this country with it can expect to go to prison for even longer.' Detective Inspector Gary Curnow, from West Yorkshire Police’s Regional Organised Crime Unit, said: 'This crime group based in Bradford were involved in the international trafficking of class A drugs. 'Their imprisonment demonstrates the priority and success that forces’ in the Yorkshire and Humber region, alongside partners including the Border Force, are . having in terms of tackling those involved in the higher echelons of the drugs trade.' Phillip Holliday, of Border Force, said: “This case shows how our officers work closely with the police and others to stop people smuggling Class A drugs into the UK.'",Gang would send parcels to accomplices in Pakistan using a tracked service .
"Koalas have a unique voice box that allows them to make a 'belching' call that only large animals like elephants are capable of . Koalas might look cute but they have a unique voice box that allows them to make a ‘belching’ call that only large animals like elephants are capable of. The Australian marsupial’s mating call is about 20 times lower in pitch than it should be, given its relatively small size, new research has found. While the creature’s ability to make the noise has baffled scientists for years, they now believe they have discovered the koala’s secret - a specialised sound-producing organ that has never before been seen in any other land-dwelling mammal. The key feature of this newly described organ is its location outside the voice box or the larynx. Dr Benjamin Charlton of the University of Sussex, who led the research, said: ‘We have discovered that koalas possess an extra pair of vocal folds that are located outside the larynx, where the oral and nasal cavities connect. ‘We also demonstrated that koalas use these additional vocal folds to produce their extremely low-pitched mating calls.’ The male koala’s bellow calls are produced as a continuous series of sounds on inhalation and exhalation, similar to that of a donkey’s braying. On inhalation, koala bellows sound a bit like snoring, but when the animals exhale, the sound is more reminiscent of belching and Dr Charlton said: ‘they are actually quite loud.’ The call is also incredibly low-pitched and more typical of an animal the size of an elephant. Size is related to pitch as the dimensions of the laryngeal vocal folds normally constrain the lowest frequency that an animal can generate. As a result, smaller species will typically make higher pitched calls than larger ones. The male koala’s bellow calls are . produced as a continuous series of sounds on inhalation and exhalation, . similar to that of a donkey’s braying. On . inhalation, koala bellows sound a bit like snoring. When the . animals exhale, the sound is more reminiscent of loud belching. The call is incredibly low-pitched and more typical of an animal the size of an elephant. But koalas have bypassed that constraint as their vocal folds are in a different location, according to the study, which was published in journal Current Biology. The folds are two long, fleshy lips in the soft palette, just above the larynx at the junction between the oral and nasal cavities. They look similar to the laryngeal vocal folds of other mammals, but their location is highly unusual. ‘To our knowledge, the only other example of a specialised sound-producing organ in mammals that is independent of the larynx are the phonic lips that toothed whales use to generate echolocation clicks,’ Dr Charlton said. The combination of biological, video and acoustic data collected in the new study represents the first evidence in a terrestrial mammal of an organ other than the larynx that is dedicated to sound production. The scientists now plan on looking more closely at other mammals to find out whether this vocal adaptation is truly unique to koalas.

"Ronald Phillips, 40, will be executed by Columbus, Ohio with an alternative form of lethal injection . Columbus, Ohio will use an untried-dose of two drugs to put to death a condemned inmate who raped and killed his girlfriend's 3-year-old daughter, the state prisons agency said on Monday. A warden determined the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility doesn't have enough pentobarbital, the drug Ohio formerly used until its manufacturer put it off-limits for executions, Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said in an email. Instead, the state will use an . intravenous combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a . painkiller, in the Nov. 14 execution of Ronald Phillips of Akron. Those drugs are included in Ohio's . untested backup execution method, which requires them to be injected . directly into an inmate's muscle. No state has put a prisoner to death . with those drugs in any fashion. Phillips, 40, was sentenced to death for killing Sheila Marie Evans in 1993 after a long period of abusing her. Ohio's revamped execution policy calls for it to try to buy specialty batches of pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies, which mix individual doses of drugs for specific patients. If that fails, the policy calls for the use of the two-drug approach. A plan by Georgia to use a similar specialty batch of pentobarbital has been put on hold by a federal lawsuit challenging the state prison agency's refusal to identify the compounding pharmacy that provided the drug. The lawsuit also questions the drug's safety and effectiveness. Compounding pharmacies are under increased scrutiny following last year's meningitis outbreak that killed more than 60 people and sickened hundreds and was linked to contaminated ingredients at the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. Phillips' lawyers have pushed for mercy for Phillips, arguing he was raped and beaten by his late father as a child and grew up in a chaotic, filthy environment. The state says Phillips long denied suffering such abuse and raised it only as his execution became imminent. Phillips will be injected with a never-been-used combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. He has been languishing on death row for 20 years .","Ohio Correctional Facility doesn't have enough pentobarbital to use as an injection so they are using a combination of a painkiller and a sedative .

"At six weeks of age, little Nathan, Mal and their sister who is yet to be named, resemble three kittens purring and napping for the majority of the day. But by the end of the year, Ben Britton, 37, expects his current African lion roommates to weigh up to 40 kilograms each and no longer fit on his couch. As the director of Wild Animal Encounters in Western Sydney, Mr Britton has taken on the role of the lions' mother from the day they were born, after their natural mother rejected them. 'They're only just starting to find their feet,' Mr Britton told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Ben Britton, 37, the director of Wild Animal Encounters in Western Sydney, is raising three African lion cubs in his lounge room after their mother rejected them after birth . 'They're sleeping around 20-22 hours a day at the moment so they're not very active, they only have short bursts of energy when they're fed which is about four times a day, and then they crash about half an hour after that.' Wild lion numbers are falling at a significant rate across the world, dropping to 26,000 from over half a million in only 100 years. In an effort to promote the magnificent animal's conservation the company, which also spends a quarter of each year working in Botswana, hopes the three cubs become their fury ambassadors and encourage Australians to help in their preservation. Teaming up with National Geographic, Mr Britton is documenting his relationship with the three cubs as they grow up. At only six-weeks-old, weighing no more than six kilograms each and growing at least a kilogram every day, Ben has personally bottle fed them from one-day-old . Mr Britton said the cubs spend up to 22 hours a day sleeping and have short bursts of energy lasting for only half an hour around their meal times before they crash . 'We've just introduced meat into their diet, so they get one meat feed a day and they get extra excited around that time, but by the time the evening news is on they've crashed out on the lounge. 'Yeah - they have already worked out how to get on the lounge. They just take a little run and jump.' But as their weight grows by one kilogram a week, it won't be long before the big cats can no longer find a space on the couch. Before their second birthdays, the two boys - named in memory of Mr Britton's best friend Nathan and his favourite sports player Mal Meninga - will weigh over 150 kilograms each. In their prime, at about four-years-old, each male could potentially weigh over 200 kilograms while their sister will reach about 160 kilograms. Despite her smaller frame Mr Britton says the female cub, who will be named through an online competition later in the year, is developing a strong personality already. Lion numbers across the world have dropped from half a million to only 26,000 in the last 100 years. Mr Britton hopes the cubs will encourage Australians to support the conservation of their species . The 37-year-old said the female 'rules the roost' and bosses her brother around. He described the two male cubs as 'sooks' who preferred to cuddle up to him . 'Lions are a social cat and when you are involved with them for this long you become part of the pride, so they do remember you and want to interact with you and they still want to have that relationship when they are older,' Mr Britton said . 'The girl is the boss, she definitely rules the roost, which doesn't surprise me,' he said. 'So she bosses her brothers around and even though she's the smallest, she's the most confident – you often find that with lions. 'The boys are a bit sooky really, they like their cuddles and to sit with you a bit more which is often the case with male lions even when they're bigger.' 'The great things about lions is they're a social cat and when you are involved with them for this long you become part of the pride, so they do remember you and want to interact with you and they still want to have that relationship when they are older. That’s a special thing you don't get with other cat species.' Even with them starting to find the use of their teeth and claws on household furniture, Mr Britton, whose home on site the zoo has housed and array of animals from kangaroos and wombats to monkeys and crocodiles, says the lions are some of his most welcome house guests. 'The cats sleep so much that it means they're pretty good whereas when you've got a joey it needs to be in a pouch and you have to carry it around with you and clean up the pouch regularly.' Wild Animal Encounters has teamed up with National Geographic to document Mr Britton's relationship with the three cubs as they grow up . The company says their animals' 'lives extend beyond the boundaries of their enclosure' and that they often take them into new environments to enrich their lives . 'Monkeys also want to be with you the whole time and cling to you all day, whereas lioness' would just have the cubs in her den and then go off and do her thing, so compared to the other animals we've had, the lions are the easiest ones by far.' Bringing the animals out of their enclosures and into new environments, including his home, is a regularly practiced thing at the Wild Animal Encounters park. 'Animals have got so much going on in the wild – food, shelter, predators, prey and so on - when they come into captivity we supply and delete a lot of that and the mental side in captivity is hard to match, so we try to enrich their lives as much as we can which includes investigating new areas,' Mr Britton said. 'The big cats for instance get to walk a kilometre a week outrside their enclosure. They get to investigate the frog ponds and chase skinks in the garden. Their lives extend beyond the boundaries of their enclosure.'","Nathan, Mal and their sister who will be named via an online competition, are six-week-old African lions living in Ben Britton's lounge room .

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now under fire for its sloppy handling of Ebola virus cases in the U.S., spent time and resources in 2011 to educate Americans about the epidemic threat posed by a zombie apocalypse. 'If you're ready for a Zombie Apocalypse, you're ready for any emergency,' read one CDC Internet graphic designed to be spread – virally – on social media. The campaign, complete with a gorey 36-page graphic novella called 'Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic',' a 'Zombie blog' and slick horror-movie posters, drew applause from fans of the AMC series 'The Walking Dead,' but eye-rolls from most everyone else. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE CDC'S GRAPHIC NOVELLA . The CDC ran a social media campaign in 2011 urging Americans to make a preparedness kit – to hedge again zombie attacks . This poster, produced by the CDC, was meant to capitalize on the popularity of the AMC series 'Walking Dead' Now, in the context of the Ebola crisis, the effort strikes some as wasted and frivolous. 'I know it was ""cool"" back then,' one tweet sent Thursday read, 'but in retrospect, maybe the time and effort put into the CDC's Zombie Preparedness 101 was poorly spent.' But the Obama administration's CDC was deadly serious about using the brain-eating undead as a proxy for real crises, telling people to put together emergency kits just in case. 'If you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse, you will be prepared for a hurricane, pandemic, earthquake, or terrorist attack,' said then-Assistant Surgeon General Dr. Ali Khan. At the time, he was in charge of the CDC's Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director, was in charge of the agency in 2011. He took the job at the beginning of the Obama administration. Frieden has come under fire for fumbling the first three Ebola cases diagnosed on U.S. soil, including one where the agency told a nurse with direct exposure to an Ebola patient that she could get on a commercial aircraft. As serious a topic as Ebola is, the CDC was trying to latch on to pop culture with its zombie stunt. 'There are all kinds of emergencies out there that we can prepare for,' the agency's Zombie Preparedness website, which is still online, reads. 'Take a zombie apocalypse for example. That’s right, I said z-o-m-b-i-e a-p-o-c-a-l-y-p-s-e. You may laugh now, but when it happens you’ll be happy you read this, and hey, maybe you’ll even learn a thing or two about how to prepare for a real emergency.' Reactions from Web surfers were mixed. 'This might just actually spur me to make that emergency kid (sic),' one wrote. 'CDC, you are made of awesome.' The writer quickly amended those words: 'Guess I’ll stick to making an emergency kiT, since I’ve already made the emergency kid.' The CDC's social media campaign helped urge Americans to prepare for zombies, suggesting that preparing for the undead would be no harder than preparing for Ebola . World War Z: In the 2013 movie, zombies feed on humans and turn their victims into still more zombies . Twitter was a hotbed of zombie speculation on Thursday with manyn users nonplussed at the CDC's use of time and resources three years ago . Others were unimpressed, including an EMT, self-described as 'a huge zombie fan, and well prepared for disaster.' 'In a time when the Federal Government has a $14.3 Trillion debt, and cannot control spending,' that reader's message read, 'can you please post exactly how much government employee and/or contractor time was used to create this entertaining but wasteful page (including planning and approval), and how much it costs us (the taxpayer) in IT Services and support on expensive, secured government equipment to maintain such pages on a annual basis?' 'It’s not that I don’t think that you did a great jobs (sic), and I thank you for the laughs. I just want to know how much these moments cost us.' Another remarked that 'the only thing more disturbing than the CDC posting this nonsense is the number of people who seem glad that they did.' The USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism commissioned a case study based on the campaign, collecting responses from government, authors and other opinion shapers. One news anchor at WGN‑TV in Chicago, the report related, 'dismissed her station’s report on the campaign by saying on air, ""This is baloney"".' 'Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly called it one of the ""dumbest things of the week."" And an editorial in a small North Carolina newspaper commented: ""We believe Khan's time and our tax dollars could have been better spent providing instructions to readers on how to prepare for a real outbreak or hurricane or tornado."" The Walking Dead: So far, CDC Director Thomas Frieden hasn't had to deal with any actual cases of zombie sickness . The Gazette in Colorado Springs, however, praised the initiative. 'What's so great about this effort,' an editorial in that paper read, 'is that it cost the CDC all of $87 for a stock photo, and some staff time, rather than the millions spent on public information programs that nobody pays attention to.' The cost of that staff time was never reported, nor was the cost of commissioning the graphic novella, nor the opportunity cost related to putting genuine crises on the back-burner. Casting corpses that dine on brains as government disease antagonists, one conservative Republican campaign consultant told MailOnline, is full of irony. 'This is something the Obama administration can do without fear that it would blow back on them,' the operative said. 'The last time there were any brains in that building, Reagan was president. So if the zombies did come, the West Wing wouldn't look too appetizing.'

"Suspended: Jacquelyn Moore was suspended over the unannounced school shooting 'drill' A middle school principal has been suspended terrifying students and staff by staging a shooter 'drill' that involved police officers entering classrooms with guns drawn. Jacquelyn Moore, principal of Jewett Middle Academy Magnet in Winter Haven, Florida, was removed this week pending an internal investigation. During last week's drill school officers went from classroom to classroom, with guns drawn, pretending to look for active shooters. The station reported that the school resource officer involved in the drill was carrying a loaded Glock .45-caliber pistol, while a patrol officer was holding an AR-15 rifle, though it was not loaded, reports WTSP 10 News in Tampa Bay. Some of the students panicked while others hid and ducked out of the way. 'We actually thought that someone was going to come in there and kill us,' 7th-grader Lauren Marionneauxtold Fox 13. School district Superintendent Kathryn Leroy said that she never ordered an 'active shooter drill be performed with students present and officers having weapons in their hands.' She publicly apologized and promised it would never happen again. From now on, any time there is a lockdown drill at school there will be an announcement, and parents will be notified, the school district said. Horror:  During last week's drill at Jewett Middle Academy Magnet (pictured)  in Winter Haven, Florida school officers went from classroom to classroom, with guns drawn, pretending to look for active shooters . But Winter Haven Police Department's Interim Police Chief Charlie Bird told WTSP says the element of surprise is critical to making sure police and students, teachers and staff know how to react. 'The difference between a drill and an unannounced drill is that they thought this was real and people were in fear. However during this drill, an entire classroom was found to still be conducting teaching. There were students still wandering around not where they were supposed to be. Students still back at a desk playing video games.' Jacqueline Vincent is a parent of a child at the school told WFLA: 'She is a really good principal I don't think she would do anything to jeopardize the children so I am not sure why they came to that decision.'

"A disabled pensioner has been left with two months' worth of rubbish because bin men refuse to climb the three steps outside his house to collect it. Former delivery man Wilson Burdis, 67, who suffers from a severe lung complaint, said his bin has not been emptied for eight weeks due to 'health and safety' reasons. Mr Burdis, from Morley, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'They're telling me they're not allowed to take it down the three steps to the street for health and safety reasons. I just think it's ridiculous. Wilson Burdis, 67, said he has been left with two months' worth of garden waste because council workers refuse to collect it due to 'health and safety' 'I used to have to carry fridges, washing machines and all sorts up and down steps. If I'd ever have made that kind of excuse I'd have been laughed at.' Mr Burdis, who lives with his wife Jean, 68, said the household rubbish from his green and black bins is collected because the refuse teams simply take the bags out of the bins. However, the pensioner was told by bin collectors that he would have to take the brown bin - which holds garden waste - down the steps to street level himself before it could be collected. Due to his lung condition, he is unable to lift the bin and so has been left with a build-up of rotting waste. 'I've lived here for about eight years and it hasn't been a problem before,' he said of the bin collectors. The pensioner, from Morley, near Leeds, West Yorkshire, claims Leeds City Council bin collectors told him he needed to move the brown bin down three steps for it to be collected, but he is unable to due to a disability . Leeds City Council said a 'one-off' special arrangement had now been made to clear the backlog of waste. A spokesman said: 'Mr Burdis moved to a bag collection for his household and recyclable waste collection last year but at the time we did not review his garden waste collection - for which we apologise. 'We understand he is unable to take his wheeled bin to the kerbside so we have now spoken to him to offer a suitable alternative arrangement and we have also organised a one-off recovery collection in the next few days.'","Wilson Burdis, 67, said council workers won't collect his garden waste bin .

"Cancer will become a manageable condition rather than a death sentence within a decade, experts boldly predicted yesterday. Scientists believe they are close to rolling out a radical technique that allows them to develop extremely personalised cancer treatments, that will substantially increase life expectancy. They think within five to ten years they will be able to sequence the DNA of tumours in every cancer patient – allowing doctors to deliver a highly tailored treatment. Mammogram: Scientists believe they are close to rolling out a radical technique that allows them to develop extremely personalised cancer treatments, that will substantially increase life expectancy . The work, due to start at the £3million Tumour Profiling Unit in London this year, is expected to pave the way for radical forms of diagnosis, surveillance and therapy. Doctors think closely examining the genetic make-up of every individual tumour will revolutionise the effectiveness of the treatments at their disposal. They say the technique could substantially increase life expectancy, allowing terminally-ill patients to live for a decade or more in good health. For example, one patient at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea has been taking the breast cancer drug Herceptin for a decade, although this is considered an exceptional case. Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, which is running the project, said: ‘None of this is science fiction. 'One would think in five or ten years this will be absolutely routine practice for every cancer patient, and that’s what we’re aiming to bring about. ‘We should be aspiring to cure cancer, but for people with advanced disease, it will be a question of managing them better so they survive for much longer – for many years. ‘Cancer often appears in people who are old, and if we can keep them alive long enough for them to die of something else, then we are turning cancer into a chronic disease.’ Genetic profiling of cancer is already being investigated at several laboratories around the world, but the new unit will pioneer its use, he said. For example, patients with advanced breast cancer are tested to determine if their tumours have a particular type of the HER2 gene, responsible for 20 per cent of cases. Skin cancer patients with a particular type of melanoma may also be prescribed the life-prolonging drug Vemurafenib. Scientists: Currently, all cancer drugs go through a process that ends with a big trial involving several thousand patients. Such trials are designed to look for small success rates across large population (file picture) Professor Ashworth's team will use the techniques to track cancers as they progress, mutate and develop resistance to drugs. At the moment, tumour DNA has to be profile using an invasive biopsy. But the scientists now hope to develop a blood test to identify DNA floating around the body from tumours instead. They hope the programme will shed light on currently intractable problems such as so-called ‘unknown primaries’ – cancers of unknown origin that account for one in 20 cancers. It may also start to reshape the way trials of cancer treatments are conducted. Currently, all cancer drugs go through a process that ends with a big trial involving several thousand patients. 'None of this is science fiction. One would think in five or ten years this will be absolutely routine practice for every cancer patient, and that’s what we’re aiming to bring about' Professor Alan Ashworth, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research . Such trials are designed to look for small success rates across large population. But they often lead to drugs being marketed that only benefit a minority of the patients who take them. For example, only one in ten women given chemotherapy for breast cancer actually responds to the treatment. In future, big trials could be replaced by smaller studies providing much more meaningful results. Each would recruit a few hundred patients whose genetic make-up is likely to suit the treatment being tested. Professor Ashworth said: ‘Basically, the way we’re developing drugs for cancer is now failing big time. Certainly, the idea of developing old-fashioned chemotherapy is going out the window. ‘Let’s design the trials for success rather than failure.’ The research has been made possible by the rapid reduction in the cost of genetic sequencing. It took a decade of work and around £2billion to produce the first draft of the human genome, or genetic code, in 2000.","Scientists 'close to radical technique to develop personalised treatments'

"The United Nations needs to intervene to stop a Sudanese mother of two being executed for marrying a Christian, senior MPs from all parties have demanded today. Pregnant mother Meriam Ibrahim, 27, was thrown in jail in September for converting from Islam to Christianity after marrying US citizen Daniel Wani. She was sentenced to  100 lashes and death for her 'crime'. Yesterday she gave birth to her baby girl Maya  - while still shackled to the floor at the Omdurman Federal Women’s Prison in North Khartoum where she has been locked up for eight months. The case has sparked global outrage and today, after shocking images of Meriam shortly after she gave birth were published on MailOnline, a host of MPs joined forces to demand action from the UN. The plight of Meriam Ibrahim, 27, (pictured) who has spent eight months in prison after refusing to renounce Christianity, has sparked global outrage . Labour's Douglas Alexander said the case was 'barbaric' and demanded the Government 'speak out firmly' Labour’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, Douglas Alexander, told MailOnline: 'The plight of Meriam Ibrahim has outraged and shocked many people across the world. 'The UK government must speak out firmly against her barbaric sentence and continue to call on the Sudanese government to revoke it. 'Not only is her sentence abhorrent, but reports that she was shackled and restrained – even whilst giving birth, show that her treatment in detention, and the treatment of her young innocent children, has been both inhuman and cruel. 'The reports indicate that Meriam is being deliberately targeted and attacked because of her Christian faith. 'It is vital that at these moments - when the world’s attention is focused on such victims of persecution - politicians are not afraid to speak up and speak out against such attacks on innocent people because of their religious beliefs.' Veteran Lib Dem foreign affairs expert Sir Ming Campbell added that the Government now needed to raise the case at the UN. The former Lib Dem leader, who sits on the respected Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: 'This is an act of barbarity and should be universally condemned - not least because it is wholly contrary to United Nations conventions on human rights. Father Daniel Wani, a U.S. citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire, holds Maya for the first time after being allowed to visit to his wife, Meriam Ibrahim, who was sentenced to death for marrying him . Former Lib Dem leader Sir Ming Campbell said it was time for the UN to act to help Meriam Ibrahim . 'What we should be doing is making the strongest representations possible and raise it at the UN in New York.' Labour's Mike Gapes, a fellow member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, added: 'It is absolutely disgraceful. 'It is another appalling example of the religious intollerance that that world needs to confront much more strongly. 'It is barbaric. It disregards all the values and human rights of the last 50, 60 years. It disregards her human rights, her children and he right to choose her religion and her partner. 'We have got to work with the EU and with other countries - the whole International Community - to condemn this.' Mr Gapes also urged other Muslim countries to speak out. He said: 'We've got to get the Muslim and Arab world to speak out. But there are countries that share these awful reactionary attitudes.' Tory MP Priti Patel added: 'This case just shows an awful, awful disregard for human life. 'I think as much pressure should be laid on the Sudanese Government to stop this from happening. They should be universally condemned. 'They should allow this lady to carry on living her life and respect her rights. It shows blatent disregard for her rights, her children's right, her right to choose her own religion and her right to choose who she marries.' Tory MP Penny Mordaunt added: 'No person should face torture or death for their religious beliefs. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim has committed no crime, and she deserves her freedom and her dignity. 'My heart goes out to this brave young mum and her family. The international community should do everything in their power to press the Sudanese government to secure her release immediately and stop her execution.' Fellow Tory MP Henry Smith said: 'The pain and humiliation that this mother has endured for the ""crime"" of being a Christian is unimaginable and has shocked communities across the world to their core. 'We should stop at nothing to make sure that the Sudanese authorities know that Mrs Ibrahim’s treatment is unacceptable, and should demand that she is released – unharmed – as a matter of urgency.'","Death row mother Meriam Ibrahim, 27, gave birth to baby girl Maya yesterday .

"The former compound of a New Hampshire couple who infamously held off federal agents there to arrest them in a 90 day standoff has hit the market for a very reasonable $250,000.

Then, when it finally came time to turn themselves in on these charges following their trial, the two stockpiled weapons and held off federal agents for 90 days, gaining a rather large following of supporters in the process. At this same time, Ed noted that there were explosives hidden around the property to scare off trespassers. For this reason, federal agents won't even let interested buyers tour the property. Strong stand: During the standoff, Dan posted no trespassing signs and legal claims outside the door . No luck: The first auction bought in no interested buyers .

"Anger: A photo by 'Sophie Wittams' was in fact of unsuspecting Charlene Tyler, from Lincolnshire . A Tory MP plans to make a formal complaint over allegations of 'entrapment' against a newspaper that forced Brooks Newmark to resign as a minister for sending an explicit photograph of himself. Mark Pritchard said the story could be a test case for the new press regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation. Charities Minister Mr Newmark was forced to quit after allegedly sending a picture of himself wearing Paisley pyjamas to a journalist, masquerading as 'Sophie Wittams', via the instant messaging app Whatsapp. Mr Newmark admitted: 'I have been a complete fool.' However, lawyers and media commentators questioned whether there was a public interest in using subterfuge to get the Tory MP to exchange explicit images with an undercover reporter, who was working for the Sunday Mirror. Some even suggested that the paper may have committed a criminal offence by ‘tricking’ Mr Newmark into sexual activity. A male journalist working for the Sunday Mirror set up a fake Twitter account in the name of Sophie Wittams, supposedly a pretty blonde in her 20s working in PR. ‘Sophie’ described herself as a ‘twenty-something Tory PR girl’ in London, and her flirty and flattering tweets attracted the attention of several Tory MPs – including married minister Mr Newmark. Fellow Tory MP, Mr Pritchard, said on Twitter he would be referring the story to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which recently replaced the Press Complaints Commission. He told his 3,200 Twitter followers: ""Test case for IPSO Will be making formal complaint over attempted entrapment by Mirror."" Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""It is in the public interest that their actions are fully investigated. This is the first real test as to whether the new body, Ipso, has any teeth."" Tthe Sunday Mirror said the story was in the public interest. Alison Phillips, Mirror weekend editor, told the Guardian: ""This investigation was brought to the Sunday Mirror by a freelance reporter. 'The investigation, which had a clear public interest, was carried out following information from a reliable source."" IPSO's code of practice states editors must justify intrusions into people’s private lives, including when using digital communications. It adds: ‘Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.’ Charlotte Harris, media lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said: ‘I think many members of the public reading the Sunday Mirror story will consider that it does amount to entrapment – particularly if you look at when the story has been used.’ And criminal barrister Matthew Scott wrote on his blog yesterday: ‘What conceivable public interest was served by tricking Mr Newmark in this way?' Lloyd Embley, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror, defended the story after former BBC journalist Sue Llewellyn claimed it was ‘unethical’. He tweeted: ‘1) it wasn’t a Mirror sting 2) there’s a nailed-on public interest.’ The pictures of ‘Sophie’ on the account appear to have simply been taken from the internet. They show at least two different women – one an unsuspecting young woman from Lincolnshire and the other a blonde model from Sweden, who yesterday made furious claims she had been ‘exploited’. Although the name Sophie Wittams was selected for the account, it bears no connection to any real person with that name. Alluring: This picture of 'Miss Wittam's' legs - actually Miss Tyler's - was used as the journalist encouraged Mr Newmark to send explicit images. Miss Tyler said the MP had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign . However, the bogus profile was still enough to persuade the married Tory minister he was chatting to a young woman – a conversation which culminated in him sending an X-rated photo. The journalist also tried to charm a series of Conservative politicians as ‘Miss Wittams’ – and a number replied. ‘She’ described newly-elected Newark MP Robert Jenrick, 32, as a ‘fitty’, and called housing minister Brandon Lewis, 43, a ‘legend’. The reporter also tried to flirt with Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, 43, after he posted a picture of himself with two dogs at a pet shop in his Dover constituency – although the MP simply acknowledged it with a polite reply. Other Tory politicians lauded by ‘Miss Wittams’ included Dan Byles, 40, Mark Pritchard, 47, and Nick de Bois, 55. The journalist also used the account to tweet about boozy work nights out, sunbathing and sport as well as Conservative policies. There is no suggestion that any MP apart from Mr Newmark behaved inappropriately or sent any explicit material. The fake Twitter profile was set up in May and has now been deleted. Its profile photograph was yesterday revealed to be Swedish model Malin Sahlen, 22, who last night said it was ‘offensive’ to use her image without permission. '‘I have had a lot of emails, texts and phonecalls from different countries about it. It feels unreal,’ she tells Aftonbladet. ‘I do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible, both for me and others involved in this.’ On her blog she writes: ‘I feel very confused right now and still can’t comprehend that what has happened has happened. I can blog more about this another day, but right now I can’t bare to talk about it.’ Enticing: The Twitter profile picture of 'Sophie Wittams', who is really a Swedish model uninvolved in the sting. Malin Sahlen, 22, last night said it was ‘offensive’ to use her image without permission . ‘This thing feels really unpleasant.’ The undercover reporter also used another enticing picture from a young British woman’s Twitter page as part of the deception. During the summer heatwave, ‘Miss Wittams’ tweeted ‘Cheeky early finish on a Friday #lappingupthesun’. It was illustrated with a selfie of a woman’s tanned legs, which was taken from a tweet sent the previous day by Charlene Tyler, 26, from Boston, Lincolnshire. Miss Tyler told the Daily Telegraph she was upset that the Mirror had hijacked her photo for use in its sting. She said Mr Newmark had nothing to be ashamed of and should have felt no need to resign. 'I think grown adults can do whatever they like as long as both of them are over the age of consent,' she said, adding that she hoped Mr Newmark was okay and revealing she felt 'awful' about her unwitting role in his downfall. Disgraced: Brooks Newmark with his wife Lucy, just after he was elected MP for Braintree in 2005 . 'The fact that a newspaper was stealing my photograph is quite wrong. The newspaper’s taken it too far,' she said of the Mirror reporter's use of her photograph.

"A White House spokesman says officials were in touch with the Jimmy Kimmel show over President Obama appearing, but turned the opportunity down because of crises in Gaza and Ukraine . The White House has confirmed that it was in touch with the Jimmy Kimmel Live show over President Obama appearing, but decided not to go ahead with the segment after crises in both Gaza and Ukraine. White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama had considered appearing on the show during his West Coast trip this week, but had turned the opportunity down. Earnest added that the decision was 'at least in part' to do with the rapidly worsening crises in Gaza and Ukraine. Asked whether officials had decided that appearing on the light-hearted show would be a bad idea, Earnest simply replied 'we elected not to do it.' Appearing on the Kimmel show would have caused controversy for Obama, who has already been criticised for attending a large number of fundraisers during his trip despite tragedies overseas. The President is due to be in LA this evening, when the show is filmed, sparking rumours that he would make a guest appearance. TV Guide shows that on Wednesday, Kimmel has a performance from Common scheduled, but no other guests are listed. Having already appeared on TV with the likes of David Letterman and Jimmy Fallon, it was thought that Obama would feature in an hour slot on Kimmel's show. In their statement today, the While House sought to play down talks with ABC executives about Obama's appearance, but according to TMZ scheduling for the show was so advanced that officials had started to run background checks on all staff at the El Capitan theatre where the show is filmed. Obama has already been criticised for attending multiple fundraising events while on his visit to the West Coast, including for Democratic candidates in Seattle and San Fransisco on Tuesday before arriving in Los Angeles today. He will spend the day attend local Democratic National Committee events scheduled for tonight and tomorrow, when he will also appear Thursday at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. Yesterday, fans of the Kimmel show took to Twitter to discuss the news and some mocked Obama. User Jonah Goldberg saying 'Unforeseen fundraiser get in the way?' and Jeannie Bondie adding: 'So just fundraisers, then?'. Today in Gaza, Hamas has been accused of hiding rockets in an empty school next to makeshift housing for 3,000 displaced Palestinians, effectively making them human shields. With the invasion now nearly a week old, the death toll for Palestinians has reached 630, including many children. Meanwhile in Ukraine, the bodies of those killed when Flight MH17 was shot down last week are being transported out of the country for identification, following accusations that pro-Russian separatists had plundered the crash site.

"Ever wanted to stay dry in a water fight? Melbourne clothing and technology label Threadsmiths has created a revolutionary T-shirt that remains waterproof no matter how hard you try to soak it. Made from 100 per cent cotton, the plain white T-shirts called The Cavalier feature a 'hydrophobic' nano-technology application woven in the fabric and capable of repelling most liquids and dirt. A patented technology, unlike other liquid-repelling applications and aerosols which can contain chemicals, the Threadsmiths website states: 'Our shirts emulate the natural hydrophobic properties of the lotus leaf.' Scroll down for video . Melbourne clothing technology company Threadsmiths has created a waterproof T-Shirt using a patented technology . Despite the material's waterproof qualities, the fabric is made from 100 per cent cotton . 'The Cavalier shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals, and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be.' Still breathable, the Australian invention's technology boosts the material's resistance to water and stains by causing it to simply bead up and roll off the fabric. Creating a natural self-cleaning effect, any residue left on the material can be removed by just wiping or rinsing off it off with water. Lewis Pitchford of the label said the the waterproof technology did not rely on the T-shirts being coated in hydrophobic sprays available in the U.S. such as Ultra-Ever Dry, reported the Herald Sun. The T-shits contain no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals according to the fashion label . The woven technology has been patented and does not rely on the fabric being coated in hydrophobic sprays . 'Most people are pretty amazed when they see it,' he said. While the label currently only produces T-shirts, Mr Pitchford said he welcomed suggestions about what other garments to make using the fabric in the future. There is speculation the fabric could be revolutionary for restaurants and cafes, where spills on tablecloths and aprons are a daily occurrence and also in the medical sector and hospitals, reported Eftm.com.au. Machine washable, the waterproof effect will last for up to 80 washes. The T-shirts are available for men and women and retail for $65 each, while children's T-shirts are coming soon. Lewis Pitchford of Threadsmiths said the label was open to suggestion on what garments to make next . From left, Olivia Cianci, Stevie Shumack and Tiphaine Calixte tested the hydrophobic T-shirts out on Bronte Beach in Sydney's eastern suburbs and found them to be waterproof despite their best efforts to saturate them .","A Melbourne label has created a 100 per cent cotton waterproof T-shirt .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had no idea it was the 16th anniversary of Steven Gerrard's debut and felt bad leaving him out of the team for the 1-0 win over Stoke. However, the captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by Glen Johnson five minutes from time to end a three-match losing streak in the Premier League. 'I wasn't aware it was 16 years until I walked into the dressing room and saw the programme,' said the Reds boss. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Liverpool 1-0 Stoke City . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had no idea it was the 16th anniversary of Steven Gerrard's debut . 'I spoke to him yesterday and he didn't mention it so I felt bad when I saw about 20 pictures on the programme. 'Steven is in a part of his career when he is not going to play every minute of every game. 'He played Palace and he played Ludogorets when he was outstanding and put in a huge amount of effort, and we have other players here who can come in and do a job and Steven understands that. 'I need to look at each game. We have good players that are fresh. 'He came on and gave a great contribution towards the end and his experience and stature in the game helped us at that point, but I thought the team overall was excellent.' Gerrard's contract expires at the end of this season and the 34-year-old has said he is not yet prepared to hang up his boots, like close friend Jamie Carragher did the season before last. The captain was on the pitch when the winner was scored by Glen Johnson five minutes from time . But with questions being asked about how much longer Gerrard can be effective at the highest level, a new deal may not be as straightforward as it once was. 'Not that I am aware of,' was Rodgers' response when asked whether there had been any progress on a new contract. 'I think the club is talking with Steven's representatives so there is no update on that.' After a turgid first half performance the Reds improved after the break, but it took Johnson's diving header after Rickie Lambert's header had bounced down off the crossbar to finally break the deadlock. But Liverpool were also indebted to goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, whose high-profile blunder in midweek against Ludogorets only increased the spotlight on him after some indifferent performances. The Belgian made one brilliant close-range save to deny Mame Biram Diouf just before Johnson struck while Bojan Krkic also hit a post. Gerrard applauds the fans as they chant his name after the Premier League clash . 'He has made a couple of great saves. We asked him to simplify his game and do what he is good at, which is shot-stopping,' said Rodgers. 'He came for a couple of crosses at the end when the pressure was on and he made a couple of great saves, and I am very pleased for him as he is a very good guy who is working hard at his game.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes was deflated he could not break the Potters' woeful run at Anfield, where they have not won a top-flight match in 51 attempts and last scored in 1983. 'We feel a little bit disappointed. We put a huge effort in,' he said. 'Our record here hasn't been great. We thought this was a real opportunity to wipe the slate clean and get a positive result. 'In the first half Liverpool created very little. In the second half it became more open because we were looking for a winner.' Glen Johnson strikes late with a header to give his side a much-needed 1-0 victory over Stoke City at Anfield .","Liverpool beat Stoke City 1-0 in their Premier League clash .

"The little brother of a nine-year-old fatally stabbed at a playground near his western Michigan home had touching and shockingly mature words to share at a memorial service Wednesday. Kameron Verkerke, at just 7-years-old, told a packed church in Kent County that his brother Connor--who he helped get home in the wake of the tragedy--would have wanted his family to stay strong despite their pain. 'It's hard to go through this,' Kameron said. 'But he's in a better place, and we know that he doesn't want us to be sad all our life. We know he wants us to be happy, even though it's really hard to.'

The . boy, called Connor by family and friends, was playing with some other . children on the playground in Kentwood, near Grand Rapids, on August 4, . when witnesses say one boy pulled a knife and stabbed Connor in the . back. Connor died at a hospital, and the alleged assailant, a 12-year-old, is facing a murder charge. The service was largely free of talk about the incident.

State of shock: Connor's grandmother, Toni Nunemaker, gave a speech during the memorial service at Cornerstone Church in Caledonia, Michigan . 'It was all about Connor, whose father called him 'one of my heroes.' 'I have never known anybody' who loved as much as 'my nine-year-old son,' said Jared Verkerke. He was one of several family members, teachers and others who spoke at the service. Many attendees were dressed in their Boy Scouts uniforms. Connor was a Cub Scout and hoped to become an Eagle Scout one day. The scouts gave Connor a special 'Scout salute' in front of a collection of his favorite things, reports the Detroit Free Press, including a skateboard, a soccer ball and favorite books. As they later filed out, the scouts would salute Connor's family as the Beatle's song Blackbird played. Dearly missed: Crowds gather at a vigil held earlier this month for Connor .

"When a camera trap set up on the banks of Australia’s Kimberley’s Margaret River went missing earlier this year, local rangers assumed it had fallen into the water. Yet three weeks later the camera was found almost 65 miles upriver and the footage revealed it had actually been stolen by a sea eagle. The wings of the eagle are shown flapping during the one-minute clip before the bird lands and pecks at the screen. A sea eagle, in particular the White-Tailed variety, is also known as an 'erne' or 'ern'. The birds vary in size from around 6lb to almost 20lbs. Their diets consist mainly of fish and small mammals. The last British sea eagle was shot in 1916 and the species disappeared from the wild for over 50 years but they are now thriving. Species are found across north America, Australia and Europe. The Gooniyandi Indigenous Rangers, including Roneil Skeen, set up the trap to capture footage of saltwater crocodiles in Northwest Australia. On a routine check of the traps, Mr Skeen noticed the camera had gone missing and assumed it had been washed away. A passer-by called the rangers three weeks later to say they had found the camera around 65 miles upriver from where the trap was set. Once Mr Skeen examined the footage he discovered that a juvenile sea eagle had picked up the camera, flown for around 20 seconds before landing and pecking the screen. The first shots show the wings of the bird flapping as it flies along the river, it is then placed on the rocks on the river bed before capturing the full face of the winged thief. ‘Unexpectedly our camera went missing,’ Skeen told ABC Kimberley, ‘we thought that it had fallen into the water but a juvenile sea eagle came and took-off with it.’ It is not the first time birds have been caught interacting with cameras in the wild. In August a colony of Gentoo penguins tried to pick up a GoPro camera that had been set up on the Falkland Islands. Once rangers examined the footage from the missing camera they discovered that a juvenile sea eagle had picked up the camera, flown for around 20 seconds, pictured, before landing and pecking the screen . At the end of the minute-long footage, the bird is showing placing the camera on the rocks on the river bed before inquisitively examining the screen with his beak, pictured . Gooniyandi Indigenous Rangers set up the camera trap on the banks of Australia's Kimberley's Margaret River, pictured, in Northwest Australia to capture footage of saltwater crocodiles . One shot record the inside of the penguins beak as it reached for the camera. Other conservationists recently strapped cameras to the back of gannets off the coast of Wales to learn more about what they get up to 300 miles at sea. The gannet cam discovered that the sea birds circle at 30 metres high before diving for fish at speeds of up to 60mph. Watching the footage revealed male gannets tended to feed more at trawlers than females, too. Dr Votier said this difference may have conservation implications when a ban on discarding is implemented under reforms to the EU Common Fisheries Policy.

"A jealous lover who murdered his girlfriend over her affair with a man she met on a dating site for Oxbridge graduates was jailed for life today. Jonathan Tebbs, 46, stabbed dedicated town hall chief Kate Dixon 29 times with a Swiss Army knife before reading an Oscar Wilde poem about a man who kills his wife. He stripped her clothes off and calmly carried her into the shower where he washed the blood from her lifeless body at a flat in Streatham, south London. The killer attempted to scrub the murder scene clean and then searched on the internet for Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which includes the verse: 'Yet each man kills the thing he loves … The coward does it with a kiss, the brave man with the sword.' Cambridge-educated council chief Kate Dixon (left) branded her ex-lover Jonathan Tebbs (right) a 'Nazi' days before he stabbed her to death with Swiss Army knife . Tebbs became enraged after learning Ms Dixon, 41, was in a relationship with a man she met on Blue Match - an upper crust dating website for Oxbridge graduates. The controlling killer became increasingly possessive after believing that he and Ms Dixon were meant to be together, Southwark Crown Court heard. He flew into a rage after confronting the council figurehead about her relationship with Mark Baynes when he caught the pair on Skype together. Today, a jury of seven women and five men took less than three hours to unanimously find Tebbs guilty of murder. The killer, wearing a black three-piece suit, lavender shirt and blue tie, bowed his head as the verdict was announced while cries of 'yes' came from the public gallery packed with Kate's close friends and family. A statement prepared on behalf of the grieving family said: 'Kate's shocking death has deprived Kate of a life she enjoyed and richly deserved. Mark Baynes, the boyfriend of Kate Dixon, leaving Southwark Crown Court after he gave evidence . 'It has deprived Kate and Mark Baynes of the life that they were planning together and were looking forward too very much. 'It has deprived the council of a manager who contributed much to services she was involved in and it has deprived her close colleagues and friends of Kate's company.' Sacha Wass QC, defending, said Tebbs 'lost his temper', adding: 'He clearly loved her, he clearly felt unable to cope without her and because of his personality traits, it was much more difficult for him to intellectualise, which he clearly tried to do but clearly failed to do, because of his actions on that night.' Ms Dixon, who was joint head of strategy, equality and performance at Islington Council, started a tumultuous 12-year romance with Tebbs after meeting him on a Tube train. But she became disillusioned and on numerous occasions tried to end the relationship despite being 'fearful' of Tebbs and 'frightened of what he was capable of'. On the night of the killing, Ms Dixon finally plucked up the courage to end the relationship with Tebbs after he caught her Skyping Mr Baynes. Tebbs, who taped his conversations with Ms Dixon, made his final ever recording of his girlfriend just shortly before he stabbed her to death. Jurors were played the chilling two-and-a-half-hour recording which began after Tebbs had snatched Ms Dixon's phone away from her, demanding to know more about her new romance. Ms Dixon told Tebbs that she wanted to end their relationship but the jealous lover quickly interrupted and went on an hour-long unbroken rant, accusing her of cheating on him because of her difficult relationship with her father. The court heard that Ms Dixon had undergone psychotherapy after meeting her biological father for the first time. Southwark Crown Court heard Tebbs denied the murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was later convicted of murder . Tebbs began raising his voice when she refused to tell him exactly where her new boyfriend was from in the Midlands. He shouted at her that she had 'destroyed their relationship' by seeing Mr Baynes and then demanded to know whether they had sex. Tebbs barked: 'He comes from Birmingham, has cups of coffee, gives you a kiss, and then says goodbye - is that it?' In the final moments of the recording, Tebbs said: 'You have no f*****g respect for me whatsoever, you continue to lie even now'. Yet each man kills the thing he loves, . By each let this be heard, . Some do it with a bitter look, . Some with a flattering word, . The coward does it with a kiss, . The brave man with a sword!from The Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde . The tape cut out shortly before Tebbs stabbed Ms Dixon to death with his Swiss Army knife.Tebbs, . who bowed his head in the dock and stared down at the floor while the . tape was played, wiped tears from his eyes once it had finished. Giving evidence, he denied being a possessive or controlling partner and claimed Ms Dixon had no reason to be scared of him. 'I . was very supportive of her, and I think she developed and grew as a . person and a woman over the years, and I was proud to see that happen . and as a result of that I fell in love with her even more', he said. The . pair planned to move in together in September 2012, but Tebbs' discovery of an online dating flyer on the day of the move led to their . fourth break up in 12 years. Tebbs said of the final row: 'She was leading up to say the relationship wasn't working and I was trying to rationalise it.' She told me: 'Our relationship is over. I said ""Do you really mean this?"" She looked me in the eye and said 'Life is unfair. 'I said with incredulity ""I can't believe it"" - I grabbed the knife off the laptop and by the time she moved back I didn't say anything else, I just stabbed her.' He added: 'I can't believe I did it, I can't believe it was me.' Tebbs had told the court how he ultimately dialled 999, but this was only done at 10am the following morning after he had dragged her body to the bathroom to undress and wash her. In the hours after the murder Tebbs researched Oscar Wilde poetry and how to write a will online, before withdrawing cash and emailing his sister with the line: 'I stabbed her'. On July 1 he contacted police when he handed them a five-page statement. He was charged with murder the following day. Tributes flooded in for Ms Dixon, with colleagues describing her as the 'best manager they ever had'. The council figurehead was responsible for some of the biggest projects focusing on helping vulnerable people in Islington, including underprivileged children. Tebbs, of Finsbury Park, north London, was convicted of murder. He had admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Sentencing Tebbs to life imprisonment and ordering he serve at least 19 years, Judge McCreath said: 'Kate Dixon, of whom we have heard much during this trial and of whom we have heard more from the moving statement read to the court this morning, was a good, kind and much loved woman. 'The evidence I have heard makes it plain that even from the time she tried to end her relationship with you, a combination of that kindness, her affection for you and the domination you exercised over her made it impossible for her to do so. 'The evidence also shows that whilst you are, as I recognise, a man of virtues, you are also a man who needs to be in control of those you are close to and you are a man with quick temper.' The judge said the break-up 'cannot have come to you as a bolt out of the blue'. 'Everything she said to you that night she had already told you or tried to on the previous Monday night. You stabbed her many, many times. 'She tried her best to defend herself against the brutal attack and - on your own account - begged you to stop. I accept that this was not premeditated. 'The fact remains that this was a ferocious attack on a defenceless, vulnerable woman, a woman much smaller than you and in her own home, with a knife. 'Your reaction was not to seek any sort of help but instead you cleared up the scene of this dreadful event and manufactured a false account of what had happened. 'You will remain in prison for a minimum term which I must now set. The sentence on you is imprisonment for life, with a minimum term of 20 years, less the time you have spend in custody on remand.' Tebbs stared down at the floor as he was sentenced while grieving relatives and friends looked on. Detective Inspector Louise Knipe, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'What was clear to us throughout this investigation was that Kate Dixon had finally summoned the courage she needed to leave Tebbs. 'However he was of the mindset that if he couldn't have her, no one else would. He wouldn't allow her to leave and he made sure of that by brutally stabbing her to death. 'Tebbs's behavior was not as a result, as he tried to portray in court, loss of control at suddenly finding out about the new person Miss Dixon had met. 'He knew about this in the week before he killed her and after he did, he was clear-headed. He scrubbed the flat, he was organised and he was putting his house in order. I'm pleased the jury rejected his claims today and convicted him of murder.'","Jonathan Tebbs had 'possessive' 12-year relationship with Kate Dixon .

"Ryan Lochte knocked Olympic icon Michael Phelps off his perch on Saturday with a brilliant performance to win the men's 400m individual medley. But just minutes later, in the women's version of the event, a 16-year-old Chinese prodigy performed an even more amazing feat as she smashed the world record and left her competitors far behind. Ye Shiwen posted such a good time that her final 50m was in fact faster than Lochte's performance in the men's event, at just 28.93 seconds. Her achievement was so unprecedented that it even led some broadcasters to question whether Ye had benefited from underhand practices. Record breaker: Ye Shiwen knocked five seconds off her personal best and broke the world record by more than a second as she stormed to gold in the 400m individual medley in the London Olympics . Beaten: Ryan Lochte, pictured, was slower than Ye over the last 50 metres of his own medley race . BBC presenter . Clare Balding asked former British Olympian Mark Foster, who was in the studio . as a pundit: ‘How many questions will there be, Mark, about somebody who . can suddenly swim so much faster than she has ever swum before?’ Chinese swimming has previously been . tainted by drug scandals – another 16-year-old world champion tested . positive for doping last month – but Foster sought to play down any . suggestion of cheating. He said: ‘It was a five-second best . time and it was the way she did it as well. Bearing in mind she is 16 . years of age, and when you are young you do some big best times… it can . be done.’ Miss Balding’s question provoked a storm among BBC viewers on Twitter, with many praising her for daring to even hint at the possibility of cheating, but many criticising her for tainting the Chinese swimmer’s achievement and some even calling for her sacking. @aliwillson was outraged at Miss Balding's query, and said:'Ye . Shiwen sets world record and Clare Balding immediate intimates she . doping. Who the hell does she think she is?! #BBC pls fire her ASAP' Whereas ‏@ImroTseng felt that Balding not questioning other record breakers' success in years gone by was unfair. But others applauded her for simply questioning how Miss Ye was able to record such an impressive time, and beat the world record by such a margin. Sky's . cricket pundit and presenter David Lloyd was among them. ‏@BumbleCricket simply said: 'Clare Balding a brilliant broadcaster' Angered: Some users took to Twitter, with @aliwillson even calling for Miss Balding's sacking . Unfair: This user believes Miss Balding was wrong to broach the subject in Miss Ye's case . Defence: Others, including David Lloyd, hailed the broadcaster for her comments . Ye's total time was 4:28.43, a world . record which was three seconds ahead of her closest rival and five . seconds quicker than her own personal best. While . Lochte, 27, was 23 seconds faster than Ye overall, he took 29.10 . seconds to complete the final 50m freestyle lap of the race, 0.17 . seconds slower than the Chinese teenager. The American star said he admired . Ye's achievement, and even suggested that she might be able to beat him . in a head-to-head race. 'We were all talking about it last night at dinner, it is pretty impressive,' Lochte said on Sunday. 'She's fast, if she was there with me, maybe she would have beaten me.' Ye herself was humble in response to her record-breaking swim, and put it down to the quality of her coaching. Medal winners: Ye Shiwen shows off the gold alongside the United States' Elizabeth Beisel, left, and compatriot Li Xuanxu following the final . Proud: Ye attributes her success to the training she has received since being identified as a potential champion . 'I think it is because I have had very good training recently, which is why I got this result,' she said. 'I am so excited, this is like . something out of a dream. Before the final I didn't sleep so well, but . it didn't effect my performance, I have trained hard.' The champion added: 'I am very young and I am sure I will just get better.' Last night the BBC defended Miss . Balding’s comments, insisting: ‘The Chinese swimmer had just knocked . five seconds off her personal best to break a world record; in her role . as a presenter it is Clare’s job to ask the experts (in this case Mark . Foster), how she managed to do it. There was absolutely no implication . of doping.’ The success of China, which won more . gold medals in the pool on the first day than it did in the whole of its . own Olympics in Beijing four years ago – prompted further questions, . with some fearing China’s sudden resurgence is a throwback to days of . the 1994 Rome world championships, when its drug-powered women swept to . 13 of the 16 available golds. Questions: Appearing alongside former British Olympian Mark Foster, BBC Commentator Clare Balding questioned whether Ye had benefited from underhand practices . Publicity: Ye's achievement is sure to catapult her into the top rank of Chinese sports stars . In June Chinese state media said . 16-year-old Li Zhesi, part of the country’s winning team at the 2009 . World Championships, had tested positive for a performance-enhancing . drug, EPO, which boosts the body’s oxygen supplies. The Chinese, who point out that their . athletes are regularly tested, have gone to great lengths to ensure . there is no chance of any of their athletes failing dope tests in London . and are said to have even imposed a ban on them eating the food . prepared at the Olympic Village. Miss Ye began her illustrious career . when she was plucked from a primary school classroom. Teachers in China . are trained to look out for pupils with promising physical attributes . and noticing the seven-year-old had unusually large hands and long legs, . her teacher alerted the local government sports officials. She left home to begin an intensive . training regime at one of China’s 3,000-plus state-run and funded ‘medal . factories’, designed to transform talented youths into ruthless . sporting machines. Congratulations: Ye Shiwen hugs Xuanxu Li after her victory at the Aquatics Centre at the Olympic Park . Sensation: Ye Shiwen managed to swim the final 50m length in the race in . a time of 28.93, a time that was quicker than the men's champion Ryan . Lochte . Disappointed: Lochte shakes hand with Michael Phelps after they won silver in the 4x100m relay . Aged just 12, she was selected for the national team. She took her trainers by surprise at the World Championships in Shanghai last year, producing a devastating freestyle triumph in the 200m individual medley. Her trajectory caught Communist Party propagandists by surprise, but they have since given her the kind of profile usually afforded to more established stars. ‘Her career has been rocket-like. She’s one of the other great discoveries following the 2008 Beijing Olympics,’ the Communist Party’s newspaper of choice, the People’s Daily, declared.","Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen smashed world record by a second and her own personal best by five .

The five-bedroom property, in the exclusive Chester Square in Belgravia, is being restored to reinstate its Georgian features. Recent pictures show it needing some attention, with faded wallpaper revealing where pictures once hung. The renovation aims to get rid of new features that are 'not fitting' with the home's character. Baroness Thatcher, who died aged 87 last April, had lived in the property since 1991. Sir Denis, Lady Thatcher's husband, took . out a 10-year lease on the house for £700,000 in 1991. The lease was . renewed a decade later, the Guardian reported. The library will become a 'snug' and a 'security' room will be turned into a bedroom. The bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms will also be rearranged, documents reveal. A planning application obtained by The Independent states: 'Throughout the property, there is evidence of original features being replaced with cornices, skirtings and other detailing, which are not fitting with the Georgian criterion. 'It is proposed to reinstate these features.' The paper reported that house was 'sold last summer' for an undisclosed price. It is now believed to sell for £12million as a singular family home. It is not known whether the property formed part of Baroness Thatcher's will. According to the Land Registry the property was bought for £2.4million in 2006 by Bakeland Property Company Ltd, based in the British Virgin Islands. However, the former prime minister continued to live there until a few months before her death. The former prime minister, who died last April aged 87, had lived in the property since 1991 . It is thought her children, Carol and Mark Thatcher, could have a share in the property, where they stood to announce their mother's death. Sources close to the family revealed the sub-lease to 73 Chester Square expired in 2010, and Mark would have liked her to move out so that the property could be sold. But this was regarded by everyone else as out of the question, given her age and health. So she stayed, but the argument aroused tensions.","Belgravia property will be stripped of modern features added by new owners .

"A special firearms police officer been awarded £20,000 for sexual . discrimination against the North Yorkshire Police. The officer can only . be identified as Mrs M for security reasons . An elite police markswoman has won £20,000 compensation after being bullied by colleagues. She was accused of having an affair with a senior officer and told she could not work with another woman because they would need to go to the toilet together. Colleagues also hid a stash of hardcore pornography in a cabinet for her to discover during a training exercise. And at the end of a recruitment day, a training inspector asked the officer, who for legal reasons can only be named as Miss M: 'Would you like me to get you some pink guns?' An employment tribunal found there was a 'culture of discrimination' in her team at North Yorkshire Police. It ruled that senior officers failed to investigate her complaints properly and said the claims about the affair were 'salacious and unsubstantiated'. Miss M, who remains a police officer, said the abuse damaged her career and left her tearful and unable to sleep. She complained three times in 2010, before making an official complaint in January 2011, when she was kicked out of the firearms unit. At the tribunal in London, Miss M's lawyer, Damian Kelly, accused the force of a 'cover-up' and said a senior officer had sided with 'the lads', leaving his client isolated. 'It is unfortunate that in the 21st century, discrimination of this kind can still take place in the police force,' Mr Kelly said after the hearing. The tribunal panel ruled in favour of Miss M on three counts of sex discrimination and handed her the five-figure sum. Of this, £5,000 was for the 'unsubstantiated' claim about the affair that was repeated during the tribunal. Four other allegations of sex discrimination were not proved. A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'In view of the tribunal's earlier findings, the force accepts that the claimant officer was entitled to an award of damages. 'These have been assessed as being in the middle band of the amounts set out in the law for compensation for injury to feelings in cases of this kind. 'We take on board the tribunal's additional award for extra distress caused, in the main, by the officer's original complaints not having been investigated as quickly as they ought to have been. Miss M completed her training as an authorised firearms officer in 2006. Between 2006 and 2010 she would periodically attend courses run by the North Yorkshire Police firearms training unit . 'The force does not intend to appeal against the tribunal's awards. 'Lessons learned from the case have been, and will continue to be, carried into effect. For legal reasons - including the national security rules which apply to aspects of the case - we are not in a position to issue any further statement about the issues in this claim.' The county's police and crime commissioner, Julia Mulligan, said: 'This was clearly a distressing case for the officer, and it is right she has been awarded damages. 'We must now focus on the lessons we have learned and improve the support for officers who make complaints. 'Speaking generally, I know how difficult it can be for a woman in a male-dominated environment. I want to ensure we have a fair and equal workplace for all.'","The former firearms officer is identified only as Miss M for security reasons .

"A young girl and her mother have been left heartbroken after their beloved pony and horse were burned alive by arsonists. Milli Knowles, 10, and stablehand Samantha Brierley, 38, were called to the stables near Bolton where they kept their pet animals after reports of an early-morning fire. Their nine-year-old cob, named The General, and their Shetland pony Penny, 27 - who were said to be regarded as 'family' - had been killed in the blaze. Destroyed: The blackened remains of stables near Bolton, Greater Manchester, where a Shetland pony and a horse were burned alive in an arson attack. Police believe the arsonists used petrol and firelighters to start the blaze . Killed: Shetland pony Penny, 27 (left) and horse The General (right), 9, who were burned alive in an arson attack on Tuesday morning. The two animals, owned by Milli Knowles and her mother Samantha Brierley, were said to be part of the family . Police believe both animals were killed when arsonists crept into their remote stables on Tuesday morning and used petrol and firelighters to set them on fire. Milli’s father John Knowles, 44, a glass repairman, said the culprits were 'sick'. He said: 'I have got no idea why this has happened. I can’t believe it has happened. 'How can someone do something like that? It is just sick.' A neighbour phoned the fire brigade just after 4am on Tuesday morning when they were woken by the fire. But the horse and pony were trapped inside the wooden building and could not be saved. When Miss Brierley was called to the stables in Astley Bridge, Greater Manchester, she collapsed with shock. Part of the family: Milli Knowles, 10, shown grooming her Shetland pony Penny. Milli has grown up with the animals and wants to be a stablehand when she is older. Her father Mr Knowles said Penny was part of the family and his daughter is heartbroken about what has happened . Miss Brierley said: 'I got a phone call to say the stables were on fire and I just needed to get here. Apparently I collapsed. 'Those animals were everything. I spend a big part of my life here. I feel like my heart has been ripped out.' The fire took place just hours after Milli and Miss Brierley had taken out the animals for rides over the weekend. Mr Knowles said: 'Milli simply cannot understand why someone would do something like this. 'She keeps asking the question: ‘Why would they do it?’ and unfortunately that question cannot be answered logically by anyone.' Devastated: John Knowles, whose daughter Milli and fiancée Miss Brierley looked after the horses, says his family is heartbroken about what has happened. He said the arsonists, who carried out the attack on the site he is standing, were 'sick' Burned out: The wreckage left by arsonists who burned alive two animals belonging to 10-year-old Milli Knowles and her family. Milli, her mother Miss Brierley and her father Mr Knowles had visited the stables to see the horses the night before the shocking attack . Mr Knowles said the horses had been put to bed by the family the night before. He said: 'Then we got a phone call at 5.15 am from the stable owner telling us to come down right now. 'He had got there within minutes as he lives just up the road. 'When we got there the fire was just . being put out by the fire brigade although it was still smoking. The . horses had burned alive inside.' The General: Samantha Brierley, a stablehand, loved the two animals and went to the stables every day to look after them with her daughter Milli. The pair had been out riding the horse and pony just days before the fire . Gone: The family were called to the stables early on Tuesday morning after the fire had started. Miss Brierley was so devastated by what had happened to her horses, above, that she collapsed crying on the floor . 'General was my fiancee’s horse and the site was very horrific for her. 'She . collapsed crying on the floor in front of the stables when she saw what . had happened. The fire brigade put her in a fire engine to look after . her for a bit. 'Milli also came down with us when we got the call. Penny was her baby and she is just as destroyed as the rest of us.' Mr Knowles said neighbours had seen the . stables on fire at 4.45am but another neighbour had seen the stable on . fire around 30 minutes earlier. He said: 'A . van came earlier today to remove the remains of the horses although . there is very little left of them. It is absolutely heartbreaking. The . horses are like our kids. Investigation: Detective Constable Dave Harris, from Greater Manchester Police, is urging members of the public to come forward with any information. The force has launched a joint investigation with the fire service after a horse and a pony were killed in a suspected arson attack . 'I do not think this experience will ever leave my fiancée. I don’t see us having anymore horses in the near future. 'Samantha's job is to look after horses and this is going to make her work . very hard. She has loved horses ever since she was a little girl. 'Penny is my daughter’s first horse and she was really attached to her. She is just destroyed and heartbroken now. 'Milli has gone through a lot of trauma with Penny because she was stolen 12 months ago although we eventually got her back. 'Now this has just topped it off really. She is a 10-year-old girl and she finds it very emotional. It is . absolutely heartbreaking.' The stables, owned by David Davies, had been rented out to the Knowles family for the past eight months. Mr Davies was due to sell the stables, along with his home and land, later this week at auction . Mr Knowles said Milli would always help muck out Penny's stable. He said: 'Sometimes, mainly on weekends, she would get up before 6.30am to help Samantha muck out and groom them. 'Every day after school she would go to the stables to look after Penny. 'Friends of hers and kids from school would often come around to help her groom the horses. In many ways it was a big family effort. 'Sometimes said she want to do what my fiancé does, which is to look after horses. 'She is very relaxed with animals and she really loves them. We are at a loss as to why this has happened.' Stable owner David Davies built the stable block several years ago to house his own horses. He has rented it out to the Knowles family for the past eight months. Mr Davies was due to sell the stables, his nearby home and riverbank land at auction later this week. He said: 'The scene of the fire was just horrendous. I can’t envisage how anyone could do anything like that. They owners of those animals loved them to bits.' Detective Constable Dave Harris, from Greater Manchester Police, said police were investigating the fire along with the fire service. He said: 'This was a deliberate fire that caused the death of two horses. 'The owner is understandably very distressed and we want to find out who did this as soon as possible. 'I would urge anyone who may have seen someone acting in a suspicious manner around the stables to contact police.'","The fire was started by arsonists at stables in Bolton, Manchester .

"Created: . 04:40 EST, 1 July 2014 . Joined by thousands of mourners, the mothers of three Israeli teenagers murdered on their way home from school saw their bodies laid to rest yesterday. Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Naftali Fraenkel and Gilad Shaar are believed to have been shot dead in the backseat of a car after one of them managed to call police and whisper: 'We've been kidnapped.' Their abductors shot them during the phone call, it is believed, fearing security forces would find them. In fact, officers thought the call was a prank and the alarm was not raised for another seven hours, according to local reports. Scroll down for video .

Laid on stretchers and wrapped in blue and white Israeli flags, the bodies were to be laid to rest together in the central Israeli town of Modiin. The services were held as it was reported investigators were looking into whether the teenagers were murdered after one of the boys called the police.

Pictured are the parents and sister of Gilad Shaar at the funeral service in his hometown . Yosuf abu Zaghah is the first Palestinian casualty since the bodies were found. His funeral took place today . Force: A huge ball of fire is seen following an Israel airstrike in Rafah, southern Gaza in the early hours of this morning. Aggresive crackdown: Israeli soldiers (pictured) have since arrested a number of Palestinians linked to the Islamist group Hamas in the West Bank since the boys' deaths . Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon issued a statement this morning vowing to find those behind the killings. 'We . see Hamas responsible for the kidnappings and murders. We will continue . to pursue the murderers of the teens and will not rest until we lay our . hands on them,' he said. Mr . Zaghah, who was killed in the early hours of this morning while police . carried out a raid, is the first casualty of the increased tension . between Israelis and Palestinians. Reports say he had thrown a grenade at Israeli soldiers before he was shot. A . military spokesman meanwhile said aircraft struck 34 targets across . Gaza overnight after more than 20 rockets were fired into Israel since . late Sunday from the Palestinian territory. Tragedy: The bodies of Naftali Frenkel, a 16-year-old with dual Israeli-American citizenship, and two Israeli teenagers have been found two weeks after their disappearance .

Grief: Israelis mourn and light candles in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv shortly after yesterday's announcement that the bodies of the three missing Israeli teenagers were found . The discovery of the three boys' bodies lead to an outpouring of grief across Israel - not least in Tel Aviv,  where of large gathering of mostly teenagers lit candles and displayed the Israeli flag . In an operation codenamed 'Brother's Keeper,' Israel dispatched thousands of troops across the West Bank in search of the youths, closed roads in the Hebron area and arrested some 400 Hamas operatives throughout the territory. Israel stepped up its crackdown on Palestinians linked to Hamas following the discovery of the teenagers' bodies last night. The . boys’ disappearance while hitchhiking a fortnight ago triggered one of . the country’s biggest ever manhunts. Now the grim find near the city of . Hebron seems certain to increase Israel's aggression against the Palestinian militant group, . which has its power base in the Gaza Strip . Hamas . spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned against escalation, saying that if . Netanyahu 'brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him.' Within hours of the teenagers' bodies being found, the Israeli army set off a huge explosion in the home of one of the suspects Amar Abu-Eisha. Here Abu-Eisha's relatives inspect the damage to the property . Both Amer Abu-Eisha and his co-suspect Marwan Kawasmeh appear to have gone missing, with Israel claiming they are on the run.

Location: Israeli soldiers stand near the area where the three Israeli teenagers' bodies were found yesterday. The rural track is just outside the village of Halhul, a few miles north of the West Bank city of Hebron . Now that the boys' bodies have been found, Israel has threatened to 'make Hamas pay' for their deaths. Israeli soldiers (pictured) have since arrested a number of Palestinians linked to the Islamist group in the West Bank . Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today . programme this morning, Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to United . States, said: ‘For the last 18 days we have been praying that these boys . were returned safe and sound and it has hit the country hard to find . out that they were kidnapped and murdered. ‘We . have had rockets fired at us so I wouldn’t have said it is retaliation. This is a Hamas action and it was perpetrated by Hamas. Hamas calls for . the murder of Jews worldwide and now it’s done this. Israel’s . government has made the decision to protect its population,' he added. ‘Hamas . has not taken responsibility for its actions. But they are celebrating . on the streets, praising it and calling for more and more . kidnappings...‘We are talking about a terrorist organisation. It is no . different to ISIS or Al Qaeda,' Mr Dermer went on to day. ‘I’m . sure the United States will support us in fighting terrorism. They are . doing it thousands of miles away, we are doing it on our doorsteps,' he . added. Israel has released . no further details on its missile targets, but in recent weeks has . repeatedly hit launch sites and weapons storage areas in similar . attacks. Suspects: The Israeli Defense Force had named Marwan Kawasmeh (right) and Amar Abu-Eisha (left) as the teen's kidnappers in an announcement made last Thursday. They are still allegedly on the run .

Discovery: Israeli soldiers patrol close to the area where the bodies of the three Israeli teenagers were found . There have been no immediate reports of casualties. Netanyahu, who earlier yesterday held Hamas responsible for the new rocket strikes from Gaza, convened his security cabinet to consider moves against the Islamist group, which has neither confirmed nor denied Israel's allegations about the kidnapping. The senior ministers ended their late-night session without taking any final decisions and plan to reconvene later on Tuesday, a government official said. 'Netanyahu's threats against Gaza and against Hamas do not frighten us,' the movement's Gaza-based leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was quoted as saying by its Al-Quds television station.
