"Corruption in the UK has grown since the coalition came to power and has caused a 'crisis of trust' in Britain's political system, according to a new survey. Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, released today, revealed that 65 per cent of people believe that corruption has increased in the past two years. The figures are part of a survey of 114,000 people in 107 countries about bribery around the world. Since 2010, public trust in institutions such as the media, judiciary and police have dropped. Rise: Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, released today, revealed that 65 per cent of people believe that corruption has increased in the past two years . Almost 70 per cent of people now believe the sector has a corruption problem - up from less than 40 per cent two years ago. The number of Britons admitting to paying a bribe has also jumped. One in 20 people in Britain say they have paid a bribe for services - up from just one in 100 in 2010. Investigation: The figures are part of a survey of 114,000 people in 107 countries about bribery around the world . Drop: Since 2010, public trust in institutions such as the media, judiciary and police have dropped . The report said the UK Government 'has not been paying sufficient attention to this disturbing trend'. One in five Britons said they had resorted to bribing people in the judicial system, while almost one in ten said they had paid a bribe while in contact with the police. Seven per cent said they had bribed education officials, while 11 per cent of people who had contact with the registry and permit services or land services said they bribed workers. The report found that while corruption 'is not endemic' there are 'significant problems' that should be addressed. The report's authors said the results show a 'crisis of trust' in Britain's political system. UK corruption is worsening, according to the public poll, and one in 20 people admit to paying a bribe . Two thirds of people believe political parties are corrupt and 55 per cent believe that the British parliament has a corruption problem. Nine out of ten people say the UK Government is run by a few big entities acting in their own interest. Robert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International UK, said the country has been 'complacent about corruption' despite warning signals over the past five years. He said: 'The result is now beginning to show, and some recent actions, like the abolition of the Audit Commission, are likely to make the situation worse. 'We need the Government to accept there is a problem in the UK rather than claiming it is only a problem overseas. 'This means having someone specifically in charge of tackling corruption; undertaking a national corruption risk assessment; drawing up a national action plan; and making sure that all areas of the public sector have in place the kind of anti-corruption procedures that the government expects of the private sector.' The worldwide survey shows that corruption continues to be a greater problem elsewhere in the world. One in four global respondents said they have paid a bribe when accessing public services and institutions in the last 12 months. Police are viewed as the most corrupt sector in 36 countries, and of those questioned, 53 per cent said that had been asked to pay a bribe to the police. Judiciary - 21 per cent . Registry and permit services - 11 per cent . Land services - 11 per cent . Police - 8 per cent . Education - 7 per cent . Tax revenue or customs - 4 per cent . Medical and health - 3 per cent . Utilities - 3 per cent . Around the world, people’s appraisal of their leaders’ efforts to stop corruption is worse than before the financial crisis began in 2008, when 31 per cent said their government’s efforts to fight corruption were effective. This year it fell to 22 per cent. The worldwide survey found that corruption has also worsened in most Arab countries since their 2011 revolutions, according to the public opinion poll. The Arab public's continued frustration with corruption may undermine governments' efforts to restore political stability, while hindering economic growth and foreign investment. Of four countries which experienced changes of government during the Arab Spring, a majority of respondents in three - Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen - feel the level of corruption has risen in the past two years, the survey showed. In Egypt, 64 per cent said corruption had worsened; in Tunisia, the proportion was 80 per cent. The exception was Libya, where only 46 per cent said the country had become more corrupt. Within Egypt, 78 per cent of respondents said the police were corrupt or extremely corrupt. The proportion was 65 per cent for the judiciary and 45 per cent for the military, one of the country's most respected institutions which ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi last week sparking a wave of protests. Christoph Wilcke, Middle East and North Africa director for Transparency International, said the police, judiciary and political parties in Arab countries needed to be reformed in order to gain the trust of the public. In the social and economic turmoil that has followed the Arab Spring, however, governments have had little time or energy to push such reforms. 'There is a contradiction between policy and rhetoric,' said Wilcke. The report says results show there is a 'crisis of trust' in Britain's political system .","Global Corruption Barometer 2013 found 65 per cent of Britons say corruption grown in past two years .

"Plans to allow gay marriage could be voted on and approved by MPs within weeks, it emerged last night. David Cameron and Nick Clegg have agreed to fast-track the controversial change in the law – bringing it before Parliament in the New Year. A Tory grassroots campaign of opposition to gay marriage has been gathering momentum in recent weeks and the move will be seen as an attempt by Mr Cameron to ‘lance the boil’. First civil partnership: Shannon Sickles (right) and Grainne Close, leave Belfast City Hall in December 2005. Now plans to allow gay marriages are set to go ahead as the PM looks to outpace a growing opposition movement . Previously, Number Ten had said only that same sex civil marriage would be introduced at some point before the next election in 2015 . Proposed legislation was not included in the last Queen’s Speech – which sets out the legislative programme for the year ahead – adding to the impression the new law is being hurried. The move will alarm the significant numbers of Conservative MPs, including some ministers, who have indicated that they are fundamentally opposed to the idea. But even if, as expected, dozens of Tory MPs refuse to back the plans, they look certain to be passed into law with the support of Labour and the Lib Dems. Labour leader Ed Miliband has suggested the Government should go even further than proposed, and allow gay marriages in church. With this ring: Cameron and Clegg have both spoken in support of gay marriage, but some MPs, including ministers, oppose the proposed change in the law . The proposal is also being fiercely opposed by some senior church figures – presenting the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, with a fresh dilemma after the Church’s unexpected rejection of women bishops. He has hinted at a softening of the Church’s stance on homosexual partnerships after promising to re-examine his own traditional views, but would face a fierce internal battle if he decided to back the Government. The Government has received 228,000 responses to its consultation on allowing gay civil marriage – more than any other issue under the Coalition. Civil partnerships, introduced in 2005, already give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples. But the Government wants them to be legally allowed to make marriage vows. Ministers have vowed to protect churches and other religious groups, insisting claims from opponents that they might be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies once civil weddings are allowed because of human rights laws are incorrect. But some faith groups, including Quakers and liberal Jews, have suggested they want to host services. One senior source said: ‘The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have agreed to get on with it. It was in danger of slipping beyond the general election. ‘David Cameron’s view of this is: “get it done and get it done quickly”. If we are going to do this it’s better to make it happen rather than have it hanging. If people want to commit to each other, he believes that’s a foundation of a stable society.’ The Prime Minister is to appease Tory critics of the plan to legalise gay marriage by offering a free vote on the issue as a ‘matter of conscience’. In a significant concession which will dismay the Liberal Democrats, Number Ten sources say the PM believes Conservative MPs should not be whipped to vote in favour. The Lib Dems are expected to instruct their MPs to back the legislation, and if Labour does the same it seems certain to become law. However, if significant numbers of Tories vote against, Mr Cameron may face the embarrassment of the plans making it into law thanks to the backing of opposition MPs. Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson has already indicated that he will break ranks by opposing gay marriage. Owen Paterson says he will oppose a change to the law that allows gay marriage . Choice: Churches and other places of worship will not be forced to hold same-sex weddings under the plans . The Prime Minister threw his weight behind the proposals in a speech to the 2011 Tory party conference. Defending the measures he said at the time: ‘Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other.’ Chancellor George Osborne said last week he was ‘proud’ to be part of a Government that planned to introduce a law to redefine marriage and claimed that a ‘clear majority’ of the public backed a change. However, a ComRes poll published this week suggested 62 per cent of voters and 68 per cent of Tories believe marriage should continue to be defined as a ‘life-long exclusive commitment between a man and a woman’. The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has underlined his support for the Church’s opposition to gay marriage. But he added: ‘I know I need to listen very attentively to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender communities, and examine my own thinking prayerfully and carefully.’","Cameron and Clegg aim to fast-track change in law after resistance grows .

"An electronic cigarette is believed to have sparked a fire at a flat, after it exploded while on charge. Fire chiefs investigating the blaze at the apartment in Barking, in East London, said they believe the device could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket. Four fire engines and 21 firefighters rescued a woman from the ground floor flat shortly after 3.30pm on Saturday, and she was taken to hospital by ambulance with smoke inhalation and shock. Scroll down for video . An electronic cigarette is believed to have sparked a fire at a flat, after it exploded while on charge. Fire chiefs investigating the blaze at the apartment in Barking, in East London, said they believe the device could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket . A large section of the ground floor flat was damaged by the fire. It comes after 65-year-old Jean Booth was left fighting for her life after she is believed to have used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in a Manchester hospital bed. In the early hours of Friday morning the pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, and is now fighting for her life after suffering severe burns to her scalp and face. Mrs Booth was only in the hospital for a routine hip operation and hospital chiefs are investigating how the incident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning. A spokesman for the hospital said last night: ‘We can confirm that an incident involving one patient in our care took place in the early hours of Friday.’ It comes just two weeks after an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face while it was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire. Laura Baty, 18, managed to quickly turn away from the flames  - but was left with a burnt dress and a singed arm. Charlie Pugsley, from the London Fire Brigade Fire Investigation Team, said: 'People assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes, and in most cases they are. 'The danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the risk of over-charging, which can potentially have explosive results. Last week, barmaid Laura Baty, was burnt when her e-cigarette exploded while it was charging . Around 1.3million people in the UK are thought to use e-cigarettes as consumers look for 'healthier' ways to continue smoking . 'We are calling on e-cig retailers to ensure they are selling the correct chargers for the cigarettes. 'As with all rechargeable electrical equipment, it's vitally important that people use the correct type of charger for their e-cigs to prevent fires which can be serious and could even result in death.' The London Fire Brigade said that people should never leave items like e-cigarettes on charge over night or when they're sleeping. They also highlighted safety concerns over people lighting cigarettes when using oxygen cylinders for lung conditions. It said people should never smoke or use naked flames near oxygen equipment as cylinders can explode when exposed to heat.","Fire chiefs investigating blaze at the apartment in Barking, in East London .

"al-Shabab leader Ahmed Godane was killed by a U.S. drone strike . The leader of the extremist Islamist group al-Shabab has been killed in an American drone strike in Somalia, the Pentagon confirmed Friday. The death of Ahmed Godane, who founded the Somalia-based group, is considered a significant blow for the al-Qaeda-affiliated organization, government officials said. 'Godane’s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,' said Rear Admiral John Kirby, the . Pentagon press secretary, in a statement. Godane's group has carried many bombings and suicide attacks in Somalia and elsewhere, including the Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 that killed at least 39 people. The leader publicly claimed responsibility for the Westgate attack, saying it was revenge for Kenyan and Western involvement in Somalia and noting its proximity to the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. He was in one of two vehicles hit by the U.S. military strikes Monday night, said Abu Mohammed, an al-Shabab commander and spokesman. Six other militants were also killed as the two vehicles headed toward the coastal town of Barawe. The U.S. strikes hit Godane after he left a meeting of the group's top leaders, said a senior Somali intelligence official. The Pentagon has confirmed the death of Ahmed Godane, who led the Somalia-based extremist Islamist group al-Shabaab, picture here in 2008 as fighters prepared to enter Mogadishu . The strikes on an encampment and a vehicle were conducted by special operations forces using manned and unmanned aircraft, according to Kirby. They struck using several hellfire missiles and precision-guided munitions. A witness in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake.' The attack took place 105 miles south of Mogadishu in a forested area where al-Shabab trains its fighters. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaeda. In 2012, the U.S. offered a reward of up to $7 million for information leading to his arrest. Godane's death could generate an upheaval in leadership that would break al-Shabab away from al-Qaeda and instead pledge allegiance to the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, according to two security experts. Godane has no obvious successor and there are reports of a rift within al-Shabab over which global terror group to align with, said Matt Bryden, the head of Sahan Research in Nairobi. A struggle for power seems likely, he said. 'Advanced splintering seems like a probable outcome,' terrorism analyst J.M. Berger said. 'If Shabab ends up exiting al-Qaeda, there will be global implications for that ... but it's hard to say right now which way that will go.' Godane, 37, was publicly named as leader of al-Shabab in December 2007 and has since exercised command responsibility for the group's operations across Somalia, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. An armed member of the militant group al-Shabab attends a rally in in 2012 in support of the merger of the Somali militant group al-Shabab with al-Qaeda . Last year he was said to be in a feud with foreign militants, including an American jihadi from Alabama, Omar Hammami, who accused al-Shabab leaders of enjoying extravagant lifestyles with taxes collected from Somali residents. Hammami was killed last September following months on the run after falling out with Godane. After Monday's airstrikes, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said. 'Everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.' The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years. A missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab, and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. attack that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert. Hundreds of newly trained al-Shabab fighters perform military exercises in 2011 just south of Mogadishu . The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members attempted on Sunday to free other extremists held there. Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011. Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 70 miles south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting. Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Pentagon press secretary Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said Godane's death is considered a 'major symbolic and operational loss' for al-Shabab .","Pentagon confirms that a Monday airstrike in Somalia has killed Ahmed Godane, the leader of the largest al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa .

"An American male doctor has contracted the Ebola virus while working at a hospital in Liberia, it was confirmed today as the CDC warned that the deadly disease was spiraling out of control. The unnamed doctor had been treating women in the obstetrics ward of a hospital in the Liberian capital, his charity Serving In Mission said on Tuesday. The group doesn't know how the doctor contracted Ebola since the ward is separate from the zone where Ebola patients are being treated. Scroll down for video . Health care workers wearing hazmat suits work at the Elwa hospital in Monrovia, Liberia on Saturday. A U.S. missionary charity confirmed today that another male doctor had contracted the disease and was now being cared for in isolation . The doctor did not work in an Ebola ward. The group did not specify how he contracted Ebola, but it can be spread through vaginal fluids. Dr Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who just returned from West Africa, said today that the world's worst Ebola outbreak is threatening the stability of affected and neighboring countries  and a 'massive' response is needed to bring it under control. Dr Frieden said: 'We're likely to see significant increases in cases. Already we have widespread transmission Liberia. In Sierra Leone, we're seeing strong signs that that will happen in the near future.' The group, Doctor Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres - MSF), also warned on Tuesday that the world is losing the battle against the disease and said treatment centers have been 'reduced to places where people go to die alone' as authorities race to contain the disease. Doctors Without Borders President Joanne Liu said her organization is completely overwhelmed by Ebola outbreak in four West African countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. She called on other countries to contribute civilian and military medical personnel familiar with biological disasters. More than 1,500 people have died across West Africa from Ebola. A statement from SIM today read: 'Upon onset of the symptoms, the doctor immediately isolated himself and has since been transferred to the ELWA Ebola isolation unit. 'The doctor is doing well and is in good spirits.' Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA, said today: 'My heart was deeply saddened, but my faith was not shaken, when I learned another of our missionary doctors contracted Ebola.

(AP Photo/Courtesy Jeremy Writebol) 'As a global mission, we are surrounding our missionary with prayer, as well as our Liberian SIM/ELWA colleagues, who continue fighting the Ebola epidemic in Liberia. We have gifted Liberian doctors, medical staff and support staff who are carrying on the fight.' The aid organization plans to hold a press conference at its Charlotte, North Carolina headquarters on Wednesday. Last month, two Americans Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol were released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia after recovering from the deadly virus. An American male doctor has contracted Ebola while working in the obstetrics unit at the ELWA hospital in Monrovia (pictured), his missionary organization confirmed today. He has been transferred to the Ebola isolation unit . The 33-year-old doctor contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, and was flown out of the country along with missionary Mrs Writebol, 59, to be treated. The two received an experimental drug known as ZMapp and recovered. The manufacturer says it has run out of supplies of the drug and it will take months to produce more. World Health Organization Director Margaret Chan warned that the outbreak would 'get worse before it will get better' and would require a larger global response. She thanked countries that have helped but said: 'We need more from you. And we also need those countries that have not come on board.' The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed more than 1,500 people in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Health workers spray the body of a patient suspected of dying from the Ebola virus with disinfectant, in a busy street in Monrovia, Liberia today. Another American doctor has contracted the disease, the charity Serving In Mission said on Tuesday . Earlier on Tuesday, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization warned that food in countries hit by Ebola is becoming more expensive and will become scarcer as farmers can't reach their fields. Authorities have cordoned off entire towns in an effort to halt the virus' spread. Surrounding countries have closed land borders, airlines have suspended flights to and from the affected countries and seaports are losing traffic, restricting food imports to the hardest-hit countries. Those countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - all rely on grain from abroad to feed their people, according to the U.N. FAO. For instance, the price of cassava root, a staple in many West African diets, has gone up 150 percent in one market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia. 'Even prior to the Ebola outbreak, households in some of the affected areas were spending up to 80 percent of their incomes on food,' said Vincent Martin, who is coordinating the food agency's response to the crisis. 'Now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach.' An estimated 1.3 million people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will soon need help feeding themselves, said the U.N. Chan and other officials at the U.N. forum criticized the border closures because they are preventing supplies from reaching people in desperate need. 'The three worst-hit countries are isolated,' Chan said. 'We cannot fly in our experts for help.' The situation will likely worsen because restrictions on movement are preventing laborers from getting to farms and the harvest of rice and corn is set to begin in just a few weeks, the FAO said. Ivory Coast decided Monday night to keep its borders with Guinea and Liberia closed but said it would open a humanitarian corridor to allow supplies in. A separate Ebola outbreak has hit a remote part of Congo, in Central Africa, the traditional home of the disease. So far, 53 cases consistent with Ebola have been identified there, of whom 31 have died, WHO said today.","The unnamed doctor had been treating women in the obstetrics ward of a Monrovia hospital, the charity Serving in Mission (SIM) said today .

Chief: Springfield Police Chief Stephen Moody said the preliminary investigation indicates that the woman shot the boys and took her own life . Scene: Authorities work the scene at the family's Springfield, Ohio home . The police chief in the city about an hour-and-a-half drive northeast of Cincinnati said no additional information on any possible motive was available. The two boys attended Warder Park/Wayne Elementary School, and the superintendent of the Springfield City School District said a team of psychologists and counselors were at the school on Wednesday to provide support to children, staff and parents. Superintendent David Estrop said Ayden Johnson was in the fourth grade and Daylan was in the second grade. 'They had many friends here,' said Estrop. Former neighbor Vicki Green told WHIO, ''This is a shock because you never see any kind of depression out of her. 'She's always smiling, always smiling. So I don't know. I have no idea why this would happen or why she would do anything like this.'","Rachel Johnson, 32, and Daylan Johnson, 7, were dead at their home when her estranged husband called police shortly before 8 a.m .

"A black mother from upstate New York is outraged after she says a white security guard at her special-needs son's new school played a racist prank on the boy. Brandiss Pearson, a mother of two from Syracuse, says the school staffer forced her 12-year-old son, Brandon, to pose for a photo in a way that made it look like the boy was being frisked. Brandon Pearson suffers from Down Syndrome and did not understand what was happening. Mistreated: Brandon Pearson, a 12-year-old with Down Syndrome, became the target of a racially charged prank pulled on him by a white security guard at his new school in upstate New York . Harsh lesson: Brandon arrived at Huntington K-8 School in Eastwood Tuesday and was met by a guard who made him stand against the wall with his hands up as if he was being frisked . Mrs Pearson's complaint has led Syracuse school officials to suspend the guard and open an inquiry into the disturbing incident. Pearson tells The Post-Standard of Syracuse the cruel, racially charged joke took place on Tuesday, the first day of school at Huntington K-8 School in Eastwood. According to the mother, she, her son Brandon, her husband and her father stopped in a school hallway to snap pictures in front of a mural before the beginning of class. That is when the unnamed security guard jumped in, turned Brandon to face the wall and lifted the boy's hands above his head on the wall, as if to be searched. Making light of it: When Brandiss Pearson (left), Brandon's mother, confronted the guard a day later, he dismissed the incident as a 'funny joke' She said the white man was laughing and said: 'Now take the picture. He's in the right position.' The unaware 12-year-old boy kept smiling, but his family were shocked and appalled at the guard's conduct. Racial divide: Mrs Pearson is a college-educated registered nurse who is working on her master's degree, but she says to some she is just a black woman . ‘I was shaking, just like fire-breathing mad,’ she told the paper. 'All he saw was a little black boy who needed to assume the position.' Mrs Pearson, a registered nurse at St Joseph’s Hospital Health Center, confronted the insolent guard about his antics when she ran into him in the hallway Wednesday. In response to her outrage, the man allegedly said he thought what he did was 'a funny joke.' The school guard was suspended Wednesday pending an investigation by the school district. Pearson has a bachelor’s degree in social work, she is currently working on her master’s degree, and also sits on the board of directors of a not-for-profit organization dedicated to revitalizing neighborhoods – but she says no matter her accomplishments, some people will always judge her and other Africans-Americans solely based on the color of their skin.","Incident involving Brandon Pearson, 12, took place Tuesday on the first day of fall semester at Huntington K-8 School in Eastwood, NY .

"Manchester United made a last-ditch bid for Ajax keeper Kenneth Vermeer. Ajax have agreed to sell Vermeer to their Eredivisie rivals Feyenoord for a reported fee of around £600,000. However, United tried to strike a deal at the end of last week for the 28-year-old but Vermeer said he had given his word to Feyenoord.

Louis van Gaal is a fan of Vermeer, who would provide cover for No 1 keeper David de Gea. It is understood United discussed the possibility of Anders Lindegaard, plus cash going to Feyenoord to help make the deal happen but Vermeer insisted on seeing the deal through. The 28-year-old was in Van Gaal's original squad for this summer's World Cup - but lost out on the final 23 due to Jasper Cillessen's form. Vermeer will sign a four-year deal at De Kuip and Ajax have moved quickly to replace Vermeer, snapping up 33-year-old Diederik Boer from FC Zwolle. Dutch international Vermeer admitted he jumped at the chance to join Feyenoord: 'It was a chance I had to grab with both hands. ‘I’m grateful to Ajax for 14 fantastic years but I had to put myself first. I want to be playing. And I can do that at Feyenoord,' he told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf on Monday.

"Manchester United’s lavish spending has not finished. In January another £50million has been allocated to sign more players in the wake of this summer’s £150m-plus spending spree which culminated in the signing of Radamel Falcao. Arturo Vidal, Mats Hummels and Sami Khedira remain top targets. Juan Mata will be sold in January to accommodate a second wave of rebuilding under manager Louis van Gaal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch transfer targets Vidal and Cleverley showing their quality . Next time: Manchester United are still on the hunt for Arturo Vidal (pictured) On the move: United will look to sell Juan Mata as Louis van Gaal continues his rebuilding process . Atletico Madrid, Roma and Juventus are in the market for the mercurial Spaniard, who was signed last January from Chelsea for £37m. United would accept a sale in the region of £20m. It is said don’t judge a book by its cover. But the weird front image of a new biography about Bobby Moore suggests otherwise. I can’t think of a worse, more unflattering picture I have ever seen of Bobby Moore who remains England’s only World Cup-winning captain and who was an inspiration to a generation. The image makes England’s original golden boy look more like an east London gangster of the Sixties than an icon of whom Pele said was the best, and most handsome, English footballer he had ever seen or played against. Maybe though that was the point: to depict Moore as an enigma rather than an icon of his time. Controversial: A new biography of Bobby Moore (left) features an unusual image of the football icon . Mon: On transfer deadline day Man Utd seal the signing of Radamel Falcao on a loan deal. A few days earlier United had no interest or involvement in signing the Colombian from Monaco. Tue: The transfer window is briefly re-opened to accommodate United offloading Tom Cleverley to Aston Villa. Seems like big club caveats to me. Wed: James Milner sums up England's dire 1-0 win over Norway with such a bad pass that would have made Geoff Thomas flinch. Thur: England boss Roy Hodgson gets angry with a press pack that have not only supported him but given him an easy ride. I feel he’s had a crack at two tournaments so should go especially now that he is blaming everyone but himself for England banality. Fri: A book is launched aimed at tarnishing the reputation of Bobby Moore. Libero . The formation of the Elite Development League which has taken the place of reserve football has been hailed as a way of improving the standard of young players coming through. It is essentially an Under 21 team but can accommodate three over age players usually if they are coming back from injury. Last Monday I went to watch Charlton host Leeds at their training ground in Eltham. I have to say I was underwhelmed. There is a lot of talk about how more sophisticated training techniques and tactics under coaches with an attache case full of badges and iPad presentations is improving the game. But there was little evidence of that. Sadly I came away with the distinct impression that players are being drilled like robots and constrained with the parameters of whatever the latest fad formation happens to be. 4-3-3 morphing into 4-5-1 has become popular over the last couple of seasons and both Charlton and Leeds played that way. They both set out to pass the ball out from the back bit more often than not when a route was closed down the ball went back then forward with a long hopeful ball. The main reason? Not one player on either side was prepared to dribble past an opponent or two thus opening up the game and allowing a passing cycle to continue and set up a chance. And while both teams had wide men none were wingers in the conventional sense. And it doesn’t matter how many times someone re-writes the coaching manual; wingers with pace, tricky and good crossing change games to break through two sets of back four who able to rely on physical and rugged defending in a match Leeds eventually won 1-0. The other problem is that the formations were too rigid. People make the mistake that 4-4-2, for the time being outdated, has been the root of the problem for English football especially at international level. It hasn’t per se. The problem has been that too many teams, especially England, play a far too rigid 4-4-2, with the flat lines. When the lines are blurred, when there is flexibility 4-4-2 can be as fluid as many formation. Coaches have got to start giving players freedom of expression and conscious of doing the right thing and staying in their zone but even at this level and at most clubs there is pressure to get results. So actually it seems there is more emphasis on success rather than development than there was in the days when the stepping stone to the first team was the reserves. Talent: Oscar Borg (above) has failed to secure a move to Manchester United . I am hearing . One of the country’s best young players, Oscar Borg, has failed to secure a move to Manchester United because of complications over a compensation fee from parent club West Ham, with whom he has been with since the age of 10. Left back Borg, 16, is also wanted by Aston Villa but as it stands the potential 'new Luke Shaw' is ready to commit himself to the Hammers for the next two years. But Borg has been contacted by the Turkish FA (his grandmother was born in Istanbul) about declaring his nation allegiance to them and has also has offers from Galatasaray and Beskitas. I am also hearing . It is now being reported that Cristiano Ronaldo is ready to re-join Manchester United next summer. Regular readers of this column will know Football Grapevine revealed last summer how close Ronaldo was to going back to United. After long discussions Ronaldo’s advisors decided it was best to get a new mega-deal with Madrid. Going back? Cristiano Ronaldo (pictured) could be ready to re-join Manchester United . But come next summer Ronaldo could be swayed by Man United’s new 'Galactico' recruiting policy. The key could be Falcao moving on from his loan with United to Madrid, whom he wanted to join last week. In that respect such a deal would happen if super agent Jorge Mendes wants it to happen. Mendes currently represents Ronaldo and Falcao. It is understood that Mendez and his company earned nearly 5m euros for the deal that took Falcao to United, the player having been touted about to PSG, Arsenal Manchester City and Liverpool.

Big money: The Real Madrid winger (right) could be swayed by Van Gaal's new 'Galactico' recruiting policy . Back Heel . In a fortnight it will be ten years since Brian Clough died. It was no secret that in latter years of his managerial career that an alcohol problem affected his life. Sometimes it made Clough hard work for those around him. But those of who grew up watching football in the Seventies will never forget the two wonderful football sides he nurtured organically at Derby and Nottingham Forest. A club like Forest winning two European Cups with a cavalier style of football? Icon: It's hard to disagree with those that say Brian Clough was the best manager England never had . You didn’t have to be a Forest fan to cheer them on and be enthralled by how they played. And how for so long Clough’s inspiration kept Forest punching way above their weight even when financial muscle started to control who could win titles and cups. Then of course there were Clough’s outspoken tirades. I still feel had Clough not Don Revie succeeded Sir Alf Ramsey, Clough would have got the best out of mercurial players such as Alan Hudson, Tony Currie, or Stan Bowles, and a bit later Glenn Hoddle and Laurie Cunningham, and maybe won (or at least qualified for!) the 1978 or 1982 World Cup. It’s often said that Brian Clough was the best manager England never had. It’s hard to disagree. RIP MR Clough. BTW . Isn’t it funny how so many people are now lamenting the fact that the England team doesn’t have the option of a 'young' Frank Lampard and Steve Gerrard playing in tandem. Three Lions: Are England missing Steven Gerrard (left) and Frank Lampard (right)? Y Factor . If you are wondering why England’s match against Switzerland is on a Monday night it's because it is part of UEFA’s money orientated plan to spread Euro qualifiers over the weekend to pocket more TV revenue. But as it stands more and more people are losing the appetite to watch England and I can’t see a Monday night slot helping. Let's see. Why not in future just give the captain’s armband to the player who has the most caps at the start of the game? As it stands that is Rooney. But from now on the position should be a symbol of seniority. Not some sort of sinecure. I-Bet . England are 2-1 to beat Switzerland. I think it will be a 1-1 draw which is 5-1. Coral offer 33-1 for Gary Cahill to be top scorer.","Manchester United target January spending spree .

"Two British terrorists who fled the UK  to fight in Syria ordered books Islam For Dummies, The Koran For Dummies and Arabic For Dummies from Amazon ahead of their trip. Mohammed Nahin Ahmed also told his childhood friend Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22, 'I cannot tell anyone I'm going to jihad. Lol. I'll get arrested' before they left Birmingham and joined rebels in Aleppo, a court heard today. After eight months fighting in Syria they were arrested on their return to Heathrow Airport in January after their relatives tipped off counter-terrorism detectives. Sarwar had left a note for his mother arguing going 'to do jihad' in Syria was 'doing the best deed in Allah's eyes' and said the Taliban and Al Qaeda 'are not bad', so she went to the police. After returning to Britain they told officers they had been doing humanitarian work but a camera containing 'thousands' of images, including some of them posing with guns on the front line, was found in their luggage. Scroll down for video . Convicted: Best friends Nahin Ahmed (left) and Yusuf Zubair Sarwar, both 22,  fled Britain for Syria to 'do jihad'. They took pictures of themselves with guns, which were found by police in their luggage . Reference books: The pair bought Islam for Dummies, The Koran for dummies and Arabic for Dummies from Amazon ahead of their Syria trip, where they spent eight months fighting in Aleppo . Traces of 'military-grade explosives', including TNT and nitro-glycerine were on the men's clothes and trainers. Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later. It read: 'Make sure you don't get any authority involved its (sic) a kuffar (infidel) government. 'I will try to intercede for you but don't rely on my intercession for if Allah allows me to intercede make sure to perfect yourselfs (sic). 'Make sure to keep me in your dua (prayers) as I am doing the best deed in Allahs eyes in'shaa' Allah. 'I will be going to Sumya (Syria) Ash sham which I will help the oppressed and fight Allahs enemies there. 'Taliban, Al Quada (sic) etc are not bad the West portrays them as bad. 'The group I will be joining is Kataib Al Muhajireen which is part of Al Nusra. In 'shaa' Allah . 'WE WOULD STAND UP AND NEVER WOULD LET ALLAHS RELIGION BE DEMONISED' Sarwar's family reported him missing to police in May last year after they found a hand-written letter from him in which said he had left to join a terrorist group called Kataib al Muhajireen (KaM) - later renamed Kateeba al-Kawthar - 'to do jihad'. Officers also found social media and email conversations between the pair and Islamic extremists. Over Skype, Ahmed talked to a Swedish national who was fighting with KaM. He told the fighter: 'I come to join KaM,' to which the Swede replies: 'Inshallah (God willing)'. Ahmed later asked a Danish Islamic extremist: 'Would the brothers in Yemen accept me?' At  Woolwich Crown Court in south-east London today they each admitted one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism acts contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act. The families of both men had put pressure on them to return to the UK once they discovered where they were. Days earlier he had told his family he was travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University, where he was a part-time computer science student. It prompted a search of the men's homes, which revealed an online conversation between Ahmed and a Swedish national fighting with the KaM, during which Ahmed said he wanted to join the terrorist group. West Midlands Police said the men showed the mind-set to go and join the jihad in Syria, before carrying out research, buying equipment, and finally travelling their via Turkey. Ahmed, who was born in Bangladesh, moved to Britain as a child, while Sarwar, who is of Pakistani descent, was born in Britain. Family: Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later . Guilty: Ahmed, left, and Sarwar, right, each admitted one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism acts contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act at Woolwich Crown Court . In court: Nahin Ahmed (pictured left and right before he went to Syria) pleaded guilty to preparing for acts of terrorism today . An initial search of their homes revealed images of Islamic propaganda on both of their computers, including images of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) flags, shaheed (martyr) literature and several texts which are linked to the jihadi mindset. Judge Topolski QC said he would not pass sentence until a Court of Appeal decision about a similar case had been heard later this summer. The judge earlier told the court that he was willing to offer a reduction in sentence if the defendants were to plead guilty. He described the case as a 'grave one'. He told the court that together they 'carefully planned a journey from the UK to Turkey and on to Syria to join Islamist rebels fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad'. Ruse: The pair said they were travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University (pictured at Heathrow) but they then went on to Syria . Ahmed passes through a gate at the airport. At home he and his friend had propaganda on both of their computers, including images of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) flags and shaheed (martyr) literature . Assistant chief constable Marcus Beale, senior officer for counter-terrorism in the West Midlands, said: 'These young men went to considerable lengths to hide their plans from their families, who have since suffered a great deal of distress. 'It's not easy to know everything that a family member is doing all of the time, but we encourage parents to hold a healthy interest and curiosity into who their children mix with and who seems to hold a strong influence over them. 'Crucially, if families are worried that a member is thinking of travelling to Syria, it is very important that they tell the authorities as soon as possible. 'The police and other agencies can offer support to help safeguard those who are vulnerable to radicalisers and the sooner we can intervene, the better chance we have of preventing young people from becoming embroiled in criminal behaviour.'","Mohammed Nahin Ahmed and Yusuf Zubair Sarwar admit terror offences .

"Police are on red alert at the prospect of drones flying overhead during Sunday’s Manchester derby. Serbia’s Euro 2016 qualifier against bitter rivals Albania had to be abandoned earlier this month after a mass brawl following the landing of a drone carrying a provocative political message landed on the pitch. But while that is the most high-profile case of its kind this season, there has been an instance closer to home. A man was arrested in a supermarket adjacent to the Etihad after flying a drone over the stadium as City thumped Tottenham 4-1 just a fortnight ago. Manchester City host local rivals United in what is expected to be a fiery derby on Sunday . Police are on red alert to make sure no drone is flown over the pitch at the Etihad Stadium . The most high profile 'drone case' this season was during the Euro 2016 qualifier between Serbia and Albania . A Serbian player dragged down the Kosovo flag and the match had to be abandoned after a mass brawl . A man was arrested after flying this drone near the Etihad Stadium during a Manchester City game recently . The sudden use of the flying devices around sporting arenas presents a fresh problem for Greater Manchester Police, who will also have a helicopter on hand this weekend. GMP are aware of the potentially growing problem and will arrest anyone found to be flying a device and instructed to land it immediately. In the region of 400 officers are set to be deployed to ensure Manchester United’s trip to City passes without incident.

Superintendent Craig Thompson, who will be in charge of operations on Sunday, said: ‘We are well used to policing high-profile fixtures like this. I would urge fans to come to the game, enjoy the day and arrive well in time for the kick-off because of the building work going on around the ground. ‘They will see plenty of police officers on the ground who are there to ensure their safety.

'Their plans for a life together . include her learning to tattoo while she also gets the full-body ink . that she’s always dreamed of and of course a family,' said a friend of . Toumaniantz. He added: 'I know that there are . people who are terrified that Lesya has made a rash decision that she’ll . regret horribly, but sometimes the best decisions are the ones you make . in an instant with your heart rather than the ones long-debated in your . mind. Friends of Lesya have flooded her with messages praising the artwork and how beautiful she looks. 'You must be so happy that you can wear that tattoo. Enjoy it. It looks great,' wrote Ralf Bieler. 'Sooo beautiful. even the style of the name fits your face well,' wrote another. Mr Toumaniantz's handiwork hit the headlines in 2009 after he tattooed 56 stars across an 18-year-old's face who then lied and accused him of inking her when she was asleep. Mr Toumaniantz fled Belgium after the scandal caused by Kimberley  Vlaeminckin in 2009. She lied to her family and reporters and claimed that she had asked Mr Toumaniantz for just three stars near her eye. Freshly . inked: Kimberley Vlaeminck at the age of 18 in 2009, shortly after she . asked tattooist Rouslan Toumaniantz to cover her face in black stars . As her regret sank in, she claimed he kept adding more and more after she fell asleep at the Tattoo Box in Coutrai, Belgium. She promised to sue the tattooist for . the cost of removal, claiming a language barrier meant the Flemish . speaker had misunderstood when she gave instructions in French and . English. Miss Vlaeminck said she avoided going out in public because the tattoos made her feel like a 'freak'. But a week later she confessed to a . Dutch TV station that she had been awake throughout and had indeed asked . for the full 56 marks. She said she lied because she was afraid of how her father would react. Even still, Mr Toumaniantz - whose . own face is covered in tattoos and piercings - offered to pay half the . cost of laser removal, saying he did not want to leave a customer . unsatisfied. He later retracted this offer, leaving Miss Vlaeminck to cover the cost alone. Though laser treatment has been shown . to be a effective way of removing ink, even the most advanced . technology would leave white marks across her face.","Ruslan Toumaniantz signed his name across his girlfriend's face less than 24 hours after he met her .

"The European adventure ended for Hull before it had even begun as the Tigers crashed out on away goals having beaten Lokeren 2-1 on the night. Meanwhile, Tottenham progressed comfortably with a 3-0 victory over Cypriot outfit AEL Limassol to go through 5-1 on aggregate and will be included in Friday's draw in Monaco along with Premier League rivals Everton. Click here to read the match report from Tottenham's win over AEL Limassol as Spurs progressed to the Europa League group stage. Click here to read the match report from Hull's victory over Lokeren as the Tigers were eliminated on away goals. Host commentator . Tottenham progress 5-1 on aggregate following a 3-0 home victory. Mauricio Pochettino's men gave a professional performance and progress to the next stage of the competition. Hull's European adventure over before it really began as the Tigers crash out on away goals. A valiant effort from last season's FA C up finalists - winners on the night but out on away goals. 85 mins: 18-year-old defender Veljkovic comes on for the final few minutes of the game. The winger hit a terrific strike towards goal which looked destined for the roof of the net but Romero in the Limassol goal did well to tip over. Plain sailing for Tottenham. 77 mins: Sandro has played well this evening and is replaced by Holtby. Leading 2-1, as it stands Hull will go OUT of the Europa League on aggregate as Lokeren have that vital away goal. 64 mins: Andros Townsend scores from the spot! 60 mins: Paulinho with another good touch - the Brazilian has been tidy tonight - to take the ball away from the onrushing goalkeeper on the edge of the area before laying it off to Aaron Lennon who dinks the ball towards goal but it is cleared on the line by Carlitos. Unlucky, would have been a great goal. 48mins: Spurs have made a hell of a start to this second half, continual pressure on the AEL goal, and it's rewarded when Paulinho scores. The Brazilian burst into the box down the right-hand channel, and slotted home beautifully across the keeper. It's all kicking off here! Hull are right back in this, as Robbie Brady bags his second of the night, sending the keeper the wrong way. An Elmohamady cross strikes a Lokeren hand, and the referee points to the spot. Big call and a big chance for Hull. 49 mins: Disaster for Hull City at the start of the second half. A Lokeren corner isn't cleared properly, and it falls to Jordan Remacle. The Lokeren man smashes it into the top corner past McGregor. City now need AT LEAST two goals to go through. One would see them go out on away goals. Everyone's favourite charitable craze of the moment got a run out at half time here. Tottenham's mascot Chirpy gets a bucket of ice cold water poured over his head. That'll be an uncomfortable second half. Incidentlly he nominated Children in Need's Pudsey. These mascots stick together don't they! Craig Hope at the KC Stadium: You get the feeling the next goal will decide this one. Lokeren were by far the better side for the remainder of the opening half following Brady’s early breakthrough. They’re bright on the ball, the man in possession always has an option and, in Vanaken and Dutra, they boast a front pair not afraid to take aim. ‘Delicately poised’ is what any half-decent commentator would be trotting out now, were it on TV, that is. So, Tottenham and Hull both lead at half-time. Spurs look to be on their way to qualifying for the Europa League for the fourth successive season European compeition in succession while Hull are level with Lokeren on aggregate. Should the Tigers concede a nasty away goal, Steve Bruce's men will need to win by two goals on the night. 45 mins: Paulinho does excellently to dispossess Limassol in their own half before sliding in Harry Kane who places the ball into the corner of the net. Cool finish by the young striker. Tottenham have been pressng high all half and finally forced Limassol into a mistake. Spurs now lead 3-1 on aggregate. Seven minutes of injury time to be played following Fegrouche's nasty injury while at Hull, the referee blows for half-time. 41 mins: Limassol's Brazilian is booked for a foul on Tottenham wideman Andros Townsend. The referee pointed to three different areas of the pitch - looks like that's a warning for a number of fouls by Bebe. Craig Hope from the KC Stadium: 6 mins - Steve Bruce said Hull could do with an early goal and that’s exactly what they’ve got. Lokeren goalkeeper Jerry Verhulst was their hero seven days ago but he hardly covered himself in glory with the hesitancy which allowed Robbie Brady to steal in for an easy opener. This tie is still level, remember, and Hull will need at least one more before they’re planning trips to the San Siro. 11 mins: Kane fires the ball straight down the middle but Romero, called into action immediately after coming on to replace Fegrouche, saves with his leg. What a start! It remains 2-1 to Tottenham on aggregate. 10 mins: Long delay here at the Lane while Fegrouche gets treatment following the decision to award a penalty. Surprised the keeper only gets a yellow. Felt it was a red. Fegrouche will play no further part as the stopper is stretchered off the field. 3 mins: Kyle Naughton is hauled down by the AEL Limassol goalkeeper and a penalty is awarded to Spurs. However, Kerim Fegrouche took a whack to the face and is down receiving treatment. So, the next ninety minutes or so will decide whether Hull and Tottenham are in the hat for tomorrow's draw. As mentioned previously, Everton, who finished fifth last term, have gone straight into the group stage without having to qualify. Those teams, like the Toffees, who already have their places in the group stage assured include: Last season's winners Sevilla, Fiorentina, Wolfsburg, Dynamo Kiev and Lille. Celtic and Rafael Benitez's Napoli will also compete in this season's tournament following their elimination from the Champions League via the play-offs this week. As it's Hull's maiden voyage into Europe, supporters won't be too fussy about who the Tigers line up against should they progress this evening. Meanwhile for Spurs, a European jaunt is often an annual occurence and Mauricio Pochettino's men will be fancied to go quite far in this year's competition. McGregor, Figueroa, Rosenior, Chester, Davies, Elmohamady, Meyler, Livermore, Brady, Aluko, Sagbo. Lloris, Naughton, Vlad, Kaboul, Davies, Dembele, Sandro, Paulinho, Lennon, Townsend, Kane. Can Tottenham and Hull join Premier League rivals Everton in Friday's draw group stage draw? The Tigers will be desperate to progress in their first-ever foray into Europe while Spurs will be confident of maintaining their lead against Cypriots AEL Limassol.","Tottenham progress to group stage with 5-1 aggregate victory .

"One of the world’s most dangerous fanatics will be freed from jail within days – with a judge’s permission to do the school run. Notorious hate preacher Abu Qatada is considered such a threat that he will be permitted to roam the streets for only two hours a day. But Mr Justice Mitting ruled that he must be allowed to walk his youngest child to school under his bail conditions. It raises the prospect of parents at . the school gates bumping into the radical cleric, who was known as Osama . Bin Laden’s ambassador in Europe. Preacher of hate Abu Qatada (left) can be released on bail after more than six years in prison, Mr Justice Mitting (right) ruled . Last night critics described the bail . ruling as a ‘disgrace’. Former home secretary David Blunkett warned . that Qatada was ‘extraordinarily dangerous and we don’t want him on our . streets’. Qatada has spent much of the past . decade in a high-security prison and has cost taxpayers more than . £1million in benefits, prison costs and legal fees. Ministers are attempting to deport . him to Jordan to stand trial on terror charges, but three weeks ago they . were blocked by European human rights judges. Yesterday Government lawyers argued . the fanatic should remain in prison while they continue efforts to . remove him and insisted he presented an ‘unusually significant risk to . the UK’. But the Special Immigration Appeals . Commission ruled he should be released on bail, to resume his life with . his wife and five children. Jordanian authorities released this picture of . Qatada (left) in 2008 under his name of Omar abu Omar. Right, the Daily . Mail's front page from January 27, 2005 . Qatada is expected to walk free from Long Lartin high-security prison in Worcestershire on Monday. Under his bail conditions, he will be . forced to wear an electronic tag and comply with a 22-hour curfew . within a defined zone around his home address, thought to be in Wembley, . north London. Meetings with anyone other than his . immediate family will have to be approved by security officials. If he . breaks the conditions, he could be back behind bars within hours. Officials do not consider it likely . that Qatada will take part in the planning of a terrorist attack or . other operational activities. However, it is feared he could use the . internet to give justification for attacks overseas or in Britain. Officials want to prevent this . happening by banning him from having a mobile phone or access to the . internet, where his sermons could be uploaded on to extremist websites. Qatada is currently being held at the Category A Long Lartin prison, but after a judge's ruling will walk free within days . In evidence it was claimed that Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) does not accept that Qatada's detention was unlawful . Qatada’s strict curfew also reflects . the fact that he has, in the past, been accused of terrorist . fundraising. He was found to have £170,000 cash in his possession, . including £805 in an envelope marked ‘For the mujahedin in Chechnya’. The bail ruling came as the respected . Royal United Services Institute think tank warned that ‘sources . estimate that at least 200 would-be suicide bombers are actively . planning attacks in the UK’. In his ruling, Mr Justice Mitting . said Qatada’s bail conditions could be relaxed within three months . unless Britain makes ‘demonstrable progress’ in negotiations to send the . 52-year-old home. Last month, judges in Strasbourg . ruled that Qatada could not be deported in case evidence obtained from . torture was used against him at trial in Jordan. British diplomats are . trying to extract assurances that this will not happen. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said the Government was bound by the rule of law 'as much as anybody else'. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'The Government is obviously very concerned about this case and very much wishes to see Abu Qatada deported to Jordan and, when he is in Jordan, tried fairly if the Jordanian authorities wish to put him on trial. 'He cannot be deported unless the assurances which are required following the judgment in the European Court of Human Rights can be secured.' A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Qatada . should remain in detention, our view has not changed. That is the . argument we made to the court today and we disagree with its decision. ‘This is a dangerous man who we . believe poses a real threat to our security and who has not changed in . his views or attitude to the UK.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons . Home Affairs Select Committee, said most people would be ‘astonished by . this decision considering Abu Qatada is wanted on terrorism charges in . eight countries’. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . said: ‘The Home Secretary needs to explain urgently what action she is . taking on the national security implications of this judgment. ‘Abu Qatada should face terror . charges in Jordan, and the Home Secretary needs to urgently accelerate . discussions to make that possible.’ Robin Simcox of the Henry Jackson . Society, a foreign policy think tank, said: ‘Today’s decision is a . disgrace. But, if Abu Qatada is to be released, the Government should . place him under a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure, the . successor to control orders. He is far too important an Al Qaeda . ideologue not to be under surveillance.’ Qatada, also known as Omar Othman, featured in hate sermons found on videos in the flat of a September 11 bomber. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has overruled every court in Britain in ruling that Abu Qatada can stay in Britain . Abu Qatada has variously been described as 'Al Qaeda's spiritual leader in Europe', 'Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe', 'the most significant extremist preacher in the UK' and 'a truly dangerous individual'. The Jordanian father of five, whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman, claimed asylum when he arrived in Britain in September 1993 on a forged passport. He was allowed to stay and preach his extremism, and was accused of calling on British Muslims to martyr themselves in a holy war on 'oppression'. A 1995 'fatwa' he issued justified the killing of converts from Islam, their wives and children in Algeria. In October 1999 a sermon in London called for the killing of Jews and praised attacks on Americans. And the same year he was convicted in his absence of planning terror attacks in Jordan. When he was arrested in February 2001 he was found in possession of £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the mujahedin in Chechnya'. Videos of his sermons were found in the Hamburg flat used by some of the 9/11 hijackers. As fears of a domestic terror threat grew after those attacks, he thwarted every attempt by the Government to detain and deport him; he went on the run to avoid being detained without trial or charged under new anti-terror laws. After 10 months on the run he was discovered in a council house in south London, arrested and taken to Belmarsh high-security prison. Qatada was released in March 2005 and put under a 22-hour home curfew designed to limit contact with other extremists. He was rearrested months later but ministers were thwarted in their efforts to deport him because of fears he would be tortured if he returned to Jordan. As the court battle continued, Qatada was released in June 2008 to live in his £800,000 council house in west London before being rearrested that November over fears he would breach his bail conditions. In 2008, the Court of Appeal ruled in Qatada's favour, saying there were reasonable grounds for believing he would be denied a fair trial in Jordan because evidence against him could have been extracted through torture. But in a landmark judgment in February 2009, five Law Lords unanimously backed the Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the basis of assurances from foreign governments. Lord Phillips, now president of the Supreme Court, went further, saying that evidence of torture in another country 'does not require the UK to retain in this country, to the detriment of national security, a terrorist suspect'. Qatada has always denied claims that he is al Qaeda's European ambassador, and insists he never met Osama bin Laden.","Hate preacher is expected to walk free on Monday .

"A man had to be rescued by coastguards after he followed his beloved dog down a steep cliff face in a bid to save him. The Staffordshire bull terrier was being walked off a lead and had been distracted chasing birds when it plunged 60ft down a cliff on Porth Island in Newquay in Cornwall. His owner scrambled down the cliff face in a desperate attempt to rescue the family pet but then discovered it was dead and became stuck himself, unable to get back to the top and stranded on a ridge surrounded by swelling waters. Scroll down for video . A man had to be rescued by the RNLI after he followed his dog down a steep cliff face in Newquay in a bid to save the animal after it fell . He then called the coastguard for help and a lifeboat crew were called out to save the man. The dog, which is understood to be a family pet, had died from falling down the cliffs, which are around 20ft high in some places. Rescuers managed to get to the man as he stood on a ledge at the base of the cliff face, with water swelling around him. A spokeswoman for the RNLI said he would have been trapped there overnight by the incoming tides had he not been rescued at about 4pm on Tuesday. She said: 'The Staffie had been chasing birds on the cliff top and had sadly forgotten that birds have wings. 'Its owner had seen the unplanned leap and scrambled down the cliffs after his dog. 'Unfortunately he was unable to do anything further for his pet. Dogs should be on leads when they are being walked on cliff tops. People do need to think first before they follow their pets down cliff faces. We know it's human nature, but it can be very dangerous.' The coastguard and an RNLI crew were dispatched to rescue the man, who had become trapped on a ledge on Porth Island in Newquay . The rescue follows another by the team last week at nearby Whipsiderry beach when three walkers became trapped by incoming tides . The man was unhurt after the ordeal but told rescuers he would now have to tell his wife and children that their family dog had died. Newquay RNLI said recent mild weather and spring tides had made for a busy week for crews, who have been called out five times since getting a new boat on November 5. They said this was particularly busy as they had been called 46 times throughout the whole year. The man and his dog were piled into the boat and taken to the shore in Newquay by rescuers after they were called on Tuesday afternoon . Rescuers and walkers gathered to watch the dramatic rescue of the man and his dog, but sadly the animal was pronounced dead . The spokeswoman added: 'This time of year we are normally quiet. We've had good weather which sees people come out to cliffs and beaches and we've also got spring tides. People do get caught in these.' A spokeman from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'At 3.30pm on 25 November, the Newquay Coastguard Rescue Team and the Newquay Inshore Lifeboat were sent to Porth Island, Newquay after reports that a member of the public had become trapped at the bottom of a gully after trying to recover his dog. The lifeboat landed a crewman and extracted the man by sea where he was taken back to Newquay. Sadly the gentleman's dog had died. The man was reunited with his coat and belongings, recovered by the Newquay team, which were down the gully.' Last week rescuers were dispatched to rescue three walkers who had become trapped by the incoming tides at Whipsiderry beach, near Newquay. It is thought the walkers had become trapped on a rock after losing track of time and failed to notice the waters swelling around them. Attempts to rescue the trio using a harness had to be abandoned after the cliff face started to crumble, and the RNLI managed to rescue them from the water just minutes before the rock they had been standing on was completely submerged. Jennifer Grant also had to be rescued by crews in Porth Island two days ago after she fell into the sea while surfing after she had got married. She had managed to scramble onto rocks at Porth Island but was unable to get to the shore by herself.","Man had been walking with his dog along cliff top in Porth Island in Newquay when the animal fell 60ft from cliff .

"Children's minister Tim Loughton is this week set to explain details of a National Action Plan to protect children against sexual exploitation . The Government has finally answered the call to protect vulnerable children in danger of sexual exploitation. It will, this week, publish a . National Action Plan designed to make the issue a 'top . priority' for every local authority. The news comes amid a devastating report into the failures of police and care agencies to protect teenage girls who have been groomed, raped and sold by male gangs, most of whom are Asian. The mother of one teenager from . Leeds, who attempted suicide after a gang rape, said her daughter was . the victim of a 'broken system.' 'Everyone failed her,' she told The Times. 'There was no sharing of information. 'They . (police) had the names and knew where they (abusers) worked yet the men . who did this have never once been arrested or spoken to by the police.' West Yorkshire Police vowed to look again at the case to see if 'there is evidence that can help bring evil men to book'. Growing worry: CCTV footage shows now jailed gang members Mohammed Romaan Liaqat and Abid Mohammed Saddique meeting girls as they cruise the streets of Derby in a BMW . Jailed: Saddique, left, and Liaqat, right, were leaders of the paedophile ring in Derby and committed a catalogue of offences against vulnerable young girls . Children's charity Barnardos has been . calling on the Government to take action on child exploitation since . January with its Cut Them Free campaign. Other caregivers have also suggested . that political sensitivities are to blame for a near paralysis of the . systems designed to keep children safe. Like most little girls, Josie lived for horses. She had an exemplary school record with 100 per cent attendance rate. But at 13, the teen from Keighley, West Yorkshire, was given a laptop and quickly became addicted to Facebook. Her father was then warned his daughter was spending a lot of time with older Asian men. One even told the father he would 'slit his throat' when he answered the phone to him. From there it got worse. Josie started disappearing overnight and began drinking. Yet, when her father locked his daughter in her room to protect her, it was he who got into trouble with the police for false imprisonment. He told The Times he has since collected every scrap of evidence to prove his daughter is being sexually exploited by gangs. 'The police kept saying that they're waiting until Josie realises it's wrong,' he said. 'Is that really the best they can do? When the father of 14-year-old Charlotte looked at his daughter's Facebook profile, he discovered 'loads of male, Asian friends.' Concerned, he started to restrict his daughter's activities. The teen from Keighley, West Yorkshire, then went to live with her mother. He tracked down all the names and addresses of her friends he believed were involved and passed them on to police. Meanwhile her school was reporting Charlotte had begun arriving looking 'dirty and extremely thin'. She was going missing for days at a time, according to agency notes. By October last year she 'admitted she has slept with different Asian males.' The police told Charlotte's father they hoped to take action against the men. That was 17 months ago and he is still waiting. 'There's no will to deal with this issue in Keighley' he said. 'What chance have these kids got if that's the attitude of the police?' There is a culture 'which assumes that . once a girl gets to 14 she's beyond hope of intervention - it's too . late,' a source told The Times. Police and care agencies often say that they cannot take action against suspects without the victim's co-operation. However, a 2008 protocol established by the force and West Yorkshire's five local authorities states: 'Adults involved in child sexual exploitation... should be treated as child sex abusers and subjected to the full rigour of the criminal law.' Nicola is the only case in six who was groomed by a gang of white men. The abuse began when she was 12 after a visit to Leeds from her family home in Bradford. Nicola had thought they were 'really nice people' but by 13 she was doing drugs - 'everything but heroin'. She was raped twice. The first time she was 'drugged up to the eyeballs' and remembers being dragged into a bedroom and gang raped. Afterwards her mother took Nicola to the police station, only to be told that 'we don't deal with that here'. In desperation Nicola's mother took her daughter to New Zealand and away from the gang. She let her return four months later. Nicola did return to her old haunts but discovered it wasn't really what she wanted. 'I used to think it was so exciting,' she told The Times. 'But after New Zealand, it was like seeing them with another pair of eyes.' She hasn't been back since. Children's minister, Tim Loughton, . suggested two weeks ago that the plan will call on councils to act with a 'much greater . urgency' to identify victims of sexual exploitation while taking 'robust . action against those who commit these appalling crimes.' As well as the gang rape case of the girl in Leeds, five new cases have been highlighted by The Times' investigation. No one has been prosecuted for sex exploitation in any of them. Only one of the girls in the six cases had been in care. One was groomed by white students, but in all the other cases, the perpetrators were Asian, mostly of Pakistani origin. This pattern of abuse at the hands of male Asian gangs in the West Yorkshire area has been highlighted before, but never formally acknowledged. In January the Asian ringleaders of a gang in Derby, . who brought a ‘reign of terror’ to a city’s streets, targeting and . grooming young girls for horrific sexual abuse, were jailed. Abid Saddique and Mohammed Liaqat . were told they would serve a minimum of 11 years and eight years . respectively before they could be considered for release. A DfE spokesman refused to reveal the contents of the National Action Plan but said: 'We are publishing an action plan this week and that will draw on work around the country to prevent sexual exploitation, identify those at risk and support victims. 'It will address the challenge of securing prosecutions and the need for robust action against perpetrators. 'Child sexual exploitation is an appalling form of child abuse and we are determined to do everything possible to stamp it out.

"Federal senator Cory Bernardi has renewed his call for a nationwide ban of the burqa after he spotted women wearing them at the homes of those arrested in Thursday's terror raids. The Liberal senator from South Australia tweeted that  'some burqa wearers' spotted inside houses which police raided represented the 'shroud of oppression'. The women were pictured in the raids to foil a possible terror plots planned in Sydney and Brisbane. Homes  were searched  by NSW Police and Australian Federal Police and 15 people were arrested with one charged. The South Australian Senator has linked Thursday's  terror plot raids with people who wear burqas . Senator Bernardi tweeted that some burqa wearers were seen inside houses searched during Thursday's raids . Campbell Newman said people should not be using the raids to vilify racial groups . Following the raids Senator Bernardi tweeted to his 13,000 followers that Australia should ban the burqa completely after linking the head dress with suspects of terrorism. 'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust(ralia),' Senator Bernardi tweeted on Thursday. Mr Bernardi told Daily Mail Australia that his tweet was in line with previous comments he had made about 'security and identification issues associated with facial coverings.' 'This has led to some changes in state laws in Australia,' he said. 'I stand by my previous concerns.' The senator wrote an opinion piece published in the Sydney Morning Herald in 2010 in which he wrote 'In my mind, the burqa has no place in Australian society.' 'I would go as far as to say it is un-Australian.' To me, the burqa represents the repressive domination of men over women, which has no place in our society and compromises some of the most important aspects of human communication,' he wrote. Cory Bernardi has been condemned by The Liberals, Labor and The Greens over his tweet . Both sides of the political divide, including The Greens, have criticised the senator for his most recent tweet. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said  acts of terrorism should not be associated with what people wear or their religious affiliation. 'This isn't about people's religion. It's not about what people wear. It's about potential terror attacks here in Australia,' he told reporters in the Northern Territory. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Senator Bernardi's comments were stupid. 'The last thing we need at a time like this are ignorant comments from government MPs that feed prejudice,' Mr Shorten said. Senator Bernardi has been a frequent critic of the burqa, saying it raises security and identification concerns. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said she would rather Australia ban Mr Bernardi. 'Ban the burqa? Really? If only we could #BanTheBernardi,' she tweeted. In 2010 senator Bernardi called for a ban on the burqa saying the clothing was 'unAustralian' Queensland Premier Campbell Newman warned against racial vilification following the raids. He said Australians should not use Thursday's operation as an opportunity to disrupt community relationships. 'If anybody uses what's happened to vilify a group, race or religion they are playing into the hands of these would-be-terrorists.' 'That is, helping the terrorist organisations to achieve what they want to achieve.' Mr Shorten said he had 'no time for Senator Bernardi's stupid comments'. 'The last thing we need at a time like this are ignorant comments from government MPs that feed prejudice,' he said. 'We must refuse to submit to this type of fear and intolerance.' Senator Bernardi hit back at Mr Shorten, saying the Labor leader was in no position to offer criticism. 'Given Bill Shorten was part of a government that wanted to facilitate sharia-compliant finance laws in our country, his lack of understanding on this matter speaks for itself,' he told Fairfax Media.","South Australian Senator Cory Bernadi tweeted that the burqa should be banned .

"Australian senator Cory Bernardi, who said legalising gay marriage would spark calls to legalise bestiality, is attending a conference of young Conservatives in Britain . The Conservatives today sought to distance themselves from an Australian MP linked gay marriage to bestiality as he prepares to attend a Conservative conference in the UK this weekend. Liberal senator Cory Bernardi is flying into London after claiming legalising gay marriage could trigger demands for bestiality and polygamy to be legalised as well. He is due to attend the European Young Conservative Freedom Summit in Oxford this weekend, according to The Australian newspaper. Labour said his appearance at the event was 'astonishing' and accused the Tories of paying 'lip service' to equality. But Conservative HQ has moved to play down his links to the party. A party spokesman said: 'We haven't organised this event and are not in control of who attends. 'We strongly condemn Mr Bernardi's comments which don't reflect David Cameron's or the Conservative party's viewpoint in any way.' Mr Bernardi was forced to resign as Bernardi has resigned as parliamentary secretary to opposition leader Tony Abbott are sparking a furore with his comments during a debate on same sex marriage. Mr Bernardi said if same sex couples were allowed to tie the knot in Australian, it would lead to more extreme demands. ‘The next step ... is having three people that love each other be able to enter into a permanent union endorsed by society, or four people,’ he said. ‘There are even some creepy people out there, who say that it's OK to have consensual sexual relations between humans and animals. Will that be a future step?’ Mr Abbott said Senator Bernardi had made ‘ill-disciplined remarks’ and then repeated them on the radio. He had made ‘one mistake too many’. The European Young Conservative Freedom Summit is being held at St Hugh's College, Oxford from Friday to Sunday. ConservativeFuture, the youth wing of the British Conservative party for under-30s, has urged young Tories to attend, saying: 'This is your chance to join us at the leading conference for young conservatives of its kind in Europe.' Mr Bernardi’s arrival in the UK comes at a sensitive time when the British Conservative party is split over plans to legalise gay marriage. Former Labour Cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw said: 'It's astonishing that a youth wing of the Conservative Party could invite someone who has compared same sex marriage to bestiality to speak at one of their events. 'David Cameron should stop this appearance and make it clear that views like this have no place in his party. 'It's clear that while the Tories may pay lip-service to equality, too many of their supporters are prepared to endorse outrageous and offensive views like this.' David Cameron was applauded by the Tory party conference last year when he urged them to back the change in the law. ‘I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative,’ he said. ‘I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.’ However, a number of senior Tory backbenchers have voiced opposition to the plans.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he finds the burqa confronting and wishes people didn't wear it, but that it is their right to do so in Australia because it's a free country. But Mr Abbott has voiced support for ensuring the all-encompassing Islamic dress is not worn inside Parliament House because it is a high-security building where people's faces should not be hidden. At a press conference in Canberra this morning, Mr Abbott - who stopped short of calling for the garb to be banned - repeated previous remarks that he found the full body dress 'confronting'. His comments follow calls from a series of Liberal backbenchers and conservative Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie  for the dress to be banned from Federal Parliament. Mr Abbott's own chief of staff, Peta Credlin, has reportedly expressed support for the ban. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has weighed into the burqa debate. In 2010, Mr Abbott told reporters he found the Islamic dress 'confronting. Peta Credlin, Tony Abbott's chief of staff and top adviser, supports a burqa ban in parliament house, Fairfax reports . 'Frankly, I wish it was not worn,' Mr Abbott said on Wednesday. 'But we are a free country, we are a free society and it is not the business of government to tell people what they should and shouldn’t wear.' Mr Abbott said Parliament House was currently a 'secure' building and said he did not want to make a 'mountain over a molehill'. 'It is perfectly appropriate that in certain circumstances people be required to show their face. There can't be one rule for one form of attire and a different rule for another form of attire. It has to be the same rules for everyone, and if the rules require you to show your face, well, you show your face,' he said. Mr Abbott said that 'to the best of our knowledge' no one had ever tried to enter Parliament House wearing a burqa. According to Fairfax Media, Ms Credlin expressed sympathy to the idea the burqa should be banned in comments to Liberal backbencher George Christensen last week.Mr Christensen is a vocal supporter of the ban. The report said Ms Credlin warned Mr Christensen against fuelling further tension in the community and urged him to instead clarify that the headdress presents security concerns when approaching the controversial debate. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the ban was a 'dreadful proposition'.'It divides our society,' Mr Shorten said. Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi has written to Parliament's presiding officers, requesting the full-body dress be banned. Senator Bernardi previously told Sky News: 'Parliament House should be open to the people but we need to know the identity of the people who are coming in here'. While Mr Bernardi supports a complete public ban of the religious headdress, Fairfax Media reports Ms Credlin only agrees with a ban being enforced in Parliament House because other face-covering garb, such as helmets, are already banned. Ms Credlin revealed her sentiments to Liberal National George Christensen (pictured) last week . Mr Bernardi renewed his call for a nationwide ban of the burqa due to security and identification issues earlier this month following the terror raids in Sydney. 'Note burqa wearers in some of the houses raided this morning? This shroud of oppression and flag of fundamentalism is not right in Aust(ralia),' he tweeted to his 13,000 followers. Conservative Australian Senator Jacqui Lambie echoed his sentiments, telling media that she opposes the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women. She also posted a controversial meme to her Facebook page featuring a woman wearing a burqa and holding a gun, which said 'for security reasons it's now time to ban the burqa'. The news comes only a week after Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi renewed his call for a nationwide ban of the burqa due to security and identification issues .","Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he 'wishes' the burqa wasn't worn .

"The Liberian man who brought Ebola to America came to the U.S. to marry his fiance, it emerged on Friday. Thomas Eric Duncan was to wed Louise Troh in a ceremony which would have paved the way to him staying in the U.S. permanently - and escape his native Liberia. Mark Wingfield, associate pastor at Wilshire Baptist Church, told MailOnline: 'Louise told our senior pastor on Thursday that Mr Duncan had come to the US to marry her and start a new life. 'Those are her words to describe the situation'. Scroll down for video . Hopes: Thomas Eric Duncan had intended to marry his girlfriend Louise Troh during his first trip to America . Shattered dreams: Duncan had wanted to 'start a new life in America' said his girlfriend's local church on Friday. Tragically he is now fighting for his life and his partner's family are quarantined in their home (above) Until that point he had not even heard of Duncan and there were not plans he was aware of for a wedding, he added. The revelation may explain why Duncan, who was exposed to Ebola days before he was due to travel to the U.S. when he helped a sick woman who later died, lied on a form to get out of Liberia. Duncan replied 'no' when he filled out a form asking if he had been exposed to the Ebola virus before he boarded the plane in Liberia. He now faces prosecution there. Until three years ago he had been living in a refugee camp in Ghana because he was unable to return home due to a civil war in Liberia - and on his arrival just about scraped a living tinkering with cars and bartering. Duncan arrived in the U.S. on September 20 and is believed to have come on a tourist visa in what was his first trip to America. Up to 100 people including five schoolchildren were exposed to him while he was infected - health authorities in Texas now say that 10 people are of particular concern. An email about his marriage was also sent to the congregation of the Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, where Troh is a member, by senior pastor George Mason. It read: 'Louise and other members of her extended family are in isolation now because of their contact with Mr Duncan. 'You can imagine how frightening this must be for all of them, mixed with the sadness of Mr Duncan's diagnosis.' Duncan, 42, and Troh, 54, appear to have a relationship of some king going back many years and have at least one child together. Duncan had good reason to escape his life in Libera - it is ground zero for the worst outbreak of Ebola in history which has so far claimed more than 3,000 lives. Duncan has also suffered personal tragedy and one of his brothers recently died too. According to the New York Times he spent the last year working as a driver for a cargo company until he suddenly quit on September 4 after a visit from his sister. Troh, a caregiver, arrived in the US in the late 1990s from Liberia and settled in Massachusetts where her immediate family still live. She got a social security number and has dozens of immediate and extended family members in America stretching from Maryland to Minnesota. She married her ex-husband Joe Joe Jallah though they have now divorced. Troh has been living in the Ivy Apartments, a run-down complex of homes in the suburb of North Dallas. Mr Wingfield said that Troh joined the church a year ago and that she was a 'loved' member of the congregation. He said that she and some of her family were regular attendees at an adult Bible studies class on Sunday mornings, where she had made lots of friends. Mr Wingfield described Troh as the 'matriarch' of a large number of her family and said that she was 'at the centre of that network'. He said: 'If anything happened to her it would be devastating to that entire family'. Better life: Duncan had good reason to escape his life in Libera - it is ground zero for the worst outbreak of Ebola in history which has so far claimed more than 3,000 lives. Pictured above is his former home in Monrovia . Trail: Mercy Kennedy, nine, cries after her mother was taken to an Ebola ward on Wednesday. She lives on the same street as Duncan did. He had been in contact with another woman who died of the virus . The area is home to many immigrants and dozens of languages are spoken in the area. Residents told MailOnline that gangs were a problem and that people moved in and out every few months with little sense of community. Troh appears to have been a regular visit to Liberia and on her Facebook page 'checked in' as being into Monrovia as recently as August 11. According to visapro.com it is possible to marry on a tourist visa but there are a number of issues. If somebody in such a position gets married within 30 days of arriving in the US it is frowned upon by the authorities. However even if Duncan's application would have been denied the marriage would have bought him months in the US whilst it was processed. Visapro says: 'Once you have married and filed for adjustment of status you will not be able to leave the US until you apply for and receive advance parole or your green card. 'If you leave the country before receiving one of these two documents, you will not be allowed to re-enter the US.'","Local Baptist church in Dallas, Texas, said on Friday Thomas Duncan came to the U.S. to marry and 'start a new life in America'

"Nasa could soon be using rockets powered by poo, it has been claimed. Researchers have been working with Nasa to develop a system to repurpose human waste on a moonbase. They say the system would produce enough fuel for the return trip to Earth. Scroll down for video . Florida Researchers have been working with Nasa to develop a system to repurpose human waste on a moonbase and turn it into fuel. The Florida team created an anaerobic digester process, which kills pathogens from human waste, and produces biogas - a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide by breaking down organic matter in waste. They found the process could produce 290 liters of methane per crew per day. The digestion process also would produce about 200 gallons of non-potable water annually from all the waste. Through electrolysis, the water can then be split into hydrogen and oxygen, and the astronauts can breathe the oxygen as a back-up system. Currently human waste is stored and sent back to Earth on cargo vehicles than burn up in the atmosphere . In 2006, NASA began making plans to build an inhabited facility on the moon's surface between 2019 and 2024. As part of NASA's moon-base goal, the agency wanted to reduce the weight of spacecraft leaving Earth. Historically, waste generated during spaceflight would not be used further. NASA stores it in containers until it's loaded into space cargo vehicles that burn as they pass back through the Earth's atmosphere. For future long-term missions, though, it would be impractical to bring all the stored waste back to Earth. Dumping it on the moon's surface is not an option, so the space agency entered into an agreement with UF to develop test ideas. 'We were trying to find out how much methane can be produced from uneaten food, food packaging and human waste,' said Pratap Pullammanappallil, a UF associate professor of agricultural and biological engineering. 'The idea was to see whether we could make enough fuel to launch rockets and not carry all the fuel and its weight from Earth for the return journey. 'Methane can be used to fuel the rockets. 'Enough methane can be produced to come back from the moon.' Nasa started by supplying the UF scientists with a packaged form of chemically produced human waste that also included simulated food waste, towels, wash cloths, clothing and packaging materials, Pullammanappallil said. He and Dhoble, now a doctoral student at the University of Illinois, ran laboratory tests to find out how much methane could be produced from the waste and how quickly. Researchers say the system could create enough fuel to bring Astronauts back from the moon . They found the process could produce 290 liters of methane per crew per day, all produced in a week, Pullammanappallil said. Their results led to the creation of an anaerobic digester process, which kills pathogens from human waste, and produces biogas -- a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide by breaking down organic matter in waste. In earth-bound applications, that fuel could be used for heating, electricity generation or transportation. The digestion process also would produce about 200 gallons of non-potable water annually from all the waste. That is water held within the organic matter, which is released as organic matter decomposes. Through electrolysis, the water can then be split into hydrogen and oxygen, and the astronauts can breathe oxygen as a back-up system. The exhaled carbon dioxide and hydrogen can be converted to methane and water in the process, he said. The process could also turn up on Earth, said'It could be used on campus or around town, or anywhere, to convert waste into fuel,' Pullammanappallil said. The study was published last month in the journal Advances in Space Research.","Scheme collects methane from human waste and turns in into fuel .

"A man was rescued last night after he was adrift for six hours on a paddle board off the coast of Cornwall. Joe Holtaway went for paddle off the Cornish south coast near Marazion when he was dragged out to sea. His family became concerned when he failed to return and rescuers were scrambled at 8pm. A team of RNLI volunteers, pictured, recovered Mr Holtaway who was unable to make his way back to shore . The RNLI and coastguard teams from Penzance, St Ives, Penlee and Porthleven raced to the scene along with a helicopter and searched for several hours. Three hours later, a lifeboat found Mr Holtaway floating behind St Michael's Mount, approximately one mile off shore. He was taken to hospital in Treliske for a check up where he was treated for suspected hypothermia. Speaking after his ordeal, Mr Holtaway said: 'It was a beautiful evening in Marazion, I paddled out on my board in the sunset and drifted further/got colder than I could get myself back to shore from. 'Six hours later the lifeboat took me onboard, and brought me in. 'Much love, respect and appreciation for everyone who was on the beach, the emergency services, my friends and family (all are family.x)' Joe Holtaway, pictured, paddled out to sea at sundown yesterday in Marazion when he got lost . Martin Leslie, the coastguard's area commander, said: 'The guy has been recovered. 'He was found by the lifeboat at the back of St Michael's Mount. 'He's being transported to Treliske hospital by land ambulance. 'He was wearing a wetsuit and had a paddleboard or something similar. 'If you're going to go out you must let people know where you're going to go, what time you're going to be back. 'Stay within your limitations. 'Today it's calm, it's flat, it's good conditions - but it is very cold, even standing here on the shore side.' An eyewitness who saw the rescue said: 'The helicopter has been scanning up and down the shore. 'There's been the coastguard and a rib flying around with lots of people on the beach with torches and also off St Michael's Mount with high power torches. 'It's been quite a large scale search we've seen tonight. 'We're standing here nicely wrapped up - but to be out on the water on a night like this is going to be pretty challenging. 'The level at which the helicopter has been flying across Mount's Bay has been incredible - probably no more than 20 feet above the water in pitch black conditions. 'These people are taking a lot of risks to try to find whoever has gone missing.' Mr Holtaway's brother Ben has thanked the lifeboat crew for plucking him to safety, describing them as 'superstars.' He wrote: 'Fantastic Penlee, can't say thank you enough, I have one lucky brother.' Mr Holtaway was pulled out to sea behind St Michael's Mount, pictured, where he was found by the RNLI . Mr Holtaway was found suffering from hypothermia when he was recovered just south of St Michael's Mount . A spokesman for Penlee lifeboat added: 'After nearly three hours of searching for a missing person Penlee Lifeboat found the young man a mile south of Marazion Beach around 11pm. 'The person, who had been in the sea for five hours was taken to Newlyn harbour by the Lifeboat then conveyed to hospital by ambulance. 'The young man is suffering from hypothermia but should be ok, a great result this evening, it really was a fantastic effort by everyone involved.' Mr Holtaway left his clothes and bicycle on the beach at Marazion around 5pm when he entered teh worker. Patch Harvey, coxswain at Penlee RNLI, described how crews spent three hours searching for Mr Holtaway in darkness. He said: 'Thankfully this story has a happy ending but it could have been very different. 'Joe paddled out on his paddleboard at about 5pm, just before darkness fell, but quickly became very cold, disorientated and confused. 'Despite the calm conditions, it is not advisable to enter the sea at this time of year, at such a late hour, without any means of communication with the shore. 'It is very easy to lose your bearings when darkness falls and you are freezing cold. 'On this occasion there was a happy ending but Joe was very lucky that the crew found him safe . A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said coastguards received a call reporting Mr Holtaway's disappearance at 8pm. 'The Penlee all-weather and inshore lifeboats, the Penzance, Porthleven and St Ives Coastguard Rescue Teams and the Culdrose Royal Navy Search and Rescue Helicopter all assisted in the search,' the spokesman said. 'A lifeboat later found the person approximately one mile offshore.'

"Acknowledging California's parched new reality, the city of San Diego has embraced a once-toxic idea: turning sewer water into drinking water. The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to advance a $2.5billion plan to recycle wastewater, the latest example of how California cities are looking for new supplies amid a severe drought. Each of the nine council members effusively praised the effort before the vote as a way to make San Diego less dependent on imported water and insulated from drought. 'We're at the end of the pipeline,' said Councilman Scott Sherman. 'We have a real problem getting water down here.' Recycling: The San Diego City Council voted unanimously to support a $2.5billion plan to recycle waste water to drinking water. The Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant, pictured, will decontaminate the water . Such recycling, called toilet-to-tap by critics, has suffered an image problem that industry insiders call 'the yuck factor.' San Diego, a city of 1.4million people that imports 85 per cent of its water from the Colorado River and Northern California, has slowly warmed to the idea. A 2012 survey by the San Diego County Water Authority showed that nearly three of four residents favored turning wastewater into drinking water, a major shift from one of four in a 2005 survey. 'The drought puts a finer point on why this is so necessary,' Mayor Kevin Faulconer said. 'Droughts are unfortunately a way of life in California, so we have to be prepared. This helps us to control our own destiny.' The plan calls to initially recycle 15million gallons by 2023 and 83million gallons a day by 2035, about one-third of the city's water supply. It enjoys broad support from business groups and environmental advocates. Parched: California is currently experiencing a period of severe drought. Evidence of the drought is seen above in the pictures of Lake Mead over a seven year span. Declining: Lake Mead is fed by the Colorado River, where the city of San Diego gets 50 per cent of its water . The Orange County Water District, which serves 2.4million people in California, plans to boost production of recycled water next year from 70million gallons to 100million gallons a day. It has reused wastewater for drinking since 2008 through treatment that includes sending water through ground basins. The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which serves 1.8million people in the San Francisco Bay area, decided in September to pursue construction of facilities that it says could lead to turning wastewater into drinking water for Sunnyvale and western Santa Clara County. Still, it remains rare to turn sewage to drinking water. The WateReuse Association, a group of agencies behind the efforts, counts only 10 projects nationwide, including El Paso, Texas, and Fairfax County, Virginia. Two Texas cities, Wichita Falls and Big Spring, started projects within the past two years. On Tuesday, the San Diego council ratified an agreement between the mayor and four environmental groups — San Diego Coastkeeper, Surfrider Foundation, Coastal Environmental Rights Foundation and San Diego Audubon Society — to ask the Environmental Protection Agency for another reprieve and to commit to the recycled wastewater plan. Unlike Orange County, San Diego plans to send water through a reservoir because it lacks groundwater basins. Richard Nagel, general manger of the West Basin Municipal Water District, which serves about 900,000 people in Southern California, said he has fielded inquiries from about a half-dozen agencies lately who are interested in recycling wastewater. His agency began in 1995 in response to an earlier drought. 'It's the investment you make for a locally produced, drought-proof water supply,' he said. Desperate measures: The above map shows how San Diego supplies residents water, drawing from reservoirs in northern California, the Colorado River and some local sources .","The City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday to pass a plan to spend $2.5billion on recycling waste water to drinking water .
The entire state of California is experiencing severe drought, but water supplies are especially short at the end of the pipeline in San Diego ."
"Rory McIlroy admitted a week of distractions had taken their toll after he suffered a nightmare start to The Barclays. The world number one came into the first leg of the four-tournament FedEx Cup play-offs as a hot favourite following victories at the Open Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA Championship, but starting on the back nine at the Ridgewood Country Club, he made the turn in four-over 40 before picking up a shot on the way back. His round of 74 left him nine shots off the lead held by Bo Van Pelt, who made an eagle on the 17th for a round of 65 that put him one shot clear of a group of eight on five under. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods take on  Ice Bucket Challenge . Nightmare: Rory McIlroy endured a tough start at The Barclays in his bid to make it four wins in a row . Back to drawing board: McIIroy is hopeful of getting back into contention at The Barclays . Paul Casey was among that number along with Cameron Tringale, Hunter Mahan, Charles Howell, Brendan De Jonge, Ben Martin and Brendan Todd. McIlroy was within an inch or so of a birdie on the first hole he played, the 10th, but his form then deserted him as he registered a double-bogey on the 12th, and followed that with bogeys on the 13th and 18th to leave him last of all players on the course at the time. He pulled a shot back on the par-four fifth but gave it back on the eighth, missing a four-foot putt to bogey. He recovered to birdie the ninth, his final hole of the day, finishing with a three-over round of 74 and at least off the very bottom of the leaderboard. McIlroy, who appeared on late-night US television with Tiger Woods earlier this week, days after parading his Claret Jug at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground last weekend, said he needed to regain his focus to get back into contention. 'I'm not quite on my game, I've not quite put in the time over the last few days for obvious reasons,' he said on Sky Sports. 'I'm going to go and have some lunch and then work on the range, work on a few things, and try to catch up on some practice I've missed out on over the last week and try to be ready for tomorrow.' Looking forward to the FedEx Cup, he added: 'For me, not being here for the weekend isn't an option. I've got to work hard today on the range and get out there and get off to a fast start tomorrow, and get myself back into this tournament.' Justin Rose carded 68, dropping shots on the 12th and 17th to miss out on a share of the lead. 'My game feels close,' he said on Sky Sports. 'I played really well at the PGA as well but my putter let me down so I was really pleased today that there were some four, five putts that I got and that kept my momentum going. It was something I struggled with at the PGA. 'My ball striking was there or thereabouts. I didn't hit that many fairways today so I was happy to get round.' Frustrated: McIlroy reacts to hitting into a sand trap on the 13th hole at The Barclays in Paramus . Van Pelt, having just birdied the 16th, chipped in from 47 foot on the 17th for an eagle which catapulted him clear of the chasing pack. Having arrived here ranked down at 104th in the FedEx rankings, Van Pelt said he was able to play with a freedom not usually afforded him at this time of year. 'I had very expectations but I was happy with how I was playing,' he said. 'I've come to this tournament before where I was in the top 30 and I felt like I had something to lose, but anything here is house money for me.' The top 125 players in the standings have qualified for The Barclays, with the field being trimmed to 100 for the Deutsche Bank Championship, 70 for the BMW Championship and then 30 for the Tour Championship with the man finishing top of the standings claiming a 10million US dollars bonus. McIlroy led the FedEx Cup standings coming into the tournament followed by Jimmy Walker, Watson, Matt Kuchar and Jim Furyk.","McIIroy is looking for a fourth straight win following success at the Open Championship, WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA Championship .

"A rape victim is carrying her dorm-room mattress with her everywhere she goes to protest the inaction by school administrators in bringing her attacker to justice. Columbia University senior Emma Sulkhowitz is carrying the mattress as part of her senior thesis art project, and will only stop once when her rapist is no longer enrolled in school. Sulkhowitz points out that the project - which she is calling 'Mattress Performance' or 'Carry That Weight' - could last as little as one day, or continue until she graduates this spring. The mattress represents her specific rape, since she was attacked in her dorm room. The weight of carrying it around also visualizes how she continues to be haunted by the experience. Scroll down for video . Making a statement: Columbia University senior Emma Sulhowitz was raped on campus nearly two years ago, and is now spreading awareness of the issue of sexual assault by performing an art project in which she carries her mattress with her every where she goes . 'A mattress is the perfect size for me to just be able to carry it enough that I could continue with my day but also heavy enough that I have to continually struggle with it,' she told the Columbia Daily Spectator. Sulkhowitz plans to spread information about the project via word of mouth, and says one of the rules is that she can't ask for help with carrying the mattress. However, anyone can ask to help her and she thinks this will be one way of spreading the project to her college community. Last May, Sulkhowitz reported the scarring experiencing to police, a year and a half after the incident happened. She says the incident was so damaging, she initially decided not to go to authorities because she was afraid and ashamed of what had happened. 'When it first happened, I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I didn’t even tell my parents. ... I didn’t even want to talk to my best friend,' she said. The student newspaper has identified the student accused of the rape, but since no charges have been filed, MailOnline is not naming the man. Weighed down: Sulkhowitz will continues to carry the mattress until her rapist is no longer on campus. She says this might take only one day or last the rest of the year . However, he is one of a handful of students who have been accused of sexually assaulting multiple classmates on campus, in lists graffitied on bathroom stalls and distributed in pamphlets. Sulkhowitz recounted the incident to the student newspaper, saying it came as a surprise since she had consensual sex with the attacker twice before. Scarred: Sulkhowitz initially didn't come forward to police because she was scared and ashamed of the attack . On August 27, 2012, the two were hanging out in her dorm room when things took a violent turn. According to the police report, Sulkhowitz said her attacker suddenly hit her across the face then 'choked her, and pushed her knees onto her chest and leaned on her knees to keep them up.' He went on to grab her 'wrists and penetrated her anally'. Sulkhowitz told her attacker to stop, but he continued raping her until he 'suddenly stopped without ejaculating'. While she didn't report the incident to police at first, she and two other victims of the same man reported him to school officials the following spring. Administrators held a hearing on the matter but eventually found the student in question 'not responsible'. The experience of reporting the rape to police was just as terrible an experience for Sulkhowitz as well. Officers showed up to take her statement at her dorm room on May 14, and she says they were dismissive and questioning of her account - especially the fact that she had slept with her attacker before and couldn't recall minute details of the incident. She was then asked to go to the police station and fill out more paperwork, with one document describing the attack as 'domestic violence' even though she was never in a relationship with her rapist. While she was speaking with the Special Victims Unit, the officer who took her statement continued to talk with her friends at the station, saying he didn't buy her story. Police have passed the case along to the District Attorney, and while Sulkhowitz believes it may be too late to bring up charges against her attacker, she still hopes for justice.","Emma Sulkhowitz was raped nearly two years ago, when she was a sophomore at Columbia University .

"Altering what we eat to conform to dietary guidelines would actually increase emissions of greenhouse gases, a study has found. The researchers found that diet-related greenhouse gas emissions would increase by 12 per cent if dietary recommendations are followed. And while the scientists aren't suggesting we should ignore dietary guidelines, they are suggesting that such guidelines should be made with more environmental considerations in mind. The study is not a recommendation to eat less healthily, however, but rather to highlight the gap between food production and living sustainably. This pie chart from the researchers shows how greenhouse gas emissions of certain foods compare to the USDA dietary recommendations . Dr Martin Heller and Dr Gregory Keoleian of the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems looked at the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of around 100 foods. They also looked at the potential effects of shifting Americans to a diet recommended by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). They found that if Americans adopted the recommendations in USDA's 'Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010,' but consumed the same number of calories diet-related greenhouse gas emissions would increase by 12 per cent. Current estimates put the average American's daily calories intake at more than 3,300 calories a day. • Increase vegetable and fruit intake. • Eat a variety of vegetables, especially dark-green and red and orange vegetables, and beans and peas. • Consume at least half of all grains as whole grains. Increase whole-grain intake by replacing refined grains with whole grains. • Increase intake of fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, such as milk, yogurt, cheese, or fortified soy beverages. • Choose a variety of protein foods, which include seafood, lean meat and poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products, and unsalted nuts and seeds. • Increase the amount and variety of seafood consumed by choosing seafood in place of some meat and poultry. • Replace protein foods that are higher in solid fats with choices that are lower in solid fats and calories and/or are sources of oils. • Use oils to replace solid fats where possible. • Choose foods that provide more potassium, dietary fiber, calcium, and vitamin D, which are nutrients of concern in American diets. These foods include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and milk and milk products. If Americans reduced their daily caloric intake to the recommended level of about 2,000 calories while shifting to a healthier diet, meanwhile, greenhouse gas emissions would decrease by only 1 per cent according to Dr Heller and Dr Keoleian. 'The take-home message is that health and environmental agendas are not aligned in the current dietary recommendations,' Dr Heller said. The paper's findings are especially relevant now because the USDA Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is for the first time considering food sustainability within the context of dietary recommendations, he said. In its 2010 dietary guidelines, the USDA recommends that Americans eat more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products and seafood. They should consume less salt, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, added sugar and refined grains. The guidelines don't explicitly state that Americans should eat less meat. However, an appendix to the report lists the recommended average daily intake amounts of various foods, including meat. The paper titled 'Greenhouse gas emission estimates of US dietary choices and food loss' was published in the Journal of Industrial Ecology. The recommended amount of meat is significantly less than current consumption levels, which Dr Heller and Dr Keoleian estimated using the USDA's Loss Adjusted Food Availability dataset as a proxy for per capita food consumption in the United States. Researchers at the University of Michigan say following dietary guidelines (stock image shown) could increase greenhouse gas emissions. They say certain guidelines do not have environmental impacts in mind. In the study they found the USDA 2010 Dietary Guidelines would increase emissions by as much as 12 per cent . While a drop in meat consumption would help cut diet-related greenhouse gas emissions, increased use of dairy products - and to a lesser extent seafood, fruits and vegetables - would have the opposite effect, increasing diet-related emissions, according to the researchers. In the US in 2010, food production was responsible for about eight per cent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. In general, animal-based foods are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions per pound than plant-based foods. The production of both beef cattle and dairy cows is tied to especially high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. For starters, cows don't efficiently convert plant-based feed into muscle or milk, so they must eat lots of feed. Growing that feed often involves the use of fertilisers and other substances manufactured through energy-intensive processes. And then there's also the fuel used by farm equipment. In addition, cows burp lots of methane, and their manure also releases this potent greenhouse gas. In general, animal-based foods are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions per pound than plant-based foods. The production of both beef cattle and dairy cows (stock image shown) is tied to especially high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, say the researchers . Greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing the US diet are dominated by the meats category, according to Dr Heller and Dr Keoleian. While beef accounts for only four per cent by weight of the food available, it contributes 36 per cent of the associated greenhouse gases, they conclude. The researchers found that a switch to diets that don't contain animal products would lead to the biggest reductions in this country's diet-related greenhouse emissions. But Dr Heller said he's not arguing that everyone should go vegan, and he believes that animals need to be part of a sustainable agricultural system. However, reduced consumption would have both health and environmental benefits. In their paper, Dr Heller and Dr Keoleian also looked at wasted food and how it contributes to US greenhouse gas emissions. They concluded that annual emissions tied to uneaten food are equivalent to adding 33 million passenger vehicles to the nation's roads.","Researchers at the University of Michigan say following dietary guidelines could increase greenhouse gas emissions .

"A community of Orthodox Jews have been expelled from their homes in a bitter conflict with hostile villagers. Just a few months after fleeing from Canada amid allegations of child abuse, members of the Lev Tahor community were forced to leave San Juan La Laguna in Guatemala yesterday. The village Elder's Council voted to kick them out because the group refused to greet or have physical contact with the community, according to a member of the council.

Lev Tahor is a radical strain of Hassidic Judaism that believes television and computers are bad and must be avoided. The group rejects the state of Israel because it views the Jews as a people who must remain in exile. Verbal abuse, threats to cut off power and eject them by force were the last straw for the Jews, some of whom have been there for six years. A leader of the Lev Tahor sect in San Juan, Rabbi Uriel Goldman, said that most Guatemalans were friendly towards the Jews but an aggressive minority chose to push the group out. 'I don't understand why they don't want us, we're doing nothing bad here. They also warned us they would remove us from the village by force.' He said that the council in San Juan issued an ultimatum to Lev Tahor, saying water and electricity would be cut off if they did not leave. Around 230 members of the Jewish community were living in San Juan La Laguna, Guatemala .

'This is not typical in the world I live in. Even in Iran, Jews are not expelled,' he said. Miguel Vasquez Cholotio, a member of the elders' council, said the villagers decided to expel the group because they refused to greet or have physical contact with the community. 'We felt intimidated by them in the streets. We thought they wanted to change our religion and customs,' he said. Antonio Ixtamer, who lives in the community, said that several members of the group had upset residents because of their 'arrogant' attitude. He said they would go into stores and pay whatever they wanted for the products rather than the marked price and that they bothered tourists. 'On one occasion there was a tourist taking pictures of a hill and the Jews thought he was taking photos of them and they clashed,' Ixtamer said. Lev Tahor  means 'Pure Heart' in Hebrew and the group practices an austere form of Judaism and believes that technological trappings such as television and computers  must be avoided. It was founded by Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans in Israel and flourished after he moved the group to the U.S. in the early 1990s.

"Spinach could be the latest weight-loss aid curbing food cravings by nearly 95 per cent, new research has found. Scientists at Lund University in Sweden discovered a spinach extract containing green leaf membranes called thylakoids boost weight loss by almost 43 per cent. They based their findings on analysis of 38 overweight women. Food cravings are also known as hedonic hunger - the urges people have for unhealthy foods including sweet treats and fast food. Scientists at Lund University in Sweden have found a spinach extract containing green leaf membranes called thylakoids curbed food cravings by 95 per cent and boost weight loss by 43 per cent . The study shows that taking thylakoids reinforces the body's production of satiety hormones and suppresses hedonic hunger, which leads to better appetite control, healthier eating habits and increased weight loss. Professor Charlotte Erlanson-Albertsson who took part in the study, said: 'Our analyses show that having a drink containing thylakoids before breakfast reduces cravings and keeps you feeling more satisfied all day.' The study involved 38 overweight women and ran for three months. Every morning before breakfast the participants had a green drink. Half of the women were given 5 grams of spinach extract and the other half, the control group, were given a placebo. The participants did not know which group they belonged to – the only instructions they received were to eat a balanced diet including three meals a day and not to go on any other diet. 'In the study, the control group lost an average of 3.5 kg while the group that was given thylakoids lost 5 kg,' said Professor Erlanson-Albertsson. 'The thylakoid group also found that it was easier to stick to three meals a day – and they did not experience any cravings.' The green leaf membranes gradually slowed down the digestion process giving the intestinal hormone sufficient time to be release and signal to the brain the body is satisfied, researchers said . The team of researchers said the green leaf membranes gradually slowed down the digestion process giving the intestinal hormone sufficient time to be release and signal to the brain the body is satisfied. Professor Erlanson-Albertsson, added: 'It is about making use of the time it takes to digest our food. 'There is nothing wrong with our digestive system, but it doesn’t work well with the modern ‘pre-chewed’ food. 'The thylakoids extend digestion, producing a feeling of satiety. 'This means that we are able to stick to the diet we are meant for without snacks and unnecessary foods like sweets, crisps and such.'","Swedish researchers found green leaf membranes called thylakoids boost weight loss by 43%, curbing food cravings by 95% .

"This month marks a year since Father Rod Bower put up his first controversial message on the signage board outside Gosford Anglican Church. The message read: 'Dear Christians, some people are gay. Get over it. Love God'. It was a statement that certainly grabbed the attention of not only local passersby but also gained an international audience. And his outspoken views were not just confined to gay marriage. His thoughts on Australia's asylum seeker policy, climate change and coal seam gas have also been expressed in huge letters. Scroll down for video . This month marks a year since Father Rod Bower put up his first controversial message which he shared on the signage board outside Gosford Anglican Church, in the Central Coast - north of Sydney . Since then, the church's Facebook page has taken off - now with 12,607 likes . Now, Father Bower shares what's on his mind almost on a daily basis, displaying new messages on the board on NSW's Central Coast, north of Sydney. His unique way of engaging with the community began when he was visiting a dying man who's family tried to hide the fact that he was gay. Father Bower said he didn't want people to assume that he was anti-gay because he was Christian and a priest . 'That's when I thought to myself: ""hang on, I don't want people to assume that just because I'm a Christian and I'm a priest that I would be anti-gay"",' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Because I'm not. I'm actually a very vocal supporter of marriage equality. 'So I wanted to say to the community, don't assume that all Christians are conservative.' Since then, the church's Facebook page has taken off - now with 12,607 likes. 'It's just incredible. On a good week we get up to 300,000 views,' he said. 'It’s not unusual to get about 80,000 to 100,000 views.' But Father Bower's progressive views haven't gone without criticism. While other conservative priests have confronted Father Bower for his beliefs, he's also received threats and abuse from the public. 'Lots of hate mail, hate emails, hate tweets and hate posts,' he said. 'The ban button gets a bit of a work out sometimes.' A spokeswoman for the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle, which the Gosford parish belongs to, declined to comment on Father Bower's views. What the priest finds most concerning is the level of hatred Australians have towards others. 'I think the ones that I find most deeply disturbing are the ones targeted at vulnerable people,' he said. 'People saying things like ""if they [refugees and asylum seekers] all drowned that would solve the problem"".' One particular anonymous hate mail still remains in the forefront of his memory. The priest says he disagrees with Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott's stance on asylum seekers . Father Bower hopes to 'promote a society in which the vulnerable are cared for, in which the minority are embraced and in which human beings can flourish' 'Someone sent me a photocopied image of the boat breaking up on Christmas Island,' he said. 'He pasted a carton of beer and a bottle of champagne on the picture and wrote ""this is something to celebrate"". 'It was a graphic example of the kind of heart that I want to change.' Although the positive response definitely outweighs the bad, Father Bower says the criticism can 'some days eat into your soul a bit'. He believes media moguls like Rupert Murdoch sometimes have a negative influence on society. 'I think responsible journalism is one of the greatest gifts that can be given to a democracy,' he said. 'But I think when a powerful media provider is so focused on one area of the political spectrum, I think that can be very unhealthy for society.' So Father Bower wants his message of compassion and generosity to be loud and clear. 'For me it's really about the heart and emotion. Who we are as people and who we want to be as people,' he said. 'I hope to promote a society in which the vulnerable are cared for, in which the minority are embraced and in which human beings can flourish.' The Anglican priest says responsible journalism is an essential element to a healthy democracy. However he found that media mogul Rupert Murdoch 'focused on one area of the political spectrum' Father Bower said he received a lot of criticism from other conservative priest and also was sent hate mail from the public about his view on marriage equality . Father Bower makes no secret of his feelings towards Immigration Minister Scott Morrison . He even suggests Mr Morrison's actions are illegal and he should face court in The Hague . Father Bower also weighs into environmental issues, such as coal seam gas, a hot topic in his constituency . Forget the race that stops a nation every November, Australia stops all races, according to the churchman . Father Bower also feels strongly about education funding . After the jailing of Australian journalist Peter Greste in Egypt, Father Bower took another swipe at the Prime Minister . But Australia's asylum seeker policy is his favourite topic of discussion, linking the issue to his devout faith . The controversial federal budget, which has prompted nationwide protests, is also not off limits .","Father Rod Bower  has been putting up messages on a signage board in front of Gosford Anglican Church .

"A new volcanic island off the coast of Japan has tripled in size since it formed just over a month ago, experts have said. The land mass, which has now been named Niijima, was first spotted on November 20 in the Ogasawara chain around 600 miles south of Tokyo. Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time. However, the island has actually expanded to 56,000 square metres (13.8 acres) - around three times its size - as a result of continuing eruptions from the volcano below. Scroll down for video . Violent birth: This image shows the newly formed Niijima island (right) next to the uninhabited Nishino Shima land mass, a day after it first emerged from the sea off the coast of Japan around 600 miles south of Tokyo . Rapid expansion: This picture taken on December 20 shows how Niijima has grown to three times its size in the last month thanks to fresh volcanic eruptions below the surface of the Pacific Ocean . According to National Geographic, the Japan Meteorological Agency says it now rises to around 80ft above sea level and Japanese scientists believe it is large enough to last for several years, perhaps for good. A NASA satellite image taken on December 8 shows Niijima next to its closest island, the uninhabited Nishino Shima which lies around 500m away. The discoloration of the water caused by the volcanic minerals and white puffs of steam and gases can also be seen. The mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption on November 20 in a region dubbed Ring of Fire. Growing presence: This picture was taken on December 6, just over two weeks after the island formed . In this NASA satellite image from December 8, Niijima can be clearly seen next to the larger Nishino Shima . Smoke billows from a new islet off the coast of Nishino Shima, a small, uninhabited island in the Ogasawara chain off the coats of Tokyo. At that point, it was around 600ft in diameter . In September a similar new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan. It was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide/ . The . phenomenon on the coastline near the port of Gwadar caused astonishment . when it emerged from the Arabian Sea but, like the new islet in Japan, . experts said it was unlikely to last long. Although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions, they are rarely as powerful as the latest one. In fact, the forming of the new island is the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years. Video footage showed smoke billowing from part of the ocean around the Ogasawara island chain and the Japanese coastguard later confirmed it was coming from the new islet. This chain is made up of over 30 . subtropical and tropical islands. The islet is made up of volcanic lava and rocks forced from the ocean floor. Volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as 1,000C. The mass of rock, pictured, was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region of the Pacific Ocean dubbed Ring of Fire . The coastguard warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off. He added that the islet may not last long due to erosion, but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new marker on the map. Similar eruptions in the early 1970s and 80s created tiny islets in Japan's territory that have since disappeared. The new islet rose into the ocean near the Bonin Islands, also known as the Ogasawara chain.

The coastguard has warned sailors to use caution in the area and avoid travelling near it until the heat from the eruption cools off . ‘If this becomes a solid island, our country's territorial waters will expand,’ Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said. In September a similar new island appeared off the coast of Pakistan. It was forced to the surface following an earthquake and was made up a mound of mud and rock 70ft high and 295ft wide. The phenomenon on the coastline near the port of Gwadar caused astonishment when it emerged from the Arabian Sea but, like the new islet in Japan, experts said it was unlikely to last long. In November this year, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean created a new island off the coast of Japan, pictured. The mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed Ring of Fire - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of Tokyo . Experts said the islet, pictured, may not last long due to erosion, but if enough volcanic lava surfaces and solidifies it could create a new islet a new entry on the map .","The islet was 600ft in diameter when it appeared off south coast of Tokyo .
Now measures nearly 60,000 square feet and rises 80ft above sea level .
Scientists doubted it would survive but now think it could last forever .

"A murder trial is about to begin for a man who allegedly killed his wife twenty years ago. Paul Curry, of San Clemente, California, allegedly murdered his wife Linda Curry in 1994 with nicotine, ABC News reported. Curry, 57, had a new job and new wife in Kansas when authorities arrested him in 2010, where he 'was living off a $400,000 insurance payout from Linda Curry's death,' the news site reported. Scroll down for video . Did he do it? Paul Curry, 57, is accused of killing wife Linda Curry with a nicotine injection in 1994 . The Los Angeles Times reported in 1995 Linda Curry had been poisoned. Speaking to the newspaper, Paul Curry said at the time 'I'm not convinced that she died from nicotine poisoning. 'I'm not convinced that this diagnosis is any different from the long list of others that we got before she died,' he continued. 'They were all wrong.' Curry also said he was 'researching everything about nicotine to understand how it could've killed her.' The Orange County Register, reporting in 2010 on Curry's arrest, said authorities from both the sheriff's department and the district attorney's  office worked together. Victim: Nonsmoker Linda Curry, pictured, died of nicotine poisoning, authorities say . Sgt. Yvonne Shull told the newspaper the night Linda Curry died, 'It was only her and him' in the couple's home. 'When (Linda) Curry was given this dose of nicotine, she would have lived only a few hours,' she also said. Ebrahim Baytieh, a prosecutor for Orange County, told CBS Los Angeles at the time 'Nicotine is one of the strongest poisons available. ' 'I think in his mind he felt she was worth more to him dead than alive,' Baytieh also said. The Metropolitan News-Enterprise reported 'Witnesses said that before she died, she claimed that she was afraid her husband might kill her for insurance money.' The newspaper also revealed, citing a witness' testimony, Paul Curry allegedly pressured Linda to up her insurance policy to $1.4million, 'which she did not want to agree to.' ABC News reported that jurors are being selected in the murder trial.","Paul Curry, of San Clemente, California, allegedly killed his wife Linda Curry in 1994 by giving her a nicotine injection .

"It’s official, Raheem Sterling is England’s best player. He started with a reputation as a dribbler, but his speed, link-up play and movement makes him such a threat. And it was good to see Sterling and Daniel Sturridge doing what they do for Liverpool on a weekly basis. Sturridge goes at defenders whenever he can, runs off the back of people and if he can’t get past he’ll look for a one-two. Sterling is good at moving into the space Sturridge vacates and the pair linked up well all night. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Don't come at me with statistics . Main man: Raheem Sterling was England's best player against Norway on Wednesday night . On the move: Daniel Sturridge put in a lively performance and linked up well with Sterling . From the spot: Wayne Rooney celebrates putting England into a 1-0 lead against Norway . England start to shape up . I was pleased with the general shape of the team on Wednesday night. On paper it looked like 4-4-2 but Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were given licence to come in off the line. It’s so easy for wide men to stick to their wings, and England have been crying out for flexibility. On Wednesday night there were promising signs, now they just have to increase the number of shots on goal. Threat: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (above) was given licence to roam against Norway . Save energy for Switzerland . At one stage on Wednesday night I was slightly worried the side might be expending too much energy. We are a proud nation trying to make amends after a poor World Cup, but the game that matters this week is the qualifier against Switzerland on Monday. With 65 minutes on the clock, we still had a few players charging around and after weeks of intensive club football that can take its toll. Roy made his substitutions in the nick of time. Time for a new midfield generation . With England no longer able to call on Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, the next generation need to make their mark in the middle. Both were exceptional servants for England, but Jack Wilshere and Henderson both looked as if they were playing with a greater freedom in their absence. Henderson was hitting his passes with a real punch — he made more in the first half than the entire Norway midfield — and Wilshere was going at and past people in a way we haven’t seen for more than a year.

"As Alexis Sanchez celebrated his first Premier League goal against Leicester on Sunday afternoon, he probably wasn't aware of its significance. The Chilean's effort, which flashed past Kasper Schmeichel to give the Gunners the lead at the King Power Stadium, also made him the 100th player to score for the north London side in the Premier League era. It was the £30million summer signing's second goal for the club, following on from a priceless winner against Besiktas in the Champions League play-offs.

The former Barcelona star joins an illustrious list of players to have found the back of the net for Arsenal since the Premier League began back in 1992. Club legend Thierry Henry leads the way in the goalscoring stakes, having netted 175 times during his eight-year career at Highbury and the Emirates. In second place, but miles behind the Frenchman, sits Ian Wright with 104 league goals to his name, while Manchester United striker Robin van Persie is third having scored 96 times before leaving for Old Trafford in 2012. Goal-getters: Thierry Henry (left) sits top of Arsenal's goalscoring chart above Ian Wright (right) Flying Dutchmen: Robin van Persie (left) and Dennis Bergkamp (right) are third and fourth in the Gunners' list . Other names near the top of the Gunners' list include Dennis Bergkamp (87 goals), Robert Pires (62 goals), Emmanuel Adebayor (46 goals) and Cesc Fabregas (35 goals). Sanchez joins a group of 19 players to have scored a single league goal for Arsenal, with the likes of Gael Clichy, Kieran Gibbs, Carl Jenkinson, Nacho Monreal and Serge Gnabry each having celebrated just one top-flight strike in the red and white. There will surely be more to come from the Chile star, however. Despite Sanchez's goal being a piece of history it was not enough to seal a win for Arsenal at Leicester as Leonardo Ulloa earned Nigel Pearson's side a share of the points with a fine header.

Five-year-old Fresa was found wandering the streets of Mexico City with half of her snout missing with surgeons believing it was cut off by a sharp object.

The dog, whose name means strawberry in English, was found by neighbours wandering the streets of Mexico City . The dog, whose name means strawberry in English, was unable to breathe through her nose and surgeon Jesus Paredes was forced to operate on her. The three hour operation saw Fresa have her lips reconstructed using other flaps of skin, which also removed her protruding jaw.

"A former Marine-turned-rent boy for some of Hollywood's biggest names in the 1940s claims to have had threesomes with the Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis Simpson. Scotty Bowers, now 88, has opened up 'his little black book' and told all, shedding light on the prostitution ring he claims catered for the royal couple as well as gay and bisexual A-listers including Cary Grant, George Cukor and Rock Hudson. 'Full Service: My Adventures In Hollywood And The Secret Sex Lives Of The Stars' opens the doors of the closeted underworld of old Hollywood through three decades. Times past: Scotty Bowers, a former marine, has penned an explosive memoir about life as a Hollywood rent boy in the 1940s. He claims to have had threesomes with the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson . Stories in the 286-page book tell of . arranging bedroom partners for actresses Rita Hayworth and . Katharine Hepburn, who he claims he set up with 'over 150 different . women', reports the New York Times. His own lovers included Edith Piaf, Spencer Tracy, Vivien Leigh and Cary Grant, says Mr Bowers, who was married in 1984 to his current wife, Lois. Mr Bowers also says he provided . services for the Duke of Windsor - who had abdicated as King Edward VIII . - and his wife Wallis, allegedly sharing a series of three -in-the-bed . romps with the couple. He . has been inundated with book and film offers but has until now remained . tight-lipped over the secret lives of his famous clients. Old Hollywood rent boy Scotty Bowers claims he shared three in a bed romps with the Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis Simpson . 'I’ve kept silent all these years . because I didn’t want to hurt any of these people,' Mr Bowers told the . Times in an interview, adding that he doesn't need the money. 'And I never saw the fascination. So they liked sex how they liked it. Who cares?' He writes in the book's preface: 'Although I'm not a shy man I have . always been reticent to reveal details about what I have done, mainly to . respect the privacy of those whose lives have intersected with mine'. He explained his change of heart to the Times: 'I . finally said yes because I’m not getting any younger and all of my . famous tricks are dead by now. The truth can’t hurt them anymore'. 'Although I'm not a shy man I have . always been reticent to reveal details about what I have done, mainly to . respect the privacy of those whose lives have intersected with mine' Mr Bowers, who now lives in Hollywood Hills with his wife of 27 years, said it all started in 1946, when he was just 23. Newly discharged from the Marines after World War II he got a job at a gas station near Paramount Pictures, reports the Times. The book is as explicit as it is bawdy. The author describes pumping gas one day when actor Walter Pidgeon drove up and propositioned him with a $20 bill. It was to be the start of an era of 'amazing, intoxicating days, wildly erotic and carefree', he writes in the book. In its first chapter, Mr . Bowers writes that the well-spoken Mrs Miniver star drove him to a large . house on that blazingly hot afternoon. The actor and his friend, Jacques Potts, invited him to use the swimming pool: 'It's hot . Scotty. Hop in for a swim, I'll join you in a minute ... No need for a . suit. There's no one else here.' Mr Bowers claims he romped with the erstwhile King Edward VIII, pictured left in 1949,  and says he also had threesomes with Edward and Wallis Simpson, pictured, right, in 1942 . He describes then having 'really hot sex' with the married men, who were in their 50s. 'Neither of them exhibited even a hint of effeminate behaviour. They were both in remarkably good shape, too, especially when you consider their ages', he recalls. The men saw each other off and on over the years: 'We always had a lot of fun together', writes Mr Bowers. The author - who admits he did not have a . sheltered childhood - had a first wife, Betty, who gave birth to their . daughter Donna in February of 1947. He says life at home with his wife . 'was pretty dull'. 'Rock Hudson and one of his gay lovers . drove in one night ... in due course, he . and I would get to know one another pretty well' Life at the Richfield gas station on Hollywood Boulevard - which had turned into a trendy hang-out - was far more exciting. 'Rock Hudson and one of his gay lovers . drove in one night in a brand-new 1947 Chevrolet Coupe, of which he was . very proud', he writes in the book's first chapter. 'He filled up and we chatted; every second of third day after . that he came back and had me pump five dollars worth of gas into his . car. He was living in North Hollywood at the time and, in due course, he . and I would get to know one another pretty well.' A request from a 'middle-aged queen' to meet one of Mr Bowers' 20-year-old blond friends is what tipped him away from being a casual sexual partner of Mr Pidgeon's and towards the world of turning tricks. According to Mr Bowers, he . stumbled into a business that he ran from his base at the gas station, . servicing clients himself as well as setting them up with his handsome . Marine friends. Mr . Bowers, whose striking good looks attracted Hollywood's biggest icons, . said the station was a 'safer hangout' then gay bars, which were often . raided, reports the Times. Iconic actors Cary Grant, left, and Spencer Tracy, right, were also allegedly among Mr Bowers lovers when he worked as a Hollywood rent boy in the 1940s . Mr Bowers claims that he set up sexual encounters with 'over 150 different women' for actress Katharine Hepburn . 'Sometimes police would come around, . sure. But I think I never got caught partly because I kept everything in . my head. There was no little black book', he told the Times. In his preface, the author writes: 'Whatever folks wanted, I had it. I . could make all their fantasies come true. No matter how outrageous or . off-beat people's tastes, I was the one who knew how to get them exactly . what they were after. Straight, gay, or bi; male or female; young or . old - I had something for everyone.' 'Frankly,' he writes, 'I knew Hollywood like no one else knew it.' Source: nytimes.com . However, . he quit his job in 1950 and said he supported himself for the . next 20 years through prostitution, bar work and working as a handyman. In . his book, Mr Bowers writes that, in addition to his gay clients, he . also gained a following among heterosexual actors like Desi Arnaz, who . used him as a matchmaking service. The X-rated revelations come after . years of silence on the part of Mr Bowers, who claims, reports the . Times, that as he never accepted cash for his services, was 'not a . pimp'. Unsurprisingly, though not yet out, the book has met with mixed reception - with some doubting its veracity. 'If you believe him, and I do, he’s like the Kinsey Reports live and in living color,' Matt Tyrnauer, a Vanity Fair writer who is to make a documentary about the one-time lothario, told the Times. Playwright and author Gore Vidal has . given the explosive tome his seal of approval, writing on his official . site, gorevidalnow.com, that he thoroughly recommends the read. 'I . have known Scotty Bowers for the better part of a century. I’m so . pleased that he has finally decided to tell his story to the world. 'His startling memoir includes great . figures like Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. Scotty doesn’t lie-the . stars sometimes do - and he knows everybody,' he writes. Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, pictured here together in 'Bringing Up Baby' allegedly used Mr Bower's services, the rent boy claims he slept with Grant while organising lesbian sex for Hepburn . American songwriter Cole Porter, pictured, was also among his Mr Bower's clients during his time as a a rent boy . In his praise fro the book, William . J Mann, author of Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn and How to Be a Movie . Star: Elizabeth Taylor in Hollywood, says the story 'is juicy, juicy stuff - but just as importantly, . it’s a seminal chapter of American popular culture that gives us a . richer understanding of the people, times, and culture of Hollywood’s Golden Age.' 'Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars' opens the doors of the closeted, x-rated under world of old Hollywood over three decades . The shocking tell-all is likely to meet with some rather less supportive audiences - particularly the relatives and fans of some of those exposed. The book has been libel-checked and Alan U Schwartz, an entertainment lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, told the newspaper that while some readers 'might be in tears... there’s nothing they can do about it.' The publishers, however, stand by the chronicle of the bygone era, with Grove/Atlantic's Morgan Entrekin telling the newspaper that he did not feel Mr Bowers was being 'meanspirited', and did not 'get the sense that this guy is trying to exploit these experiences.' Mr Bowers, who told the Times that he prefers the sexual company of women, continued his eyebrow-raising and largely hidden sideline until the onset of AIDS in the 1980s. The disease 'brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of movies,' Mr. Bowers writes. 'It was obvious that my days of arranging tricks for others were over. It was too unsafe a game to play anymore.' His story is set to be published by Grove Press on February 14 and is written with Lionel Friedberg, an award-winning producer of documentaries.","Says lovers included Edith Piaf, Spencer Tracy, Vivien Leigh and Cary Grant .

"A 15-year-old girl without a driver's license took her father's SUV without permission before crashing the vehicle, killing three teenage boys, authorities have said. The unidentified girl, who may have been speeding, is now facing possible charges in the crash, which killed Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney and Ryan Lesher, all 15, in Wayne County, Pennsylvania. On Saturday morning, the girl, who was visiting Wallenpaupack Lake Estates from her home in New York, took the car with a 16-year-old friend and picked up four teenage boys to get breakfast. As the group headed back to the development, the driver lost control on a bend and the vehicle flipped over multiple times. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: From left, Cullen Keffer, Shamus Digney and Ryan Lesher were all killed after a friend's SUV crashed in rural Pennsylvania on Saturday morning.

"Blueprints for how to build a 3D-plastic gun remain easily accessible via the internet, despite the U.S. State Department ordering the . website which initially posted the plans to remove them. On Thursday, Defense Distributed was forced to take the . blueprints down from its site by the U.S. Department of State on the basis that they could . violate possible arms trafficking violations. But now the plans have been uploaded to torrent site Pirate Bay multiple times, and have already been downloaded from the site thousands of times. Scroll down for video . Blueprints for how to build a 3D-plastic gun have quickly appeared on peer-to-peer sites such as Pirate Bay . The plans have been uploaded to torrent site Pirate Bay multiple times, and have already been downloaded from the site thousands of times . Pirate Bay has said that it has no intention of removing the plans from its peer-to-peer file-sharing service. 'TPB has for close to 10 years been . operating without taking down one single torrent due to pressure from . the outside. And it will never start doing that,' a Pirate Bay insider . told TorrentFreak, which first pointed out the 3D gun on the . now-Icelandic site. Now that the blueprints for the gun have appeared online it will become increasingly difficult to track how many other sites are also hosting them. The main thing preventing more 3D guns from being printed at this time is the limited availability of 3D printers themselves. Bang: This is the moment Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson successfully fired the first working plastic gun made by a 3-D printer . The blueprints, that can be produced . on a 3-D printer costing as little . as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously . designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing . modern ammunition. The plans were quickly downloaded more than 100,000 times since it was posted to the web on Monday. Surprisingly, most downloads of the plans did not come from inside the U.S. but from Spain. The U.S. was second, ahead of Brazil, Germany, and the U.K., according to Haroon Khalid, a developer working with Defense Distributed, who reported the statistics to Forbes. The State Department Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance ordered Cody Wilson, the 25-year-old founder of the site, to remove the online blueprints for the 3D-printable 'Liberator' handgun, Forbes magazine reported. The State Department office is reviewing whether the files violate export control laws for weapons, known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), since the plans were downloaded overseas. Crude: The Liberator plastic gun is a simple single-shot weapon that fires a small .380-caliber bullet . Wilson, currently a law student at the . University of Texas in Austin, says his group will comply with the State . Department directive. On Sunday, the group Defense Distributed posted a video of founder Cody Wilson firing the 'Liberator' plastic pistol. Mr Wilson made the schematics for the weapon available for free online this week - meaning everyone with a high-end 3-D printer can create their own version of the gun. In response, New York Senator Chuck Schumer announced that he plans to introduce legislation that will ban the weapons because they can pass through metal detectors at airports and court houses without being picked up. 'We’re facing a situation where anyone - . a felon, a terrorist - can open a gun factory in their garage and the . weapons they make will be undetectable. It’s stomach-churning,' he said. Plastic: Sixteen of the 17 parts that make up the Liberator are plastic, constructed by a 3-D printer. A small nail is used for a firing pin . Sixteen of the 17 parts in the . Liberator pistol are made from tempered plastic molded inside the . Stratasys Dimension SST 3D printer. The final piece of the weapons - the . firing pin - is a common nail. Mr Wilson told Forbes.com . that he hopes to make weapons available to anyone who wants them. It is . a bid, he says, to keep governments accountable to the people. 'You . can print a lethal device. It’s kind of scary, but that’s what we’re . aiming to show,' he said. 'Anywhere there’s a computer and an Internet . connection, there would be the promise of a gun.' The name of the gun - Liberator - comes from a simple World War II pistol that was designed by the U.S. military to made cheaply and air dropped in large numbers into occupied Europe and concentration camps. Like its World War II predecessor, the Defense Distributed pistol is a crude weapon. It holds only a single shot and uses an inaccurate smooth bore. Shocking: New York Senator Chuck Schumer plans to introduce legislation that would ban plastic guns made from 3-D printers . 3-D printing is poised to revolutionize engineering and reforge industries from medicine, to construction to aerospace. The process, also called additive manufacturing, creates a three-dimensional solid object from a digital model. The feat is achieved by laying down layer upon layer of plastic. The layers are then joined together to create the final shape. The machine takes blueprints from computer aided designs and 'slices' them into digital cross-sections that the machine uses as a guideline for printing. The process of addictive manufacturing has been in use on a large industrial scale since the early 1980s. However, since 2010, an entire industry has sprung up around personal 3-D printers, which are increasingly small, increasingly powerful and increasingly affordable. Defense Distributed used a higher-end $8,000 model to build its 3-D gun. However entry-level desktop models can cost $500 to $1,000. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Engineers hope 3-D printing will begin an era of 'instant prototyping' that will allow product developers to forge and tinker with prototypes quickly and inexpensively. The group has successfully fired it . with a .380-caliber pistol round. However, an attempt to shoot a . slightly larger 5.7 x 28mm defense cartridge blew the gun to pieces. Currently, the Liberator can only be . made through highly specialized processes on an $8,000 3-D printer. Mr . Wilson says he hopes to adapt the model . The technology behind 3-D printing is not new and has available for industrial applications for decades. It . is only since about 2010, though, that 3-D printers have become cheap . enough, simple enough to use and compact enough for most consumers to . purchase. Schumer says the accessibility of 3-D printers makes plastic guns a security threat. 'Guns are made out of plastic, so . they would not be detectable by a metal detector at any airport or . sporting event,' Schumer said, according WCBS 880. 'Only . metal part of the gun is the little firing pin and that is too small to . be detected by metal detectors, for instance, when you go through an . airport. 'A terrorist, someone who’s mentally ill, a spousal abuser, a felon can essentially open a gun factory in their garage.' Schumer . wants to renew a previous ban on undetectable weapons while the new . bill would add a ban on plastic high-capacity magazines. 'People . have made silencers, stocks, triggers and lots of other gun parts. They . can then upload these digital blueprints to the web and then anyone . with one of these printers - and the printers cost about $1,000 -  can . make one,' Schumer said. Current law bans . all-plastic weaponry. Defense Distributed weapons have just one large metal piece in the handle, to get around the law. Schumer says the metal can be swapped out and replaced with plastic. Production: In an instruction video, the 3D printed gun is shown being printed layer by layer using technology that could soon become commonplace in the home . Process: Video shows the team beginning to assemble the gun after each part was printed and cleaned .","The State Department demanded Defense Distributed  remove the blueprints from their site .

"Bernard Gavrin, from Brooklyn, New York, who will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia this month, 70 years after he went missing during the Second World War . An American soldier will finally be buried with full military honours, 70 years after he went missing in action during the Second World War. The Department of Defense has confirmed that Army Private Bernard Gavrin from Brooklyn, New York, will be buried in Arlington National Cemetery after his remains were discovered only last year. According to the Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office, Private Gavrin was just 29 when he was reported missing on July 7, 1944. His regiment has been in Saipan, Japan, in the Northern Mariana Islands of the western Pacific Ocean and came under heavy attack, suffering many casualties. Mr Gavrin was declared dead in July 1945 and by 1948, his remains were deemed non-recoverable. However, in recent years, excavations in Saipan by a Japanese non-profit group have turned up the remains of several American and Japanese soldiers from the Second World War. Last year the remains and personal items from American soldiers were uncovered and were handed over to the American government for testing. It then emerged that the remains of Mr Gavrin were among them after they were tested using a family member's DNA. Mr Gavrin's 82-year-old nephew David Rogers, of Delray Beach, Florida, said he was planning to be at the burial in the cemetery on September 12. He said it was 'absolutely incredible and unbelievable to all of us' that Gavrin would be laid to rest in 'the most honorable place you could be buried in this country.' Mr Rogers, whose mother was Gavrin's sister, said the private was the youngest of three children and had enlisted in 1940. He said the last time he saw his uncle was when he was eight-years-old and his uncle came to visit. Mr Rogers had injured himself, requiring stitches, and Mr Gavrin went to his bedroom. Mr Gavrin will be buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on September 12 . 'He awakened me and kissed me on the forehead,' Rogers said. He also recalled how the loss of his uncle was shattering and said that when the telegram came to inform the family he was missing, that his grandmother, Mr Gavrin's mother, opened it. He added: 'She let out a scream that lives with me to this day.'","Private Bernard Gavrin went missing in action in Saipan during WWII .

"Steven Gerrard's retirement from international football will leave a huge hole in England’s midfield. I don’t see any midfielder currently in or around the squad who can replicate what he does and deliver the range of passing he has from deep positions. Roy Hodgson must have been bitterly disappointed that he couldn’t persuade him to stay on for another two years. Undoubtedly his decision to quit the international game will benefit Liverpool enormously and damage England’s hopes, especially as they play their toughest opponents in Euro 2016 qualifying, Switzerland, a week tomorrow. With Frank Lampard retiring, too, and the manager having to cope with injuries, there is an obvious lack of experience in the midfield. But now the captain has gone, it will be up to the new guard to assume the mantle. We do not have a player who can sit deep as Steven has done latterly in his career and deliver those 40- or 50-yard passes. Scroll down for videos... Farewell: Steven Gerrard retired from international duty after England's dismal World Cup in Brazil . Game over: England's draw with Costa Rica at the World Cup proved to the Gerrard's final cap . Michael Carrick might come closest with the way he can slide balls in, but he’s injured, so the task is likely to fall to Jordan Henderson, Gerrard’s team-mate at Liverpool. I’m hoping that in the friendly against Norway on Wednesday we see him step up to international level. Perhaps he might even blossom now he will be the main man and Gerrard has gone, as the manager will have to hang his hat on him. Though Henderson has thrived in the past 18 months at club level, taking leaps and bounds forward in his form, we have yet to see that in an England shirt. He does have the ability in his locker. Look at the pass he played to help set up Raheem Sterling’s goal in the opening game of the season. He can deliver those exquisite balls, but he has to do so more consistently. With England, he tends to regress to a more stilted game where he goes short, square and back. This is a challenge for him to seize the opportunity and to dominate. Time to step up: Jordan Henderson (centre) could take advantage of Gerrard's retirement . But the player I think Hodgson will be most positive about is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. He has that flexibility as a midfielder in that he can play wide and in the middle and as such has a few strings to his bow. He still plays a little bit off the cuff, which is a good thing, as he gives you that injection of pace and creativity wherever he plays. Before the World Cup and his unfortunate injury, he looked like he was playing himself into the team. But he can add real quality to England’s midfield: look at the lovely little clipped ball he played in for Olivier Giroud at Everton. It’s Oxlade-Chamberlain’s early-season form that has impressed me the most. He has come back from his injury and picked up the reins from where he left off in those pre-World Cup friendlies. He might end up in central midfield permanently, as Arsene Wenger likes him in that role, and I think he will be there for these England matches, with Henderson sitting and possibly his Arsenal team-mate Jack Wilshere alongside him. Wilshere could play in the role that Ross Barkley would have filled in an attacking midfield before injury ruled him out. There are huge gaps in the England midfield but that means huge opportunities as well. It’s up to Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere to seize them. Exciting times: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has impressed for Arsenal in the opening weeks of the season . Can we now get even more out of Rooney? Wayne Rooney is the new England captain and he was the obvious choice, but I’m hoping that we will now see an even better player in the England shirt. It’s not that Rooney doesn’t play well for England; he does. Even at the World Cup, when he came in for some criticism after the Italy game, you could see that he was doing his job and performing at a higher level than most players could reach. But you feel there is still more to come from Rooney with England, even at the age of 28. Sometimes giving a player that responsibility, and the reassurance that he is your top man, can allow him to thrive. Alan Shearer was my captain with England and he relished the idea of being our leader. He would have always given 100 per cent whatever, but maybe it just lifted his game a little. That’s what I’m now hoping to see from Rooney. Leading by example: Wayne Rooney was named England captain by Roy Hodgson last week . Why Sturridge will have to do Mario's running . It seems the whole football world will be waiting to see which Mario Balotelli turns up when Tottenham take on Liverpool. He is a one-off and he does unusual things — on and off the pitch. At his best he has the ability to run off the back of defenders, to score goals, to hold the ball up and to win headers if you get crosses in. But it totally depends on his mood. On another day he won’t run in behind people, he can’t hold the ball up and he doesn’t go for headers. His best games are nine out of 10 marks performances, but his worst are four out of 10. To be a quality player he needs to make sure that his worst performances are sevens. As I wrote last week, if Brendan Rodgers can coax that out of him, he will have an absolute bargain. Raring to go: Mario Balotelli (centre) could prove to be an astute signing for Liverpool after costing £16million . All change: Daniel Sturridge (left) will have to play the Luis Suarez role after the arrival of Balotelli . Your worry would be the number of times he has had to be substituted early in games because he wasn’t delivering. It happened again at the World Cup when Italy coach Cesare Prandelli had to take him off at half-time in their match against Uruguay because his performance was so erratic. His relationship with Daniel Sturridge will be one to watch. Sturridge likes to be the main man up top of the attack and Luis Suarez used to do a lot of the work in behind him, chasing down the ball and dropping in. There’s no way Balotelli will be doing that, so I would imagine Sturridge will now be asked to carry out the Suarez role, when I’m pretty sure he would rather play as the furthest-forward striker. But if you’re going to play two up front — and you would want both of those players on the pitch — then someone will have to sacrifice himself a little and it definitely will not be Balotelli. However it turns out, we won’t be able to take our eyes away as the story unfolds.. Manchester City again have the chance to prove themselves against the best in the Champions League with Bayern Munich in their group. I know they beat Bayern away last year, but that was after the Germans had qualified. A better guide would be the 3-1 lesson Bayern gave City at the Etihad. I can’t believe Manuel Pellegrini will have two up front again. In the Champions League you have to adjust your tactics. Sir Alex Ferguson did so. City have the depth, the experience and the quality to do better again this year — but I still suspect they’ll be second to Bayern in their group.","I don't see any midfielder who can replace Steven Gerrard .

"CLICK HERE to read the full story on Malky Mackay's offensive text about Cardiff chairman Vincent Tan. Former FA chairman Lord Triesman has called for Malky Mackay to be banned from football for at least a year after Sportsmail revealed his racist text and email exchanges with Iain Moody. Although Mackay insisted he was guilty of sending only three racist texts ‘out of 10,000’ recovered from Moody’s phone as part of a Cardiff City investigation into eight transfers during his tenure as manager, this newspaper revealed another tranche of messages that further exposed the 42-year-old Scot on Saturday morning. In one, Cardiff believe Mackay called Malaysian club owner Vincent Tan a ‘chink’. Mackay gave a TV interview on Friday night in which he insisted he was not racist, sexist or homophobic. He did, however, accept that the texts he sent to Moody — then head of recruitment at Cardiff and until his resignation last week the sporting director at Crystal Palace — were ‘unacceptable’ and ‘inappropriate’. Under fire: Sportsmail has revealed a number of controversial text messages sent by Malky Mackay . Offensive: Mackay referred to Cardiff owner Vincent Tan (L) as a 'chink' in one particular text message . Punishment: Former FA chairman Lord Triesman believes Mackay should be banned for a whole season . Sportsmail understands there is a real appetite at the FA to punish both Mackay and Moody. The governing body has made no comment because it could prejudice their investigation after evidence was passed to Wembley officials by Cardiff’s lawyers. But insiders at the FA expect the two men to be charged in the belief that this cannot be compared to previous cases, in which privacy has been given as a reason not to proceed. Triesman, who served as FA chairman between 2008 and 2010, told the BBC yesterday that Mackay should be banned from football for a season simply on the strength of the three messages he has admitted sending. ‘There could very well be a significant period in which he can take no part in football,’ said Triesman. ‘If it turns out to be three texts then maybe a season (ban), if it’s more than that may be much more. Assuming that the evidence is stacked up — I can’t pre-try it — I think the FA, in the same sense that it can say to players, “Here is a period in which you can take no part in playing”, could do so with other people in football.’ Read it here first! How Sportsmail broke the news over Malky Mackay's texting shame . I'm sorry: Mackay apologised for any offence caused by his messages in an interview with Sky Sports HQ . Revealed: Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton uncovered the shocking messages sent by Mackay . Gone: Iain Moody (C) left his role as Crystal Palace's sporting director after allegations against him . The full picture: Sportsmail brought the behaviour of Mackay and Moody to light earlier this week . Lord Ouseley, the chairman of anti-discrimination campaign group Kick It Out, told the BBC yesterday that the case highlights a greater need to address prejudice and bigotry in sport. ‘It’s very difficult to prescribe what is appropriate,’ he said. ‘My concern is that we’re talking about one individual and focusing on that individual and I understand why that is, but we’re talking about the wider implications for the game. 'Malky Mackay is probably thinking, “Hey, I’m unlucky, I’ve got into a situation where all my texts have been forensically examined”. If that happened to every other football manager, senior administrator and other people at top levels of the game then there wouldn’t be many people working in the football, the game might just collapse. ‘I think what we have got to recognise is that there is a serious problem about prejudice and bigotry and where that is in the hands of people with power, something’s got to be done and it’s got to be done now. Under investigation: The FA have begun looking at a dossier of messages between Mackay and Moody . Criticised: Cardiff have called for LMA chief executive Richard Bevan (L) to quit his role . ‘The Malky Mackay case is a microcosm that enables us to focus on what is a real, serious problem. If football is going to get to grips with this it has an opportunity now and that’s why the role of the FA is important. ‘You can say a season, two seasons, whatever, if we think that’s it, close it off, we’ve dealt with that and the problem is over, it isn’t.’ It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .

"With its health benefits and celebrity fans, super-hydrating coconut water is the must-have drink of 2013. But hot on its heels is mineral-rich aloe vera juice. Market trend predictors are singing the . praises of nutrient-packed, cholesterol-lowering aloe vera-based drinks. The latest must-sip claims to aid weight loss, digestion, immune function, and even ease general discomfort. Move over, coconut water! With its cocktail of vitamins and minerals, aloe vera juice is tipped to be the season's hottest health trend . Aloe Vera contains a multitude of vitamins including A, C, E, folic acid, B1, B2, B3, B6 and is one of the few plants that contains vitamin B12, which helps with brain and nervous system function.

"Kell Brook has claimed he was the victim of an ‘unprovoked attack’ in the stabbing incident that has left him facing an uncertain future in boxing. The 28-year-old spoke for the first time on Friday about the shocking assault in Tenerife on Thursday, claiming he was not responsible for the altercation that saw him suffer a stab wound to his left leg. Brook will wear a cast for the next four to six weeks and will be unable to defend his IBF world welterweight title in Sheffield on December 6.

Champion: The Sheffield fighter won a world title at the first time of asking after beating Shawn Porter . In action: Brook turned in a gutsy display to beat Porter and line up a potential fight against Amir Khan . Brook, who won the title last month, said: ‘I was out enjoying a night out before returning home to the UK when I was the victim of an unprovoked attack. ‘I’m devastated after being on such a high, having achieved my dream of becoming world champion. This is a major setback but the thought of defending my title is what’s keeping me positive right now. ‘I want to thank everyone for their support and ask for privacy for myself and my family. Make no mistake, I will be back.’ Despite suggestions the injury will wreck Brook’s hopes of fighting Amir Khan in a domestic blockbuster at Wembley in May, promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail: ‘It won’t have an impact. I would anticipate that Brook will be fit to fight again in February or March, so I don’t think a fight with Khan will be affected.’ Hearn and Brook’s family have been at the fighter’s bedside since the attack, which is being investigated by the Spanish police. Brook is being treated at Candelaria hospital and police remain at scene of both the scene of the attack . Pictures of blood splattered on the concrete which are said to be connected to the stabbing of Kell Brook . Quite how Brook came to sustain the injury is not yet known, but the fighter is understood to have been on a night out in Golf de Sur with his heavily pregnant partner, Lindsey, who went home before the altercation occurred. Brook was drinking with three others, including the man with whom he is believed to have had the altercation. The party left the bar at about 2am, going to the home of one of the group. At 6am, Brook and his alleged assailant left for the latter’s home nearby, with the confrontation happening shortly after. Police sources confirmed Brook ‘lost a lot of blood’ and that the alleged attacker has not yet been found.

"Where do superheroes go when they need a cut and blow dry? To Mr Universe of course! And at 17st with a massive 58in chest, one hairdressing body builder hopes that the much sought-after title will soon be his. Muscular Simon Ackroyd, 45, from Cheadle, Cheshire, splits his time between working in a salon and bodybuilding, as he works towards claiming the title once held by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Bulging muscles: Body builder and hairdresser Simon Ackroyd's workouts have left him with a 58in chest and 21in biceps . Gentle giant: Simon has been hairdressing for 30 years, and says he is not as intimidating as his physique might make him appear . The father of four has been body building for 18 years and eats a whopping 6,000 calories a day in order to maintain his sculptured physique. Hitting the gym for two hours a day, five days a week has left him with 21in biceps and 29in thighs. But Simon, who has been hairdressing for 30 years, says he is not as intimidating as he appears: 'The difference between body-building and my job is mad but I’ve always been a gentle guy. 'Some people judge me as some kind of monster, but when they talk to me they realise I am a nice bloke. ‘People will walk past with their mouths hanging open. No-one expects a guy like me to be working in a hairdressers. I have a lot of regular clients and they all love it though. They’re all dead proud.’ Unlikely stylist: 'When people see me they sometimes get a shock. No-one expects a guy like me to be working in a hairdressers' says Simon .

However, his wife Jenny, 49, is growing tired of preparing the mammoth meals needed to fuel her husband’s colossal body. ‘She’s sick of it to be honest,’ says Simon. ‘When I start my diet I’ll drop down to 4,000 calories. This will include six 400g portions of cod a day, with 100g of rice with every meal. ‘If I do well in Mr Universe, I’ll go for Mr World the following year but then she said I have to retire.’ World domination: If Simon does well in the Mr Universe competition he is also going to compete in the Mr World competition next year .

"A woman and her three young children were fortunate to escape with minor injuries after they were violently attacked by a stranger in New York. The terrifying incident was captured by CCTV cameras and the video shows the man elbowing a child in the head and tossing another to the pavement. NYPD said the violent scene unfolded after the man tried to sexually assault the mother in front of her children. The video shows a man carrying a child from the driver’s side of a car before confronting the 26-year-old mother, who is holding a one-year-old child in her arms. The man and the mother are struggling near the rear passenger side door when he suddenly elbows the five-year-old child in the head, knocking him or her to the floor. With the mother attempting to intervene, the man pulls the child out of the backseat and tosses him or her to the pavement before climbing back into the car and driving off. Police said the incident occurred in the early morning hours of 24 August in Queens after the mother and her children were picked up in Manhattan by a man who claimed to be a taxi driver.

"Kolo Toure has questioned whether Chelsea have the mental strength to complete an unbeaten season as he warned Liverpool are out to wreck their ‘Invincible’ ambitions. The Ivorian, who excelled in Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat against Real Madrid, was part of the Arsenal side that marched imperiously through the 2003-04 campaign without losing a game in the Barclays Premier League. It has become a source of debate as to whether Jose Mourinho’s current squad can replicate that achievement following their flying start, with another question being how many trophies Chelsea will actually win. Kolo Toure (right) impressed during Liverpool's defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League . Karim Benzema (right) scored the winner for Real Madrid as they eased into the knockout stages . Toure, though, has explained how difficult it is to see off all-comers and predicted that the biggest tests still await Chelsea, despite them having travelled to Old Trafford and the Etihad Stadium already. Next up for Chelsea is a collision with Liverpool on Saturday lunchtime and there is much riding on the outcome of that contest, particularly given the history between the two clubs. The wounds Chelsea inflicted on April 27 this year when winning 2-0, after all, are still fresh. ‘Chelsea have a good team,’ said Toure. ‘With the squad they have of course they can do it, but its not the only quality. It is about mentality. Every game is challenging and sometimes things don’t go well for you but you need to be able to come back and carry on fighting. The season has just started. We will see. Chelsea continued their unbeaten Premier League run against Queens Park Rangers last weekend . Arsenal went a whole season unbeaten in 2003/04 and Chelsea have been tipped to follow suit . ‘It’s a great chance (to end the argument)! But the most important is we want to win the game. It’s a very important game when you think what they do to us last season, that cost us the league and now we have the chance to beat them. I can’t wait for that, honestly. ‘Every game for Liverpool you want to win and Chelsea are playing well now. When you play at home in a game like that it is going to be attacking teams. Chelsea attack and Liverpool attack as well. I think you are going to see a great game. We want to win . ‘This season they will attack … with the players they have they can’t defend all the time. I think they will just try to score goal and we will try to score goals. It’s going to be a great game, definitely.’ Steven Gerrard famously slipped, allowing Demba Ba to score for Chelsea as Liverpool lost 2-0 in April . Ba (left) raced through and calmly finished past Simon Mignolet to give Chelsea the lead back in April . Having been out in the cold for most of the season, starting only in Capital One Cup games against Middlesbrough and Swansea, Toure seized his chance to impress Brendan Rodgers in the Bernabeu Stadium and he hopes to have given his manager a dilemma. ‘I was talking to somebody (before game in Madrid) and I was saying that Ronaldo won’t score… and he didn’t score!’ Toure said with a smile. ‘At the end of the day, we could have gone with a draw but we are still there. We will do everything to win those two [group] games coming. ‘I’m ready for Chelsea. Any position, I am ready to fight for my club, I play from my heart, that is what is important. It doesn’t matter which players play we will give 100 per cent.’","Kolo Toure was part of Arsenal team that went the whole season unbeaten .

"At least 10,000 British emigrants are enjoying life in the sun on sickness benefits of up to £94 a week. This could be costing the taxpayer almost £1million a week in a time of austerity. Claimants in the UK are being forced to take new tests to see if they really are as sick as they say. A (taxpayer funded) place in the sun: At least 10,000 Britons living overseas are enjoying handouts thanks to incapacity benefits. (Picture posed by models) But officials admit that 4,000 older recipients of the benefit living in Spain, Jamaica and elsewhere will be able to continue drawing the handout until they reach retirement age. This is because Iain Duncan Smith’s Department of Work and Pensions will not re-test the entitlement of those reaching State Pension age before 6 April 2014. The Government is forced by EU rules to pay certain benefits even if the recipients eventually move abroad. In addition, Britain has reciprocal arrangements with other countries, including the U.S. and Jamaica, to keep up expatriates’ handouts. It emerged last month that expat . pensioners receive £13.4million a year in winter fuel payments – even . though many live in sunnier climes where they seldom need to turn on the . heating. Exemptions: Iain Duncan Smith has decided not to re-test the entitlement of those over 60 . But the cost of incapacity payments going abroad dwarfs that of winter fuel payments – costing up to £49million last year. And even though some of the remaining 5,800 expat claimants will be reassessed, ministers will have to rely on foreign GPs to carry out the assessments, raising questions over whether they will be as thorough as the independent doctors hired by the DWP to carry out the assessments in Britain. The highest rate of incapacity benefit is £94.25, meaning that up to £940,000 is going abroad every week to claimants. If the allowance was initially claimed in Britain, anyone is entitled to continue claiming after moving to any of 30 European countries or their overseas territories. Under European law, benefits acquired in one member state must be paid to those who move to another. The deal also includes Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Switzerland – none of which is in the EU. The UK also has reciprocal arrangements with some non-European countries. Tory backbencher Priti Patel said: ‘These figures are deeply alarming. Huge sums of public money are going to people unjustifiably, and it is all down to EU regulations. ‘British doctors will be strict in reassessing claimants, but we need an assurance that doctors in other countries will be just as strict.’ Emma Boon, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is ridiculous that EU rules prevent our government from making our own choices about whether to give benefits to those who have moved away.’ Assessments: IB claimants in the UK face stringent new tests to see whether they are eligible to continue claiming. (Picture posed by models) 'Deeply alarming': Tory backbench MPs Priti Patel and Philip Davies both say the issue of expatriates claiming incapacity benefits must be tackled . A spokesman for the DWP said those who are genuinely too disabled or ill to work are entitled to the new Employment Support Allowance under EU rules. If someone from the UK now living abroad has paid enough in National Insurance contributions, he or she can receive contribution-based ESA subject to the same checks as someone living in the UK. He said: ‘Incapacity Benefit is an outdated benefit which is now closed to new claimants. We are currently reassessing everyone of working age on IB, whether they live in Great Britain or abroad. ‘People from the UK living abroad will only be entitled to ESA if they have paid sufficient National Insurance contributions. If they are found to be fit for work they will have their benefits stopped.’ He said those emigrants on Incapacity Benefit will be reassessed for ESA using exactly the same criteria as those in Britain. The DWP estimates that there are around 10,000 on IB abroad, the majority in Europe with many in Spain and Ireland. About 5,800 living overseas are expected to be reassessed for ESA between February 2011 and April 2014. As in the UK, those who are approaching 60 or more will not be reassessed because they are deemed to be too old to seek work. UK-based sickness benefit recipients will be assessed by DWP-approved doctors. But the DWP will have to rely on foreign GPs to carry out assessments for those based abroad. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I applaud the Government for getting to grips with Incapacity Benefit. But we mustn’t allow people to escape having to be reassessed by moving abroad.’ * In an earlier version of this article we said the Department for Work and Pensions would not re-test those over 60. In fact, the reviews will not affect those people due to reach State Pension age before 6 April 2014.","4,000 can continue to claim until retirement .

"A picture of a man dressed in a sinister clown costume taken from a Facebook page called 'Spot the Burnley Clown' which has sparked panic after social media users falsely claimed he was terrorising the area . Police have been bombarded with frantic calls from the public after a Facebook site about a mystery clown sparked panic across four towns and villages. The page called 'Spot the Burnley Clown' was set up to detail the movements of its creator as he paraded around areas of the Lancashire town dressed in an orange wig, painted face and fancy dress clothing. But despite there being no sightings of the clown in the flesh, the page sparked frenzied gossip on the social media network with stories falsely claiming the joker was armed with a baseball bat was hiding in bushes ready to mug people. The exaggerated stories spread panic across Burnley and the nearby towns of Blackburn and Clitheroe plus the village of Sabden. Fearing a madman was on the loose like Pennywise, the killer clown from the Stephen King horror TV series It, dozens of calls were made to Lancashire police to alert them. Teachers at primary schools were understood to have contacted police after concerned parents said their children were being frightened by reports. Twitter users claimed the clown had been knocking on windows and mugging people, but police said no sightings had been reported since the rumours surfaced. Officers said reports had been made from 'well meaning' people but said most were as a result of 'third hand' information. The fear of clowns is known as coulrophobia which adults and children can suffer from. Today, . Lancashire Police said: 'Over the last couple days, police have . received a number of calls from concerned members of the public in . Burnley and the surrounding areas with regards to a man dressed as a . clown reportedly in possession of a baseball bat. No sightings: These pictures were also posted on the Facebook page, but it is unclear whether they are of the same man.  Police they are not taking any action because the reports are based on 'third-hand information' 'The calls have come as a result of various postings on Facebook as well as a dedicated page Spot the Burnley Clown, with comments becoming more and more exaggerated. 'We would like to reassure people that there is no foundation for any of these reports and we have had no first-hand reports of any incidents of violence or intimidation. 'We would urge people to only report first-hand instances of suspicious behaviour and try to avoid repeating gossip and third hand information. 'When people start to talk about incidents like this on social media, without any malicious intent, stories can become confused and sometimes exaggerated and people should bear this in mind.' Dozens of calls were made to Lancashire police over fears a madman was on the loose like Pennywise (above), the killer clown from the Stephen King horror TV series It . The Facebook page has a series of posts from a man claiming to be the clown. One read: 'I am sorry to everyone I scared tonight. I will keep my clownings to the parks from now on. Now i have to go to bed but I hope you all have a clowning good day tomorrow.' But he followed that up with: 'Will everyone stop being mean. I am a friend clown not a bad clown that is why I hide in bushes and behind trees where you least expect so I dont scare anyone.' His last message read: 'Am home now. I cleaned some peoples windows but they said to go away but I said I am a clown here to help everyone needs a clown in their life. 'Now I am at home maybe I will go out again later. I am your local neighbourhood friendly clown woof woof.' But one Facebook poster said: 'He’s one sad person who needs to grow up.' Another said: Omg this is well bad! Paedophiles will be doing this to lure kids in. Sick - you should be ashamed.' But another replied saying: 'Keep up the good work clown. If I see you about I’ll get you a custard pie.' Inspector Zeg Awan of Lancashire Police said: 'We are not treating it with a degree of importance. 'When it comes down to it, there have been no reported concerns about violence.

"Former figure skater Johnny Weir has announced that he and his husband Victor Voronov have broken up after two years of marriage. The Olympics commentator, 29, revealed the split on Twitter on Wednesday, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' The couple, who were married two years ago, parted ways after Weir's packed schedule meant he was too busy to spend time or take a vacation with his attorney husband, TMZ Sports reported. Divorcing: Johnny Weir (right) has broken up with husband Victor Voronov (left). The former ice-skating champion announced the split Wednesday on Twitter . Violence at home: The couple appeared together earlier this month to get a domestic dispute case dismissed. Voronov accused Weir of biting him about a month before the Olympics . Voronov had supported his husband's . career, according to the site, but they had only seen each other two or . three times in the past month and their plans for a holiday were repeatedly stalled. Their relationship also ran into trouble recently when Voronov accused Weir of biting him in a police report. But . the couple put on a united front when they convinced a New Jersey judge . to throw out the domestic dispute case earlier this month. The former figure skater, whose commentary during Sochi established him as one of its biggest stars, appeared to still be with Voronov when they attended Lyndhurst Municipal Court on March 4 to get the case dismissed. Voronov, a lawyer, filed a police report about a month before the Olympics claiming the former ice skating champion had bit him, a source told RadarOnline. The pair put . on a united front, with Voronov placing his hand on his husband's knee . and whispering into his ear, the website reported. Happier times: Weir and Voronov got married on New Year's Eve 2011, shortly after the former figure skater came out as gay . Weir, dressed in an unusually somber black outfit, caught the attention of the judge, who commented 'Nice hairdo!' as he approached the bench. The couple asked the Lyndhurst Municipal Court judge to dismiss the case, and it was granted. Leaving the court, Weir told Radar: 'It is a private matter I do not wish to discuss.' Police and court officials declined to reveal further details because it is a domestic dispute case. Weir officially came out as . gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay . suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate. Stars of Sochi: Weir and fellow skater Tara Lipinski were applauded for their colorful commentary in Sochi . Popular: Weir scored fans with his quirky wardrobe, left, and an invitation with Lipinksi to the Oscars, right . Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told .

He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. 'He's . wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my . razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually . do.' But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'

"Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard appears to have shrugged off the row about the Liberal Party's insulting menu, as she is pictured at a breakfast meeting with action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger. Miss Gillard and the former Californian Governor have teamed up to write a joint opinion piece to urge global action on climate change. The British-born prime minster has week- this morning she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay. Unlikely allies: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard meets Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss an article they both wrote urging global action on climate change . Miss Gillard appeared relaxed and undaunted sharing a light breakfast with Hollywood legend Schawarzenegger as the unlikely pair collaborated on their article. The joint piece, which has been published in News Limited newspapers, draws on the similarities between California and Australia. The article reads: 'California and Australia have a lot in common - climate change threatens our fragile environments and aggravates serious bushfires, droughts and floods, which put our important agricultural industries at risk. 'Because of these similar challenges, even though we are leaders from different sides of the political spectrum, we strongly agree on two fundamental ideas - that taking action on climate change can no longer be delayed and that such actions can succeed beyond partisan politics.' In a vulgar incident earlier this week it . emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail', . described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'. Today Miss Gillard, who has attacked the Liberal Party for what she said was their sexist attitude to women, was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay. Questions: Miss Gillard Was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a hairdresser . Appearing on a radio show in Perth, Western Australia, 51-year-old Miss Gillard was asked outright if Mr Mathieson, 56, was gay because he was a hairdresser. 'That's absurd,' Miss Gillard told interviewer Howard Sattler on radio 6PR when he said he wanted to ask her about Mr Mathieson's sexuality. But the interviewer was not going to drop the subject, after earlier asking the Labour leader about the sexist menu. 'But you hear it,' said Mr Sattler, quoting what people were saying: 'He must be gay, he's a hairdresser.' 'Deeply shocked': Australian Prime minister Julia Gillard was likened to a quail with 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box' on a menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party . Miss Gillard made it clear that she was not going to be drawn in to the rumours Mr Sattler said were being bandied about. 'I mean, Howard, I don't know if every silly thing that gets said is going to be repeated to me now,' she said. To all the hairdressers out there, including the men who are listening, I don't think in life one can actually look at a whole profession full of different human beings and say ""Gee, we know something about every one of those human beings.""' Mr Sattler reminded the Prime Minister that he had been promised a candid interview with her, asking: 'You can confirm that he's not (gay)?' 'Oh Howard, don't be ridiculous, of course he not,' said the British-born Prime Minister. 'But you're in a heterosexual relationship?' he pressed. 'That's all I'm asking.' She replied: 'Howard, let me just bring you back to earth - you and I have just talked about me and Tim living at the lodge. We live there together as a couple, you know that.' The astonishing interview had begun with Mr Sattler telling Miss Gillard that she had been the butt of rumours and snide jokes many times, to which she she said that was probably right. When he asked if he could test a few out and she asked in what way, he said: 'Tim's gay.' After telling the radio host that the suggestion was ridiculous she said: 'Yes, on the internet, you know, there are lots of, you know, what I've referred to in the past as nutjobs and I'm happy to use the expression again - people who peddle and circulate vile and offensive things.' Bloggers later pointed out that the questions had put Miss Gillard off guard - she told Mr Sattler that the general election was on September 12 when it is actually being held on September 14. Mr Mathieson is divorced with four adult children, three born during his marriage and one who he fathered in his late teens. He began dating Miss Gillard in 2006 and has been her partner ever since. Bad taste: The Liberals have apologised for the reference to Miss Gillard on the fundraiser menu (above) Furious: Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (right), who was also . targeted in the menu, described the stunt as a 'snide, dirty and sexist . trick' Political observers said the dinner . menu's contents had blunted the Liberal Party's attack on Miss Gillard's . campaign to warn about about the threat of male dominance in government . if the Liberals won the election, as the opinion polls are suggesting. The dinner menu made its unsubtle attack on British-born Miss Gillard under the title of Moroccan Quail. Liberal leader Tony Abbott was also quick to condemn the menu, calling it 'tawdry'. 'I think we should all be bigger and better than that,' he said. Today Miss Gillard to have put the incident behind her appearing relaxed and undaunted as she met with Hollywood legend Schawarzenegger to collaborated on an article. In 2006 as governor of California Schwarzenegger making it the first US state to impose limits on global warming gases. One of Gillard's key policies since taking office has been the introduction of a carbon pollution tax. The article emphasised the importance of carbon pricing in lowering emissions to less damaging levels and reducing climate change. It read: 'This means we need to put a meaningful, global price on carbon pollution now. 'What the Industrial Revolution and the Information Technology Revolution have shown is that the people in regions which lead these transformations prosper the most and the soonest.

"A terrorist group who kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria has slaughtered hundreds of people after storming a town in the north of the country. Boko Haram are said to have gunned down groups of unarmed civilians and set fire to a number of buildings, including a police station, during the rampage in the lawless Borno State. The atrocity emerged as Britain announced it was sending a team of team of experts to join the hunt for the missing schoolgirls. Scroll down for video . Demonstration: Women protest outside Nigeria's parliament in Abuja, trying to prompt officials to bring back the schoolgirls abducted by Islamist militants, Boko Haram . Anger: Another woman holds a placard at a demonstration in Lagos, Nigeria, pleading for the return of the kidnapped children . Downing Street revealed British security experts would be joining teams from France and the US in trying to find the girls. The team has been drawn from Whitehall departments including Defence, International Development and the Foreign Office. It is likely to include military officers but will concentrate on planning, co-ordination and advice to local authorities, rather than getting involved in operations on the ground to free the girls. In the Commons, David Cameron condemned the kidnapping as 'pure evil'. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions he said: 'I'm the father of two young daughters and my reaction is the same as every father or mother in this land or the world. 'This is an act of pure evil, it has united people across the planet to stand with Nigeria to help find these children and return them to their parents.' 'The Foreign Secretary and the British Government have made repeated offers of help to the Nigerian government since the girls were seized. Earlier a local politician described how 'hoodlums' arrived in armoured cars and threw explosives throughout the deadly 12-hour attack on Gamboru Ngala. They are also said to have burnt 17 trailers loaded with cows and grain in a public market. The attack happened after security personnel deployed in the town were moved to another area as part of the operation to find the abducted schoolgirls, according to the International Business Times. A witness described how dead bodies were littered around the town while most of the buildings were destroyed. Many residents were asleep in their houses at the time of the ambush. Last month 273 schoolgirls aged between 12 and 16 were abducted from their boarding school in the town of Chibok. The militant group were said to have taken the girls away in trucks after they were called back to sit an exam, but about 50 pupils managed to escape. It has also emerged that the group had . kidnapped another 11 girls from the village of Warabe in Borno yesterday, . increasing the international pressure for the extremist group to be stopped and the girls returned. Nigerian Police are now offering a £300,000 reward to anyone who can help them find the missing children. Militant: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, vows to sell the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in northern Nigeria for as little as £7 during a video message . Explosion: The group have been behind a number of deadly attacks, including the bombing of Nyanya bus station in Abuja last week . Boko Haram translates into English as 'Western education is sinful'. They heavily oppose the Westernisation of Nigeria and want to impose Sharia law. Violence linked to the group and their insurgency is said to have led to an estimated 10,000 deaths between 2002 and 2013. Their recent attacks include a car bomb that killed 19 people and two bus blasts which caused 70 fatalities in the capital Abuja. On March 16, 100 people in villages across the country were killed in a series of gun attacks. The militants are currently led by Abubakr Shekau. He is known for targeting Christians as well as politicians who oppose the Islamisation of Nigeria. Shekau is the most wanted man in Nigeria. The US has offered a reward of £7m for information about his whereabouts. Hundreds have been killed in a crackdown on the group by Nigerian Police, including the group's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, who died in custody. Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram said he would sell the remaining captives as slaves for as little as £7. In a video, Shekau declares: 'I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.' With outrage growing over the failure to rescue the girls, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the country’s largest city Lagos last week to protest at their government’s inability to find the victims. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said . security forces are doing all they can to find the girls . It has been reported that his government is in negotiations . with the terrorists who are demanding an unspecified ransom for the . students' release. The White House has branded the kidnapping an . ‘outrage and tragedy’. The State Department said the US are sending a . ‘co-ordination cell’ including military personnel and law experts to . Nigeria. Pledging his support, President Obama said: 'We're going to do everything we can to provide assistance to them. 'In the short term our goal is obviously to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies.' British Special Forces have also been put on standby after Foreign Secretary William Hague described the abduction as 'disgusting and immoral'. Military chiefs in London are . considering sending in the Special Air Service and the Special Boat . Service to help search for the schoolgirls. However, Mr Hague has become frustrated with the situation, after he first offered his assistance nearly three weeks ago. He told Sky News: 'It's difficult of course because this is primarily a matter for Nigeria and Britain can't just walk in there... and do as we like. 'It's very frustrating when the world can't act to deal with these things promptly because the trail goes cold of course after several weeks.' A social media campaign to raise awareness globally about the kidnapping is gaining momentum with celebrities including Mary J Blige adding their support. The mass kidnapping occurred the same day . as a bomb blast, also blamed on Boko Haram, that killed 75 people on the . edge of Abuja and marked the first attack on the capital in two years. The . militants repeated that bomb attack more than two weeks later in almost . exactly the same spot, killing 19 people and wounding 34 in the suburb . of Nyanya.

"Bad cop ... but best dad? An Illinois police officer is currently under investigation for allegedly going outside his jurisdiction and using his emergency lights to pull over a school bus - all because his teenage son forgot his lunch. The curious traffic stop occurred about 7am Tuesday in Johnsburg, McHenry County. Lt. Brian Keller was in an unmarked black Dodge Charger at the time. Investigation: Cop Brian Keller used his unmarked black Dodge Charger to stop a bus and deliver his son's lunch in Johnsburg, Illinois, on Tuesday morning . He pulled over the bus about nine miles from Marion Central Catholic High School in Woodstock. The bus was transporting high school students at the time. Keller is said to have gotten out of his vehicle and onto the bus, given his son lunch, and then told the bus it could carry on. The traffic stop appears to have startled the driver of the bus, who filed a police complaint over the incident. 'The apparent purpose of the stop was to issue his son his lunch for the day,' the complaint read, according to The Chicago Tribune. 'The complainant was advised that documentation would be made, however, she needed to contact (the Lake County Sheriff’s Office) regarding the incident.' Lake County Undersheriff Raymond Rose said the complaint was currently under investigation. 'We received information regarding allegations of inappropriate actions by Lt. Brian Keller,' Rose told the Tribune. 'As a result of that, Sheriff (Mark) Curran and I have ordered an internal investigation into the allegations.' Keller is a former chief at the Lake County sheriff's department. However he recently transferred to a new position as a lieutenant working in court security.","Lt.

"Scientists have revealed a new species of horned dinosaur with a bizarre set of 'wings' on its head. Mercuriceratops gemini was approximately 6 meters (20 feet) long and weighed more than 2 tonnes. It lived about 77 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous Period. Scroll down for video . An artist reconstruction of Mercuriceratops gemini, a new species of horned dinosaur that had wing-like ornamentation on the sides of its skull. Mercuriceratops had a parrot-like beak and probably had two long brow horns above its eyes. It was a plant-eating dinosaur. It reached 6 meters (20 feet) long and weighed more than 2 tons. It lived about 77 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous Period. Each animal has a slightly different 'frill' so they could identify each other. Research describing the new species is published online in the journal Naturwissenschaften, and is based on fossils collected from Montana in the United States and Alberta, Canada. Mercuriceratops (Mercuri + ceratops) means 'Mercury horned-face,' referring to the wing-like ornamentation on its head that resembles the wings on the helmet of the Roman god, Mercury. The name “gemini” refers to the almost identical twin specimens found in north central Montana and the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Dinosaur Provincial Park, in Alberta, Canada. Mercuriceratops had a parrot-like beak and probably had two long brow horns above its eyes. It was a plant-eating dinosaur. Map indicating locations where Mercuriceratops gemini skull fossils were discovered. The name 'gemini' refers to the almost identical twin specimens found in north central Montana and the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Dinosaur Provincial Park, in Alberta, Canada. 'Mercuriceratops took a unique evolutionary path that shaped the large frill on the back of its skull into protruding wings like the decorative fins on classic 1950s cars. 'It definitively would have stood out from the herd during the Late Cretaceous,' said lead author Dr. Michael Ryan, curator of vertebrate paleontology at The Cleveland Museum of Natural History. 'Horned dinosaurs in North America used their elaborate skull ornamentation to identify each other and to attract mates—not just for protection from predators. 'The wing-like protrusions on the sides of its frill may have offered male Mercuriceratops a competitive advantage in attracting mates.' 'The butterfly-shaped frill, or neck shield, of Mercuriceratops is unlike anything we have seen before,' said co-author Dr. David Evans, curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the Royal Ontario Museum. 'Mercuriceratops shows that evolution gave rise to much greater variation in horned dinosaur headgear than we had previously suspected.' Quarry in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada, where the Mercuriceratops gemini skull fossils were discovered . The new dinosaur is described from skull fragments from two individuals collected from the Judith River Formation of Montana and the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta.

'Susan showed me her specimen during one of my trips to Alberta,' said Ryan. 'I instantly recognized it as being from the same type of dinosaur that the Royal Ontario Museum had from Montana.' 'This discovery of a previously unknown species in relatively well-studied rocks underscores that we still have many more new species of dinosaurs to left to find,' said co-author Dr. Mark Loewen, research associate at the Natural History Museum of Utah.

"It's a craze that's been blamed squarely on the internet - but as these 100-year-old photos reveal, cat owners have been dressing up their pets since long before the age of the blog. The surreal catalogue shows kittens in dungarees, silly paper hats, bonnets, bow ties and dresses, and has been revealed as part of a landmark archive of 12 million out-of-copyright images which are being placed online by a single academic. Kalev Leetaru, a Fellow at Georgetown University in Washington D.C., hopes his vast collection on the photo-sharing site Flickr will become a landmark new resource for history-lovers around the world. Scroll down for video . Get your paws on some history: As these images from 1911 show, dressing up cats in silly costumes is a craze which long predates the age of the blog. The photos from Kittens and Cats: A Book of Tales by Eulalie Osgood Grover are part of a vast collection of out-of-copyright images which have been uploaded to Flickr by an academic . Tea time: The text before this image reads: 'I wish someone would hurry and bring me some milk. Mine is all gone and so is my mouse. I wonder if this is all we are going to have to eat. I am so hungry I shall have to go home and catch a rat. The Queen is asking some one to tell a story. I believe she means me. Yes, dear Queen, I will' Mew wardrobe: The surreal photos feature cats dressed up in dungarees, overalls and dotty bow ties. The book is just one of thousands uploaded to Flickr . The cat images were drawn from a 1911 collection called Kittens and Cats: A Book of Tales by Eulalie Osgood Grover, a U.S. children's author who sold millions of books in the first half of the 20th Century. The book is just one among 600 million library book pages which have been scanned for uploading to the archive by Mr Leetaru - and the range is astounding. The images stretch from 1500 to 1922, when copyright laws kicked in, and range from colourful depictions of Queen Victoria's spectacular coronation parade to intricate pen-and-ink drawings of human anatomy and mosquitoes. There is a disastrously inaccurate drawing of a dodo made by a Dutch researcher long after the animal became extinct, along with a rather chilling map of how the then-fading British Empire would be turned into Greater Britain including Australia and Canada. Other images show the beginnings of Britain's railway history from the London Underground to Manchester, the Blackpool seafront and an early layout for the New York subway. Going for a ride: The cats are in surreal situations - though the collection also includes intricate drawings of human anatomy and a hair-raising sketch of a mosquito . Picture purrfect: As with humans, much of the expression comes from the eyes, but having a bizarre array of hats and bonnets probably doesn't do any harm . Strike a pose: Despite his archive containing three million images so far, Mr Leetaru couldn't help admitting the cat images were among his favourites in the collection . Long before the digging of the Channel Tunnel there were books discussing how it would be possible, and charts showed off the dramatic spread of Alexander Graham Bell's telephone throughout the United States. Mr Leetaru carried out the incredible trawl in his spare time without a penny of funding. It was made possible by writing software which took out-of-copyright books which had already been uploaded to the internet, stripping out their images and adding keywords and context to make the archive searchable. Almost three million images have been uploaded so far, and by the time the project is finished there are expected to be 12 million. Despite the huge wealth of historical images, he couldn't help admitting that the cat pictures were among his favourites. He told MailOnline: 'I came up with the project last fall, and ran a pilot of the project across all 600 million pages earlier this year, but with small-resolution images, just to see what it would produce. Husband and wife? Many of the cats are dressed up in intricate costumes, their size suggesting they may have been painstakingly custom-designed . Shut-eye: In one case, a cat is pictured in a tiny bed. The researcher said: 'The project was entirely unfunded and there was no huge team, just me, and I did it entirely in what little spare time I had. So, its a perfect example of what's possible today from purely volunteer and personal projects in the era of ""big data""!' The researcher added: ''I wanted to be able to search for images matching a certain keyword, to be able to trace imagery through time. For example, to see the imagery of the ""telephone"" change over the decades as it changed from being the realm of male businessmen at work to the whole family at home' Mystery: What makes the online Flickr archive so curious is that many of the photos come with only cryptic descriptions, leaving the viewer guessing as to their origins . Modern day: Cat memes were thought to have started online like these two felines who have made waves on social media posing for dinner (left) and wearing a fez (right) 'The results were so stunning that I then went back and created the final full-resolution version you see today. 'The project was entirely unfunded and there was no huge team, just me, and I did it entirely in what little spare time I had. So, its a perfect example of what's possible today from purely volunteer and personal projects in the era of ""big data""!' He added: 'I wanted to be able to search for images matching a certain keyword, to be able to trace imagery through time. For example, to see the imagery of the ""telephone"" change over the decades as it changed from being the realm of male businessmen at work to the whole family at home. 'I realised there were so many books that had been digitised about the telephone, but there was simply no way to just see a collage of all of their images. So, this project was born. 'For the vast majority of the images you see in books, there isn't some original copy hanging in a museum somewhere - the printed copy of that image you see in that book is likely the only copy surviving of that image. So, in a way this is also sort of an art project, creating the world's ultimate online art museum!' Fascinating: The archive on Flickr will eventually number 12 million images and contains several gems. This chart was printed in the Bell telephone magazine in 1922 . Intricate: In the days before photography there are well-studied drawings of everything from the growth of the telephone in 1922 (left) to a human head in 1905 (right) Needs work: The description of this drawing of a dodo from an 1848 book remarked on how inaccurate it was, resembling the animal as much as it did a fighting cock . Hair-raising: This mosquito comes from the 1867 book Hardwicke's science-gossip: an illustrated medium of interchange and gossip for students and lovers of nature . Explaining his software, he added: 'It actually is quite simple, which is what makes the project so amazing. 'It relies on the fact that when a book undergoes Optical Character Recognition to make it searchable, that software automatically identifies all of the images in the book so that it won't look there for text. 'Historically that information is just discarded, but in this case my tool goes back and uses that information to extract all of those images. 'It amazes me that people have been digitising books and OCR'ing them for decades and no-one had ever thought to use that discarded information to extract and catalogue the images. 'I'm going to be releasing the software and other technical instructions for other libraries to use in the next few weeks.' You can browse the archive yourself by using the search tool on Flickr.

"Beatles fans with very deep pockets are being given the chance to own the house where John Lennon wrote some of the band's most famous songs. The beautiful mock Tudor mansion in Weybridge, Surrey, was home to Lennon and his first wife Cynthia between 1964 and 1968. The 1920s era estate boasts six bedrooms, a swimming pool, 1.5 acres of well-manicured, landscaped garden and a £15 million price-tag. Kenwood: John Lennon's former home in Weybridge, Surrey . Sprawling: The estate boasts 1.5 acres of 'well-manicured, landscaped gardens' Good neighbourhood: Kenwood was a stone's throw from Ringo Starr and George's Harrison's country piles . The property, named Kenwood, is described by estate agents Knight Frank as a 'luxuriously finished family home'. Happy couple: John Lennon with his first wife Cynthia, with whom he bought Kenwood . Originally called the Brown House, it . was designed by architect T.A. Allen, and built in 1913 by local . builders, Love & Sons. It was re-named former owner by Ken Wood, founder of the famous . food mixer company, when he owned the property. John Lennon bought the house for £20,000 on July 15th, 1964, on the advice of The Beatles’ accountants, Dr. Walter Strach, and James Isherwood. Cliff Richard and . Tom Jones had earlier bought homes on the St George’s Hill estate. It's also close to Sunny Heights, . the former home of Ringo Starr, and a short drive from Kinfauns, George . Harrison’s former home in Esher. During his time there, Lennon wrote a number of tracks for The Beatles' Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album. The house features also in scenes from a home movie which featured in the film Imagine: John Lennon. According to music legend, the rock icon spent . several days in the house taking drug LSD before proclaiming himself the . reincarnation of Jesus Christ to the rest of the Beatles. Lennon met Yoko Ono while living at Kenwood, which contributed to the downfall of his marriage to Cynthia. It's has been claimed Cynthia returned from a holiday to Greece and . discovered her husband and Ono in a compromising position and under the . influence of drugs. Luxurious: The indoor pool is a more recent addition. In Lennon's time the swimming pool was outdoors . Bargain: Lennon bought the house for £20,000 and sold it for £40,000 . One of six bedrooms: Lennon's first wife Cynthia caught him at the house in a compromising position with Yoko Ono . Though he reportedly regarded Kenwood as a 'stop-over' on the way to something better, Lennon spent twice the original . £20,000 purchase price on renovations, reducing its 22 rooms to 17, . landscaping the grounds and building an outdoor swimming pool. Much of the initial decoration was . left to interior designer Kenneth Partridge, whom Lennon employed after . being impressed by his design work at a lavish party held by Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein to celebrate the Beatles’ departure for their . first tour of the USA. However, when Partridge had completed . his work, Lennon and then-wife Cynthia immediately made a number of . further alterations and Cynthia’s mother was given an allowance to fill . the shelves of the house with antiques and antiquarian books, and a . heavy sliding wooden door was installed at the gate entrance to keep out . fans. On camera: Kenwood features in scenes from a home movie which appeared in the film Imagine: John Lennon . All in the name: The house was named Kenwood by a former owner, the founder of the Kenwood food mixer company . Kenwood has three floors and on the . ground floor during the Lennon period the front door opened on to an . entrance hall, where he placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. The . sun room was filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a . Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to . mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbituates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or . chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a . present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (nee Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level . kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex . that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use. Drugs: Lennon reportedly spent several days in the house taking drug LSD before proclaiming himself the reincarnation of Jesus Christ to the rest of the Beatles . Rising prices: The house has changed hands several times since lennon sold it. It was last sold in 2007 for £5.8 million . The house had six bedrooms, with five on the first floor. The giant master bedroom featured a huge double bed, white carpets and an en-suite bathroom complete with sunken bathtub, shower, Jacuzzi and ‘his and hers’ wash basins. Lennon wanted the guest bedrooms to contain works of art by students of the Liverpool Art College. In particular, two drawings by former Beatles’ bassist Stuart Sutcliffe were hung, for what Lennon described as 'sentimental reasons'. The first floor also had a study. On the top floor was the attic, which Lennon claimed as his own, painting the ceiling one bright colour, then changing to another when the paint ran out, and installing most of his musical equipment there. Lennon moved out of the house after his split from Cynthia and it was sold for £40,000 to Bill Martin, writer of songs such as 'Puppet on a String' and 'Congratulations'. It’s changed hands several times since then, and last went on the market, with an asking price of £5.95 million, in 2006 and was sold in January 2007 for £5.8 million.","Lennon lived in Weybridge, Surrey mansion between 1964 and 1968 .

"Maria Sharapova recovered from a slow start to defeat fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko and reach the second round of the US Open. It was a potentially tough draw for Sharapova given Kirilenko was ranked in the top 10 last year before injury problems struck. She did not play for the first three months of this season and has won only two matches all year, tumbling to 113th in the rankings. Comfortably through: Maria Sharapova waves to the fans after defeating fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko 6-4 6-0 in the first round of the US Open in New York . Momentum: Sharapova took 10 games in succession against her opponent to ensure the victory . Power play: French Open champion Sharapova returns to Kirilenko during the match at Arthur Ashe Stadium . But for six games Kirilenko more than matched Sharapova, breaking the fifth seed's serve for 3-2 and then holding her own. Kirilenko was the last player to beat Sharapova in the opening round of a grand slam at the Australian Open in 2010. She was quickly pegged back this time, though, Sharapova recovering to 4-4 and then breaking serve again to take the opening set. Try as hard as she might, Kirilenko simply could not stem the run of games against her and by the end of a 6-4 6-0 victory, Sharapova had racked up 10 in a row. Struggles: Kirilenko required lengthy treatment to her left ankle during the match . Freefall: Kirilenko, in the top 10 last year, has suffered injury problems and is now ranked No 113 . To compound Kirilenko's misery, she also needed lengthy treatment to her left ankle. The pair, who are both 27, have known each other since they were juniors and Sharapova said: 'It's always tough. 'I played a tough opponent who is capable of playing really good tennis so it was a tough first round for me. I'm happy I stepped it up and I was able to finish really strong. 'She's been injured throughout the year so it's great to see her out here competing.' Next up: Sharapova will take on Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru in the second round . Sharapova missed the US Open last year because of a shoulder injury and was thrilled to be back under the lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium. 'It was tough missing this court last year,' she said.

"At a Nashville detention center with a long history of violence, escape attempts and sexual-abuse allegations, more than two dozen teens broke out of a common area and created a large disturbance in the yard Wednesday night, roaming the area with sticks and spraying a fire extinguisher. Officials said two staff members suffered minor injuries at Woodland Hills Youth Development Center, where just two days earlier, 32 teens escaped after finding a weak spot in the fence surrounding the yard. Six remained at large Thursday. On Wednesday night, about 28 teens - some of whom were part of the initial breakout - kicked out metal panels underneath the windows in a common area to reach the yard. This time, police formed a ring around the center's perimeter fence to try to prevent another escape. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Second breakout: Teens can be seen roaming the facility holding sticks and metal bars on Wednesday . Anarchy: Staff member is attacked by one of the teenage inmates of Woodland Hills Youth Development Center . Troubled: An escaped inmate sprays a fire extinguisher late Wednesday night after 28 teenagers escaped from a youth detention facility . Video shot by Nashville station WTVF showed teens chasing and assaulting a man who appeared to be a staff member. Photos in The Tennessean newspaper showed teens in the detention center yard carrying sticks. One showed someone spraying a fire extinguisher. Others were spotted on the roof of the facility throwing rocks. The second violent escape attempt in a week began late Wednesday night. The teens got out of their dorm rooms and were roaming the facility, reports WFTV. Two staff members suffered minor injuries in the uprising. It wasn't until SWAT teams and helicopters descended on the facility that the teenagers were brought under control. None of them managed to breach the perimeter fence. Ten ringleaders were identified and brought to another detention center, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson said. The rest were returned to their dorms. Some of the teenagers involved in Wednesday's escape were also a part of Monday's breakout. This week's incidents are the latest in a string of troubles for the facility, where most of the 14- to 19-year-olds have committed at least three felonies. The center saw a spike in assaults in 2012 after the state placed older teenagers there from a shuttered facility in eastern Tennessee. Between July and September that year, police had to be called at least 47 times for assistance, which surpassed total police visits for the previous two years combined. Ringleaders: A group of boys got out of their rooms, armed themselves with bats and sticks and freed others . Apprehended: Teenagers are escorted to an awaiting Tennessee Department of Correction bus in custody after the riot . Quelled: Police in SWAT gear formed a ring around the perimeter fence to prevent any of the teens escaping before they were brought under control and apprehended . Among the acts of violence listed in police records is a guard trapped in a headlock and repeatedly punched by a young man. Another assault involved four youths ambushing a staff member and beating him until he was rescued by colleagues. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice ranked Woodland Hills as 13th in the country among juvenile facilities with reports of sexual abuse by staffers. In a 2004 breakout attempt, more than a dozen teens armed with broom handles and hurling bricks injured 16 staffers before they were dispersed by police in riot gear. On Monday night, 32 teens 'overwhelmed' their minders at the center by simultaneously breaking out of four dormitories and then crawling under a weak spot in a chain-link fence. By Thursday morning, six were still on the run. Police caught up with some walking along roads or coming out of the woods. Some turned themselves in, including one at the guard shack Tuesday evening. And some were swiftly returned to the detention center by their own families for their own good. 'He broke loose, he was gone, but he's back now,' said LaWanda Knowles, whose nephew joined the escape. 'I just want to know that he's here safely and he's OK - I don't want the police jumping on him, nobody beating on him or nothing.' The teens left their rooms at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center at about 11 p.m. Monday night and gathered in common areas. With just 16 unarmed adults to keep watch over 78 youths in 12 dormitories, the staff was 'overwhelmed,' said Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson. At large: Six of these eight teenagers are still on the loose after escaping from the facility Monday . Monday's breakout: One of 32 escaped teenagers, third from right, is turned in by family members after escaping from Woodland Hills Youth Development Center Tuesday, September 2 . Weak spots: A crew checks for places in the fence surrounding Woodland Hills teens may have crawled under . Returned: One of Monday's 32 escaped teenagers is taken into custody after he was turned in by family . 'Staffing was lighter during the overnight hours, so presumably they had planned for that,' Johnson said. The groups of young men kicked out metal panels under the windows of each dorm to get into the yard, and then ran around for a while before some started slipping through the chain-link fence that encircles their campus. The fence is buried 8 inches deep into the ground, but the teens found a spot where they could slip out underneath it. None of the staff were hurt, and initially they simply called other staffers for backup to help bring the teens back into the dormitories. Once they spotted the teens escaping the perimeter, they alerted police, and the Tennessee Highway Patrol joined the search. Knowles said police had come searching for her nephew around 5 a.m. at his home about 8 miles from the facility. The teen showed up about two hours later, and briefly saw his parents and family, she said. 'He wanted to see his mom, and nieces and nephews and his sisters, so he came home,' she said. 'But when we found out that he ran, I jumped in my truck and put him in there and brought him back.' On the run: Six teenagers are still on the loose after Monday night's escape from Woodland Hills . Troubled: Police were called to the facility 47 times in 2012, and there have been two escapes in three days . Once back in custody, the teens who escaped were being taken to juvenile court to face potential escape charges, officials said. Most of the 78 juvenile delinquents held at the center Monday night had committed at least three felonies, Johnson said, but the facility is more like a high school with security than an adult prison. There are no guard towers or barbed wire. The teens stay in single rooms that for their own security are locked on the outside, so that only those with keys can enter. But they can push their room doors open if they need to. They wear blue pants with white or light gray T-shirts, with no markings. The center has a school, offers vocational training and career counseling, and works to move teens to less restrictive settings, according to a state website. It holds them until their 19th birthdays. All have been charged as juveniles, not adults. The Department of Children's Services will review that longstanding policy for all three of the state's juvenile detention centers, Commissioner Jim Henry said. It's difficult for staff to maintain control when the teens can open doors to enter common areas, he said.","A second escape attempt was staged at a Nashville detention center for teens Wednesday night .

"Two private jets once owned by Elvis Presley have appeared for sale on an aviation classified website amid their owner's ongoing feud with The King's estate. Long a fixture at Elvis's Tennessee home, Graceland asked the owner of the Lisa Marie and smaller Hound Dog II in April to remove the jets by early 2015. A furor soon erupted within circles of dedicated fans accustomed to seeing the jets at Graceland for 30 years. Piece of history: Two private jets once owned by Elvis Presley have appeared for sale on an aviation classified website amid their owner's ongoing feud with The King's estate. Pictured is the larger of the planes, the Lisa Marie, a 1960 Convair 880 . Hound Dog II: The Lisa Marie's smaller companion is also for sale. It served as a backup while renovations and additions were being made to the Lisa Marie . Now, for a 'serious offer,' one deep-pocketed superfan could call the 1960 Convair 880 and  Lockheed Jetstar their own, according to sales site Controller.com. Fans enjoy touring the planes for their direct connection to Presley and his jet-setting lifestyle, a sort of touchstone to the life of the King of Rock and Roll and his family. By April of next year, the planes named Lisa Marie and Hound Dog II could be gone. Elvis Presley Enterprises, which operates the Graceland tourist attraction, has written to the planes' owners saying they should prepare to remove the jets from Graceland by next spring. Feud: The planes have appeared on an airplane classifieds site amid owner K.G. Coker's ongoing feud with the Graceland estate. Graceland announced in April that the planes would need to be moved, causing a fa uproar. Coker said that if forced to move the planes, he'd likely sell them off . Cilla responds: Graceland devotees were upset enough that Priscilla Presley was forced to respond . The planes have been a tourist attraction since the mid-1980s. They had been sold after Presley's death, and were eventually purchased by OKC Partnership in Memphis. Seen here in 1955, Presley mainly used the Lisa Marie, which he had graciously appointed to his specs, using the Hound Dog II as a back-up jet . OKC Partnership and Graceland agreed to bring the two jets to Graceland. The agreement called for OKC Partnership to receive a cut of ticket sales in return for keeping the planes there. In an April 7 letter to OKC Partnership's K.G. Coker, Elvis Presley Enterprises CEO Jack Soden says the company is exercising its option to end the agreement and asks Coker 'to make arrangements for the removal of the airplanes and the restoration of the site on or shortly after April 26, 2015.' When news of Graceland's wishes that the planes be removed broke, fan outcry was enough to force Priscilla Presley to respond. 'I see your posts about the planes,' Priscilla tweeted in early July. 'Please calm down, we're in the midst of negotiations. It's as simple as that. Thank you.' In November, New York-based Authentic Brands Group bought Elvis Presley Enterprises and the licensing and merchandising rights for Presley's music and image from CORE Media Group. As part of the deal, Joel Weinshanker, founder of the National Entertainment Collectibles Association, acquired the operating rights to Graceland, which attracts about 500,000 visitors each year. After the sale, Authentic Brands said upgrades to the tourist attraction were planned. Earlier this year, Elvis Presley Enterprises announced plans to build a 450-room hotel, theater and restaurant, with a projected opening date of August 2015. Flying limo: Named after Presley's daughter, the Lisa Marie is like a customized flying limousine, complete with a large bed, a stereo system, conference room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. It was renovated after Presley bought it from Delta Air Lines. Presley took his first flight on it in November 1975 . Fit for a King: Presley bought the Lisa Marie for $250,000 and according to its owner then put hundreds of thousands more into its renovations . Eye-catching: Lime and yellow seats are in Elvis' smaller plane, a Lockheed Jetstar named 'Hound Dog II' Their plan was approved Tuesday by the Memphis City Council. Today, Graceland visitors can buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the two airplanes. Fans climb into the airplanes for an up-close look at their interiors.

It was renovated after Presley bought it from Delta Air Lines. Presley took his first flight on it in November 1975. When Presley died on Aug. 16, 1977, Presley's pilot flew the Lisa Marie to California to pick up Presley's ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, to bring her back to Memphis. The Lisa Marie's last real flight saw Priscilla Presley and actor George Hamilton flown from California to Memphis for Presley's funeral, after which it was returned to Memphis for good . Elvis's flying limo has dozens of custom speakers among top of the line other amenities for its day. It was designed by a team that had previously designed Air Force One . Bye ya'll: The beloved plane, long seen as a glimpse tourists could take inside the King's storied inner sanctum, may wind up somewhere other than Presely's Tennessee home next April . 'Taking Care of Business': At one point, after the planes were sold following the singer's death, the Lisa Marie was owned by Raymond Zimmerman, owner of the Service Merchandise chain, according to Coker. The Hound Dog II was in the hands of Hustler head Larry Flynt for a time, Coker said .

"New technology is allowing people who are paralysed to walk again. Michael Gore, 42, suffered a serious work accident 11 years ago and damaged his spine which left him unable to walk. Yet  today he is able to get out of his chair, stand six foot two inches tall and walk across the room. This is all thanks to a lightweight robot he wears, referred to as 'electronic legs' or a 'powered exoskelton'. Michael Gore, 42, injured his spine and was left unable to walk. But thanks to new 'wearable robots' being developed, he is now able to stand up and walk on his own . Michael's model is called Indego, and is among several competing products being used and tested in U.S. rehabilitation hospitals that hold promise not only for people with spinal injuries, but also those recovering from strokes or suffering with multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. The technology is thought to be at least a year away from the market, and at two stone, the Indego is the lightest of the powered exoskeletons. It snaps together from pieces that fit into a backpack. The goal is for the user to be able to carry it on a wheelchair, put it together, strap it on and walk independently. None of the products, including the Indego, are yet approved for personal use, meaning they must be used under the supervision of a physical therapist. Michael, from North Carolina, demonstrated the device this week at the American Spinal Injury Association meeting in Chicago, and successfully negotiated a noisy, crowded hallway of medical professionals and people with spinal injuries in wheelchairs. Write caption here . When he leaned forward, the device took a first step. When he tilted from side to side, it walked. When Michael wanted to stop, he leaned back and the robotic leg braces came to a halt. Gore used forearm crutches for balance. A battery in the hip piece powers the motors in the robotic legs. 'Being able to speak eye-to-eye [with a person] is just a big emotional boost,' Gore said. 'Being able to walk up to you and say hello is not a big thing until you cannot do it.' The devices will not replace wheelchairs, which are faster. 'None of the devices are speedy enough for a paralysed person to walk across a street before the light changes,' said Arun Jayaraman of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, who is testing a number of similar devices. 'None of them have fall prevention technology either. If the person falls, they can hurt themselves badly. 'If you fall down, how do you get off a robot that is strapped into you?' The technology needs to become even lighter and have longer-lasting batteries, he said. It is hoped the devices might help prevent pressure sores from sitting too long in a wheelchair, improve heart health, develop muscle strength, lift depression and ultimately bring down medical costs by keeping healthier patients out of the hospital. Companies in Israel, New Zealand and California make competing devices, and all the products are becoming less bulky as they are refined. The Indego was invented at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and tested at the Shepherd Center, a rehabilitation hospital in Atlanta. It's unclear exactly how much the devices will cost if they become available for personal use. Some technology news media reports have said $50,000 to $75,000.","The Indego 'powered exoskeleton' can be strapped to leg but weighs 2 stone .

"Some believe they have caught a glimpse of the afterlife, others claim to have floated above their body, watching as medics save their lives. But the reality of near-death experiences may be much more prosaic. Research suggests that far from being a brush with the afterlife, they are caused by a rush of electrical activity in the dying brain. In experiments on rats whose hearts had stopped, the pattern of activity was similar to that seen when the animals were fully conscious. A mysterious surge of brain activity observed in dying rats may explain reports of near-death-experiences. Even after the animals' hearts stopped beating and no blood was reaching their brains, they appeared to show signs of conscious perception, said the scientists . However, the signals were up to eight . times stronger. The researchers said that the discovery that the brain . is highly active in the seconds after the heart stops suggests that the . phenomenon has a physical, rather than spiritual nature. It has been argued that the dying . brain is incapable of such complex activity and so near-death . experiences must have their origins in the soul. It suggests something happens at the brink of death that pushes the conscious brain to a high level of arousal, potentially triggering the visions and sensations associated with near-death experiences (NDEs). As many as a fifth of people who survive cardiac arrests report having had an other-worldly experience while being 'clinically' dead. Typically NDEs involve travelling through a tunnel towards an intense light, being separated from the body, encountering long-departed loved ones or angels and undergoing some kind of judgment of 'life review. Some emerge from NDEs as transformed individuals with a completely altered outlook on life, or a new belief in religion. But many scientists believe near-death-experiences are nothing more than hallucinations induced by the effect of the brain shutting down. As many as a fifth of people who survive cardiac arrests report having had an other-worldly experience while being 'clinically' dead. Dr Jimo Borjigin, from the University of Michigan, said the study tells us reduction of oxygen during cardiac arrest can stimulate brain activity that is characteristic of conscious processing . The new research involved recording the electrical nerve impulses of anaesthetised rats whose hearts were artificially stopped. Within 30 seconds after suffering a cardiac arrest, all the animals displayed a short-lived surge of widespread, highly synchronised brain activity. 'We were surprised by the high levels of activity,' said Dr George Mashour, one of the US researchers from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. 'In fact, at near-death many known electrical signatures of consciousness exceeded levels found in the waking state, suggesting that the brain is capable of well-organised electrical activity during the early stage of clinical death.' Near death experiences involve travelling through a tunnel towards an intense light, being separated from the body, encountering long-departed loved ones or angels . The findings are reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Previously it was assumed that brain activity ceases when the heart stops. Lead scientist Dr Jimo Borjigin, also from the University of Michigan, said: 'This study tells us that reduction of oxygen or both oxygen and glucose during cardiac arrest can stimulate brain activity that is characteristic of conscious processing.' 'It also provides the first scientific framework for the near-death experiences reported by many cardiac arrest survivors.' However, other scientists have been cautious that the study might shed light on the human condition at the moment of death. Dr Chris Chambers, Senior Research Fellow at Cardiff University, admitted it is tempting to draw a link between a surge of neural activity and consciousness but there are two barriers to doing so. 'The first is that we don't know to what extent rats experience . consciousness at all, so we don't know what the activity means. 'Second, . even if rats are conscious, to conclude from their brain activity alone . that these bursts of activity reflect consciousness would be a logical fallacy known as reverse . inference. 'To overcome these limitations we would need to run a study . in humans and relate the changes in activity to what they report about . their conscious experience.'","U.S. scientists found something happens at the brink of death .

"A 5-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of kindergarten after school officials said his hair was too long. Malachi Wilson, who is half Native American and a member of the Navajo Nation, was dismissed from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas for violating school policy that states boys can't have hair that is longer than the collar of their shirt, or wear ponytails. Many Native Americans believe that hair is scared, and cutting it is a manifestation of loss. Scroll down for video . Kicked out: 5-year-old Malachi Wilson was sent home from F. J. Young Elementary in Seminole, Texas on his first day of school because of his long hair, and told he needed to cut it to return . Heartbreaking: 'How do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in?' asked April Wilson, Malachi's mother . 'After we had enrolled him he was excited. He was ready to go. Everyday it was the question, ""Mom, [am I] going to school?""' his mother, April Wilson, told KOSA. No sooner had he arrived however, than Malachi was sent home, with an order from the school's principal, Sherrie Warren, to cut his hair if he wanted to return. Adding insult to injury, when his mother protested his dismissal, noting her son's Native American religious beliefs, Miss Wilson demanded she show proof of his heritage. Once she had provided formal proof Malachi was indeed Native American, he was allowed to return to school, but the young boy still seems hurt. 'It was a sad day,' he said of being sent home. 'It’s kind of heartbreaking because how do you explain to a 5-year-old that he’s being turned away because of what he believes in? Because of his religion, because of what’s part of him,' his mother added. 'Our hair is sacred to us.' Proof: Malachi's mother April was asked to obtain formal paperwork of her son's Navajo heritage, and bring it to the school . School policy: The Seminole Independent School District does not allow boys to have hair that goes past their collars, or wear ponytails . She said she has not ruled out filing a discrimination lawsuit against the district. School district officials say they followed procedure, and pointed out the rule in their handbook that says, 'certain recognized religious or spiritual beliefs may qualify for an exception from provisions of the dress code.' Interestingly enough, the school's mascot is a Seminole, with long hair.

"A dog named Buddy more than lived up to his moniker over the weekend, when he rescued his owner from afire. Jacob Martin was sleeping Sunday when a fire broke out in the house he was renovating next door to his home in Mansfield, Ohio. His pit-bull Buddy started barking, waking him up just in time to escape and save his own home from the spreading flames . Scroll down for video . Lifesaver: Jacob Martin nearly slept through a house fire over the weekend, but was saved when his dog Buddy barked to wake him up . Crucial: The fire broke out at a house Martin was renovating next to home he lived in. Buddy woke Martin up with enough time to escape and stop the other home from burning to the ground . Sad: Unfortunately, Martin is afraid he may not be able to keep Buddy since due to the fire and the fact he recently lost a job . 'The heat melted the door,' Martin told Fox 8 Cleveland. 'I actually burnt my hand trying to open the door.' Martin was renovating the home next door and had spent $1,500 on new additions, which were completely lost after the fire burnt the building to the ground. He did not have rental insurance. But Martin is just glad to be alive, and gives all the thanks to Buddy. 'Buddy is the best dog I ever had, great dog and good company,' he said. The dog's instinct to protect his new master is perhaps more surprising considering Martin had only adopted him a month and a half previously. Martin adopted him from a co-worker who found the dog in a home vacated by a neighbor in the middle of the night. Now Martin fears he may not be able to keep Buddy because he recently lost a job and the fire has taken a toll on his funds. Firefighters are still investigating what caused the home to become engulfed in flames, but don't believe it was intentionally started.","Jacob Martin was sleeping Sunday when a fire broke out at the house he was renovating next door .

"A super-mall and tourism complex proposed for the Grand Canyon would include fast food chains, hotels, gift shops and a gondola to take those who don’t want to hike or ride a mule to its bottom. One of the Seven Wonders of the Natural World, the Grand Canyon has a problem with bringing in cash from the millions of tourist who visit it every year. But the entrepreneurs behind the proposed Grand Canyon Escalade will give visitors greater access and ability to marvel at nature's handiwork over the past two billion or so years. Unspoiled: The Grand Canyon could soon have a mega-mall with fast food chains and hotels . Easy-access: A 1.4-mile gondola could transport 4,000 tourists to the bottom of the canyon each day . What where: Elements of the designs currently up for approval by the Navajo nation . Plans: Hotels, restaurants, retail outlets and a cultural visitor centre are among elements of the proposal . The project, currently being reviewed by Navajo tribal government, would be built on 420 acres next to what is known as the Confluence, where the Colorado and Little Colorado Rivers meet. Developer R. Lamar Whitmer also plans a cultural centre, amphitheatre and an elevated 1,900ft-long walkway along the river's edge. At present the routes down to the bottom include mule rides, hiking, rafts from other areas or helicopters for the well-heeled, but investors argue the development would bring a greater appreciation and access to the majesty of the place. Their figures claim the majority of the canyon’s five million tourists each year spending less than an hour admiring its edge before moving on – they say a 1.4-mile tramway could transport about 4,000 visitors to the bottom every day where the layer of Vishnu Schist is among the most ancient exposed rock on earth. Cultural: The developers explain the virtues of the deluxe restaurant, cultural centre and art studios . Take a stroll: Plans for the 1,900ft-long walkway along the river's edge . The proposal also says the project would bring 3,200 jobs in for the Navajo, whose greatest cultural issue is unemployment. Not surprisingly, there is fierce opposition to the plans with some opposed to any building on sacred land, the commercialising one of the world’s most iconic natural landmarks and the potential damage additional tourism could do to the park’s ecosystem. In 2007, the less ambitious Skywalk at Grand Canyon West, run by the Hualapai nation, faced a battle before they opened a controversial glass bridge that jutted out over the rim but it largely been viewed as a success and provided a financial shot in the arm for the area's caretakers.

"He is arguably England's greatest ever writer, using tens of thousands of words to craft his plays and poetry. Scholars say William Shakespeare was among the most educated men of his time, using around a quarter of those words used in the English language during his lifetime. He invented many of the words that make up his 37 plays, but for others he turned to the Latin and Greek languages for inspiration. Two booksellers in New York believe this dictionary, which dates to 1580, was once owned by the poet and playwright William Shakespeare . Experts say it will take months, if not years to assess whether the annotations adorning the book, were written by the Bard of Avon. Only six confirmed examples of his handwriting exist, making comparisons very difficult . But like many contemporary writers, experts have long believed Shakespeare turned to a reference book as a guide. Today, as the literary world marks the 450th anniversary of the Bard of Avon's birth, two booksellers from New York have revealed they may have the answer to the mystery of where he learned his vast vocabulary. George Koppelman and Daniel Wechsler say they have discovered the writer's dictionary, annotated by his own hand. For more than 50 years, experts have believed Shakespeare consulted a 1580 dictionary published in London and known as An Alvearie or Quadruple Dictionary. 'The ordinariness of the individual . annotations is, to me, precisely what argues for their authenticity' - Expert Henry Wessells . Cambridge Latin tutor John Baret was responsible for publishing the dictionary, in English, Latin, Greek and French - giving it the name Quadruple Dictionary. Many experts believe Shakespeare could have used Baret's work to craft his own. Noted Shakespearean scholar T.W. Baldwin asserts in William Shakespere’s Small Latine & Lesse Greeke: 'Baret was in effect the standard English dictionary of Shakespeare’s schooldays, and must have had powerful influence in shaping the English definitions of Shakespeare’s generation. 'But it is not likely that Shakespeare would have preserved the patterns so accurately if he had not himself turned many a time and oft to Baret for his varied synonyms.' And so, when in 2008 when a book bearing the 1580 publication date appeared on eBay, it caught the eye of Mr Koppelman. The seller's reference to 'contemporary annotations', wet his appetite to find out more. He paid $4,300 for the book, the New Yorker reported. The 450th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare is being celebrated today. The Bard was born on April 23, 1564 and died on the same day 52 years later . George Koppelman, who bought the dictionary from eBay for $4,300 in 2008, and Daniel Wechsler haver released a book Shakespeare's Beehive (pictured) charting their discovery and arguing the case for the book once being owned by Shakespeare . Once in his possession, he and Mr Wechsler studied its annotations for clues as to the author, leading them to conclude the scribbles and markings adorning the pages are indeed those of Shakespeare himself. The pair have published their own book, Shakespeare's Beehive: An Annotated Elizabethean Dictionary Comes To Light, reproducing parts of the Alvearie, while debating its authenticity. The pair said: 'Over the course of discovery, it became impossible for us to neglect a host of personal markers that run throughout the annotated book - finger prints left by the annotator that reveal a personality and hint at an identity. 'In addition, there is a preponderance of natural history annotations, interest in the language of clothing and costume of the period critical to stagecraft, and annotations that connect with our understanding of Shakespeare’s father and his profession.' But proving the dictionary is in fact that of Shakespeare, could be harder than it would appear. He is known to have signed just six legal documents, and is thought to have hand-written only three pages of an unpublished play. While there is no categorical evidence of when William Shakespeare was born, historians widely believe today to be the 450th anniversary of his birth. It is known that the playwright was baptized on April 26, 1564 and that he died on his birthday 52 years later. The poet and writer was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, the third child of eight to his middle-class parents, John and Mary Shakespeare. Over the next 30 years he would produce 37 plays, and countless poems and other works, making him one of the world's most celebrated playwright five centuries later. Across the UK arts organisations have marked the 450th anniversary. Today the Royal Shakespeare Company theatre in Stradtford will host a fireworks display on its rooftop, which is set to paint an eight-metre high portrait of the Bard in the night's sky. At London's Victoria and Albert Museum, the Live Canon Ensemble will recite all of the Bard's 154 sonnets as part of an all-day event. With so few examples of his handwriting to compare against the annotations in the dictionary, experts have questioned its authenticity. Mr Koppelman and Mr Wechsler say they have discovered annotations that suggest borrowed ideas from one of his most well-known plays Hamlet. Another antiquarian Henry Wessells, who had access to Koppelman and Wechsler's early work, has anaylsed the arguement that the book is Shakespeare's Alvearie. He said in a blog post: 'The ordinariness of the individual . annotations is, to me, precisely what argues for their authenticity: . they form not a rough draft of any single text, but a tool kit. 'The . connections between Baret’s word store and the plays and poems all point . to the transformation that occurs in the space between an author’s . notes and composition: the play of language.' But others have urged caution, throwing doubt on the idea that the annotations were penned by the playwright. Of the six confirmed fragments of Shakespeare's handwriting only the words 'by me' and his signature 'William Shakespeare' were written by him. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C. is the largest collection of printed Shakespeare material in the world. It also has a huge archive of handwritten and printed material from the Bard's contemporaries. The library's director Michael Witmore, and curator of manuscripts Heather Wolfe, said in a blog on Monday that they cannot yet get excited about the alleged new piece of Shakespeare's history, The Atlantic reported. 'At this point,' they write, 'We . as individual scholars feel that it is premature to join Koppelman and . Wechsler in what they have described as their ""leap of faith"".' They said there are a number of different research methods that experts must use to confirm the identity of the dictionary's annotator. Responding the the sceptisim . The Folger Library in Washington D.C. holds the largest collection of printed Shakespeare material in the world . The library's director Michael Witmore, and curator of manuscripts Heather Wolfe said in a blog that they feel it is 'premature to join Koppelman and Weschler in what they have described as their ""leap of faith"".' They include paleography, or the study of old script. The handwriting used to mark the dictionary is italic-style. Almost all of the existing examples of Shakespeare's handwriting are in another style, 'secretary'. Mr Witmore and Ms Wolfe say other writers in the 16th century are known to have used examples of both italic and secretary, keeping alive the possibility it is Shakespeare's Alvearie. Verifying Shakespeare as the owner of the book is likely to take months, if not years, of research before experts will be confident to say beyond any doubt that the Bard himself scrawled the notes in the margins as he wrote his great masterpieces. Responding the the skepticism Mr Koppelman and Mr Weschler added: 'The question is, does it make sense to imagine any book extensively written in by Shakespeare to realistically survive entirely unnoticed to the present day. 'In simplest terms (our claim) goes as follows: with Baret’s Alvearie we are faced with a book that has not once been reprinted since 1580. A most obscure book. A humble copy. 'An extensive network of annotations that, through obscurity and a lack of attention, comes to light only now, never previously studied or speculated upon. 'These are the basic stepping ­‐stones to providing plausibility to the dream that such a monumental discovery is possible. The rest is in the evidence.'","Today is the 450th anniversary of William Shakespeare's birth .

"Guilty: Stephen Devesey, who has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years after killing his teenage girlfriend and hiding her body under his floorboards . A young father who suffocated his teenage girlfriend just weeks after she gave birth to their son has been jailed for life. A jury at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday found Stephen Devesey, 21, guilty of murdering Nicole Cartmell in February last year, before hiding her body under the floorboards of their home. Jailing Devesey for a minimum of 17 years, Mrs Justice Thirlwall told him: 'Your actions have destroyed a family who have lost a mother, a sister and a daughter. Your son will now have to come to terms with the actions of his father in the first few weeks of his life.' As the unanimous verdict was read out, Nicole Cartmell's family were heard to say 'yes' and her mother Julie broke down in tears. Devesey, who had pleaded not guilty, remained emotionless throughout the hearing. The 21-year-old killer struck, suffocating his girlfriend with his arm, just minutes after she made a terrified 999 call on February 10 last year - desperately trying to leave his home. After he murdered her, Devesey prised up the floorboards at his home in Handsworth, West Midlands and dropped her body onto a cellar floor. Young mother Nicole Cartmell, 18, was killed just after giving birth to a baby boy last year . Devesey then carried out an 'elaborate charade', telling lies to police and others in a bid to cover up the crime. He changed his Facebook status a week after she went missing from 'engaged' to 'it’s complicated'. He also texted Nicole’s mobile phone after she was reported missing on Valentine's Day, to appear concerned about her. Devesey’s . brother James told the court that he had stayed . with his brother a number of times following Nicole's disappearance. He . testified that his brother had not answered the . door to police who were looking for Nicole and that he had been with Stephen when he used Nicole’s . bank card to withdraw £120. The family of Nicole Cartmell outside Birmingham Crown Court for the trial of Stephen Devesey who was today foudn guilty of murdering her in Handsworth, Birmingham . Devesey was arrested on suspicion of murder after the body was found burried under floorboards . Giving evidence about the rotting smell James Devesey said he spoke to his brother about the odour. He told the jury: 'I said jokingly that could be a dead body under the floorboards, he (Stephen) said ""don’t joke about that"".' Devesey even made his brother burn incense to mask the smell when social workers visited the house. The killer was initially arrested on suspicion of fraud after police found . he had used Nicole’s cash card to withdraw money on several occasions. When they searched his home they found her bag, purse and a green jacket she was wearing when she was last seen alive. This led police to scour the rest of . his home on March 2, and they discovered her body in the cellar, crudely . covered by rubbish and old clothes. Nicole had been missing since Valentine's Day the month before she was found . The court heard how Nicole had called police just days before her death. A 999 call from a young woman was made from Devesey’s home on February 10. A . woman is overheard speaking to Devesey, telling him she would put the . phone down if he opened the door of the property, which could only be . opened with a key, to let her leave. The call was terminated after the woman had asked the other person to open the door six times. Prosecutors told the jury Devesey killed Nicole shortly after the call was made. The house in Handsworth where the grisly discovery was made. Nicole's boyfriend Stephen Devesey has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years for her murder . Sentencing Devesey to life with a minimum tariff of 17 years, Mrs Justice Thirlwall told him: 'You murdered Nicole Cartmell, a bright, beautiful, young woman who was still only 18. 'You did not want her to leave you so you made sure she did not. 'When she came to your house for the . last time you knew she had to leave to get to her uncle’s birthday . party, but you prevented her from leaving. 'The 999 call she placed was the last time anyone other than you heard her voice. 'She stood no chance from the moment you put your forearm around her throat. 'I am satisfied she may have collapsed at an early stage but it was not instantaneous, she must have suffered for some time. 'After you killed her you set about disposing of her lifeless body. 'You lifted the floorboards and covered her body with items such as curtains to hid it. 'When the smell became too bad you told your brother to light joss sticks. 'The only mitigating circumstance is your age, as you are still only 21 and I take that into account. 'I therefore sentence you to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 17 years.' Speaking in a statement after the sentence Nicole’s heartbroken parents Julie and Gary Cartmell, from West Bromwich, West Mids, said they hoped Devesey’s conviction would 'haunt him forever and a day.' They also revealed they would raise the baby boy Nicole gave birth to just weeks before her death. They said: 'The Cartmell family would . like to give our heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in finally . bringing our daughter Nicole’s murderer to justice. 'There are too many to mention but . each and everyone have our eternal gratitude for their hard work, . support and genuine care during this horrendous 18 months. 'The sentence will never be enough, it will never justify the loss of our beautiful daughter. 'Her precious baby boy has had his mother taken, an irreplaceable bond has been broken, it has broken our hearts. 'We hope this day will haunt Steven forever and a day. 'We want as a family now to be left . alone to concentrate on trying to recover from this ordeal and to raise . our grandson to be a happy, much loved and protected little boy.'","Stephen Devesey suffocated Nicole Cartmell, 18, and hid her body in his cellar .

"A trapper has captured a huge 11-foot-long alligator suspected of killing a 55lb pit bull puppy in a Florida lake. Eric Glover was playing with his 10-month-old pit bull King at Eagle Nest Park in Orlando when the alligator snatched the dog in its jaws and dragged him underwater. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the alligator was trapped by Florida Nuisance Alligator trapper Jason Daikus around 11pm Wednesday after three days in pursuit. Dog-snatcher: The huge alligator suspected of eating a pet dog was caught late Wednesday after trappers spent three days pursuing it . Tragic: King (front), a 10-month-old pit-bull, was eaten by the 11-foot alligator while playing fetch with his owner in an Orlando park . Fast: Dog owner Eric Glover said he was 'shocked' and didn't have time to react when the alligator snatched his 10-month-old pit-bull, King . Glover said he wanted to animal trapped so that it couldn't hurt any other dogs or people after his ordeal. 'My boy, he turned around, came to me, and he took off to run back again,' Glover told WKMG after the incident. 'And when he took off again, the gator came out, snatched him in front of the bank here and took him in. And that was it.' Glover correctly told authorities he believed the alligator was about 11-feet. It came in at 11-feet and one-inch. The attack was so quick, Glover didn't have time to do anything about it. The 55-pound pit-bull didn't even make a sound, the man said. 'I don't even think he knew he was hit,' Glover told WFTV about his pup. 'It was like that quick.' Trappers with Florida Fish and Wildlife on Monday scoured the lake for hours in search of the alligator. They left empty-handed after sunset. Habitat: The alligator had been spotted before by residents living near Eagle Nest Park in Orlando . Snatched: Glover, his deceased dog King (right) and another dog play with a neighborhood pooch at an Orlando park where King was grabbed by a gator . 'I couldn't do nothing,' Glover told WFTV. 'I froze, and I am like, ""Oh, my God. That is a gator."" Like, my instincts, ""That is a gator eating my dog."" I was shocked.' WKMG reported that several homes back onto the lake, and a bike path and jogging trail rings the lake's edge and many children walk along it to school every day. At least one neighbor said he'd seen a big alligator lurking about recently. 'I hear people say it's more than one,' Chris Bradley told the Orlando Sentinel. 'They took an alligator out of a smaller pond nearby.' According to WFTV, the alligator is too big to be released back into the wild and will be harvested. Some 12 people were bitten by alligators in Florida, according to the Sentinel. None of the attacks was fatal, although at least seven bites resulted in major injuries. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","Trappers caught an 11-foot-long alligator in an Orlando lake after a three-day search .

"After the anxiety of the first day Andy Murray settled comfortably into the US Open with a cramp-free, drama-free passage into the third round. Under the glare the Arthur Ashe Stadium lights and in a gusting wind the former Wimbledon champion made light of a useful challenge from German qualifier Matthias Bachinger to win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 46 minutes.

Bouncing back: Jamie Murray got over his men's doubles exit with victory in the mixed doubles . The same could not be said of the Scot and Bachinger, who go back to the days of European junior tournaments, since when one has scaled the heights and the other carved out a journeyman’s living. Bachinger is a decent enough player to give Murray a good workout and very decent for a world number 235 but lacked a weapon with which to hurt him. Murray was too solid in the strong breeze on a cool evening in New York, and despite the wind his serve was considerably improved from what it was against Robin Haase, and there were no signs of the physical problems that sent him into spasm against the Dutchman. 'The start was tough in the conditions and we both struggled early on but we had some fun points in the second and third sets,' said Murray. 'It’s always special playing on this court, I’ve loved it since I first came her at 15. I struggled in my first match but I pulled up okay tonight. 'Kuznetsov is a very flat hitter and a big hitter and he’s dangerous, it will be a tough match.' Murray has had some big nights on Arthur Ashe but in truth this was not one of them, with much attention centred elsewhere on packed Court 17, where 15 year-old American Catherine Bellis was playing.

The 2012 champion began with an ace, in contrast the double fault with which he kicked off on Monday, and from thereon put in a controlled performance with no angst-filled outbursts in any direction. His movement, always a barometer of his game’s overall health, was excellent. Bachinger held his own until the eighth game when two break points were created. The first was saved by a 131mph ace but on the second he hit a forehand long. Murray sealed the set after 27 minutes with a 128mph ace of his own. The Scot was cranking up his returns and that aggression brought an immediate break at the start of the second with the Bavarian, who was playing with no pressure and after winning four matches here, losing five games on the trot. A pleasing aspect of the Murray game was his ability to lob his onrushing opponent, and he went two sets up by clinching a second break at 5-3. The former Wimbledon champion briefly got into trouble at 2-2 in the third, when he saved three break points from 0-40 down. The German then saved six of his own in the eighth game, often with precision serving, but Murray made no mistake the next time and broke to love to seal his passage through.

"When Jim Harrison says he spends his days milking animals, you could easily imagine him as a dairy farmer keeping a herd of cows. But that is far from the truth, because the animals Jim keeps are some of the world's most dangerous snakes, and 'milking' is a slang term for extracting their venom. Every day Jim catches hundreds of the reptiles with has bare hands before holding their heads up to a glass beaker which they bite onto, squirting their venom inside. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Jim Harrison, 55, keeps some of the world's deadliest snakes at his reptile zoo and spends his days 'milking' them for their venom . Jim handles hundreds of the animals every day using nothing more than his bare hands before holding their heads up to a beaker for them to bite onto . As the snake bites down they automatically inject deadly venom which is collected in a beaker and is then sold by Jim and his wife Kristen, 37 . The 55-year-old and his wife Kristen, 37, house the largest venomous snake collection in America, and possibly the world, at their Kentucky Reptile Zoo. Incredibly, Jim has been bitten eight times, including one bite from a lance-headed viper which left him in hospital for four weeks needing three operations to remove abscesses from his fingers. Jim's injuries have left him without tips on some of his fingers and with scars across his hands, but he says the pain is all worthwhile because the venom he extracts can save lives. Black mamba venom has been researched for Alzheimer's disease, Asian cobra venom for antiviral medication and Malayan pit viper venom for stroke victims. Some copperhead venom has even been used in research on skin and breast cancer. Jim has been bitten a total of eight times, including one bite from a lance-headed viper (pictured) That bite left Jim in hospital for four weeks needing three operations on abscesses which wouldn't stop growing (pictured left, and right, with his hand in an ice bath) Jim has been doing the job since he was 17 years old. His hands are now badly scarred and he is missing the tips from several of his fingers . They sell the various venom for up to thousands of dollars primarily for biomedical research but also to pharmaceutical companies and university research. Venom extraction is a non-intrusive process which allows the animals to bite and inject venom naturally . Jim said: 'We have around 2000 snakes on site and average between 600-1000 extractions a week. 'The perception of anyone who keeps snake is a little weird - people don't understand why you would risk your life. 'But the reality is it's not that much risk if you use precaution, I think people get carried away from watching TV and the danger. Jim says there are around 2,000 snakes at his Kentucky Reptile Zoo, making it the largest collection of venomous snakes in the U.S., and possibly the largest in the world . Despite his injuries, Jim says the work is worth it because the venom he sells is used to save lives . Black mamba venom has been researched for Alzheimer's disease and Malayan pit viper venom for stroke victims (pictured, Kristen with a jar of extracted venom) 'Truthfully any of the snakes could be dangerous but they're only dangerous if you do something stupid.' Jim has been interested in snakes from a young age, catching his first snake aged six, while Kristen became interested in reptiles in college. After graduating from high school aged 17 Jim began keeping snakes and extracting venom. The pair now run the Kentucky Reptile Zoo full-time. It is a non-profit relying solely on people coming through the gates and the sale of venom. Jim and Kristen sell venom for up to thousands of dollars per jar, primarily for biomedical research but also to pharmaceutical companies and universities . Jim caught his first snake aged just six and began keeping the animals aged 17 after leaving high school, while Kristen became interested in the creatures in college . Kristen added: 'Almost any venomous snake is capable of causing severe injury but you are pretty unlikely to die if you get appropriate medical care. 'It's unlikely here as we do everything we can to get appropriate care and have anti-venom on site for everything anti-venom is made for. 'We both believe what we're doing is a good thing - it saves lives. The research can help people and it's good publicity for snakes as people know the venom is being used in applications which may help people one day.' Jim estimated that he performs between 600 and 1,000 extractions every week at his reptile zoo . Despite being surrounded by deadly snakes, Kristen says it is unlikely either her or her husband will be killed as they have anti-venom on site . Jim said that practically any snake can be dangerous, but only if 'you do something stupid'","Jim Harrison, 55, keeps 2,000 venomous snakes at Kentucky Reptile Zoo .

Please consider helping her family at this tragic time in their . lives. God Bless.' So far, the Go Fund Me page has raised $210 of the goal amount of $1,000 with six backers pledging support. A Go Fund Me for the family of Iasbel Grace Franks has been started after the 9-year-old girl died after being trapped in sand on an Oregon beach . Franks was trapped when a sand hole collapsed on her has died in the Oregon coastal town of Lincoln City . Lieutenant Jerry Palmer says police and firefighters responded shortly after 5 p.m. Friday and found a group of people trying to dig Isabel Grace Franks out. Palmer says officers helped extract Franks from a large hole. Collapse: Isabel Franks was inside the hole she and other children dug when it collapsed in on her . Police began CPR after Isabel was pulled free, unconscious and not breathing. North Lincoln Fire and Rescue and ambulance medical teams took over CPR and the girl was taken to a hospital, where she died. Palmer says family members were with Franks when the collapse occurred. North Lincoln Fire spokesman Jim Kusz told The Oregonian that the girl and her family were visiting from Sandy, 28 miles southeast of Portland. Kusz told KOMO News that Isabel was buried for about five minutes. Witnesses said she and some other young children had dug the hole on the beach. She sat down in the hole just before 5 p.m. and the sand caved in on her. Desperate: Onlookers tried to dig her out but the child was buried for approximately five minutes . Tribute: Mourners placed flowers and candles in the hole on the beach as part of a makeshift memorial . 'And we heard screaming,' Tracey Dudley who was staying at a nearby hotel, told KOMO News, 'and screaming coming from the beach. At first we thought, you know, it was just kids, but it was like screaming and screaming and screaming.' She called 911 and watched as people tried to dig Franks out, but sand kept falling straight back into the hole. 'It was heart-wrenching,' Dudley said. 'You could see that people were trying, and I don't even know what to say. It was awful.' The hole was filled and mourners placed flowers and candles in memorial to Franks.","Isabel Grace Franks, 9, has died after a sand hole collapsed in on her .

"A mother is moving to America to marry a paralysed lonely heart she met on a Facebook game called 'Hot or Not'. Nicole Joseph, 44, signed up to the dating site for fun - but fell for wheelchair-bound Dean Wulfekuhle. Beauty therapist Nicole said she 'just clicked' with bachelor Dean, 42, as they chatted over the internet every day. Scroll down for video . Dean and Nicole pictured on their wedding day with Nicole's daughters (l-r) Ffion, Imogen and Mollie . Nicole met Dean online when she joined up to Facebook's 'Hot or Not' dating site as a joke . Nicole, from Newport, South Wales, said: 'It was just a chance, random meeting online. 'I was only on the Hot or Not game for one day, it was kind of one of those meant-to-be scenarios. 'I can't explain it - we both just hit it off straight away.' Dean told Nicole how his hopes of having a family was ended when he was left paralysed by a spinal injury in a car accident in 1993 . 'Hot or Not', an app that can also be accessed through Facebook, shows you profiles of people, allowing you to vote whether they are 'hot' or 'not hot'. The votes are calibrated to create 'leaderboards' of the hottest people in your area, and your own profile is also rated. The app also has a 'chat' option where you can contact people also playing the game. Over the next two years Nicole visited Dean nine times at his home in Minnesota where he works as a life coach. Quadraplegic Dean was upfront about his 'challenges' and immediately explained to Nicole that he spends his life in a wheelchair. He explained that his disability affects the lower part of his body but he has some movement in his torso and arms. Nicole said: 'I think he expected me to run a mile when he told me that - but it made no difference to my feelings for him. Nicole and her daughters have now moved to start a new life in the US with Dean, who is wheelchair bound . The couple says they 'just clicked' when they began talking online . 'When I met Dean in person the first thing I thought was that he was quite a hunk. 'The only thing that was different to what he'd said is that his eyes were far bluer than I expected.' Dean told Nicole how his hopes of having a family were ended when he was left paralysed by a spinal injury in a car accident in 1993. But after meeting Nicole on the internet dating game his dream finally came true. Nicole and her three daughters - Ffion, 16, Imogen, 15, and Mollie, 13 - have all started a new life in America with the girls enrolling at a high school in Minnesota. Nicole said: 'Some of our friends and family members on both sides were concerned at first. 'But we knew from that first in-person meeting that we were both sincere.' Dean says he feels very lucky to have achieved his dream of having a family . Nicole says when she first met Dean in person she remembers thinking he was 'quite a junk' The couple tied the knot in a beautiful lakeside ceremony in June 2010. Nicole's three daughters were bridesmaids at the traditional white wedding and Nicole wore a strapless lace gown and said it was the 'happiest day of her life.' She said: 'It was a real dream come true to marry such a strong and determined man, he truly is my best friend and a wonderful father to our three girls.' They were joined by friends and family from America and the UK to celebrate their nuptials in Dean's hometown of Sauk Rapids, Minnesota where Nicole now lives. Dean said he had never let his disability get in the way of leading a full and active life. He said: 'I feel very lucky - it was my dream to have a family and I got it.'","Nicole met Dean on 'Hot or Not' dating site, which she joined for fun .

Kappes, who won the event in partnership with Storey in 2008, and MacLean suffered two mishaps and were denied a third opportunity to start by race officials.

"Americans' eating habits have improved - except among the poor, a 12-year study has found. The Harvard School of Public Health found evidence of a widening wealth gap when it comes to diet. Yet even among wealthier adults, food choices remain far from ideal. On an index of healthy eating where a perfect score is 110, U.S. adults averaged just 40 points in 1999-2000, climbing steadily to 47 points in 2009-10, the study found. A variety of healthy fruits and vegetables are displayed for sale at a market in Washington, which adults need to consume for a healthy diet . Scores for low-income adults were lower than the average and barely budged during the years studied. They averaged almost four points lower than those for high-income adults at the beginning; the difference increased to more than six points in 2009-10. Higher scores mean greater intake of heart-healthy foods including vegetables, fruits, whole grains and healthy fats, and a high score means a low risk of obesity and chronic illnesses including heart disease, strokes and diabetes. Low scores mean people face greater chances for developing those ailments. The widening rich-poor diet gap is disconcerting and 'will have important public health implications,' said study co-author Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health. Diet-linked chronic diseases such as diabetes have become more common in Americans in general, and especially in the poor, he noted. 'Declining diet quality over time may actually widen the gap between the poor and the rich,' Hu said. Harvard School of Public Health researchers developed the healthy diet index used for the study. It is similar to federal dietary guidelines but features additional categories including red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol. The study authors used that index along with government estimates on trans fat intake to evaluate information in 1999-2010 national health surveys that included interviews with people about their eating habits. The results are published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Hu said the widening diet gap reflects an income gap that deepened during the recent financial crisis, which likely made healthy food less affordable for many people. Hu also noted that inexpensive highly processed foods are often widely available in low-income neighborhoods. The overall diet improvement was largely due to decreased intake of foods containing trans fats but the disappointing results point to a need for policy changes including better nutrition education, Hu said. In recent years the government and manufacturers have moved to phase out use of artificial trans fats in foods including processed cookies, cakes, frozen pizza and margarines. Trans fats contribute to unhealthy cholesterol levels and can increase heart disease risks. These fats are made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil to improve texture and shelf life. The study authors say their results are consistent with an earlier report showing that 'nearly the entire U.S. population fell short of meeting federal dietary recommendations.' The federal guidelines are updated every five years and new ones will be issued next year. The current recommendations emphasize limiting intake of trans fats, sodium, processed foods and added sugars. They don't specify amounts but encourage diets high in whole grains, vegetables and fruits. The Harvard index has a similar emphasis with some specifics; to get a top score would include eating daily more than two cups of vegetables, at least four servings of fruit and at least one ounce of nuts. A JAMA Internal Medicine editorial says the Harvard diet index isn't perfect because it puts equal emphasis on various foods that may not contribute equally to health. Still, the study highlights a 'growing chasm' that is a public health concern, the editorial says. It suggests that government efforts to close the gap with programs including food stamps may be insufficient and that limiting government benefits to cover only healthful foods might be a better strategy.","A 12-year study has monitored the diets of high income and low income adults in the U.S .

"Tragedy: Branson Riley Carlisle suffered a fatal bite from a brown recluse last Sunday at home in Albertsville, Alabama . Three photographs taken by five-year-old Branson Riley Carlisle's mother chart the progress of the fatal spider bite that tragically ended his life the Sunday before Thanksgiving. The first picture which reveals a noticeable swelling and redness on Branson's shoulder blade was taken by Jessica Carlisle just 15 minutes after he was bitten by the brown recluse. The second photograph was taken just one hour later and reveals the bite has turned into a tender looking welt on the back of the Alberstville, Alabama, boy. The third photograph was taken in hospital by Branson's mother nine hours after he was bitten and shows a rash and painful blotching of the skin. Branson passed away suddenly from a cardiac arrest five hours later. Jessica has made the difficult decision to release the images of her dead son in a bid to raise awareness among parents of the dangers of a brown recluse spider bite. She wants them to know that the minute they suspect their child has been bitten to rush them to medical attention. The distraught mother also wants her son's final wish to be granted - to give all his Christmas gifts away to children in Africa. It was last Sunday that Branson was bitten at around 9am, wearing his new pajamas. His mother then took him to the doctors office where he started showing symptons. He told Jessica he had been  and showed her the red mark on his shoulder blade. 'He said something had stung him,' said Jessica to AL.com. 'It was a brand new pajama top and this spider was in his shirt. I saw a welt on his back.' First two bites: Branson was bitten at around 9am last Sunday and showed his mother - who took a picture 15 minutes afterwards (left) and again one hour after that (right) Deterioration: The spider bite is pictured here nine hours after Branson told his mother and tragically, five hours before he passed away . Having been bitten herself by a brown recluse, Jessica knew that bites could turn serious,and decided to take Branson straight away to Marshall Medical Centers South in Boaz and got there within one hour. While there Branson began running a fever of 100 and doctors were concerned the spider's venom was 'going systemic' - which is a rare reaction to the brown recluse bite. 'They took it very seriously [at Marshall. They started him on antibiotics, steroids and Tylenol,' said Jessica to the Examiner. 'His vitals were all normal. He was laughing and playing and being a 5-year-old boy. The doctor said he was going to send him to Children's of Huntsville or Birmingham, whichever one was quicker, but he didn't seem to think it was going to get worse. 'It was just in case anything happened, he would have the best care.' First off he was taken to by ambulance to Huntsville Hospital for Women & Children. Memory: Jessica Carlisle watched helplessly as her son's condition went downhill during the day after he was bitten by the brown recluse spider . Culprit: This is the brown recluse spider that bit Branson and was killed and captured by his mother for the benefit of the doctors . Also known as the fiddleback spider, the violin spider or the brown fiddler, the brown recluse spider has venomous and potentially fatal bite. They are usually brown or gray in colour and between six to 20 millimeters in length. They typically have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax, . These markings include a black line coming from the dorsel side that looks like a violin, resulting in the nickname 'fiddleback'. The spiders often build their webs in dry, generally undisturbed locations, including sheds, closets, garages, cellars and other similar places. In America, their range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through to southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, to southwestern Ohio. In the southern states, they are native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky. Brown recluse spiders have the ability to survive starvation and thirst, and the way in which they benefit from the regulated room temperatures of human habitations, make extermination of this species particularly challenging. Jessica said the bite appeared to get worse there and became black and blue like he had been struck by a baseball. His condition became too serious for those at Huntsville Hospital for Women & Children to handle so Branson was immediately transferred to another hospital -  Children's of Huntsville. However, once there, Branson began to deteriorate. He developed head and stomach pains and the doctors decided to place him on oxygen and take him to the intensive care unit. 'He was talking in the elevator on the way to ICU, arguing with the doctor. The doctor wanted him to open his mouth and he said, 'No, I don't want to.' Just being a 5-year-old.' said Jessica. Suddenly as Jessica was waiting outside the ICU at around 11.30pm she heard raised voices and the unmistakable sound of panic. 'Doors started flying open and people started coming running from everywhere. I've never seen so many doctors in one room,' said Jessica to the Examiner. 'The nurse came out in the hallway and sat down. They told me his heart had stopped. They shocked him.' Wish: Branson wanted to give all his Christmas presents to children in Africa who have none and his mother wants anyone who can help to drop them off at Freelife Worship Center in Sardis, Alabama . The doctors told her that their son's blood was failing to clot and that his organs were bleeding internally. 'I was in the room when they shocked him for the 17th time, and I knew there was nothing else in this world that they could do for him. I told them it was time to stop,' said Jessica. Stunned, Jessica buried her son on Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Trying to turn the tragedy into a triumph, Jessica has decided to fulfull her son's wish to give toys to children in Africa who have none. 'He wanted all the kids in Africa to have toys,' said Jessica to WHNT. 'I mean, he was going to give his own toys.'","Branson Riley Carlisle was bitten on the shoulder blade last Sunday .

"She grew up in Lewisham, south London, and only converted to Islam as a teenager, but Khadijah Dare is now said to be seen as a 'top priority' for British intelligence services. Two years ago, Dare swapped her 'comfortable life' in Britain, where she was known for her dimples and her love of her mother's home cooking, for the horror of Syria, where she has joined the terror group ISIS. Now, after appearing in an ISIS recruitment video calling on British Muslims to 'stop being selfish' and give up their families and studies to join the front line in the Middle East, Dare - a pseudonym - is said to be top of MI6's list. A security source said: 'Her notoriety has evolved so rapidly that she has achieved a celebrity-like status among jihadists fighting in Syria and those who are thinking of travelling abroad to join ISIS.' Scroll down for video . Khadijah Dare, 22, was born a non-Muslim in south London but is now said to be seen as a 'top priority' by MI6 . Dare, left, is married to Swedish ISIS jihadi, Abu Bakr, in a union said to have been arranged by his mother . The source told the Mirror: 'Dare has now become a top priority.' Dare, a mother of two young boys who is married to Swedish jihadi Abu Bakr, is believed to be one of the British-born Muslim terrorists that will be targeted by new anti-terror measures to be announced by the Prime Minister this afternoon. Among the measures expected to be unveiled include more stringent controls on British-born jihadis who board flights back to the UK from Turkey and Germany, and plans to strip suspected terrorists of their passports. But Dare appears to have no wish to return home just yet. In a video posted online calling on Muslim extremists to leave Britain and fight, she extolled the virtues of her adopted religion, saying: 'I'm not oppressed; if I was oppressed I wouldn't be a Muslim right now. 'If I thought Islam was an oppressive religion, I would have left Islam. 'Islam has made me free.' In an attempt to stir up racial hatred in a video that speaks of Muslim children being 'slaughtered', she added: 'These are your brothers and sisters as well and they need our help, so instead of sitting down and focusing on your families or focusing on your studies, you need to stop being selfish because time is ticking.' Hours after the beheading of American journalist James Foley at the hands of a British jihadist, Dare gloated on social media at his execution and vowed that she would be the first British woman to kill a US soldier. Disturbing: A Twitter post showing Dare's four-year-old son grinning as he brandishes an AK-47 rifle . Arranged marriage: She became radicalised online before marrying her Swedish husband Abu Bakr . Dare was gleeful that the 'UK must be shaking up' after the execution and from her home in the Syrian scrub she tweeted: 'Any links 4 da execution of da journalist plz. Allahu Akbar. UK must b shaking up haha. I wna b da 1st UK woman 2 kill a UK or US terorrist!' Dare's Twitter account is already notorious – not least because of the photograph of her then four-year-old son Isa, meaning 'Jesus', holding an AK-47 rifle. Her Twitter feed, which is currently suspended, was littered with images of dead bodies and Islamic State propaganda, juxtaposed with pictures which belie the normal young girl she once was. The irony of the images she has posted of 'beautiful' sunsets, baby seals and a kitten in a teacup alongside those of extremist horror are apparently lost on her. Childhood friends of Khadijah Dare – one of her many post-conversion pseudonyms – told the Evening Standard that she was 'very endearing and sweet. 'She was a bit of a tomboy but sometimes at weddings I'd see her wearing tight jeans and platforms. She also had braces and dimples and was very cute.' She liked to watch football on TV as a child, and loved Chinese food and her mother's home cooking.  When she was older she went to a local college to study media studies, film studies, psychology and sociology, and was a popular young girl. But at 18, four years ago, she converted to Islam and began worshipping at the Lewisham Islamic Centre – which has links to both the Woolwich killers of Lee Rigby and radical cleric Abu Hamza. She admitted in a Channel 4 report last year that when she began wearing the full face veil in Lewisham people on the street told her to 'go back to her country', to which she replied: 'I was born round the corner'. In the same footage she urges other Muslims to 'stop being so selfish...focusing on your families or studies' and implores them to join her in Syria and join the holy war. Horrific: James Foley was brutally murdered by ISIL. Dare disgustingly gloated on social media at his execution . Dare allegedly became radicalised online and moved to Syria in 2012, before marrying her Swedish Muslim jihadist husband Abu Bakr, arranged by his mother. Bakr is fighter with the Sunni jihadi militia known as Katiba al Muhajireen - the battalion of migrants – which joined forces with Islamic State and wants to create an Islamic caliphate. The Londoner has admitted that her parents are unaware of her new life, and as well as the pseudonym Khadijah Dare she goes by 'Umm Isa' meaning 'mother of Isa' and Muhajirah fi Sham, meaning 'Immigrant in Syria'. As her toddler sons Isa and Abdur Rahman stumbled about her gun-littered living room floor last year, Dare was unrepentant of her decision to move to Syria and of her departure from the girl-next-door who traded her promising British life for one of violence and hatred. Muslims at the Lewisham mosque where Dare used to worship have insisted it was not a breeding ground for terrorists. One woman, who asked not to be named, said: 'I know Khadijah. She attended the mosque a couple of years ago. 'She's a very nice girl, a good person, I had no idea she was fighting in Syria.

"Police were ordered to 'stand and observe' rioters as they laid waste to London's streets instead of confronting them, it was claimed today. Scotland Yard insiders have revealed teams were frustrated at their inability to wade in and arrest troublemakers while they looted and burnt out shops. They had apparently been told to try and contain any violence but not to haul away offenders who would instead be identified through video footage later, according to The Times. It was only on Monday night, when the riots escalated still further, that tactics changed and armoured vehicles called Jankels were used to disperse the crowds. On Tuesday night, some 16,000 officers also flooded London's streets - almost triple the previous night's deployment - and they were finally given the green light to confront the gangs. Police are said to have complained they were ordered to go 'soft' on rioters . Police on Brixton High Street before they were apparently given the all-clear to take tougher action . The Met has also come under fire for taking three days to issue any images of suspects - and then only releasing 12 grainy pictures. The Mail Online managed to produce another 30 with ease. In contrast, Greather Manchester Police were issuing images online via social network sites within hours of similar violence in their area. In Birmingham, police tracked down suspected rioters hours later and smashed into their homes to arrest them. Officers mounted raids on around a dozen properties across the city and made seven arrests. They also recovered apparently looted items. The police's tactics have led to much public criticism from residents and business owners, who are bemused at the 'soft' approach when their livelihoods are being ruined. Eye witnesses have told of ranks of police standing by while mobs of youths rampaged and stole from shop fronts and terrorised residents. However, it has been suggested that the approach may also have been dictated by the sheer scale of the problem with teams unable to spare officers to make arrests on the spot. There have also been calls for far more robust measures - including plastic bullets, water cannon and even the Army - to quell the chaos. By Monday night, police were using armoured vehicles and considering using baton rounds . Police officers in riot gear stand outside a looted sports store in Hackney . It has been suggested that the softer approach has been sparked by controversy over the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 riots and wider criticism of policing during protests. Mr Tomlinson was struck by a policeman wielding a baton during the G20 protests in 2009 and shoved to the ground. He suffered massive internal bleeding and died minutes later. The officer involved is now awaiting trial for manslaughter over his death. Scotland Yard was also heavily criticised in the High Court in April for using 'kettling' during the G20 demonstrations. Judges ruled the Met had broken the law in the way it kettled 5,000 protesters because it was 'unjustified' and an unlawful deprivation of liberty. Metropolitan Police officers detaining a suspected rioter in Enfield on Tuesday night . The police approach had toughened by day four of the violence in the capital . Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stephen insists 'nobody' gave any instruction to go soft. 'I'm now aware of any order to take things easy,' he told BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. Ian Tomlinson before he was pushed by a police officer at the G20 protests . He said: 'We have had this allegation made a few times. You have to realise we had over 3,000 officers on Sunday night. That is the size of two small forces combined. It is a significant asset that we put out there. 'We filled the cells of London on Sunday and Monday night, we drove Jankels at looters - if that is taking things easy, I don't understand that logic.' He admitted there were 'significant gaps' in the police response and that they were 'enormously stretched'. But he insisted: 'As far as I'm concerned Chris Allison and Lynne Owens who led this did not give any instruction and nobody else has either.' On wider tactics, he said everything 'from local engagement to extreme use of force' had been considered. Officers trained in using baton rounds were ready if needed but there are currently no water cannon on the British mainland, he added. Baton rounds, or plastic bullets, can only be used if sanctioned by the commissioner of the Met Police and have never been fired on the British mainland. They were issued to police at the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham in 1985 but never used - although the weapons are apparently also issued annually for the Notting Hill Carnival.","Yard insiders: Officers were 'told just to try and contain violence'

"Roy Hodgson claims he is not certain he'd swap his managerial career for Sir Alex Ferguson's, and also admits it was once unthinkable for an England boss to pick players who were not representing their clubs every week. The current England boss has not won a trophy since 2001 with Copenhagen, but said he would not necessarily want to swap his achievements for the former Manchester United boss', having managed 16 teams in eight countries. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson: I will continue leading England . Content: Roy Hodgson suggested he would not swap his career for Sir Alex Ferguson's . Hodgson, speaking to www.britishcoachesabroad.com, said: 'Like everything else in life, you have to weigh things up. 'But if you ask me, would it have been better to have been like Alex Ferguson, to have spent life at one club, if I’d been lucky enough to do that? I’m not certain I’d say “yes, I would have preferred that”.' Hodgson, who performed the great escape with Fulham in 2008, and also helped West Bromwich Albion become an established mid-table side, also claimed it is sometimes harder to achieve survival than win titles. 'You don’t win prizes for [keeping teams up] or get a trophy on your CV... but when (for example) you’re winning the Bundesliga with the current Bayern Munich team, is that as great an achievement as – say – keeping Burnley in the Premier League? It’s very difficult to assess these things.' Success: Ferguson won the Champions League twice and the Premier League 13 times . Hodgson, whose England side failed to get out of the group stage at the World Cup in Brazil this summer, said he'd rather some players moved abroad for more game time than sit on the bench in the Premier League. The 67-year-old also concedes that times have changed with the national team, and that he has to pick players who are not regularly playing with their clubs, something that was unthinkable even five years ago. Hodgson added: 'If you’re asking, would it be better for some of our players to play regularly for a good team abroad, rather than warm the bench here, then of course. As a national team manager, I’d like to see that. Relative: Hodgson says survival, like keeping Fulham up in 2008, can be sweeter than any trophy . 'Even as recently as five years ago – certainly ten years ago – it would be unthinkable for any England national team manager to pick a player who wasn’t the first name on his club’s teamsheet. 'Now we pick players – more than half probably – who start with us, and are certainly not the first name on their club’s teamsheet. 'They might not even get a regular game. But that’s where we are, because the clubs have a predominance of foreign players, and because they can afford it. 'They can get the best players outside of Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Bayern Munich. And basically speaking, there aren’t many clubs who can tempt away English players.'

"The morning after the night of The Jackal dawned brilliant and sunny over Belfast. The only cloud on Carl Frampton’s horizon was the IBF’s insistence that the first defence of his world super-bantamweight title must be against a little-known American. Britain’s newest world champion has secured himself not only a championship belt but also a rich range of options for mouth-watering title unification fights against stellar opponents. VIDEO Scroll down for Santa Cruz: Carl Frampton is a stronger fighter than Scott Quigg . On top of the world: Carl Frampton celebrates his points decision over Kiko Martinez . But if Frampton wants to hold onto his first world title – ‘for a very long time’ as this 27-year-old puts it – it seems he must first accommodate mandatory challenger Chris Alavos. Frampton and his mentor Barry McGuigan have a different wish list. After Saturday near shut-out conquest of Kiko Martinez, they arrived at a late-night press conference with Frampton wearing a Father Christmas outfit. The message to an IBF official in attendance in Belfast’s iconic Titanic Quarter was that a big-money duel with Leo Santa Cruz is more to their liking. That Californian-based Mexican is McGuigan’s preference. Frampton would like to settle a score with his English rival, WBA ‘regular’ champion Scott Quigg. McGuigan – The Jackal’s promoter and manager as well as his inspiration – says: ‘Quigg can only draw about 800 fans on his home turf in Manchester but we could have another 16,000 crowd here in Belfast.’ Bloody battle: Frampton lands a punch on Martinez on his way to winning the world titlte . World class: Frampton proved his quality in his unanimous points decision over Martinez . Down you go: Frampton puts Martinez on the floor during their bout in Belfast . That gathering to see Frampton score a landslide points victory over Martinez marked his potential as a cross-over star. Not only is Frampton bridging the sectarian divide in Ulster – the way McGuigan did before him – but he is attracting a new generation of younger, non-boxing support. Ulster is united behind him and McGuigan says: ‘Carl is becoming the greatest boxer in Irish history.’ Many hold McGuigan in that regard but the former world featherweight champion adds: ‘This young man is a better boxer than I ever was.’ A contemporary slant on Frampton’s prowess came from Sergio Martinez,the Argentian who is no relation to Spain’s Kiko but until recently the world’s outstanding middleweight. Crowning moment: Frampton is awarded the win by the referee after winning the fight on points . Lift me up: Fampton celebrates his victory with trainer Shane McGuigan . One of the many celebrities at the open-air ringside in a temporary arena constructed on the slipway down which the Titanic was launched, Martinez said: ‘Frampton is the most exciting young fighter in the world today.’ He looked just that as he pummelled the other Martinez to comprehensive defeat by 119 points to 109 on my card, 119-108 in the view of two of the judges and 118-111 according to the third official. Frampton is capable of adding further belts to his collection against Quigg and Santa Cruz. But if he must accommodate Alavos first then at least it will give him the chance to present himself to the American audience. That situation has arisen because Martinez was granted a dispensation to earn bigger bucks in Belfast on condition that Alavos is given his shot at the winner with 90 days of negotiating terms. Sealed with a kiss: Carl Frampton celebrates winning the fight with wife Christine . McGuigan – well aware that this has much to do with the network television rivalry here between Sky and BoxNation – will bide his time after reporting that Frampton fractured his left hand on the resilient cranium of Martinez. He had to keep punching away for the full 12 rounds because while the Spaniard resembled a bull being stuck by a picador, Frampton could not kill him off with a matador flourish. Martinez is not lacking what the Hispanics call ‘cajones’ and after beating him here for the second time in 18 months Frampton told him: ‘I respect you more than boxer I’ve ever fought but forgive me for saying I hope I never see you again.’ Next up: American Chris Avalos (left) is the mandatory challenger while McGuigan wants Leo Santa Cruz . Grudge match: Frampton has a personal score to settle with Scott Quigg (left), but he'll have to wait . Martinez had recovered from his first defeat in Belfast to win this title but Frampton has improved even more dramatically in the interval. His hand speed while counter-punching was the key to keeping the aggressive Martinez at bay and he looks close to the finished article after only 19 professional fights. A wariness of the Spaniard’s power stopped him going for the knock-out which the crowd bayed for their Jackal to deliver. But on an electrifying night they witnessed a very classy all-round performance. The world, as well as Belfast, is now Frampton’s stage, whoever he fights in the coming months.","Carl Frampton beat Kiko Martinez on points to win IBF title in Belfast .

"Loic Remy will not be wearing Chelsea’s cursed No 9 jersey this season. The exit of Fernando Torres had freed up the shirt traditionally worn by centre forwards. But Remy, who has joined Chelsea in a £10.5million deal from Queens Park Rangers, has opted for No 18, confirmed on Wednesday night when Premier League clubs submitted their 25-man squad lists.

Blues fans will look back fondly on years in which the famous number was worn by the likes of Kerry Dixon and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. However, the digit didn't bring as much luck to Serbian striker Mateja Kezman or Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz during their time in west London. Torres scored just 20 league goals during three-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge. His predecessor, Franco Di Santo, failed to score any, and Steve Sidwell and Khalid Boulahrouz did not enjoy happy stays at the club. Before that there was Argentina striker Hernan Crespo, and his one season wearing the shirt produced 10 goals. Mateja Kezman arrived from PSV having scored 78 in two seasons in Holland but as the Chelsea No 9 managed just seven. Petr Cech has retained the No 1 jersey despite Thibaut Courtois starting the season as Jose Mourinho’s first-choice goalkeeper. Elsewhere, Spurs have omitted defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto from their squad and he could now head out on loan to the Championship.

"Under a full moon in the Caucasus, Martin O’Neill was entitled to howl with elation as the Republic of Ireland did what their manager does on match day – they came alive. No one responded greater to O’Neill’s demand for an extra 10 per cent than Aiden McGeady whose two-goal contribution was the act of deliverance he has long threatened to provide in an Irish jersey. On his 70th appearance, McGeady struck with a glorious 90th minute match-winner, engineered and executed by his twinkling toes and rising self-belief.

Referee: Kevin Blom (Holland) No one goes back longer with O’Neill than McGeady and it was fitting the Glaswegian should ensure a winning Euro 2016 start for his former Celtic manager. Confronted by a wall of white as he gathered possession on the edge of the box, McGeady’s shoulder dip sent half the Georgian defence into the nearby River Kura, and created sufficient space to curl a lovely left footer into the far corner. On the touchline, O’Neill soared skywards, beside him Roy Keane and Robbie Keane, who had been substituted, were wrapped in each other arms. In the colourful history of Irish football, it’s a rare event for the senior team to score a last-gasp winner, especially on foreign turf. This win, hard-earned but deserved, was sweet and it sets the Irish up for a six-point start to Group D – they play Gibraltar next – before the trip to Germany on October 14. Predictably, the Georgians were gung-ho early on, eager to remind the Irish what they missed six years ago when the World Cup qualifier was shifted to neutral Mainz. But their early fizz couldn’t mask their limitations and Ireland, all verve and vigour, controlled most of the play. As the Georgians perhaps scented a weakness, they lowered their guard and were caught squarely on the chin in the 24rd minute as McGeady made his first telling input. From Forde’s deep clearance, Jon Walters headed down to Keane who allowed the ball run into the path of James McCarthy. The option to shoot was there but McCarthy, aware McGeady was up in support to the left, deftly he laid the ball off for his Everton comrade to slip the ball calmly under Loria. On the bench, O’Neill and Keane sprang to their feet, the tensions uncoiled and they embraced. The goal should have been the cue for Ireland to kick on and consolidate.

Battle: Two-goal hero McGeady (right) tussles with Georgia's Ucha Lobzhanidze (left) as he bids to get a cross into the penalty area . But seven minutes before half-time, their jaws dropped as Georgia conjured up an improbable equaliser from the right-foot of Tomike Okriashvili. The second half unfolded as predicted with McGeady at the hub of Ireland’s most creative efforts. He curled a free-kick a whisker wide, went close with a right-stinging right-footer and worked the substitute ‘keeper, Roin Kvaskhvadze as he peppered in crosses. For the final 15 minutes, Ireland pressed for a winner as Georgia bedded down to for a draw which seemed likely until Seamus Coleman found McGeady and the wee man’s magic did the rest.

"The only surviving son of fraudster Bernie Madoff has died after a long battle with lymphoma. Andrew Madoff, 48, was surrounded by family as he 'died peacefully' at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on Wednesday morning, his attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, said in a statement. His death comes four years after his brother Mark killed himself on the second anniversary of their father's arrest for a $65 billion Ponzi scheme. Bernie Madoff is serving an 150-year prison sentence. Andrew Madoff, who leaves behind a fiancée and two daughters, first fought mantle cell lymphoma in 2003 and was diagnosed with the disease again in October 2012. In an interview last year, he blamed the stress of living with his father's arrest for the relapse. Passed: Andrew Madoff, pictured left on the Today show in 2011 and right in February last year, has died of lymphoma. The 48-year-old trader was the last remaining son of fraudster, Bernie Madoff . 'One way to think of this is the scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew told People magazine in April 2013. 'And it's killing me slowly.' As part of his treatment, he had a stem cell transplant in May 2013, followed by chemotherapy. Although he reconciled with his mother, Ruth, shortly before his second diagnosis, he always said that he had no interest in having contact with his father. 'Even on my deathbed, I will never forgive him for what he did,' he told People magazine. 'He's already dead to me.' Before the storm: Andrew Madoff is pictured second right with his father Bernie, brother Mark and mom Ruth . Locked up: Madoff, pictured in January 2009, is serving an 150-year sentence in a North Carolina prison for his $65 billion Ponzi scheme. Andrew Madoff said he would never forgive his father for what he did . Bernie Madoff was arrested on December 11, 2008, following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme, which became the largest financial fraud in history. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. The scheme was exposed after he told his sons about it and they contacted the FBI. Andrew told People magazine last year that turning his father in was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'. Andrew, who had been head of equities at his father's New York-based company, always denied knowing anything about the scheme. Family man: Andrew Madoff is pictured with his daughters, Anne and Emily, from his first marriage . Left behind: A photo from 2011 shows Andrew Madoff with his fiancee Catherine Hooper and his mother Ruth. He reconciled with his mother after initially shunning her but said he would never forgive his father . Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, 46, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door. Speaking on the Today show in 2011, Ruth Madoff revealed that the last time she had seen her son Mark alive was the evening her husband had revealed the scheme. 'I'll never get over that,' she said. 'I blame Bernie. It's the worst thing that can happen,' In January, Bernie Madoff revealed he was battling his own health woes, telling CNBC that he suffered a heart attack last year and had been diagnosed with kidney cancer. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. No family members were criminally charged. Torn apart: Madoff's other son, Mark, is pictured with his wife Stephanie ahead of his suicide. He committed suicide in December 2010 on the second anniversary of their father's arrest . Scene: A police officers points to the third floor New York City apartment where Mark Madoff's body was found after he hanged himself. He took his life as his two-year-old son slept in the room next door . Mantle cell lymphoma, which most often affects men over the age of 60, is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that causes white blood cells to grow and multiply uncontrollably. It is aggressive and often comes back after patients go into remission. Survival rates are generally poor compared to other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and most people do not live longer than five years after diagnosis. Initial symptoms can include fever, heavy night sweats and weight loss. Patients may also find a lump on their neck, armpits or groin. Andrew Madoff leaves behind two daughters, Anne and Emily, from his first marriage. He was engaged to Catherine Hooper.","Andrew Madoff, 48, 'died peacefully' in a New York hospital on Wednesday .

"Tony Blair was last night improbably named philanthropist of the year by a leading magazine. The former prime minister was handed the award to a ‘muted’ response at a celebrity-packed gathering in central London. It was in recognition of his ‘philanthropy, establishing three charities’. GQ magazine’s decision drew immediate criticism, with Labour MP John Mann saying last night: ‘It sends the wrong message. This sort of award should go to an unsung hero who has given up their time for charity.’ Scroll down for video . Disbelief: Tony Blair accepted GQ's philanthropist of the year award at a glitzy ceremony in central London . Conservative MP Rob Wilson added: 'I can think of many awards Tony Blair might win but this wasn't one of them.' Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said the award was a 'a slap in the face for all the damage he had done to the UK'. He said: 'This is the man that could split the union, having given Scotland a parliament. 'And is advising dodgy countries around the world... GQ or generally queasy?' Tory MP Charlie Elphicke pointed out that Mr Blair has advised Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, including on how to improve his image after his police killed 14 unarmed protesters. He said: ‘It is jaw dropping that he should be given this award given his involvement in spinning the alleged brutal massacre in Kazakhstan. ‘People will be greatly concerned and wonder if this was the right decision.’ Gary Lineker tweeted: ‘Apparently, Tony Blair has won GQ’s philanthropist of the year award. Finally these awards have grasped irony!’ The GQ Men of the Year awards are popular among celebrities with many A-listers attending last night, including Kate Middleton’s sister Pippa and the model Cara Delevingne. Legacy: The decision to honour the former Prime Minister provoked immediate reaction on Twitter . On receiving his award at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, Mr Blair, 61, said: ‘I would like to dedicate this award to the people that work with and for my organisations.’ He and his wife Cherie have a property empire worth an estimated £30million, having bought homes for their children. Earlier this year, Mr Blair, who earns millions of pounds a year from his consultancy roles and charges fees of £250,000 for public speaking, was forced to deny being motivated by money. He insisted: ‘In respect to my new life, first of all, I have to say that reports of my wealth are greatly exaggerated. Just for the record, I read I’m supposed to be worth £100million – Cherie’s kind of asking where it is. I’m not worth that, half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that ... I could go on.’ Sherlock Holmes actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Doctor Who’s Peter Capaldi and Love Actually star Colin Firth all won gongs. Former Beatle Ringo Starr picked up an award for his humanitarian work and Pirates Of The Caribbean actor Johnny Depp presented punk pioneer Iggy Pop with the ‘icon’ trophy. The tribute to Mr Blair on the GQ website read: ‘In 2007 Tony Blair stepped down as prime minister, but his surging momentum’s shown no signs of slowing. ‘Alongside his role as a Middle East peace envoy, Blair’s channelled his energy into philanthropy, establishing three charities. ‘The Tony Blair Sports Foundation pairs volunteer sport coaches with children in Britain’s North East and his Faith Foundation aims to reconcile the three Abrahamic faiths, but his most ambitious is the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative. Bemusement: TV presenter Gary Lineker reacted to the news with a joke in one of many reactions on Twitter . One Twitter user compared the decision to honouring the fictional psychopath of Silence of the Lambs . Anger: Some insults were directed towards the lifestyle magazine itself, as well as its readers . Analogy: Another critic of the former PM invoked the serial killer Myra Hindley in his comparison . GQ's awards are among the most high-profile of the year. Mr Blair is pictured with presenter Banke Adetayo . 'Launched in 2008, the foundation operates in six African countries – Sierra Leone, Rwanda Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Senegal – where teams work alongside government bodies to bridge the gap between African leaders’ visions for a better future and their government’s ability to implement it.' But BBC journalist Sarfraz Manzoor tweeted: ‘It has been another hard day and just when I needed a laugh Tony Blair wins philanthropist of the year at the GQ awards.’ Bafflement: The actor Peter Serafinowicz said he had to restore his eyes after they popped out of their sockets . Theory: Users suggested the choice of Mr Blair was a publicity stunt to draw more attention to the award .","Award drew immediate criticism including from Labour MP John Mann .

"A young driver revved the engine of his car so much as a bizarre ‘tribute’ to late film star Paul Walker that it burst into flames. Niall Kinghorn was at a car rally paying respects to the Fast and Furious actor, who died in November last year, when his Ford Focus caught fire. He had been warned to stop revving the car by a crowd of onlookers at the Beach Boulevard car park in Aberdeen but he ignored them. Scroll down for video .

The 20-year-old admitted recklessly revving his car, causing it to catch fire to the danger of others, when he appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court. Sheriff Richard McFarlane called Kinghorn’s actions ‘crass stupidity’. The sheriff said: ‘I simply do not know what to make of this. You get together with auto enthusiasts. Part of the get-together was to pay respects to a deceased actor. ‘I have never heard of respects in this regard as to what you did on this occasion. 'Presumably you are counting your blessings that no other damage was sustained to other people’s property and there was no injury to any other participants.’ A court heard that Niall Kinghorn was with other car enthusiasts at the Beach Boulevard Retail Park in Aberdeeen as a tribute to the late Fast and Furious actor Paul Walker, pictured . Kinghorn was with other car enthusiasts at the Beach Boulevard Retail Park on December 14 when he started to rev the engine of his Ford Focus. Fiscal depute Karen Dow said: ‘During the evening on the Saturday, the accused was at an event organised as a tribute to a deceased actor. At 10pm the organiser and his partner heard a noise of a car engine revving excessively. ‘Although not unusual it continued for several minutes and it drew a large crowd.’ The organiser of the rally came across Kinghorn surrounded by crowds who were watching him continue to rev the engine. First responders gather evidence near the wreckage of a Porsche sports car that crashed into a light pole in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles last year, killing actor Paul Walker . The apprentice joiner’s car bonnet was open and witnesses could see the engine was glowing red. The court heard that he was warned to stop revving the engine just before it caught fire – shooting flames up in the midst of the crowd. Kinghorn was later interviewed by police and charged. Defence agent Peter Shepherd said: ‘The car burnt out. He was showing off or something. When he was told he went too far - it was too late.’ Sheriff McFarlane fined Kinghorn £750. Kinghorn refused to comment as he left court. Mr Walker, 40, was killed when a friend’s Porsche crashed and burst into flames in Los Angeles.","Niall Kinghorn, 20, revved engine of his car so much it burst into flames .

"Daniel Sturridge was last night ruled out of England’s Euro 2016 opener in Switzerland with a thigh injury. Sturridge pulled up during the morning training session at St George’s Park on Friday, reported discomfort in a thigh muscle and was whisked away for a scan. England’s medics assessed the results and decided the 25-year-old Liverpool striker was not fit to travel to Basle on Sunday for the game on Monday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England train at St.George's Park before Euro 2016 qualifier . Pain: Daniel Sturridge pulled up injured during a training session on St George's on Friday morning . Blow: Sturridge has been ruled out of England's first Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland . It is a blow for Roy Hodgson, who has now lost three of his original 22-man squad – Jack Colback and Ben Foster have also left the camp with injuries - but the manager has resisted the temptation to call in any replacements. The loss of Sturridge is without doubt the biggest blow. He has five goals in 16 appearances for his country and has become Hodgson’s established centre-forward since hitting prolific form following his move to Anfield from Chelsea. He would have retained his place up front against the Swiss but his absence provides the manager with the choice of making a simple straight swap, calling in Daniel Welbeck to partner captain Wayne Rooney in a 4-4-2 system, or making a slight reshuffle to move Raheem Sterling into a more central position. Sterling started on the left wing against Norway on Wednesday but finished the game in the centre, where he plays for Liverpool. He could play there in support of Rooney with Welbeck asked to play wide on the left. Gary Cahill also missed training on Friday. Cahill has a swollen ankle after aggravating a knock against Norway on Wednesday and worked alone in the gym, but he is confident of being fit for Monday. 'I should be fine,' said the Chelsea centre-half. 'I’ve got a bit of fluid on my ankle which they thought would be better rested.' Goal threat: Roy Hodgson will miss the quality the Liverpool man brings up top . Cahill missed out on another example of Hodgson’s new angry persona, as the England manager yelled at his players for failing to produce the tempo and intensity he wanted to see in a crossing and shooting drill. It followed his x-rated reaction to questions in the post-match press briefings his team had only managed two shots on target during Wednesday’s 1-0 win against Norway in a friendly at Wembley. 'I’ve seen that side of him before,' said Cahill. 'When he is upset he expresses his opinion and gets angry. He is also good at calming situations. I’ve seen a bit of both. 'Everyone wants it to be better. We’re no different and the manager is no different. That’s what you’re seeing - adding more pressure for us to do better. That’s really good. It’s easy to tick along when you’re winning games.' Gutted: Sturridge reacts to the news of his injury  via social networking site Twitter . At 28 and with 28 caps, Cahill is one of the senior squad members since Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard retired, and is ready to be one of the team’s leaders. 'I realise I’m one of the more experienced or older lads,' he said. 'But, what is leadership? Is it shouting at everyone every two minutes or is it trying to be in the right position, trying to lead by example? 'I think it’s a mixture of both. Saying sometimes what needs to be said but at the same time when you’re on the field just trying to organise people, which doesn’t necessarily have to mean throwing your arms everywhere. 'The young lads in this group will become more vocal. You have to be vocal when you’re playing. 'We are physical and that was a big strength in the past of English teams. We need to have that as a young group moving forward. We need to have that nasty side to us as well.'","The Liverpool forward injured his thigh during a training session on Friday .

"Louis van Gaal won’t have any excuses if Manchester United fail to mount a title challenge this season – he has easily the most expensive squad in the Premier League at his disposal. After a tumultuous summer transfer window closed last week, Mail on Sunday research can reveal the United boss has been left with a squad that cost £379.4million to assemble, more than either Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini or Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho can boast. Since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement a little over a year ago, United’s new 'noisy neighbours' policy has seen them spend a staggering £215 million on players to try and stay on top of the tree. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: A new team is not built in one month . No excuses:the Manchester United squad at Louis van Gaal's disposal is worth a staggering £379million . Big deals: Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao both arrived at Old Trafford in big-money moves this summer . Wayne Rooney: £27million, Michael Carrick: £18.6million, Rafael: £2.5million, . Antonio Valencia: £16million, Chris Smalling: £10million, Phil Jones: £16.5million . David de Gea: £18.9million, Ashley Young £16million, Robin van Persie: £24million . Marouane Fellaini: £27.5million, Juan Mata: £37.1million, Ander Herrera: £29million . Luke Shaw: £27million, Marcos Rojo: £16million, Angel Di Maria: £59.7million . Daley Blind: £13.8million, Falcao £4.8m (Loan fee) Total cost of squad = £379.4million . In the last window alone, they broke the British transfer record fee on Angel Di Maria and signed Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind before splashing out a further £5million to take Falcao on loan from Monaco. While Burnley broke their transfer record by paying £3million for George Boyd, United have 16 players that they paid at least £10million for. And while there has been criticism that the squad is top-heavy with attacking players, van Gaal will have a goalkeeper David de Gea and defenders Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Rafael, Rojo, Shaw and Blind available – signed for a total of £104.7million . To put it into context, the figure United have spent on defenders (including goalkeeper) is more than 15 Premier League clubs have spent on their entire squads. Record transfer: George Boyd joined Burnley for £3m - United boast 16 players who cost at least £10m . The change in the Premier League landscape is due to Roman Abramovich and Sheikh Mansour reining in spending to comply with financial fairplay regulations while United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward attempts to prove his club are major players in European football despite finishing only seventh last season and missing out on the Champions League. United want to build a team that mixes superstars and homegrown talent – an English version of Real Madrid during their Galactico years. The Essex-born accountant, who went to the same public school as Frank Lampard, may have a quieter personality than Manchester City’s former CEO Garry Cook but they have a similar vision for their football clubs; speculate to accumulate and make the world know you’re there. Woodward made it clear last year he would have broken the world-transfer record had Gareth Bale or Cristiano Ronaldo wanted to move to Old Trafford and he will spend more in January on Kevin Strootman and a top-class defender, with the option to buy Falcao for £45million next summer. Talented: Left back Luke Shaw moved to Manchester United from Southampton in a £30m switch . All smiles: Daley Blind shakes hands with manager Louis van Gaal having joined Man United from Ajax . Financial analysts Deloitte confirmed: ‘Manchester United have recorded the highest ever gross spend by a Premier League club in a summer transfer window. The Red Devils have spent £150m on new talent this window, representing 18% of the aggregate gross transfer spend by Premier League clubs.’ In one sense, it is a throwback to the years when Ferguson started out and consistently broke the transfer record to sign the likes of Gary Pallister, Roy Keane and Andy Cole. Over time though, particularly once The Glazers were installed, the spending dropped as City dominated. Now, the wheel is turning back as Woodward realises United can not afford to be out of Europe for more than a season if they want to attract the top talent. On the other side of Manchester, City - regarded as the biggest-spending club in world sport - will actually go into this season with a squad that is £26million cheaper than United’s, at £353.7million. Mourinho has a squad that cost £301.3million with plenty of other signings like Fernando Torres and Marco van Ginkel loaned out and not available to him this season. Overall, the figures underline the close relationship between how much you spend and what success you can expect to achieve. There is a huge gap in transfer spending between six clubs – United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham – and the rest. Everton have the seventh-most expensive squad, costing nearly £96million. Big spenders: Premier League clubs splashed the cash this summer in a bid to improve their squads . Two of the current bottom three in the Premier League, Burnley and Crystal Palace, are also in the bottom three of spenders. However, there are some exceptions. United, for one. They are No1 in spending but currently sit 14th in the table without a league win this season. That will change once the new signings all play, starting against QPR next Sunday. The other honourable exception is Swansea City. Their 25-man squad, plus eligible under-21s, cost a relatively modest £44.6million – less than any other club in the division bar four. Yet they have enjoyed success in the top flight over the last two seasons and are currently joint-top with maximum points from three matches. There is concern that the ever-increasing spending from the top Premier League clubs will kill competition over time and may even put clubs down the pecking order out of business. Former Manchester City manager Brian Horton, now assistant-manager at League One Doncaster Rovers, warned at the MBNA Northwest Football Awards last week: ‘The whole Premier League world has escalated out of all proportion in terms of transfer fees and players’ wages . ‘Unless we change something then some of those clubs lower down will go and that will be a major shame because the set-up we have, with the 92 clubs, is the best in the world.’ It’s a fair argument but van Gaal, who let his hair down last week while watching new signing Blind collect the Dutch Football Writers’ Player of the Season award, will point out he is under pressure too. United have talked the talk financially, there are now 379 million reasons for the Dutchman to walk the walk.","Manchester United have the most expensive squad in the Premier League .

"Dyson today announced its first robotic vacuum cleaner, after 16 years of research and £28 million of investment. The Dyson 360 Eye will cost in the region of £750 when it goes on sale in Britain next summer. The robot uses a panoramic camera lens on top of the machine to map its way around the house, moving on caterpillar tracks and cleaning each room before going back to its docking station. Scroll down for video . The Dyson 360 Eye (pictured) as a 360° lens so it knows where it is in a room and where it has already cleaned. It uses a panoramic camera lens on top of the machine to map its way around the house, moving on caterpillar tracks and cleaning each room before going back to its docking station . Infrared sensors will stop it bumping into furniture. Users will set its cleaning schedule via a smartphone app - allowing them to start a clean even when out of the house. The panoramic lens' shape and position gives the robot the ability to see around a room. Its live vision cameras capture 30 images a second, to build complete and continuously updated picture of its environment. The ‘eye’ also features ‘simultaneous localisation’ and mapping software to create a 360˚ view of the room. The Dyson 360 Eye robot can then identify features within these images to triangulate its position relative to the room, similar to how sailor use stars to navigate boats. It also detects objects and avoids obstacles ahead using proximity and infrared sensors. Elsewhere, it features a Dyson digital motor V2 that spins at 78,000RPM generating the highest suction of any robot vacuum. Its Radial Root Cyclone technology pulls microscopic dust and allergens out of the air and into the bin. Continuous Tank Tracks maintain speed and keep the robot on course as it moves across different floor types. And the Dyson Link app means owners can remotely control the robot vacuum, and schedule cleans. Dyson follows Miele, Samsung and LG into the robotic vacuum cleaning sector, but the company claims 360 degree camera - which can see all around the room at once - is unique. The UK firm says the machine has the most powerful suction of any robot vacuum on the market. The cleaner is powered by a V2 Dyson digital motor - the result of £150million of research - and uses the company’s bagless Cyclone technology to separate dust and dirt. Sir James Dyson, who launched the machine in Japan this morning, said: ‘Most robotic vacuum cleaners don’t see their environment, have little suction, and don’t clean properly. They are gimmicks. ‘We’ve been developing a unique 360 degree vision system that lets our robot see where it is, where it has been, and where it is yet to clean. ‘Vision, combined with our high speed digital motor and cyclone technology, is the key to achieving a high performing robot vacuum – a genuine labour saving device.’ The new machine is Dyson’s second attempt at a robotic cleaner. In 2001 the firm was close to launching the DC06 - a large robotic machine which relied on dozens of infrared sensors all around the body. The panoramic lens' (pictured) shape and position gives the robot the ability to see around a room. Its live cameras capture 30 images a second, to build a complete and continuously updated picture of its environment. The ‘eye’ also features ‘simultaneous localisation’ and mapping software to create a 360˚ view of the room . Continuous Tank Tracks, or caterpillar tracks, maintain speed and keep the robot on course as it moves across different floor types (pictured). Once the house is clean, the robot navigates back to its docking station . But the company decided to abandon the project and go back to the drawing board, . Weight - 2.37kg (5.2lbs) Size - 9 inches (23cm) diameter, 8.2inches (21cm) height . Width of cleaning path - 8.3inches (21.3cm). Motor wattage - 100W . Volume of dust bin- 0.4 litres . Battery life - 20-30 minutes without fading – it then returns to its docking station to charge . Cost – In the region of £750 . Date on sale – Summer 2015 in UK, Spring 2015 in Japan . Nick Schneider, a robotics design engineer at the firm, said: ‘This is a good example of how we will not release a technology until we are sure it will be a really high performer. ‘We were going to release the DC06 in 2001 but we decided to start again. It had so many sensors on it that it became really heavy and was just not right.’ Since then Dyson has had a permanent team of robotics engineers working on a robot cleaner. For the last two years 200 engineers have been working on the 360 Eye model, which weighs 2.37 kg (5.2lbs) - less than a full-sized Dyson cleaner. Dyson told MailOnline there were more than 420 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to technology used in the robot. The camera - which is central to its performance - takes up to 30 images of the room every second and means the machine can constantly establish where it is, where it has been and where it still needs to clean.

Dyson told MailOnline there were more than 420 patents and patent applications worldwide relating to technology used in the robot. It can also be controlled remotely using an app . The machine has 20 to 30 minutes of battery life and manoeuvres around on tank-like tracks that can take it over small obstacles. When it runs out of battery it will return to its docking station, resuming the clean when it has charged again. When the 0.4litre dust bin is full a message will be sent to the user’s smartphone. The cyclone technology captures particles down to 0.5 microns - or 600 times smaller than a standard typed full stop. The brush bar (pictured) extends to full width of the machine and uses patented carbon fibre technology to remove fine dust on hard floors, and has stiff nylon bristles to agitate and clean carpets. For the last two years 200 engineers have been working on the model, which weighs 2.37kg (5.2lbs) - less than a full-sized Dyson .

Rumours the company was working on a robotic vacuum cleaner gathered pace earlier this year when researchers at Imperial College London announced a £5 million tie-up focusing on the technology. Dyson said the 360 Eye, known until now as Project N223, followed £28 million worth of research and development by a team of more than 200 Dyson engineers. Algebra, probability theory, geometry and trigonometry was used to create the ‘eye’ of the machine, and 31 software engineers took more than 100,000 hours to create the navigation system. The machine has 20 to 30 minutes of battery life and manoeuvres around on tank-like tracks that can take it over small obstacles. It also detects objects and avoids obstacles ahead using proximity and infrared sensors . Dyson's robotic vacuum cleaner enters a market currently dominated by Roomba (pictured) which makes circular autonomous cleaners. This i-robot Roomba 562 model costs £360.

"Last week Paul Scholes questioned the culture of golden caps and glass cabinets when England players make their 100th international appearance. ‘What does 100 caps mean?’ he asked. ‘Did you win something? No.’ Frank Lampard didn’t win anything with England - other than the player of the year awards in 2004 and 2005 - but 106 caps is an exceptional achievement. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Frank Lampard on what it means to wear the England shirt . Farewell: Frank Lampard announced his international retirement after 106 caps for England on Tuesday . On Tuesday, at the age of 36, he confirmed his international retirement, making way for another generation of England players. It is 15 years since Lampard made his debut, against Belgium in October 1999. There were no gifts during Lampard’s international career. He earned every cap under Keegan, Sven Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson. Lampard timed his run to retirement, announcing it 48 hours before Hodgson names his first England squad since the diabolical performance at the World Cup. ‘Frank has been a superb representative of the English game,’ said Hodgson. ‘It is with regret that I accept and understand the decision he’s made.’ Beginnings: Lampard on his England debut - against Belgium at the Stadium of Light in October 1999 . When he was off form or out of favour with a manager, Lampard wasn’t the type to pull a hamstring or get a doctor’s note if he thought he wasn’t going to play. He turned up regardless. ‘I’m proud to get to 100 caps and to say I have done it like Bobby Moore because I grew up on stories of him,’ he revealed when he was on 99 caps last September. On Tuesday, after a final conversation with England’s head coach, Lampard confirmed he was stepping aside. He is a New York City player now, on loan at Manchester City until January, and his influence around the England camp would have been limited. ‘It has been a very tough decision. I have given it so much thought since the World Cup,’ he admitted in a statement on Tuesday. ‘Due to my club career going in a different direction it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first and also to concentrate on how I can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football.’ All smiles: Lampard played under Kevin Keegan, Sven Goran Eriksson, Steven McClaren, Fabio Capello and, latterly, Roy Hodgson during his England career which spanned 15 years . During the World Cup in Brazil he was a bystander, making his final England appearance, as captain against Costa Rica, when the team had already been knocked out. With Steven Gerrard also retired, at least we will never again have to suffer the debate about whether they can play in the same midfield. His biggest regret in an England shirt was his miss in the shoot-out against Portugal at the 2006 World Cup. ‘My dad gave me a little jolt on the phone to make sure I got my head down and got through it,’ he remembered. ‘You have ups and downs in your England career, but you don’t get to 100 caps unless you get through these moments.’ The following season, back in the a Chelsea shirt, he was taunted by opposition supporters singing: ‘You let your country down’. The reality is that he never did. Bad times: Lampard reacts after missing his penalty in the shoot-out with Portugal at the 2006 World Cup . He worked too hard, motivated throughout his career by the words of a former West Ham team-mate when he was doing extra sets of ‘doggies’ after training. ‘What the **** are you doing?’ shouted Martyn Mullen, getting a laugh out of the young players for saying it. Where are they now? Lampard is a proud Englishman. He wishes the famed golden generation could have won a major tournament. Perhaps David Beckham, Ashley Cole, John Terry, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney, Scholes, Gerrard and Lampard could have done more. They certainly had the talent. One final tournament: Lampard pictured in Rio de Janeiro during the 2014 World Cup . VIDEO Lampard announces England retirement . Lampard said: ‘It is time to move forward and I feel confident that with Roy Hodgson in charge, the young players we have and the changes being made to the youth system, that we will have success and a team this country deserves. ‘I have always been exceptionally proud and honoured to represent my country I enjoyed every minute of wearing the England shirt.’ After wearing it for 15 years, Lampard has earned a rest.","Frank Lampard announced retirement from international football on Tuesday .

"A huge section of a new Royal Navy aircraft carrier has set sail on the slow journey from a Clyde yard for completion on the other side of the country. The 11,300-tonne aft section of hull for HMS Queen Elizabeth will be carried by sea-going barge about 600 miles from Govan, Glasgow, to Rosyth on the Firth of Forth.

"A federal judge in Houston, Texas, has found oil . giant BP Plc 'grossly negligent' for its role in the 2010 . spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The ruling could add billions of . dollars in fines to the more than $42 billion in charges taken . so far for the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history. 'The Court concludes that the discharge of oil 'was the . result of gross negligence or willful misconduct' by BP, the . ruling from U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier said. A picture from 22 April 2010 shows a fire aboard the mobile offshore oil drilling unit Deepwater Horizon, located in the Gulf of Mexico . Shares of BP traded in the United States fell 5 percent today, or $2.40, to $45.31. The company has shrunk since it was forced to sell assets to . pay for the disaster aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig . that killed 11 workers. Barbier has yet to assign damages from the spill under the . federal Clean Water Act, though previous calculations by Reuters . have shown fines could run to $17.6 billion in the costliest . scenario. Barbier apportioned 67 percent of the fault to BP, 30 . percent to Transocean Ltd, which owned the drillship, . and 3 percent to Halliburton, which did cement work on . the Macondo well that blew out. BP bears the majority of responsibility among the companies involved in the nation's worst offshore oil spill, a federal judge ruled today. The judge essentially divided blame among the three companies involved in the spill, ruling that BP bears 67 percent of the blame; Swiss-based drilling rig owner Transocean Ltd. takes 30 percent; and Houston-based cement contractor Halliburton Energy Service takes 3 percent. In his 153-page ruling, Barbier said BP made 'profit-driven decisions' during the drilling of the well that led to the deadly blowout. 'These instances of negligence, taken together, evince an extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks,' he wrote. BP said in a news release that it would appeal the ruling, saying the company 'believes that an impartial view of the record does not support the erroneous conclusion reached by the District Court. 'It also repudiates BP's claims that it was merely negligent and will further damage BP's already badly damaged reputation,' Uhlmann wrote in an email. The judge was assigned to oversee most of the federal litigation spawned by BP's spill. Last year, he presided over two phases of a trial for claims against BP and its contractors brought by the federal government, the five Gulf states and private lawyers representing businesses and residents. Barbier heard eight weeks of testimony without a jury for the trial's first phase, which was designed to identity the causes of the blowout of BP's Macondo well and assign percentages of fault to the companies involved in the drilling project. The judge heard three weeks of testimony for the second phase, which focused on dueling estimates of how much oil spilled into the Gulf and examined BP's efforts to seal the well. Millions of gallons of crude gushed into the Gulf after the well blew and triggered an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, killing wildlife, staining beaches and polluting marshes. BP ultimately sealed its well after several techniques failed to stop the gusher. BP says it has spent more than $24 billion in spill-related expenses, including cleanup costs and payments to businesses and residents who claim the spill cost them money. BP pleaded guilty in January 2013 to manslaughter charges for the rig workers' deaths. BP also agreed to pay a record $4 billion in penalties as part of its deal with the Justice Department, but the plea agreement didn't resolve the federal government's civil claims against BP. Under the Clean Water Act, a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of either $1,100 or $4,300 per barrel of spilled oil. The higher limit applies if the company is found grossly negligent — as BP was in Barbier's ruling. But penalties can be assessed at amounts lower than those caps.","The ruling could add billions more in fines to the more than $42 billion in charges taken already .

"Ross Barkley is set to become the January transfer window’s biggest domestic saga and possibly the biggest domestic deal. Everton are ready to consider selling prized asset Barkley - perhaps for as much as £60million - to fund a spending spree in order to shore up their faltering squad and make sure the club does not tumble into the relegation battle. In that respect it is understood Everton will listen to offers is excess of £45m for Barkley. Ross Barkley (left) could be sold by Everton with Manchester City interested in signing the midfielder . Barkley has impressed since returning to the side after injury earlier in the season . Manchester City are the club most likely to make a move to sign the 21-year-old England international. Last summer Everton gave the player a new deal worth £65,000 a week to fend off interest from City. But as it stands City, who see fit-again Barkley as a player who could take them the extra mile in the Premier League title race, would offer to double the player’s wages, then play hard ball with struggling Everton over a fee which last summer was reported to be £60m. If Barkley is sold by Everton it could bring the situation of suddenly under pressure boss Roberto Martinez to a head. Roberto Martinez (left) is under pressure at Everton with Steve McClaren a rumoured possible replacement . As revealed last week, Martinez, seemingly fire proof at the start of the season, is now under pressure ahead of Tuesday’s FA Cup tie with West Ham. If Martinez was to be ousted then Derby manager Steve McClaren - on Newcastle’s shortlist - would be a contender for the Goodison hot seat. As revealed on November 1 in this column, Steven Gerrard would turn down a new reduced deal with Liverpool and seek new pastures in the USA. That has come to pass. Three Major League Soccer clubs - LA Galaxy, New York Red Bulls and Toronto FC - will bid for Gerrard. But given franchise parameters it is not yet clear who will be able to offer the former England player the £150,000-plus-a-week deal he wants after he rejected a new contract worth half that at Liverpool. Steven Gerrard (centre) will leave Liverpool at the end of the season with the MLS his likely destination . North American Soccer League side New York Cosmos are also still interested. There is also still interest in Gerrard in Europe - notably with Italian clubs Inter Milan and Napoli, as well as Spain’s Real Sociedad. Also as revealed in this column TWO months ago, Tottenham and Liverpool are about to go head to head for West Brom striker Saido Berahino. Ideally West Brom want £25m for the England Under-21 striker to fund a spending spree now to be masterminded by new boss Tony Pulis. Spurs value the player at £15m. Liverpool may go higher but have other targets, not least Bayern Munich’s want away Xherdan Shaqiri and possibly Jermain Defoe as a stop gap. Saido Berahino, who scored four goals in West Brom's 7-0 win over Gateshead, is wanted by several clubs . Jermain Defoe has suddenly become the most wanted striker available to Premier League clubs. Defoe, on offer from MLS soccer side Toronto FC, is being considered by Liverpool, Leicester, Hull, Crystal Palace and QPR. The best package will seal the deal - although a move to Palace and back to his London roots could appeal to Defoe if the Eagles stump up at least £70,000 a week. Palace also head the race to sign Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo on loan for the rest of the season. Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels has expressed a preference to join Manchester United which in turn would then see Arsenal land William Carvalho from Sporting Lisbon. I am hearing: Carlos Tevez is about to reject a new deal with Juventus. That could mean that in their final season at the Boleyn Ground and with the ramp up to the Olympic Stadium in mind, West Ham could well push the boat out and sign fans hero Tevez on a massive deal in the summer. Carlos Tevez is rumoured to be considering rejecting a new contract from Serie A club Juventus . Tevez (left) became a cult hero during his one season at West Ham . I am also hearing: Unlike predecessors Neil Warnock and Tony Pulis, new Palace boss Alan Pardew wont be wearing tracksuits on the touchline. Pardew prefers a more sophisticated, tailored 'Italian' manager look - and indeed employs the services of a personal tailor, Mark Powell of Soho, who makes suits for top stars ranging from Paul Weller to Sir Bradley Wiggins. BTW: Steven Gerrard deserves all the plaudits he has received. He has had a great career with Liverpool and England. It should be remembered though, amid all the sentimentality, that one of Gerrard’s motivations to leave Liverpool after all these years is because the two-year contract the club put on the table was, understandably, not as big as the one which will expire in the summer. About half in fact, a drop from around £140,000 a week to £70k. 1. Sir Bobby Charlton . 2. Paul Gascoigne . 3. Bryan Robson . 4. Martin Peters . 5. Alan Ball . 6. Frank Lampard . 7.

There is no doubt though, he has been one of the game’s all-time greats. It was interesting to see Sportsmail's Jeff Powell put Gerrard tenth in his top ten all time list of England midfielders. Of the midfielders I have seen - so I can’t include legends like Wilf Mannion or Duncan Edwards - here is my top 10. 1. Sir Bobby Charlton, 2 Paul Gascoigne, 3 Bryan Robson, 4 Martin Peters, 5 Alan Ball, 6 Frank Lampard, 7 Steve Gerrard, 8 Glenn Hoddle, 9 Paul Scholes, 10 David Beckham. I-Say: The farce surrounding the Frank Lampard situation highlights how flawed the loan system has become. It is now being suggested that beyond remaining 'on loan' at Manchester City from MLS team New York City until the end of the season (as opposed to joining up with them next month) Lampard may, in fact, be signed on a full-time basis by City from, er, City. Frank Lampard (centre) celebrates scoring Manchester City's third goal in their 3-2 win over Sunderland . Despite the ire of New York fans about the situation that would of course be a formality given both clubs have the same Abu Dhabi based owners. That in itself illustrates a potential long term danger of conflict of interest in the case of multiple ownership of clubs around the globe. Such scenarios will I suspect become more common. And of course the situation begs the question was there ever the intention for Lampard to play in New York in the first place? Was his move from Chelsea to the Big Apple then back to the Premier League with a rival club a way of making a smooth departure from Stamford Bridge to the Etihad? Also was it a way of City of getting around Financial Fair Play rules? Most pressingly, how it is a club like City, who have such a big squad they have often had 20 players out on loan at one time, able to take a player on loan themselves? Lampard takes part in a football clinic in New York in July after signing for New York City FC . Lampard, pictured during his unveiling at New York City FC, is yet to play a minute in the MLS . Surely the Premier League should step in and stipulate that a club who has more than say two players out on loan can’t take a player on loan. Moreover, there should be no loans between Premier League clubs unless the player is under 21 or over 30. The Premier League and FIFA decree third party ownership of players is against the spirit of the game. But I say the two scenarios above amount to the same. I-Bet: In recent seasons the FA Cup has recovered some of it’s magic. Wigan beating Manchester City in the final two seasons ago and Hull running Arsenal close last year have revived the notion that 'smaller' clubs can win silverware. Or at least get close. On that basis Southampton surely have a chance to go all the way this season. They are 20-1. West Ham who have an awkward trip to Everton on Tuesday are currently 40-1. Sam Allardyce has vowed to go all out in the FA Cup this season now the team are essentially safe. So it is worth a punt on the Hammers, who reached the final in 2006, at that price. A revived Spurs are 14-1. Chelsea are favourites at 5-1 with the usual suspects tucked in behind.","Manchester City interested in midfielder and will offer him £130,000 a week .

"In a season in which many big-name signings failed at Tottenham last season, one at last stood out as a player of the highest quality. Christian Eriksen turned up late in the Spurs spending spree last summer, arriving on August 31st from Ajax, one of seven transfers designed to fill the considerable hole left by Gareth Bale’s departure from the team. He ended up proving something more than an afterthought, however, being the player who most consistently delivered over the course of the season, despite a change of managers and playing philosophy mid-season from Andre Villas-Boas to Tim Sherwood, and his free kicks are now an established major part of Tottenham’s weaponry. Pass notes: Christian Eriksen (R) claims that Tottenham are playing like Ajax under Mauricio Pochettino . Philosophy: Mauricio Pochettino wants Spurs to play a high intensity passing and pressing game . ‘I think I was a bit impressed that I could keep up that level,' said Eriksen. ’I had so many games. At Ajax, there were a lot of games but you were in and out of them. Here it’s a harder competition and it got harder and harder, so I think I impressed myself.’ It wasn’t the easiest season in which to settle. ‘We had some pretty dark days,’ he says, referring to the 6-0 and 5-1 defeats against Manchester City, the 5-0 defeat to Liverpool. Now of course he has yet another manager to impress, his third in 11 months at Spurs, in Mauricio Pochettino. All the early signs are good. Eriksen looks to be carrying on from where he left off last season, with Pochettino’s insistence on passing football seemingly more to Eriksen’s taste than the direct style of Sherwood. In fact the Argentine manager seems closer to the Ajax philosophy that Eriksen imbibed as a youth in Amsterdam, where he trained under Dennis Bergkamp. Scroll down for videos... MVP: Christian Eriksen was one of the few new signings to shine at White Hart Lane last season . Changing guard: Christian Eriksen has played under three managers at Tottenham (L-R) Mauricio Pochettino, Tim Sherwood and Andre Villas-Boas . ‘It’s leaning towards Ajax way, yeah,’ said Eriksen. ‘I think a lot of the ideas are a bit similar: that he wants to play football; if you can turn, you turn; if you can play forward, you play forward. And again it’s a bit about ball possession and structure and where you need to run.’ There is one downside to the Pochettino way: the constant pressing he insists upon requires a level of intensity in pre-season training that few of the Tottenham players have previously experienced. ‘It’s been a hard pre-season,’ admitted Eriksen. ‘We’ve been getting closer to where we want to be when the season starts. It is pretty hard. The first few weeks there were times when we went to bed pretty early. ‘Now of course you try to get used to it. There have been double sessions two times a week when we were training at 10 o' clock and then again at 4, so it’s a long day. Mentally as well it’s pretty hard but it’s fun to play football, so it’s alright.’ Dutch of class: The Denmark international believes the manager has got them playing like former club Ajax . Mentors: The Tottenham playmaker was schooled by Holland legends Dennis Bergkamp and Frank de Boer (L) Famously Pochettino had Southampton players walking over hot coals in pre-season last year, though it seems Spurs’ players have been spared that for now. ‘We haven’t done that,’ says Eriksen, a little alarmed at the suggestion. ‘Only at Southampton are they walking on fire!’ Neverthless, Eriksen, like everyone in football, was taken with Pochettino’s Southampton last season. ‘I think I was impressed like everyone else. When we played against them they wanted to play football and for me personally that’s a good thing, that you want to keep the ball and create something.’ As for those Eriksen specials, the free kicks in which he now has a reputation, there has been less time to practice at present, given the intensity of the training. ‘I do spend a lot of time on them but I haven’t done it this much in the pre-season. On target: The 22-year-old scored seven league goals for Tottenham last season . 'We are training really hard so you don’t want to load your legs too much, too early. But last year it was pretty much every day doing shooting and that is probably going to happen again this season. ‘I prefer to practice with a keeper. It’s funny to beat the keeper.’ Hugo Llloris is spared that indignity, however; a reserve team keeper usually comes out to help Eriksen. It’s a skill he developed as a youngster at Ajax, where Bergkamp was his youth team coach, although for this area of the game he had to seek help from elsewhere. ‘I’ve never really seen him (Bergkamp) shoot a free-kick. Thierry Henry used to take them at Arsenal. So he didn’t teach me anything about free-kicks, no. I learnt some from Frank de Boer. He loved to take free-kicks as well. He tried to help me sometimes.’ We're ready! Tottenham will hope to hit the ground running after a decent pre-season campaign . Hammered time? Tottenham play West Ham in their opening game after losing to them three times last season . New season: Lionel Messi stars in FIFA 15 . On Saturday against West Ham we will get an idea as to whether the Pochettino era has begun to make some substantial differences to Tottenham. They lost three times to West Ham last season, thrashed 3-0 at home, losing in the Capital One Cup and then going down at Upton Park at the end of the season after Younes Kaboul was sent off early on. ‘I don’t know why we played badly against them,’ said Eriksen, speaking at the launch of EA Sports new Premier League deal. ‘We still had chances but we didn’ t score and they did. Of course we were a bit unlucky with the red card and everything. Hopefully, if we keep ourselves in the game, we’ll have a better chance than we had last year. Of course, they play different from what we want to do, but we will have to show we can do better than last year.’ Indeed, and if Pochettino pre-season training is anything to go by, they should at least come out of the blocks flying.

"A ranger and two park workers have been arrested on suspicion of rhino poaching in South Africa's flagship wildlife reserve. They were found with a hunting rifle and ammunition in the Lower Sabie area of Kruger National Park on Sunday after a recently killed rhino was found in the area. The arrests came after an anti-poaching intelligence operation that included police and park employees. A ranger and two park workers have been arrested on suspicion of rhino poaching at Kruger National Park. This carcass was found at the Satara camp in April 2013 in a separate incident . CEO of South African National Parks, Abe Sibiya, said: 'It is unfortunate that those trusted with the well-being of these animals are alleged to have become the destroyers of the same heritage that they have a mandate to protect.' Reynold Thakhuli, a spokesman for the parks service said the alleged corruption was extremely disturbing. 'These are the people that we entrusted with the welfare of these animals,' he said. 'These are just elements that unfortunately have allowed themselves to be used by syndicates.' White rhinoceros in Kruger National Park, South Africa, which is being targeted by poachers . Kruger Park lies in the northeast part of South Africa and is nearly 20,000 square kilometres, almost the size of small countries such as Israel and El Salvador. Hundreds of rangers patrol the park with some air support and backing from the South African military, but conservationists say more resources are needed to adequately protect Kruger's wildlife. The park has been hit hard by rhino poachers, many of whom cross over from neighbouring Mozambique. Home to most of the world's rhinos, South Africa is struggling to stem a surge in rhino poaching in recent years as demand for rhino horn rises in some parts of Asia, including China and Vietnam. Some people view rhino horn as a status symbol and a healing agent, despite a lack of evidence that it can cure. The horn is made of keratin, a protein also found in human fingernails. Rhino poacher Mandla Chauke has been sentenced to 77 years in prison after being arrested in Kruger National Park in 2011. Hundreds of rangers patrol the park with some air support and backing from the South African military . Rhinos were once common throughout Africa and Asia with an approximated worldwide population of 500,000 in the early twentieth century. But despite intensive conservation efforts, poaching of this  species is dramatically increasing, pushing the remaining rhinos closer and closer towards extinction. The Western black rhino was declared extinct by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) in 2011, with the primary cause identified as poaching. All five remaining rhinos species are listed on the IUCN Redlist of threatened species, with three out of five species classified as critically endangered. South Africa is home to 83 per cent of Africa’s rhinos and 73 per cent of all wild rhinos worldwide. A staggering 668 Rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa in 2012, almost two a day. In April 2013, more than 203 rhinos had been poached and 60 poachers had been arrested in South Africa. Of those arrested, 36 were caught in Kruger National Park. By August that year, Kenya reported that it had lost 34 rhinos to poaching since the start of 2013.","A ranger and two employees at Kruger National Park have been arrested .

"Sprinter Adam Gemili holds up his Olympic Games pass, with a photos of someone completely different . He's one of the most talked-about British athletes competing in the Olympics and Great Britain's great hope in the 100metres. But someone in the Locog security team hasn't read all the hype about teenage sprinter Adam Gemili. When the running sensation arrived in London to pick up his Games pass - it had a photo of someone completely different on it. The confused junior world champion posted a photo of his pass, and the mystery man, on his Twitter page - and asked followers for help identifying the fake Adam Gemili. He wrote: 'My Olympic accreditation to get into the games, who even is this guy?!?!?' Many of Team GB's track and field stars have been based at a training camp in Portugal, and are arriving at the Olympic Village just days before they're due to compete. And organisers admit Gemili's mix-up wasn't an isolated incident. Particularly after a series of security fiascoes. British Olympic Association deputy chef de mission, Sir Clive Woodward, told BBC Sport: 'It's happened a few times to be fair and I've tried to meet most athletes when they arrive to solve any problems. 'It is a big issue from a security point of view as the picture has to match the person so I know we've dealt with it as it came to us last night.' The 18-year-old is being hailed as one of Britain's 'golden generation' of future superstars, but he only started running seriously in January. The Londoner, who is currently . studying a BTEC diploma in sport at Barking and Dagenham College, only . quit football last November to focus on running. Before that the teenager's sporting career seemed destined to be played out on the football pitch rather than the running track. Adam Gemili raced to victory in the World Junior Championships last month, setting a new personal best of 10.05 . The former Dartford Grammar School pupil -  who is of Moroccan and Iranian descent - . was signed up by Chelsea when he was just eight years old and spent . seven years with the European Champions before switching to his local . club Dagenham and Redbridge. He . spent part of last season on loan at nearby Blue Square Bet South side . Thurrock, but was still training with Dagenham and Redbridge until the . end of the year, when he swapped his football boots for runners spikes. His transition to sprinter was complete earlier this month when Gemili won the World Junior Championships with a phenomenal time of 10.05 seconds.","Adam Gemili, 18, given wrong pass after arriving in London for 2012 .

"Mail readers have raised more than £13,000 to help Sophie Thomlinson take her first steps . Daily Mail readers have raised more than £13,000 towards surgery to help a two-year-old disabled girl take her first steps. Sophie Thomlinson was born prematurely and has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which means she cannot use her legs. An operation on her spine would enable her to walk, but she was denied NHS funding meaning her family was faced with raising the £25,000 cost themselves. After Sophie’s plight was featured in yesterday’s Mail, generous donations from readers mean the family now have more than half their target. One donor, John Marlow, wrote on their online fundraising page: ‘Moved to tears by the Daily Mail article – often think the people in charge of funding get their priorities wrong.’ Sophie’s mother Allison, 40, thanked readers for their kindness and said the amount donated was ‘mind-blowing’. Mrs Thomlinson said: ‘I was angry, upset and frustrated at how cosmetic surgery can be available on the NHS yet a procedure to help Sophie and improve her life isn’t. It is a child’s right to be able to walk. ‘The money raised so far is overwhelming, I keep thinking I’m going to wake up from a dream.’ The toddler, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, had been referred to a specialist at Leeds General Infirmary who can carry out the selective dorsal rhizotomy  (SDR) procedure. But the hospital was not granted funding by commissioning body NHS England, meaning she could have surgery only if it was paid for privately. Last year another hospital within the same Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust granted breast enhancement surgery to aspiring model Josie Cunningham at taxpayers’ expense, as she said her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’. NHS England policy states SDR is ‘not routinely funded’, although guidelines from rationing body NICE state it should be ‘considered’ for children with spastic diplegia. The policy is under review and campaigners fear a cost-saving decision could be made to remove funding entirely. Cerebral palsy charities last night condemned the NHS for funding procedures like £15,000 gastric band operations and Miss Cunningham’s £4,800 breast implants, but not SDR surgery. Stars Foundation, a cerebral palsy charity established by Dame Vera Lynn, said it was asked for help ‘all the time’ by families whose NHS funding for SDR surgery had been withdrawn. Family: Sophie with brother Lewis and parents Allison and Craig - who are trying to raise £25,000 for their daughter's operation . Sophie has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which means she cannot use her legs . Trustee Diana Beeny said: ‘I appreciate the NHS hasn’t got funding for everything. ‘But perhaps the people who are prioritising these operations haven’t got it right.’ Between 155 and 258 children a year with cerebral palsy could be considered for SDR surgery. In many cases their families have to raise money to have the procedure performed here or in the US, after being turned down for NHS funding. A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘We understand how difficult this is and sympathise with the family who feel they may benefit from this treatment. However the current evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient effectiveness for its routine use and we need to be assured of this.’ Visit www.justgiving.com/sophies-tiny-steps to donate to Sophie’s surgery fund.","Sophie Thomlinson was born prematurely and has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which means she cannot use her legs .

"Demands: Cecilia Giménez wants Santuario de Misericordia Church, near Zaragoza, to hand over a share of the thousands of euros . The Spanish 80-year-old whose DIY restoration ruined a 19th-century work of art is suing the church where it hangs after her hapless handiwork became an unlikely cash cow. Cecilia Giménez wants Santuario de Misericordia Church, near Zaragoza, to hand over a share of the thousands of euros it has earned in admission fees since her disastrous decoration job became a tourist attraction. And she is also instructing a legal team to explore copyrighting her rough and ready renovation to retain future profits, reports national television station TVE. The octogenarian sparked widespread . outrage in August when she marched, oil brush and paint in hand, into . the tiny church in the town of Borja and daubed over Elías García . Martínez’s Ecce Homo (Behold the Man) without permission. The . 120-year-old fresco of Jesus Christ wearing a crown of thorns was . terrifyingly transformed into what many have said now looks like a . monkey. She was . labelled insane and the worldwide attention reportedly brought on a . series of panic attacks, but she insisted throughout that the church’s . priest had allowed her to repair the piece. Locals . were horrified and, to add insult to injury, it emerged that a local . Catholic cultural foundation had earlier received money from Martínez’s . granddaughter, Teresa Garcia Blanc, to restore the crumbling damp-ridden . fresco to its former glory. Before and after: Cecilia Jimenez, 80, painted her crude rendition of Christ's face (right) over Elijah Garcia Martinez's original (left) But Giménez’s sloppy workmanship has . ended up as a mixed blessing for the church that, despite being mocked . across the world, has seen a huge upsurge in the number of visitors. It . was to prevent what town Mayor Miguel Arilla described as ‘disruptive . pilgrims’ from overtaking the area that the Santi Spiritus Hospital . Foundation, the church’s owners, started charging a €1 entrance fee. And Ecce Mono, or Behold the Monkey as it has now jokingly been called, made more than €2,000 in just the first four days. A . staggering 30,000 visitors are said to have passed through the doors . since August, but the fee was only introduced on Saturday. The current . total of ‘gate receipts’ is not known. Tourists flock to see the damaged 19th century Ecce Homo fresco (right) by artist Elias Garcia Martinez at the Santuario de Misericordia de Borja Church, at Borja in Spain's Aragon region . Spokesman José María Aznar told El . Correo newspaper: ‘Out of 20 people who came in, only one person put in . any money, so we decided to introduce an admission fee. ‘Although, despite that, it’s true that one day we also had someone who dropped in a €50 note.’ And . visitor Carmen Udaeta said: ‘As we were in the area, we thought we’d go . and see the work. It’s true that before all this we never knew, or had . heard of, or even knew where Borja was.’ The . interest has led to Giménez and her family hiring lawyers to seek . royalties, and the Foundation also hiring its own legal team to counter . the claims.

Several smartphone apps have also sprung up, allowing users to ‘eccehomonise’ themselves by restoring their pictures in a similar style. And budget airline Ryanair has launched a €12 flight for tourists to travel to Zaragoza from any of their airports to see the ‘creative restoration’.","Cecilia Giménez, 80, wants Santuario de Misericordia Church, near Zaragoza, to hand over a share of admission fees paid to see her decoration job .

"He may not have won his race - nor even come close - but he certainly won the hearts of the crowd. They roared Niger rower Hamadou Djibo Issaka across the finish line at Eton Dorney as he finished his heat in last place - 100 seconds . behind the winner. The valiant performance in the men's single sculls repechage has seen him hailed as the 'Eric the Eel' of London 2012. But there were some who failed to be moved by the efforts of the man who only took up the sport just three months ago. Five-time Olympic rowing gold medalist Sir Steve Redgrave hit out at the decision by organisers to allow him to row. Hamadou Djibo Issaka of Niger has become an early hero of the London 2012 Olympics - this Games' answer to Eric the Eel . A giant screen tracked Issaka's performance as he tried in vain to catch the other rowers . Champion: Redgrave with his collection of Olympic golds . He . said: 'There are better scullers from different countries who are not . allowed to compete because of the different countries you've got.' The 35-year-old's performance has made him London . Games' answer to Eric the Eel, the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea who . made headlines when he finished last in the 100 metres freestyle at the . Sydney Games in 2000. Issaka is at the Games courtesy of a . wild card  from the IOC Tripartite Commission, which allows each . National Olympic Committee up to five athletes to participate at a . summer games. Previously a swimmer, he was handpicked by the Niger Swimming Federation, who sent him to Egypt to try rowing. After finding his feet, he then went for more training at the International Rowing Development Centre in Tunisia for two months. His achievements in the past 12 weeks have earned him the status of the landlocked Saharan nation's national rowing champion. Slow start: Issaka can be seen struggling early on in the ehat as Lithuania's Mindaugas Griskonis (in green) and Taiwan's Wang Ming-Hui pull away . Issaka charges across the finish line at Eton Dorney, 100 seconds behind the heat winner - just three months after he took up rowing . First there was Eric the eel — now meet Jennet the Jellyfish, competing in the same event as Britain's Rebecca Adlington. Jennet Saryyeva of Turkmenistan finished a minute and 18 seconds behind the rest of the competitors in her 400m freestyle heat. Her . time of 5min 40.29sec is two seconds outside her personal best. Eric . ‘the eel’ Moussambani shot to fame at the 2000 Games in sydney when he . swam the 100m freestyle in 1min 52.72sec — more than twice the time of . the faster competitors and even outside the 200m world record. It was, however, a new personal best and a national record for Equatorial Guinea. His early success faded fast on Saturday as he was quickly outclassed by the other rowers in his heat. But Issaka was thrilled with his performance. Grinning ear-to-ear as he climbed out of his boat, he told reporters: 'It went well. I passed the finish line, it was great.' 'There were so many people encouraging . me.' 'I was happy to finish under their applause. Really, I'm happy for the whole country.' And following Redgrave's criticism Matt Smith, general secretary of world governing body FISA, insists he was added to the program and didn't take the place of another rower. And he's proud of the way the crowd took to the underdog, adding: 'We are so proud. It's given us a new country, and a big boost. As far as rowing is concerned it's fantastic. And we are really happy about the response from the spectators.' Issaka, meanwhile has had the experience of a lifetime. On Friday, instead of being tucked up in bed before his early-morning heat the next day, he was inside the Olympic Stadium attending the opening ceremony. He had been advised not to but he couldn't resist. 'It was magnificent,' he said. 'I had never seen fireworks before in my life!' He certainly didn't produce any fireworks in Sunday's race. But it will probably go down as one of the moments of the London Games. 'I'm preparing for the next competition,' he said. 'I'm happy with how things have gone.' Torchbearer: Sir Steve passed on the Olympic flame to seven up-and-coming athletes at the Opening Ceremony . Making a splash: Eric 'the Eel' Moussambani of Equatorial Guinea finished his men's 100m freestyle more than a minute slower than the world record at Sydney 2000 .","35-year-old only took up rowing three months ago .

He is now in a critical condition in hospital. His wife was also seriously injured and another person was also hurt in the atrocity in the village of Velika Ivanca, 30 miles southeast of the capital Belgrade. Terrified residents said if a police patrol car hadn't shown up, they all would have been dead. A picture from a villager's family album shows the alleged killer (circled in red) and also some of the victims . A younger Ljubisa Bogdanovic (left). A policeman (right) stands guard in the village of Velika Ivanca, where the war veteran allegedly shot dead 13 people, including his mother and son . Milorad Veljovic, the head of the national police force, said Bogdanovic first killed his 42-year-old son Branko in the head in their home. He then wounded his wife before killing . 12 neighbors, some of whom were still asleep, in four nearby homes, . Veljovic said in an interview with state broadcaster RTS. Among the reported dead are Mikailo . and Milena Despotovic, their grandson Goran, his 19-year-old wife Jovana . and their two-year-old son. Suspect: A neighbour shows a picture of Bogdanovic (second from left in a blue shirt) A forensic expert arrives at the village. The gun attack took place in a village close to the Serbian capital of Belgrade, pictured. The shooter is reportedly a 60-year-old man . In the . small lush village surrounded by fruit trees, the suspect's older . brother Radmilo broke down in tears, unable to explain why the massacre . had happened. 'Why did he do it? ... I still can't believe it,' he said sobbing, covering his face with his hands. 'He was a model of honesty. 'As a child, he was a frightened . little boy. I used to defend him from other children. He couldn't even . slaughter a chicken,' he said. But he said his brother had changed . after serving in the army during a brutal Serb-led offensive against the . eastern Croatian town of Vukovar in 1992 - the worst bloodshed during . Croatia's 1991-95 war for independence. 'The war had burdened him,' Radmilo . told The Associated Press in an interview. 'He used to tell me: ""God . forbid you live through what I went through"" ...

Twelve people in the village were killed immediately between 5 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. and one person died later in a Belgrade hospital, Veljovic said. 'Most of the victims were shot while they were asleep,' Veljovic told reporters. 'The most harrowing scene discovered by police was the dead bodies of a young mother and her two-year-old son.' The suspect had lost his job last year at a wood-processing factory, the police chief said. Residents expressed deep shock, describing the suspect as a nice, quiet man. 'He knocked on the doors and as they were opened he just fired a shot,' said villager Radovan Radosavljevic. 'He was a good neighbor and anyone would open their doors to him.

Many Serbs own guns guns, which are readily available mostly from the war in the Balkans in the 1990s . Still, neighbors said an entire five-member family was shot dead in one house, including the small boy who was the suspected killer's cousin.

'If they didn't stop him, he would have wiped us all out,' Kostadinovic said, standing in front of his two-story, red tile- roofed house. 'He shot himself when police stopped him.' A resident shows an album with photographs of people living in the village. One of those shot dead was a tw0-year-old .

She said when her husband opened their door, a policewoman shouted: 'Get back in!'. 'He was shooting everybody. Police saved us,' she said. - Police chief Milorad Veljovic . The suspected killer owned a gun but neighbors and his brother said he never hunted or shot weapons, even at weddings or celebrations as is traditional in the Balkans. 'He was quiet as a bug,' Stanica Kostadinovic said. Nada Macura, a Belgrade hospital spokeswoman, said the suspect had no known history of mental illness. Stanica Kostadinovic, the neighbor, said the man's father had hanged himself when he was a young boy and his uncle had a history of mental illness. Police blocked off the village while forensic teams and investigators in white protective robes took evidence from homes where the shootings took place. Doctors said later the suspect's condition was critical but his wife was able to communicate with the hospital staff. Tragic: A two-year-old boy was one of the slain, said Serbian police director Milorad Veljovic . Veteran: Bogdanovic is reported to have fought in the war between Croatia and Serbia in the 1990s . Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said . the killings showed that the government must pay more attention to gun . control and other social problems facing the Balkan nation, which is . still reeling from the 1990s wars. Initial reports said the alleged killer had a license for the handgun he used in the shootings since 1981. The government held an emergency . session and was expected to proclaim a national day of mourning. Although such apparent random shootings . are rare in Serbia, weapons are readily available mostly from the war in . the Balkans in the 1990s and there is a tradition of possessing . firearms.

"Fleeing: Katia Wanzeler was arrested while trying to leave the country at JFK airport on Wednesday night. She is the wife of fugitive accused Ponzi schemer Carlos Wanzeler . The wife of an accused $1 billion Ponzi schemer was arrested at New York's JFK airport Wednesday as she boarded an international flight. Katia Wanzeler's husband Carlos Wanzeler, 45, co-owner of Boston-area telecommunications firm TelexFree, was accused by federal authorities in April of bilking investors and has since fled to his home country of Brazil. Katia Wanzeler, whose name appeared on some of the checks amounting to $38 million that were found when her husband's partner James Merrill was arrested was arrest last week, was brought in on a material witness warrant. The . Massachusetts State Department said that it had notified judges in . Nevada, where the company has filed for bankruptcy, of their civil suit . against Telexfree, which promoted itself as an internet phone company . with offices in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and Brazil. The . action seeks to get money back for Telexfree investors. Just in . Massachusetts, the company made $90 million, plus millions more . overseas, officials said. 'The . scope of this alleged fraud is breathtaking,' U.S. Attorney Carmen . Ortiz said. 'As alleged, these defendants devised a scheme which reaped . hundreds of millions of dollars from hard working people around the . globe.' Following her husband? Carlos Wanzeler fled to Brazil after federal authorities accused him of bilking up to $1 billion from investors in his Boston-area company TelexFree . Nabbed: The couple come from Brazil and Carlos Wanzeler is accused of stealing mostly from Brazilian investors. Katia was arrested on a material witness warrant . Ponzi scheme? TelexFree billed itself as a VoIP company, but authorities say new investments were only passed along to older investors . Brian . McNiff, spokesman of Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, . said the courts in Nevada have been informed of the case that the judge . would take that into account when he decides on the issue. Galvin . has accused Telexfree of operating a pyramid scheme, as it did not sell . any actual product and promised exorbitant profits in exchange for . posting ads on the Internet. In order to gain from their investments, . clients were asked to pay between $289 and $1,375. Officials say the . company paid them with the money brought in by the new investors. The next court date between Telexfree and its creditors has been scheduled for May 22 in Nevada. When . it filed for bankruptcy, Telexfree said it had assets of between $50 . million and $100 million. The news of its bankruptcy spread fast and . provoked panic among investors. Many . of the investors were Brazilian immigrants in the Boston area, but the . company had offices or representatives in other Latin American countries . and even in Africa. Complaints about the company have surfaced on . social media sites from places including the Dominican Republic, Peru, . Ecuador and Uganda.

"Tragedy: Charlie Kelsey-Neil, 12, was found hanging in his bedroom by a younger sibling . A 12-year-old schoolboy accidentally hanged himself in his bedroom just two weeks after jokingly wrapping a cable around his neck in a classroom prank, an inquest heard today. Charlie Kelsey-Neil, 12, was a big fan of street magician Dynamo who often enjoyed watching the British-born star's TV shows. An inquest in Medway heard how he was found by a younger sibling at the family home in Canterbury, Kent. His mother Caroline, 31, and stepfather Jovan Neil, 26, desperately tried to revive him but he was pronounced dead later that evening. Mr Neil told the inquest the incident was not a cry for help and Charlie had never given any indication of wanting to harm himself. Mr Neil said that Charlie, who had ADHD, . loved watching magic tricks and would pretend . to be Spiderman. He said: 'He was not interested in looking on the internet, but when he did it was about fishing and magic tricks. 'He became really interested in Dynamo who does street magic.' The inquest heard Charlies had loosely put an internet cable around his neck and jokingly faked a hanging pose in front of Year 8 classmates just two weeks before his death. Charlie, a pupil at a school in Canterbury, Kent, was found unconscious at home in Sittingbourne last October. Patricia Harding, the Coroner for . Medway, said: 'I totally rule out suicide. There is no evidence he was . suffering from depression or anything of that sort. Inquest: Charlie, pictured on a fishing trip, wrapped a cord around his neck and pulled a hanging pose in front of his classmates as a prank just two weeks before his death . 'The evidence shows that it was probable that it was the unintentional consequence of a deliberate action. 'The probable cause of death is that it was an accident. It is a very tragic case.' After the hearing Charlie's family said: 'Charlie was a lovely boy with a real get up and go personality.He loved the outdoors and would even camp in the garden. 'He was a good brother and very protective of his siblings. He was always there for them and his smile could light up any room. 'All his friends have nothing but good things to say about him and he is sorely missed, we all loved him so much.' The coroner ruled the schoolboy's death was an accident.","Charlie Kelsey-Neil was a fan of the street TV magician Dynamo .

"Miracle recovery: Daniel Sturridge recovered from a bout of meningitis to score Team GB to victory . Just a month ago Daniel Sturridge was facing Olympic heartache and weeks in hospital after being disagnosed with meningitis. Tonight the 23-year-old was the star of Great Britain's football team, scoring the goal that ensured Team GB progressed to the Olympic quarter-finals. Sturridge shone against Uruguay at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, an incredible feat for a player who just weeks ago could barely walk. The striker's goal - his second in two games - was the least the team deserved from yet another . encouraging display, which maintained improvement from previous matches. It came on the stroke of half time, courtesy of Joe Allen's weaving run and drilled cross, which Sturridge gratefully prodded home. Chances were otherwise few and far between, but Team GB did enough to deserve their place at the top of their group and a place in the final eigh - emulating the achievements of their female counterparts 24 hours earlier. The men will play South Korea in Cardiff on Saturday night, the winners likely to face favourites Brazil in Manchester next Tuesday. Sturridge's solid performance will have been noted by watching England manager Roy Hodgson, scouting ahead of the national team's friendly against Italy this month. The fact the Chelsea striker is even being considered to represent his country bears testament to the swift medical attention he received after he was diagnosed with meningitis. The 23-year-old stabbed home the goal that ensured Team GB beat Uruguay . He said last week:  'I just remember . going along to a school one Thursday, handing out medals to kids, and I . think I must have caught the bug there. I felt absolutely fine before . that. 'I would not wish what I have had on . my worst enemy. It is a really difficult thing to get through and, . without the help of the Chelsea doctor, my family and my girlfriend, it . would have been even more difficult. 'I was fortunate enough to have a doctor who saw the warning signs straight away and got me off to a hospital bed immediately. Celebration: Team GB will now face South Korea in the quarter finals in Cardiff on Saturday . 'I was quarantined for five days and . if I hadn't taken any antibiotics in the hospital, I wouldn't have had a . chance of taking part in the Olympics. 'I am not going to say I would have died but I don't think I would have recovered as quickly as I have done and been here today. 'I went from being in tip-top condition suddenly to being sick and feeling weak. It was even difficult for me to walk.

Despite . raising the cash, the family has been devastated by news that Leeds . General Infirmary will not operate because Sophie’s condition is ‘not . severe enough yet’. Allison Thomlinson raised £50,000 for Sophie to have surgery which she believed would help her walk. But, she was then devastated to be told Sophie does not qualify for surgery . A girl of . two who was given a chance to take her first steps after generous Daily . Mail readers raised more than £50,000 for life-changing surgery has been . turned down for the operation in the UK. The . family of cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson were told to find . money for an operation to enable her to walk after she was denied NHS . funding. Despite . raising the cash, the family has been devastated by news that Leeds . General Infirmary will not operate because Sophie’s condition is ‘not . severe enough yet’. The . hospital is within the same NHS Trust that last year provided breast . enlargement surgery at taxpayers’ expense to an aspiring glamour model . who claimed her small breasts ‘ruined her life’. Now . the Thomlinsons face paying £75,000 to take Sophie abroad for selective . dorsal rhizotomy – an operation on the lower spine to improve mobility. Mrs Thomlinson says she is particularly upset because so many people donated to help pay for the operation . Doctors at Leeds General Infirmary have told Mrs Thomlinson that Sophie does not need the operation and that it would not be in her best interests for it to be carried out . Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Yesterday Sophie’s mother Allison, 40, said she was ‘bitterly disappointed’ at the decision. ‘We . knew we had to have an assessment before the operation but we were told . she had all the right characteristics – we just had to raise the . money,’ Mrs Thomlinson said. ‘Now, thanks to everyone who has donated, we have the money – so it was such a blow to be told no. On paper everything said she was an ideal candidate for the surgery, but . when they saw her they said she wasn’t severe enough yet.' 'You . think, ''She can’t walk, how severe do you have to be?' I was so upset . and angry I just couldn’t speak because I knew I would cry. It is so . frustrating to think of the girl who had the boob job. Sophie, . from Dukinfield, near Manchester, was born prematurely and has a form . of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia. She suffers painful spasms in . her legs and cannot stand unsupported. She . shuffles around on her knees, which causes bruising and means she . cannot play with her friends. Her mother said: ‘It hurts me so much when . we go out to the park and she sees people running around. She wants to . join in but she has to just sit there waving.’ Doctors said surgery would not benefit Sophie now. They advised the family to return in a year to see if her condition worsens. Mrs Thomlinson has now been told that Sophie will be reassessed in a year's time . Mrs Thomlinson remains convinced Sophie should have the operation and is angry that she is being denied it even though the NHS does not need to pay for it . A . spokesman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust said: ‘We would only . recommend undergoing surgery if the complex range of tests we carry out . showed there would be a benefit.’ But . Mrs Thomlinson and her husband Craig, 44, are worried Sophie would only . be deferred again next year, so she will now be assessed by Dr Tae . Park, the American surgeon who pioneered the procedure. If . he agrees to perform the operation, they hope to fly to St Louis . Children’s Hospital in Missouri when Sophie is three. With intensive . physiotherapy, she could be walking by five. But it means the couple must raise another £22,000 to cover the added costs of surgery in the US. The Thomlinsons are raising money through the charity Tree of Hope.

"Scientists have taken a major leap in unravelling the mysteries of the human brain after developing a new technique with which they were successfully able to map visual networks from a mouse and a fruit fly. Professors from the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried, Germany and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, Virginia, collaborated with teams of students to create three-dimensional maps of tiny sections of the animals' retinas. It is hoped that the techniques devised for the studies could soon be used to create a detailed map of the far more complicated human brain. Seeing is believing: Scientists have successfully mapped visual neurons in the brains of a mouse and fruit fly . For the mouse study, the brain-tissue was sliced thinly before being scanned using an electron microscope, nature.com reports. A computer was used to build a basic model, assigning different colours to different structures and identifying the points where individual cells meet known as the synapses. But the computer was unable to complete the complex task of joining the coloured sections together to create a complete map of the individual pathways. The three-dimensional model representing o.o6 per cent of  tiny of a mouse's retina which took a team of students thousands of hours to complete . Annals of the mind: Part of the 3D model of the mouse retina showing the different-coloured structures each an individual neuron . So a team of 300 students spent approximately 30,000 hours painstakingly tracing the branches of each cell to build an accurate model. The study identifed a new type of cell known as an XBC cell which was found to relay visual information from photo receptors to other cells. Despite the vast amount of labour involved, the model they created represents just 0.06 per cent of the mouse retina. In the case of the much smaller fruit-fly brain, two separate studies were conducted aimed at understanding how it detects movement. A diagram of a section of the fruit-fly's retina. By mapping the neurons of the the motion-detector circuits, they were able to show how each was wired to detect motion in a particular direction . One group mapped the neurons of the fly's . motion-detector circuits. They discovered each was wired to detect . motion in a particular direction. A second group examined the same motion-detector circuits but looked into how the cells reacted to stimulation with light. Because the photo-receptor cells on the surface of the eye can't detect motion themselves, the group concentrated on two downstreaming processing neurons named T4 and T5. Because the human brain contains roughly 80billion neurons it would take an estimated 570,000,000 years to map using the current technology . By tagging the cells with fluorescent protein markers which glow when a neuron is active they were able to show how different groups of neurons respond to the four basic motions - either up, down, left or right. Because a human brain contains roughly 80billion neurons it would take an estimated 570,000,000 years to map. However the researchers hope that by improving the technique used in the studies can be improved and with the aid of more powerful computers it will one day be possible.","New techniques devised by research teams in Germany and the U.S.

"American drones were in the skies above the U.S. consulate in Benghazi as the deadly attack that killed ambassador Christopher Stevens unfolded, it has been revealed. Defense department officials considered sending troops in to rescue the ambassador and staff, according to CBS News, but ultimately decided not to . They would haven been able to watch the attack on-screen as it unfolded. The revalations came a day after it emerged that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens repeatedly pleaded with the State Department to ramp up his security team in Libya -- requests that the Pentagon ultimately denied -- in the weeks, days and hours leading up to the terrorist attack that killed him and three other Americans, newly released cables have revealed. Stevens, who was killed in the 11 September attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, warned the State Department of a 'security vacuum' in Libya 'that is being exploited by independent actors' in one cable that described rapidly deteriorating security conditions. 'Islamic extremists are able to attack the Red Cross with impunity,' he wrote. 'What we have seen are not random crimes of opportunity but rather targeted discriminate attacks.' Revelation: The second building attacked in the Benghazi raid, pictured, was in fact a CIA base . Deadly: Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi . Stevens said the attackers would not be deterred 'until authorities are at least as capable.' Just hours before his death, he sent . the Pentagon a cable describing 'expanding Islamist influence in Dema,' a . town east of Benghazi, and said he was seeing a 'troubling increase in . violence and Islamist influence.' Stevens recapped a meeting in which . the commander of Benghazi's Supreme Security Council told him there is . 'growing frustration with police and security forces.' The cables were released by . Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the chairman of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is investigating . the security matters surrounding Stevens' death and questioning whether . the State Department could have prevented the deadly attack. Less than three weeks ahead of the . presidential election, Republicans are using the cables to attack . President Obama on his foreign policy, despite the State Department's . claim that it was solely responsible for the decisions to deny Stevens' requests for more security in Libya. 'These critical foreign policy decisions are not made by low or . mid-level career officials -- they are typically made through a . structured and well-reasoned process that includes the National Security . Council and the White House,' Issa wrote in a letter to Obama on Friday. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . The letter claims that Obama had a . political motivation in rejecting Stevens' security requests, since the . president was eager to show improving conditions in Libya after the . U.S.-led international operation that toppled Libya dictator Moamar . Gadhafi. On Aug. 2, six weeks before Stevens . was killed, he requested 'protective detail bodyguard' positions, . calling the security situation in Libya 'unpredictable, volatile and . violent.' A month earlier, he requested that . the State Department extend his tour of duty personnel, which is a . 16-man temporary security team trained in combating terrorism. The . request was denied and the security team left 8 August. Stevens had asked for the security team to stay through mid-September. Colonel Andrew Wood, the leader of . the security team that left Libya in the weeks before the terror attack, . told CBS News that Stevens fought hard against losing the team. 'It was quite a degree of frustration . on their part,' he said. 'They were -- I guess you could say -- . clenched-fist over the whole issue. Questions: In their debate on Tuesday, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney argued over when Obama first said it was a terror attack . The White House maintained publicly for a week that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya was a . spontaneous mob upset about an anti-Islam video, even though it has now . been revealed that they were informed within 24 hours of the attack . that it was planned and carried out by militants. 'Your administration has not been . straightforward with the American people in the aftermath of the . attack,' Issa wrote in his letter to Obama. In . his Rose Garden address the morning after the killings, Obama said, 'No . acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter . that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.' But . Republicans say he was speaking generally and didn't specifically call . the Benghazi attack a terror attack until weeks later, with the . president and other key members of his administration referring at first . to the anti-Muslim movie circulating on the Internet as a precipitating . event. Last week, the State Department said . that it never believed the 11 September attack on the U.S. consulate was . the result of a protest over an anti-Islam movie, contradicting . previous statements. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . The White House now says the attack . probably was carried out by an al Qaida-linked group, with no public . demonstration beforehand. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton . blamed the 'fog of war' for the early conflicting accounts. Issa's committee questioned State . Department officials for hours about what Republican lawmakers said was . lax security at the consulate, given the growth of extremist Islamic . militants in North Africa. Congressional aides are hoping to use . Stevens' cables and information from State Department testimonies to . build a timeline of what . the intelligence community knew, compared to what the White . House was telling the public about the attack. That could give Romney . ammunition to use in his foreign policy debate with Obama on Monday . night. Reports have revealed that the CIA station . chief in Libya compiled an intelligence briefing from eyewitnesses within 24 . hours of the assault on the consulate that indicated militants launched . the violence. The briefing from the station chief was . written late Wednesday, 12 September and reached intelligence agencies in . Washington the next day, intelligence officials said. Yet . on Saturday of that week, briefing points sent by the CIA to Congress . said 'demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the . protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct . assault.' Haven: Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith were hiding in a safe room which later filled with diesel smoke . The briefing . points, obtained by the AP, added: 'There are indications that . extremists participated in the violent demonstrations' but did not . mention eyewitness accounts that blamed militants alone. Such . raw intelligence reports by the CIA on the ground would normally be . sent first to analysts at the headquarters in Langley, Virginia, for . vetting and comparing against other intelligence derived from . eavesdropping drones and satellite images. Only then would such intelligence . generally be shared with the White House and later, Congress, a process . that can take hours, or days if the intelligence is coming only from one . or two sources who may or may not be trusted. U.S. intelligence officials say in this case the delay was due in part to . the time it took to analyze various conflicting accounts. One official, speaking on condition . of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the incident . publicly, explained that 'it was clear a group of people gathered that . evening' in Benghazi, but that the early question was 'whether extremists . took over a crowd or they were the crowd.' But that explanation has been met with concern in Congress. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate . 'The early sense from the intelligence community differs from what we are hearing now,' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said. 'It ended up being pretty far afield, so we want to figure out why ... though we don't want to deter the intelligence community from sharing their best first impressions' after such events in the future. 'The intelligence briefings we got a week to 10 days after were consistent with what the administration was saying,'said Rep. William Thornberry, a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees. Thornberry would not confirm the existence of the early CIA report but voiced skepticism over how sure intelligence officials, including CIA Director David Petraeus, seemed of their original account when they briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill. 'How could they be so certain immediately after such events, I just don't know,'he said. 'That raises suspicions that there was political motivation.'","U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens repeatedly pleaded with the State Department for additional security personnel .

Schurrle and Gotze, the architects of Germany's winner in the Maracana, scored to make the result more respectable but Argentina were easy winners despite some late pressure. And with Di Maria having missed the June final through injury it left Argentina fans wondering what might have been. 'It can't be revenge,' Germany coach Joachim Low said. 'You can't bring the final back.' With Lionel Messi absent due to a right leg injury, Di Maria assumed the instigator's role, setting up Aguero in the 21st minute, Lamela's outstanding volley in the 40th, and Federico Fernandez's headed goal two minutes after the interval. 'Di Maria showed why he is one of the five best players in the world,' Argentina coach Gerardo Martino said. Di Maria, who completed his move to Manchester United from Real Madrid last week, crowned his performance in the 50th minute with a chip over Germany's substitute keeper Weidenfeller, after a great run set up by Argentina captain Javier Mascherano. Tricky: Angel Di Maria chips the ball through to Sergio Aguero for the opening goal . Touch: Argentina's Sergio Aguero scores the opening goal past Germany's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer . Sublime: Tottenham winger Erik Lamela was the recipient of another brilliant Di Maria ball . Clinical:  Lamela made it 2-0 with a stunning volley against Germany and showed why his country were right to call him up . Schurrle pulled one back from a rebound two minutes later before Gotze, who scored the winning goal in the World Cup final, made it 4-2 with a deflected shot in the 78th. Germany made seven changes to their side. Captain Philipp Lahm, fellow defender Per Mertesacker and record scorer Miroslav Klose all retired after the final, while coach Loew also had to contend with a host of injuries. 'Actually I can't make any accusations against the team, they had never played together like that before,' Low said. Martino, who took over from Alejandro Sabella after the final, had to do without Messi on his debut. He did, however, have Di Maria - who missed the title match with an injury. 'We would have beaten them even if Di Maria played on July 13,' Low said. Martino said Di Maria made himself 'more prominent' than he had been at the World Cup. Up for it: Argentina's Federico Fernandez rises at far post to head home against Germany . On target: World Cup final goalscorer Mario Gotze scores Germany's second goal against Argentina . Star of the show: Di Maria displays his athleticism by controlling a ball while taking a flying leap during his all-round brilliant display, shown by his touch map (right) The attacking midfielder showed his intention early on with a run before Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer emerged to snuff out the danger. Neuer captained the side in the absence of the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was named as Lahm's successor on Tuesday. Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero then got the better of Mario Gomez in a one on one at the other end. Gomez, back in the side after missing out on the World Cup due to fitness concerns, missed three chances to score with the goal at his mercy. The Fiorentina striker was whistled by fans after his last miss and again when he was substituted. 'He was missing for around seven months. For me it was important to see how he moved, and that he had the chances,' Loew said. 'Of course he still needs a bit of time to get back to form after such a long time out with injury.' Di Maria sent in an exquisite cross with the outside of his left boot for Aguero to open the scoring with a simple tap-in after a lack of concentration in the German defense. Lamela made it 2-0 five minutes before the interval with a rocket of a volley to the top left corner from Di Maria's deep cross. Fernandez' header from Di Maria's cross gave substitute goalkeeper Weidenfeller no chance, and a rout looked on the cards when Di Maria capped his great solo run with a delightful chip over the goalkeeper. Schurrle and Gotze responded and Marco Reus struck the post for the home side, which couldn't muster a comeback - but still has the World Cup.

"Sir Jonathan Ive is said to be so proud of the upcoming iWatch, he has been boasting the device could seriously disrupt the watch trade in Switzerland. An Apple designer claims Sir Jonathan told him the watch-making nation is in trouble because of the much-rumoured wearable - although he is reported to have said a much stronger word than trouble. The iWatch is expected to be unveiled at an event next week, but won’t be on sale until early 2015. Scroll down for video . London-born Sir Jonathan Ive (pictured) is said to have made the claims to an Apple designer. Apple’s senior vice president of design was making reference to Switzerland’s watch trade. Sir Ive was responsible for the iMac, iPod and, more recently, the iOS 7 software redesign . London-born designer Jonathan Ive is Apple's senior vice president of design. Since 1996, he has been responsible for products including the iMac, which ultimately led to the design of the iPod, and more recently Sir Ive was behind the drastic redesign of iOS 7. He was knighted in 2012. Ive also leads the Human Interface (HI) software teams across the company. Outside of Apple, Ive has designed products for charitable causes, including a Leica camera for a charity auction, and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch for an AIDS-charity auction. The claims were made in a feature by the New York Times that discussed how tech was combining with fashion as wearables become more popular. It said: 'According to a designer who works at Apple, Jonathan Ive, in bragging about how cool he thought the iWatch was shaping up to be, gleefully said Switzerland is in trouble - though he chose a much bolder term for ‘trouble’ to express how he thought the watchmaking nation might be in a tough predicament when Apple’s watch comes out.’ This suggests Ive believes brands such as Tag Heuer and Breitling face tough competition from the wearable device. Reports claim Apple will charge around $400 for its iWatch, but this would still put it behind the luxury price tags of Swiss watches.

Sir Ive believes brands such as Tag Heuer (pictured) face tough competition from Apple's wearable device. Reports claim Apple will charge around $400 for its iWatch, but this would still put it a long way behind the luxury price tags of Swiss watches. Tag Heuer watches, for example, sell in excess of £700 ($1,150) Tag Heuer watches, for example, sell in excess of £700 ($1,150). This price, would however, put Apple’s iWatch at the high-end of the smartwatch market - a strategy that mirrors the firm’s approach to its iPhone business. By comparison, Samsung’s Gear 2 costs $299.99 in the US (£249 in the UK) and the Moto 360 is expected to cost $249.99 (£149). Last week, Samsung launched its curved S watch, but didn’t announce how much it would cost. Apple’s biggest rival could be waiting to see how much the iWatch will cost, if it is unveiled next week, before setting its own price.

"A man from Florida is accused of calling 911 twice after being pulled over for speeding in an effort to get the officer to go to a hoax emergency. Julius Lupowitz, 52, tried to get out of his ticket by being creative and called 911 telling them there was about to be a shooting. Dispatchers on the 911 lines took the frantic phone call. In one call he is heard telling the operator: 'There is a murder that’s going to happen, I swear, on Wingate and Wickham. No, on Wingate and Hollywood. Not the brightest! Florida police say Julius Lupowitz, 52, called 911 to make fake reports of a possible murder in progress as he was being pulled over for a traffic violation . Definitely someone going to get shot. Please, please, Wingate and Hollywood. Please,' the man said. When the line went dead, every available officer went to that intersection in West Melbourne, Florida. Then Lupowitz called called back. 'I swear, there's gonna be a murder any second. There's a man with a gun. Please, I just called.' Again, the caller hung up. Dispatchers looked for any information they could get and got the caller’s name. The idea almost worked as Lupowitz was able to have officers sent over to the fake murder scene - but the officer who pulled him over stayed put. Any excuse: Dispatchers on the 911 lines took a frantic phone call but the police officer realized soon enough that the person who was making the call was the driver he had just pulled over . It wasn't long before the name of the 911 caller was announced over the police radio - which the officer realized was the same person he had pulled over, just up the street form where the reported murder was taking place. Police believe that while the officer’s back was turned, Lupowitz made the phony murder calls. 'It almost worked,' West Melbourne, FL Police Lt. Rich Cordeau said. 'The officer was trying to wrap up quickly to respond. We responded as if it was real. We don’t know any different until we got there.' 'When you take a phony incident, and you take those dispatches away from the ability to answer those calls that could put somebody that has a real emergency in danger,' Cordeau said. 'Our officer was standing at the door of Mr. Lupowitz’s vehicle and realized, at that point, that this was the same person that was making the 911 calls,' said Lt. Cordeau. Instead of a $200 speeding ticket, Lupowitz faces a felony charge that carries a maximum 5-year prison term. Used to making selfies: Instead of facing a speeding charge and a fine of $200, Lupowitz now faces a felony charge and the prospect of five years behind bars .","Julius Lupowitz, 52, was pulled over by police and given a $200 ticket .

"Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, raged today during the first session of the commission looking into the violence that has torn their community apart. They sat through three hours of talks before exploding and telling the panel: 'You do not reflect the community we live in!' They shouted: 'Where were you when South Florissant was burning?’ and told the white commissioners they would never understand. Community affair: Dozens of angry, frustrated people attended the first Ferguson Commission meeting held at the Ferguson Community Center Monday . Emotions running high: Members of the audience sat through the first three hours of the six-hour meeting before verbally attacking the panel . Post mortem: The commission has been set up by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to examine the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting . A Post-It note put on the wall read: 'Start by calling the killing of Michael Brown what it was: a lynching. It was done to intimidate and “keep blacks in their place.”’ The six-hour meeting took place at the Ferguson Community Center, a short distance away from West Florissant Avenue, which was looted and burned last week after a grand jury announced it would not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Wilson, who is white, shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, on August 9, sparking more than a week of protest and rioting. The entire episode sparked a national conversation on race and the militarized police response. The job of the Ferguson Commission is to pick up the pieces and understand what has gone wrong. But the dozens of residents who turned up grew increasingly frustrated as the panel took three hours to introduce themselves and offer well-meaning platitudes about what they were doing. Writing on the wall: Some of the Ferguson residents who attended the first meeting of the commission Monday left Post-It notes on the wall airing their frustration (left) and giving words of advice on how to proceed (right) Some have expressed concern that the commission would turn into the governor's mouthpiece, while others addressed the violence and looting in Ferguson . Notes on a tragedy: Some four dozen pink Post-It notes written by Ferguson residents are pictured affixed to a wall at the Ferguson Community Center . List: Members of the community had the chance to write down their complaints and wishes . Panel will examine discriminatory housing policies and other key issues affecting the community . Leaders: The commission is co-chaired by Rich McClure (left) and Rev Starsky Wilson (right) They saw a huge gap between the intellectual talk before them and the pain they felt in their hearts. One man said: ‘We sat for hours and listened to your resumes; we sat for hours and listened to your pedigree. 'We don’t care. Did you mention the shot brother when talking about your resume?’ Another man shouted: ‘You want us to trust you. We don’t know you!’ Others said: 'Have you even been in Ferguson?' and: ‘This commission is a bunch of bullcrap'. The meeting had been opened with a prayer and a call by co-chairman Rev Starsky Wilson told 'hold us accountable'. Co-chair Rich McClure said that he wanted to have a 'truthful conversation,' even if it meant hard questions. He said: 'We know that solutions can be found, and we can't expect others to change if we remain the same.' But as the mood soured, an angry female resident said: ‘We’ve been sitting here since you guys started. Out of touch: Some African-Americans in the audience accused the white panelists of being unable to understand their pain . Spreading the word: Community activists in the crowd used the meeting to spread the word about an initiative to help rebuild a local antique shop called Hidden Treasures that has been damaged by looters . Not impressed: Community members lashed at at the panelists for spending the first three hours of the event making introductions and presenting their credentials . Bob Pepra, from Richmond Heights, speaking during the Ferguson Commission meeting Monday . 'We are honored you all have credentials but you do not reflect the community we live in!' Rev Wilson came out from behind his chair to calm them down, but they would not be silenced. He was told by an emotional mother: 'Don’t waste our time with the same innuendo and the same rhetoric. 'You’re killing our babies. Fix it!’ One black woman addressed the white members of the commission and said: ‘You have not experienced our pain.’ Another Post-It note read: 'Mike Brown was wrong for stealing. Darren Wilson was wrong for being judge, jury and executioner.’ The anger shows the uphill battle that the commission faces, and how it has to first prove it is not just a mouthpiece for Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, who set it up. In his opening remarks lawyer Gabriel Gore said he wanted to be 'part of the process of bring down the divisions that have existed in our community for a long time'. Catalyst: Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black, on August 9, sparking months of protest and rioting, which reached a fever pitch after last week's grand jury decision not to charge the cop . Rage from coast to coast: Demonstrators protest against the shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown during a rally at the Department of Justice in Washington Monday . Walkout: Student activists take part in the nationwide 'Hands up, walk out' protest at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri December 1 . Movement: Protesters across the US have walked off their jobs or away from classes in support of the Ferguson protesters. Monday's walkouts stretched from New York to San Francisco, and included Chicago and Washington DC . Rev Traci Blacmon, a registered nurse who is pastor of the Christ at the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, said: 'I'm from Birmingham, Alabama. I'm a child of the Sixties. 'The issues I see that have arisen are the issues that I have been dealing with my entire life'. She added that in Birmingham reform did not go deep enough and she was on the commission to have tough conversations and 'sit in discomfort until real change comes'. She said: 'I'm here because it's personal. I'm here because I have two black sons. I'm here because I have a black daughter... Ferguson is everywhere.’ Fourteen of the sixteen commissioners were present and the other two were in Washington meeting President Barack Obama.

They were protest leader Rasheen Aldridge, who at age 20 is the youngest member of the panel, and Teach For America St Louis Director Brittany Packnett. When he announced the commission, Governor Nixon said it was to look at the 'social and economic conditions' that led to the unrest over the past three months. The commission has been given a $100,000 grant from the Missouri Development Finance Board but could need as much as $1million to finish the job. Among the issues it is expected to look at are housing policies that have divided whites and blacks. The excessive use of traffic tickets on black residents to generate revenue for the City of Ferguson will also likely be examined.","Six-hour meeting was repeatedly interrupted by outbursts from angry members of Ferguson community .

"Thieves have stolen charity money collected to fund surgery so a two-year-old girl can walk. Around £500 in cash was taken from stalls at a family fun day held to raise money for an operation to enable cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson to take her first steps. She had been denied NHS funding for the selective dorsal rhizotomy procedure at Leeds General Infirmary and her family were faced with raising a minimum of £25,000 themselves. Two year old Sophie Thomlinson who was denied a life changing operation by doctors at Leeds General Infirmary, with her mother and father Alison and Craig. A thief stole £500 from a fundraiser for the child . Sophie, two, who has cerebal palsy needs the selective dorsal rhizotomy procedure to enable her to walk . Generous donations from readers who saw her plight in the Daily Mail mean they now have more than £50,000 for the operation and intensive physiotherapy afterwards. But wellwishers decided to hold the fundraising day to raise extra money so Sophie can have all the therapy and specialist equipment she needs to give her the best chance of walking. Organisers believe an opportunist thief swiped the money from cash boxes at the event in Stockport, Greater Manchester, on April 6. Sophie and mother Alison, who said she was 'devastated' about the left last week . They had expected to raise £800 on the day, which was to be split between Sophie's surgery fund and the Alzheimer's Society, but were left with just the £300 which stallholders had paid to attend. Sophie's mother Allison, 40, said she was 'devastated' about the theft. 'It is just awful,' she said. 'It is quite a lot of money which would have gone to both charities.' Event organiser Mel Parkin, 32, said: 'It looks like someone grabbed the cash out of a couple of the cashboxes. 'With all the work that went into the event and the amount of people there, it is really disappointing.' She said they had no hope of tracking down who took the money because there was no CCTV at the venue. She is now selling raffle tickets in a bid to recover the money lost. Sophie's family hope she will have a date for the life-changing surgery before she turns three in January, meaning she could be walking unaided by the age of five. Mrs Thomlinson, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, said they had been 'overwhelmed' by the generosity shown by the public. 'Without the money raised by Mail readers we could have been looking at not even getting the operation until she was seven,' she said. 'I wish I could thank everyone who donated individually. 'It is not just Sophie's life, the readers have made such a difference to our lives as a family.'","Sophie Thomlinson denied NHS funding for surgery to enable her to walk .

"What will weather reports be like in 2050? Rather dramatic and unnerving if climate change gets out of hand, researchers have claimed. In a series of videos the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) will reveal how the effects of global warming could affect our planet in the future. The fictional weather reports describe how droughts, floods and heat waves could cause problems in the next 30 years. Scroll down for video . The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), headquartered in Geneva, is releasing videos that predict what weather reports will be like in 2050 (screenshot shown). These are based on what happens if climate change is allowed to continue . According to the researchers, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, the average temperature of Earth’s atmosphere could rise more than 4°C (7.2°F) by the end of the 21st century. A report released earlier this year came to similar conclusions, that emissions from agriculture threaten to keep increasing as global meat and dairy consumption increases. If agricultural emissions are not addressed, nitrous oxide from fields and methane from livestock may double by 2070. This alone would make meeting the climate target essentially impossible. 'We have shown that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels,' said Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. 'Broad dietary change can take a long time. We should already be thinking about how we can make our food more climate friendly.' By 2050, estimates indicate that beef and lamb will account for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, while only contributing three per cent of human calorie intake. Cheese and other dairy products will account for about one quarter of total agricultural climate pollution. To find out what this might mean for people on Earth, the WMO invited television weather presenters to imagine giving a weather report from the year 2050. The result is a dramatic compendium of possible scenarios based on the most up-to-date climate science. The news forecasters include people from channels across Europe, South America and the US. A ‘teaser’ video was released today, while videos from the various networks will gradually be released throughout September at the WMO website. ‘While climate change is global, the impacts will be local,’ the video states. The project is aimed to support discussions that will be held at the UN Climate Summit 2014 on 23 September. Here UN Secretary-General’s Ban Ki-moon will hope to convince world leaders from government, finance, business and civil society to take decisive action against climate change. The WMO is hoping that a meaningful legal agreement can be made to begin seriously reducing greenhouse gas emissions from next year. Earth's average temperature could rise by more than 4°C (7.2°F) by the end of the 21st century, according to the researchers. This could lead to more extreme weather around the world such as storms, droughts and flooding.

"A mother is to sue the Government after her son developed narcolepsy when he received a swine flu jab causing him to sleep for 19 hours a day. Seven-year-old Josh Hadfield developed the condition within three weeks of receiving the drug and now suffers 'attacks' which can cause him to doze through the day. He would fall asleep up to every five minutes - even when he was walking, eating and swimming - and suffered sudden seizures when he laughs. Caroline Hadfield, from Frome, Somerset, with her seven-year-old son Josh Hadfield who contracted narcolepsy in reaction to receiving the swine flu vaccine . Now his mother Caroline Hadfield, 42, is taking legal action after the Health Protection Agency found there was a ten-fold increased risk of the disorder in children given the drug, Pandemrix. Josh received the vaccine at his local GP surgery on January 21, 2010, after Mrs Hadfield was told he was 'at risk' of the H1N1 virus because he was under five. But Mrs Hadfield, of Frome, Somerset, said that within weeks of the jab she noticed a drastic change in her son. 'He was a perfectly healthy energetic four-year-old before the vaccination, but within two weeks he was getting more tired and after three weeks he was sleeping for 19 hours. 'Things then developed quickly and he struggled to walk. Nothing could convince me it was anything but the jab which caused Josh's conditions. 'The Government had a knee-jerk reaction to swine flu and put out this vaccine, giving it to very young children.' Josh Hadfield, seven, is now on medication to control the condition but lives in constant fear of future episodes and refuses to do anything which may set them off, such as sledging . Josh is now on medication to control the condition but they live in constant fear of narcolepsy attacks. Mrs Hadfield, a civil servant, said: 'Laughter can trigger attacks and Josh was too anxious about fear of an incident to go sledging in last week's snow. 'You see other children who can laugh and enjoy things and yes Josh can laugh and enjoy things but his reaction means that he goes unconscious. 'We feel we are constantly treading on eggshells.' The vaccine was widely used in the UK during the 2009-2010 flu pandemic and given to almost one million children between the ages of six months and five-years-old. However, after a number of trials across the EU, it is no longer in use when links between the drug and narcolepsy were found in youngsters from Finland, Sweden and Ireland. Sleepy: The youngster received the vaccine at his local GP surgery on January 21, 2010 . In July 2011 the European Medicines Authority advised against giving it to the under 20s. The Health Protection Agency then commissioned a study in UK children and found that there was an estimated risk of the disorder in one in 52,000 in those vaccinated. Specialists reviewed 75 children aged between four and 18 who developed narcolepsy after the vaccine and found a 10-fold increased risk of the condition within six months of having the jab. These findings led them to state that the link suggested a 'causal association consistent with reports from Finland and Sweden'. The results, which was highlighted in BBC programme Inside Out West, saw prominent scientists agree with the findings. Professor Adam Finn, from the University of Bristol, who was in charge of one of the paediatric clinical trials of Pandemrix, said: 'The bottom line is that they found that there was somewhere between 10 and 16 times more likely to have had Pandemrix than other children. 'If you look at the figures, from what I can see the risk is so much increased that it seems very unlikely that this is a biased result. It is likely to be real.' Now Mrs Hadfield  and father Charlie, 47, a printer, have joined a group of other parents preparing legal action after their children developed similar symptoms. But the Department of Work and Pensions, which is responsible for administering the Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme, said there is currently insufficient medical evidence to show that the swine flu vaccine causes narcolepsy. Mrs Hadfield said that the HPA report was a huge leap forward and she did not know how the Government could ignore it. She added: 'That is the first report I have seen that has been published which shows that there is a 20 to 16 fold increase in cases since the vaccines was given. 'That is a huge, huge, leap forward and I can't really see now how the Government can turn around and say that there's no link because obviously there is.' GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical company which produced the drug, said it was working hard to better understand the research emerging from a number of countries. A spokesperson said: 'Narcolepsy is a complex disease and its causes are not yet fully understood but it is generally considered to be associated with genetic and environmental factors, including infections. 'It is crucial we learn more about how narcolepsy is triggered and how Pandemrix may have interacted with other risk factors in affected individuals.'","Josh Hadfield developed condition within weeks of receiving Pandemrix .

"Bad reaction: Lucy Hinks, 13, began to experience extreme exhaustion soon after having the cervical cancer vaccine alongside classmates which her parents are convinced caused it . They were told the vaccine had few side-effects and would protect their daughter from cervical cancer. But Steve and Pauline Hinks are convinced the controversial HPV jab is behind their daughter Lucy’s mystery illness which is making her sleep up to 23 hours a day. Tests have so far ruled out a brain tumour and glandular fever and the 13-year-old’s paediatric consultant is investigating potential links with the vaccine Cervarix. The jab was used in a national vaccination programme which started in September 2008. But it has already been linked to several cases of girls displaying severe side-effects. Before she received the vaccine, Lucy was perfectly healthy, had an excellent school attendance record and was among the top students in her year. But just weeks after she received the third dose of Cervarix in May this year she began to feel exhausted. By July she had lost a stone in weight and was sleeping almost round-the-clock. ‘Some nights I’ve been so worried that I wake several times to make sure she’s still breathing,’ said her mother. ‘I was concerned about the potential side-effects because Lucy had a severe reaction from the MMR vaccine. ‘But I was reassured by the school nurse that side-effects were extremely unlikely. We feel betrayed because, like most parents, we trust the health authorities with our children’s lives.’ Mr Hinks, a health and safety manager at the Pirelli tyre factory in Carlisle, said: ‘We are desperate to find some sort of treatment which will give us back the daughter we had before. Almost all cases of cervical cancer start off as an HPV infection. 80 per cent of women will contract a form of HPV by the time they reach 50, most forms are harmless. ‘We have to keep hoping that recovery will be soon.’ The vaccine is given to girls aged 12 . and 13 in a nationwide programme which followed clinical trials in 2005 . on more than 18,000 women under 26. Parents who do not wish their . daughters to have it must opt out. The vaccine is most effective when . given to girls before they become sexually active. In the first year of the nationwide . vaccination programme more than 2,000 girls in the UK had health . problems after being given the jab. Jackie Fletcher, from pressure group . JABS, called for the vaccine to be abandoned until it can be established . beyond doubt that it is safe. She said: ‘There have been some real . horror stories. After the injection, suddenly they’ve got things like . chronic fatigue syndrome.’ A spokesman for Cervarix’s . manufacturers, GlaxoSmithKline, said the company took reports of adverse . reactions very seriously and added: ‘The UK medicines safety agency . regularly reviews all suspected adverse events and had concluded that no . new or serious risks have been identified during the use of Cervarix in . the UK and that the balance of benefits and risks remains positive.’ Robert Music, director of Jo’s . Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ‘If year on year take-up of the vaccine . continues to be around 80 per cent the incidence of cervical cancer . could be reduced by two-thirds in women under 30 by 2025.’ Her parents fear it could be years . before she recovers. They now care for Lucy - who has lost nearly three . stone - around the clock and describe their lives as a 'living . nightmare'. The couple, from Port Carlisle, . Cumbria, are urging parents to find out about the potential side effects . of the vaccine, Cervarix. Their warning comes as thousands of year eight pupils prepare to receive the vaccine in schools. Mrs Hinks said: 'I would not wish what we've been through on anyone. 'I've not seen the whites of Lucy's eyes for weeks and nobody can tell us when it will turn. 'I would urge parents to get all the . facts, gather as much information as you can. Decide for yourself if . it's right for your child.' Constant care: Lucy's parents now attend her every need and one of them is always nearby. She is pictured with her sister Emily, 12, (left) who was recently offered the injection . Would you let your daughter have the HPV injection? Would you let your daughter have the HPV injection? Now share your opinion . She added: 'I could put up with the constant sleep. I believe her body needs it. 'But it's the fact that to me she's in a waking coma, with no treatment. 'At first we didn't pay any major attention to it. We were only aware there was something seriously wrong this July.' Lucy, a bright scholar at Nelson Tomlinson School with a gift for . maths, had her third and final instalment of the vaccine in May. Soon . afterwards, she started displaying signs of exhaustion. 'Then she got up one weekend,' said Mrs Hinks. 'She shouted for me, she was too exhausted to stand.' Initially, Lucy's GP found her spleen and liver were enlarged. Then, . after the teenager collapsed in the doctor's waiting room, she was taken . to Carlisle's Cumberland Infirmary. She was submitted to a barrage of . tests over the weeks to come, including those for glandular fever and a . brain tumour. But these failed to find any cause. Coping mechanism: Steve Hinks trawls the internet for cures . Later in the summer, Lucy was again admitted to hospital. This time she was unable to walk at all. Mr Hinks said: 'She had been able to limp from the settee to the toilet herself. 'But suddenly she couldn't take a single step. She lost her balance, her arms and legs were failing. 'We got a letter from the consultant . at the hospital. It says it's quite possible that this might turn out to . be a reaction to the HPV vaccine.' Mrs Hinks, who gets up to her daughter . through the night, said: 'At one stage I thought she was . going to die in her sleep.' Recently, the family installed a stairlift to take Lucy from her . bed to the living room sofa. 'I bring her downstairs because she's . part of the family,' said Mrs Hinks. 'I want her down here and hope that . subconsciously she can hear something of what's going on.' They have rigged up an electric bell which Lucy presses when she needs pain relief. 'She can whisper five words,' said Mr Hinks, who uses a microphone to help make out Lucy's barely . audible syllables. 'She says ""hurting, toilet, tablet, water"" and, . most of all, ""mum"".' Mr and Mrs Hinks spoon feed their . daughter her lunch and dinner. Meals must consist of soft food, because chewing takes precious energy. The couple said doctors are now 95 per cent sure Lucy's diagnosis of ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is correct. Mrs Hinks has revisited the decision to allow Lucy to have the vaccine many times. 'I have regrets,' she said. 'But it's . no good having them because you can't change what we've got. Hindsight . is a marvellous thing.' Though neither has any criticisms of the local vaccination programme, Mr and Mrs Hinks are now urging parents to make sure they have as much information as possible before making a decision. 'Talk to people about it,' said Mrs Hinks. 'You decide, not the Government, whether it's right for your child. The NHS initiated its UK HPV immunisation programme in September 2008. The HPV jab is available on the NHS to those aged between 12 and 13 years old. Many are immunised at school. Vaccines are delivered in three shots . over six months. They do not have any therapeutic effect on existing . HPV infections or cervical lesions which is why girls are vaccinated . before they become sexually active. The vaccine cuts the risk of cervical cancer by about 70 per cent . Of the four million vaccinations carried out over the programme's first two years, there were 4,445 reported side effects. None . of the deaths or serious health problems which have followed . immunisation has been directly linked to the vaccine - but it has been . known to trigger undetected health problems. Some . critics also believe that the HPV injection can give teenagers a false . sense of security, encouraging them to be more sexually active because . they no longer have to fear cervical cancer.","Lucy Hinks is unable to walk or talk after having injections at school .
Parents warn others to check on potential side effects of Cervarix vaccine .
The headline has been amended to make clear it reflects only an allegation that Ms Hinks' illness was linked to the jab."
"Two Massachusetts women are lucky to be alive after being attacked by a great white shark while kayaking, throwing them both into the water. The women - both in their mid-twenties - said they saw 'at least 4 feet of (the shark's) head come out of the water' and bite one of their ocean kayaks. The dramatic incident occurred just 100 yards from shire in Plymouth, south of Boston, on Wednesday afternoon. Officials used the teeth marks left on the kayak to verify the shark was a great white. Lucky escape: Kristin Orr and Ida Parker - both of Plymouth, Massachusetts - were attacked by a great white shark while kayaking just 100 yards from the shore on Wednesday . Deadly bite: This photo provided by Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries shows a hole in a kayak that, according to agency experts, was made Wednesday by a bite from a great white shark . Proof: The attack was confirmed based on tooth fragments and bite radius on the kayak . Terrifying: Ida Parker and Kristin Orr were rescued after a great white shark made huge holes in their kayak, tipping them out . 'We were just talking and paddling. I . look over to talk to her and it came completely out of the water and got . the bottom of the boat and flipped her over and knocked my kayak . completely over,' one of the women, Ida Parker, told WHDH. 'I saw at least four feet of its head. 'Four feet of it came up out of the water.' Both . Parker and her friend, Kirsten Orr - who had gone out on the water to . look for seals - were left bobbing in the water not knowing what to do. They decided to remain as still as possible and wait for help. 'The scariest part was sitting in the water thinking he was waiting, wondering where he was.,' Parker told . 'You didn't know if he was under you or around you.' 'We were sitting in the water and she was sinking and I was flipped over holding onto the bottom of the kayak. 'It was petrifying waiting in that water for the harbormaster to come and not knowing if anybody would come get us.' Dramatic rescue: This aerial photo provided by Massachusetts State Police shows the rescue of two women from the water off the coast of Plymouth after a shark attack . Usually calm: The women - both in their mid-twenties - were out looking for seals at Plymouth Beach when the incident occurred . Bite marks: The force of the shark hitting and biting the kayak pushed both women into the water . Overcome: Kristen Orr and Ida Parker said the most 'petrifying' part was bobbing in the water waiting for help to arrive . Fortunately a local on the sand heard the pair's screams and rushed into the water to help them after calling 911. Both women escaped without injury. However they lost a GoPro camera which they believe recorded some of the attack and hope it turns up so they have video of their lucky escape. A spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs, Kristi Selmi, told The Boston Globe there have been numerous shark sightings in the area this summer. 'Shark sightings have become a more common occurrence during the summer months due to an increasing population of grey seals in the area,' Selmi said. Hundreds of beachgoers were ordered out of the water on August 25 when a great white shark was spotted at Duxbury Beach, according to the newspaper. 7News Boston WHDH-TV .","Attack occurred 100 yards from the shore at Plymouth Beach, Massachusetts, on Wednesday afternoon .

"Thrill-seeker Garrett McNamara has taken the Guinness World Record for the largest wave ever surfed after riding a 78-foot tall break off the coast of Portugal in November. Confirmed by a panel of experts at the annual Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Awards, McNamara, 44, beat the previous mark held since 2008 by surfing legend Mike Parson by just one foot. Barreling down the enormous wave at Nazaré, McNamara risked being drowned or crushed by the enormous wall of water he was riding to take the coveted crown. Scroll Down for Video . Garrett McNamara, of Hawaii, surfs a 78-foot wave, the tallest break ever ridden at the Praia do Norte beach in Nazaré, Portugal . 'It’s amazing we get to do what we do, I am so grateful. The world record doesn’t mean as much to me, this is for the town of Nazaré and Portugal and for all my family and friends there,' said McNamara at the Billabong awards ceremony in Anaheim, California. 'To be able to give them something to be proud of and inspire them… I didn’t want to get caught up in it all, but I have to tell you the truth, when they announced my name I got a bigger rush than probably on all the waves I rode this year.' Garrett McNamara is towed onto the giant wave off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal as prepares to surf the 78-foot tall wall of water . The legendary surfer prepares to release his grip on the tow bar which is being pulled by a jet-ski . Garrett McNamara uses all his skill to keep himself upright as he tears across the face of the giant wave . Confirmed this week by a panel of experts, Garrett is now the Guinness World Record holder for riding the largest wave in history . The fierce wave formed off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal an area known for its funneled waves caused by the low shallow ocean floor at the shore . Taking to the sea on the morning of . November the 1st, 2011, McNamara had been invited to Nazaré by the . Government of Portugal to investigate the area for a big wave . competition. 'There is an underwater canyon 1,000ft deep that runs from the ocean right up to the cliffs,' explained McNamrara in an interview with the Guardian last year. 'It's like a funnel. 'At its oceans end it's three miles wide but narrows as it gets closer to the shore and when there is a big swell it acts like an amplifier.' As a veteran surfer of enormous waves, McNamara used buoyancy aids to help him return to the surface if wiped out and was towed onto the wave by a jet-ski rider. The Pittsfield, Massachusetts born . surfer also used a specially weighted surf board that provides extra . momentum on release from the jet-ski. Stunned . by his own achievement in surfing the wave, McNamara had to navigate . not only the 78-foot tall wall of water, but also the lip of the wave as . it came to halt as it approached the shore. Weighing tons, the cresting lip could . have knocked him off the board and into a spin cycle under the water . that would have either drowned him or broken bones with the force of the . water. Garrett McNamara is dwarfed by the huge wave . The lip of the wave begins to form over McNamara (left) as the record ride comes to an end (right) However, McNamara skillfully and successfully navigated the wave to set the record. 'It's only when I got in that I saw the footage,' said McNamara to the Guardian. 'I was in awe. I mean I felt it was a decent size. 'But you can see it then pops up 10, 20, 30 feet higher. It just supersizes.' The legendary surfer was proud to beat the previous record holder by a single foot to take the Guinness crown . When asked how he found the courage to surf waves so large McNamara had a clear answer. 'I went to Alaska a while back and surfed the waves generated from a . glacier calving and ever since then, I’ve never been afraid in the . ocean. I feel very comfortable in the ocean' said McNamara. 'This wave, if you fell, I don’t think I would’ve come home. 'It’s so dangerous, so much water moving in two different directions and . it’s all rocks. All the water is moving straight into the rocks.'","Garrett McNamara beat the previous record by just one foot .

"Almost a third of married women say they still haven’t found Mr Right, while most men claim they're happy with their other halves. Research revealed that while most women claim to love their husbands, 31 per cent said they were still on the hunt for their ideal partner and were still attracted to other men. Of their doting husbands however, 69 per cent said they'd definitely found the One and were happily married, according to the poll of 1,000 adults by The Fine Bedding Company. The poll which surveyed 1,000 married adults turned up some interesting results . The majority of women who admitted they still hadn't found the perfect partner despite being married believed this was because they were still attracted to other men. Fortunately for their other halves, 83 per cent insisted they would remain faithful if Mr Right came along. Married men who claim not to have met their ideal spouse also blame being attracted to other women as the reason why. 1. You're still attracted to your spouse . 2. You consider your other half to be your best friend . 3. Your partner still makes you laugh . 4. You agree on important family decisions . 5. You are proud of each other's achievements . However contented couples cited still being attracted to each other as the most important part of a happy relationship, with 33 per cent of women and 39 per cent of men saying they still 'fancied' their other half despite being in a long-term relationship. Having a husband who is your best friend or who makes you laugh as well as agreeing on important family decisions were also listed by women as the keys to a happy marriage. The fifth most common reason given by married women as to why they know their partner is the One is that they admire their husband's achievements. The same five reasons were given by men, though more (12 per cent) admitted to being proud of their wife's accomplishments. Only ten per cent of the men and women polled said they didn't believe there was such a thing as Mr or Mrs Right when it comes to true love. Emma Heald of the Fine Bedding Company said: 'The overwhelming majority of Brits believe that The One is out there somewhere and it is just a matter of finding them. Happily married individuals such as Richard and Judy (pictured) said being able to make their partner's . laugh, calling them their best friends and being attracted to one . another made for a successful marriage . 'Many admit that, though they are . married, they have still not have found their perfect love. 'But, they . also are quite certain that they do love their partner and that, even if .

"Normal service was resumed as feuding Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton finished one-two come the culmination of practice on Friday for the Italian Grand Prix. After McLaren's Jenson Button had surprisingly split the pair in the opening 90-minute session around Monza - with Hamilton comfortably quickest - come the second run, Rosberg held sway over his team-mate. For over an hour, though, it appeared to be a case of 'it never rains but it pours' for Hamilton as he frustratingly looked on at his mechanics tending to his car plagued by an electrical issue. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton preview this weekend's Italian Grand Prix . In form: Nico Rosberg ended the session on top of the timesheets, marginally ahead of Lewis Hamilton . Time to burn: Hamilton spent the first hour of the session out of the car as mechanics tended to his Mercedes . Hamilton has endured two mechanical retirements this year, a third in the wake of being hit by Rosberg last time out in Belgium, as well as a brake failure in qualifying in Germany and a fire in qualifying in Hungary. In this instance his troubles may only have been in second practice, affording him plenty of opportunity to recover, but nevertheless he must have been wondering 'why always me?' Hamilton will now naturally be hoping his misfortune is out of the way this weekend and he will run trouble -free through to the chequered flag on Sunday. Hamilton managed to complete 16 laps compared to Rosberg's 41, and would arguably have finished top of the timesheet but for traffic when he did finally take to the track with 25 minutes remaining. Hamilton emerged for the final 30 minutes to post the second fastest time in the second free practice session . Rosberg finished top with a lap of one minute 26.225 seconds, although Hamilton would likely have found some satisfaction with clocking the quickest lap of the day in the morning outing with a 1min 26.187secs. The fact there is no difference in times between the hard and medium Pirelli tyres - the softer compound is normally far quicker - may surprise many, but the teams opted to perform heavy-fuel race simulations in FP2 rather than qualifying runs, as is often the case in such a session. Hamilton ultimately finished 0.061secs adrift of Rosberg in FP2, with a further surprise the fact their rivals are far closer than perhaps was expected on a power circuit where Mercedes should be dominant. 1. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Mercedes 1:26.225 . 2. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:26.286 . 3. Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari 1:26.331 . 4. Fernando Alonso (Spain) Ferrari 1:26.565 . 5.

Bird's eye view: Hamilton will be keen to close the 29-point gap to Rosberg at the Italian Grand Prix . Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was the best of the rest, but only a tenth of a second off the pace, with team-mate Fernando Alonso fourth quickest and a third of a second down. Williams' Valtteri Bottas, Button and reigning champion Sebastian Vettel in his Red Bull were all around half a second adrift in fifth, sixth and seventh. The team-mates of the trio completed the top 10, with McLaren's Kevin Magnussen eighth fastest, followed by Williams' Felipe Massa and Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. Leading the way: Rosberg is ahead of Hamilton n the drivers' championship . The Australian has won the last two races to thrust himself into title contention, but suffered technical issues of his own during practice to keep him three quarters of a second back. With all race drivers back in harness for FP2, after four reserves were used in the first session, there was still another familiar sight with the Caterhams propping up the pack. After being forced to sit out the race in Spa for what he has claimed are ""political"" reasons in his team, and also FP1 at Monza, Kamui Kobayashi was back behind the wheel for FP2. Banner: Some Formula One fans appeared to be unhappy with the sport's new era . The Japanese was 21st, just under three seconds down, with team-mate Marcus Ericsson a fraction of a second down at the rear. Marussia's Max Chilton was 19th, the Briton even managing to finish ahead of Lotus' Romain Grosjean.","Hamilton missed majority of second practice session with electrical issue .

"A passenger jet bound for the US was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Ireland when a woman went into labour less than an hour after take-off yesterday. The Delta Airlines flight crew declared a medical emergency while the plane, en route to Atlanta from Amsterdam, was over Blackpool, England. The transatlantic jet, carrying 230 passengers and crew, was diverted to Shannon Airport so the woman could be taken to hospital. Medical emergency: The plane was en route to Atlanta from Amsterdam when it diverted to Shannon, Ireland . There were fears the woman would give birth on the plane because her contractions were getting ‘closer’, according to a report in The Clare Herald. The Boeing 767-300 landed safely and was met by paramedics, who assessed the woman and then rushed her to University Maternity Hospital Limerick by ambulance. The woman, who was almost full term, gave birth shortly after she was admitted to hospital, the newspaper reported. The Delta Airlines flight continued its transatlantic journey about two hours after it was forced to land. Flying while pregnant? Delta Airlines has no restrictions and does not require a letter from a doctor . Most airlines require pregnant women to provide a letter of consent or a letter from a doctor or midwife if they are flying within a month of their due date. Delta Airlines has no restrictions and does not require a medical certificate, but it encourages pregnant women to discuss air travel with a doctor before booking a ticket. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said there is no significant risk associated directly with air travel during pregnancy, even at advanced gestation. The college said there is no evidence that flying causes early labour or a woman’s water to break.","Delta Airlines flight was travelling from Amsterdam to Atlanta .

"Ronnie O'Sullivan suffered a surprise defeat on the opening day of the Shanghai Masters as veteran potter Alan McManus recorded a 5-3 victory over the five-time world champion. O'Sullivan looked to be in decent touch early on, with a 139 clearance helping him take a 3-2 lead but his Scottish opponent came roaring back to take the last three frames and move into the second round. It was O'Sullivan's first ranking event of the season, having skipped the Wuxi Classic and Australian Goldfields Open, but the 38-year-old was ultimately left to bemoan his performance as he suffered his second successive defeat following his loss to Mark Selby in the final of the World Championship at the end of the last campaign. Decent start: O'Sullivan began well with a break of 139 but failed to take his chances as the match went on . He told www.worldsnooker.com: 'Alan played a strong match, when he plays well he can beat anyone. I had a few chances but didn't make the most of them. 'I love this tournament so I wish I could have played better.' McManus, who enjoyed a run to the quarter-final at the Crucible earlier this year, admitted both he and O'Sullivan were well below their best form. 'We both struggled with the conditions,' said the world number 26. 'I won two or three scrappy frames and that was the difference. 'I didn't play very well but sometimes you play poorly and manage to scrape through - I was fortunate to do that.' Disappointed: O'Sullivan wanted to do well in Shanghai but lost his way against McManus . Beaten: The Rocket paid tribute to his opponent who, he said, can beat anyone in the world on his day . The other first-round match on Monday saw world number seven Shaun Murphy edge past Joe Swail in a final frame shootout. Despite breaks of 80, 102, 65 and 56, Murphy was taken the distance by the Northern Irishman but a run of 75 helped the Englishman edge to a 5-4 win.

"Lovebirds: Royal Parks staff release the pair of reunited Australian black swans on to Queen Mary's Gardens lake, in Regents Park, London . After seven years together, their romance came to an abrupt end last summer when constant  'squabbling' meant they had to be separated. But a pair of swans is having another go at making love work, as they were released into Regent's Park together. It is well known that swans mate for life, but the pair of Australian black swans began to concern park staff with their feisty attitude towards each other. The staff were eventually forced to intervene in the domestic, moving the female to another pond in Queen Mary's Gardens and leaving the male on his own. The separation clearly affected the male, who was seen searching and calling for his mate after her removal, according to Royal Parks staff. Andrew Williams, the gardens' assistant manager, told the BBC: 'The male and the female tend to mate for life . so it was a little unusual that they fell out.' But in spite of their unusual acrimony, he said the couple's return was a success. He added: 'We've . had a good release of the swans, with a little bit of a delay looking . out on to the water, then we stepped in and I think they look very happy . and very glad to be back to their rightful home.' Love on the lake: The pair of swans had been together for seven years when they were separated by park staff after squabbling last summer . The unusual breed of swan was initially . brought to the UK from Australia in private wildfowl collections but . many of the birds are thought to have escaped and now breed across the . country. But behind their attractive black feathers and red beaks, the birds are said to be much more aggressive than their British relatives. Dawn Balmer, from the British Trust for Ornithology told the Daily Telegraph in 2009 that the birds were now 'cropping up all over the place'. He added: 'We have been surprised by the numbers we have found...Some people would be upset if you said black swans might be killed, but others see them as a serious threat to biodiversity. They compete with other species for food and habitat and are quite aggressive.'","Park staff forced to separate pair of Australian black swans last summer .

"What do dogs want, petting or being spoken to? According to a study it’s very much the former. Scientists found that dogs had a preference for petting, whether it was from a stranger or from their owner. And it was found that dogs will only respond to vocal praise when they are very familiar with an owner and their voice. Scroll down for video . Research led by the University of Florida says dogs prefer petting (stock image shown). In the study they found dogs were more satisfied by physical contact. But they also found that dogs never tired of being petted. The results were true for dogs being petter by strangers and their owners . The research was led by Dr Erica Feuerbacher from the University of Florida. In the study, co-authored by Dr Clive Wynne of Arizona State University, the scientists examined a variety of dogs and their responses to situations. They looked at shelter dogs, owned dogs with strangers providing interactions and owned dogs with their owner providing interactions. Scientists think they know why domestic species tend to have certain characteristics that accompany their tameness, such as floppier ears, patches of white fur, and more juvenile faces with smaller jaws. Geneticists believe that a group of embryonic stem cells called the neural crest, link all these traits, which are seen in many people’s pet cats and dogs. Although the experts' proposal has not yet been tested, it is the first hypothesis that connects several components of the ‘domestication syndrome.’ It not only applies to mammals like dogs, foxes, pigs, horses, sheep and rabbits, but it may even explain similar changes in domesticated birds and fish, according to the study published in the journal Genetics. Across all groups they found the dogs had a preference for petting over vocal praise. Additionally they found that dogs never tired of being petted. When the dogs were petted they also preferred to stay in the proximity of the experimenter. But when only vocal praise was used they showed little proximity-seeking behaviour, on a similar level to when no interaction was initiated at all. ‘Overall, petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned,’ the researchers write. Previous research this year from the same two scientists, however, found that petting wasn’t the be-all and end-all; the animals actually preferred food to being touched. When food was readily available the dogs preferred to eat than be petted, and when access to food was limited the dogs showed ‘sensitivity’. ‘Overall, petting seems to be an important interaction between dogs and humans that might maintain inter-specific social behavior but vocal praise likely has to be specifically conditioned,’ the researchers write. In previous research they also found that dogs preferred food to petting .","Research led by the University of Florida says dogs prefer petting .

"Just days before the launch of a new iPhone, Apple shares had their worst day since January,  with one brokerage . warning of a stock downgrade unless its new products show better . promise for profit growth. However, it appears nobody has told Apple's fan - who have already starting to queue  for the iPhone 6. Outside the firm's Fifth Avenue store, fans have already set up camp. Scroll down for video . The queues have already begun outside Apple's Fifth Avenue Store . The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support.

"If you’ve ever taken a sneaky look through your partner’s phone, new research claims you are not alone. One in five men, and a quarter of women, in relationships admit to snooping through texts, apps and pictures on their partner’s devices. Although almost a quarter of male snoopers said they did so because they are nosy, 12 per cent admitted they were trying to catch their partner lying to them. The study from Prague security firm Avast surveyed 13,132 people in relationships across the US. It found one in five men, (stock image pictured) and a quarter of women check their partner’s phones. Almost a quarter of snoopers did so just because they are nosey, but 12% said they were trying to catch their partner lying . But looking for evidence of cheating was the number one reason why men looked through their boyfriend or girlfriend’s phone on tablet. Security firm Symantec recently left 50 fully charged handsets lying in the street, loaded with apps called Private Pix and Online Banking. The phones were left in New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco and Ottawa in Canada. By tracking which apps were opened on each device, the researchers found that 96 per cent of finders rooted through a handset for details including social network accounts. More than 43 per cent of finders tried to access online bank accounts. And only half tried to return the device. Almost a third of women said their excuse was curiosity, only 21 per cent thought their partner was cheating and 14 per cent wanted to see if their lover was lying to them. And more than half of men said they found evidence of cheating or lying, compared to 71 per cent of women. Although women were more likely to confront their partners about the lies. ‘One may think that people who snoop on their significant other to find evidence of cheating or lying are being paranoid,’ explained Avast. ‘Unfortunately, the majority of them are not paranoid–their gut feeling is often correct.’ A high percentage of respondents claimed they didn’t need a passcode to gain entry to their significant other’s device. More than 40 per cent of women reported their partner’s device did not have a passcode, compared to 33 per cent of men. Both male and female respondents claimed to know their partner’s device passcode because their partner had shared it with them in the past, unknowingly setting themselves up to get caught .

"The mother-of-four who made headlines last year leaving her children to go join Occupy Wall Street is divorcing her husband and cashing in on his banking-earned riches in the process. Stacey Hessler cites protesting as her profession and famously devoted herself to the Occupy movement, demonstrating against the very banks behind her recently increased cash-flow. She walks away from former banker Curtiss Hessler with a total of $85,385 from his stock-filled retirement fund and bank account. Stacey Hessler (left) has divorced from husband Curtiss (right) and will get $85,000 out of it . Hessler made headlines last year after leaving her children at home to join the Occupy movement . Divorce papers, seen by the New York Post, list 'irreconcilable differences' as the reason for the split, adding that their 19-year marriage 'is irretrievably broken'. It is understood by friends of the Occu-Mom that her persistent protesting has caused their relationship to fail. She would spend nights at a time sleeping outside high street banks in New York's financial district, including Bank of America, where Mr Hessler once worked before moving to a Florida local bank. And if she wasn't there she would often be found at a Brooklyn hostel, eating handout meals from a public atrium of a Wall St building. Dramatic photographs showed the moment Hessler was arrested . Hessler was charged with disorderly conduct after being arrested while protesting . It's a far cry from their white-picket-fenced three-bedroom Florida home on the aptly names East Rich Avenue.

"President Obama praised Estonia's digital accomplishments today, joking that he should have called on the country when setting up his administration's troubled health care website. During a joint press conference in Tallinn on Wednesday with President Ilves of Estonia, Obama called the country a 'vibrant democracy' where independence has been successfully reclaimed after the Cold War. The U.S. leader noted in particular the people's easy accessibility to their government - with each Estonian able to use a 'digital ID' to access public records online. Scroll down for video . President Obama joked during a joint press conference  on Wednesday in Tallinn that he needed Estonia's help with healthcare.gov . Obama said: 'Estonians can use their smart phones to get just about anything done online - from their children's grades to their health records. 'I should have called the Estonians when we were setting up our health care website.' Healthcare.gov has been plagued with problems since its launch last fall. Last month, MailOnline discovered 13 web pages on the site which held Latin-language filler text used by web designers instead of important details about health coverage. And in July, 11 out of 12 'secret shoppers' on the health care exchange were able to obtain coverage and subsidies using fake information. Federal investigators from the Government Accountability Office posing as prospective Obamacare applicants were able to successfully enroll in the federal marketplace over the phone and online by providing fictitious Social Security Numbers and proof of income. Since 2002, Estonia has had a mandatory, national ID card system which allows citizens digital access to secure e-services including government databases to check medical records and file taxes, i-voting and pre-paying for travel tickets. Each indvidual's online records is protected by a complex key encryption, according to                   e-estonia.com. Nine out of ten of Estonia's 1.3million residents have signed up to the ID cards. Three co-founders of Skype, the free online voice and messaging service, are from Estonia - Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallin. Along with Janus Friis, from Denmark, and Niklas Zennström, from Sweden they provided the backend of the company, which sold to Microsoft in 2011 for $8.5billion. Although the company is based in Luxembourg, almost half of the employees remain in Tallinn and Tartu, Estonia. President Toomas Hendrik Ilves (second left) of Estonia speaks alongside President Andris Berzins (left) of Latvia, President Dalia Grybauskaite (second right) of Lithuania and US President Obama on Wednesday . Obama arrived in Estonia on Wednesday morning as part of a three-day trip set to reassure the country and others in the region that were once under Soviet control, who have been warily eyeing Putin's aggression in Ukraine and fear he could set his sights on their nations next. Unlike Ukraine, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are NATO members, and have been seeking firm commitments that the U.S. and other alliance powers would come to their defense if Russia were to encroach on their territory. Following a meeting with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Obama declared that the U.S. commitment to security of NATO's newest members runs deep. Obama is the second sitting American president to visit Estonia, following President George W. Bush, who traveled here in 2006. Upon his arrival, Obama wrote in a guest book that it was an honor to visit 'a nation that shows what free people can achieve together.' The Baltics were invaded by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany during World War II. After the Soviet Union crumbled, the Baltic countries turned to the West and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004, much to the chagrin of Russia. Say what? The Obama administration's Healthcare.gov has been glitch-prone since its launch, with users encountering Latin-language filler text used by web designers in August .","The President joked about the state of healthcare.gov during a press conference in Tallinn, Estonia on Wednesday .

"Barack Obama left for a three-day European swing Tuesday afternoon without saying a single word in response to a terrorist video showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff, the second American journalist to die that way on camera. The president's departure  came amid equally deafening swirls of helicopter rotors and tough questions about whether and when the U.S. will strike back in a meaningful and public way against ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham. News of Sotloff's execution broke online at 1:05 p.m., shortly after White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest began his daily briefing with reporters; he said four minutes later that he hadn't heard the news. By 3:40, Obama was lifting off from the South Lawn of the White House on his way to a waiting Air Force One, which was 'wheels up' by 4:00. Just two weeks ago, the president was widely criticized for being pictured fist-bumping on the golf course minutes after solemnly addressing the nation about an ISIS video showing photojournalist James Foley's death. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Goodbye: Obama jumped aboard Marine One shortly before 3:40 p.m., en route to Air force One at Andrews Air Force base. He took off in his private Boeing 747 at 4:00 p.m. News of Sotloff's execution broke at 1:05. In a hurry: The president jogged up the steps to Air Force One on Tuesday, less than three hours after the gruesome scene of Sotloff's death was broadcast globally via social media . Walk on by: Obama strode to Marine One, his personal chopper, without acknowledging shouted questions from reporters about how he'll respond to Steven Sotloff's beheading. The helicopter took him to Air Force One . As Obama's chopper left the White House on Tuesday, CNN posted video of an interview with Brett McGurk, the Deputy U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran, who said Americans should 'stay tuned' for a reaction from the Obama administration. The U.S. is 'developing a broad regional coalition, a broad international coalition, working to get a new Iraqi government stood up, working to get our plans in place,' McGurk said. 'So stay tuned.' 'You cannot just go in militarily and start dropping bombs and hope that it's going to work out,' he said. 'You have to have a very sophisticated approach to this.' 'We are building now a broader campaign plan that we’ll develop over the days and weeks ahead,' he told CNN. The remark sounded like an affirmative echo of what Obama himself said five days ago, admitting that he hadn't decided whether to expand his anti-ISIS airstrikes beyond the borders of Iraq and into Syria . 'We don’t have a strategy yet,' he said then. CNN's Christiane Amanpour seemed out of patience on Tuesday. 'You say ""stay tuned,"" she snapped at McGurk, 'but in the meantime ISIS is busy beheading our colleagues, threatening more of them, massacring people on the ground and conducting the kind of brutality that we haven't seen in a long, long time.' Shortly after McGurk finished his interview, Obama strode past reporters on his way to Marine One without acknowledging them. 'No questions could be heard above the helicopter engine and no answers were given by the president,' according to a White House pool reporter. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, tried to drown out the bad news with press releases about a 'global sports mentoring program,' a groundbreaking ceremony for the U.S. Diplomacy Center,' and the '5th European Transgender Council Meeting.' After an eight-hour flight, Obama will wake up in Estonia for multilateral talks before continuing to Wales for a NATO summit. He will be accompanied by a subset of the White House press corps, as he was on Martha's Vineyard when his golf game became international news. Barely ten minutes after reading a resolute anti-ISIS message from a makeshift podium following Foley's beheading, the vacationing Obama was at the first tee. The photos that emerged hours later angered Americans who saw the commander-in-chief's grins and fist-bumps as a sign of disrespect while the dead journalist's family mourned. Video released Tuesday by the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) showed American journalist Steven Sotloff (L) next to an unknown jihadi shortly before his execution by beheading . Getaway chopper: Once out of earshot of the press corps, Obama boarded Marine One for a 15-minute flight to Andrews Air Force Base and a waiting Air Force One ride to Estonia . Members of Congress from the political left and right showed Tuesday that they are growing weary of the White House's slow-developing approach to combating ISIS. Republicans especially – but with Democrats softening – are demanding a plan to crush the group in its Syrian safe haven. 'Mr. President,' South Carolina Lindsey Graham tweeted on Tuesday, 'if you can't come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is.' U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson, a Georgia Republican, added on Twitter that 'we need to send a clear message to the Middle East and the rest of the world. There's only one way you deal with ISIS: You kill them.' House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, a California Republican, told CNN that the Sotloff video 'is exactly the reason why we have to go after ISIS, why we cannot just let them wreak havoc. They’re killers. They’re brutal.' Seasoned Capitol Hill Democrats are beginning to question Obama's wait-and-see posture too. Royce's counterpart Rep. Elliot Engel, who his the committee's ranking Democrat and a New Yorker, said he favored airstrikes in Syria. 'Yes, I do,' he told CNN. 'ISIS is obviously across the [Iraq] border, into Syria ... and they really have to be defeated,' he said. Senate Intelligence Committee chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, told NBC on Sunday that she has 'learned one thing about this president, and that is he’s very cautious. Maybe in this instance too cautious.' Confusion: State Dept. official Brett McGurk said Americans should 'stay tuned' for the anti-ISIS strategy that Obama said he didn't have last week . A Murderous trio of British militants linked with the cash-flush Islamist army are believed to be responsible for the beheading deaths of Sotloff and James Foley, and distributing gruesome videos showing the aftermath. 'The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,' National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said from the White House. 'If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.' At the State Department, a rattled spokeswoman Jen Psaki confused the executions of Foley and Sotloff. 'We certainly consider this act, this reported act, the act of the killing of James Foley, as a horrific terrorist act.' she said. 'If the video is genuine,' Psaki said, 'we are sickened by this brutal act, taking the life of another innocent American citizens.' Asked if the Obama administration will regard Sotloff's execution as an 'act of war,' she refused to say. 'We certainly – I'm not going to put new labels on it,' Psaki said.","Presdident walks to Marine One past journalists while ignoring their shouted questions .

"England’s rollercoaster season came to a spectacular finale on Sunday when they pulled off a thrilling three-run victory over India after MS Dhoni narrowly failed to add to his reputation as the great finisher of modern limited-overs cricket. There was no real context to this sole Twenty20 international, with 50-over cricket dominating the next six months, but the 24,000 crowd at Edgbaston were treated to the perfect example of the excitement the shortest format can provide. It looked as though a star-studded India side jam-packed with Twenty20 expertise were chasing down England’s competitive 180 for seven with ease while Virat Kohli was at last displaying the class absent throughout this tour. Smashing: Morgan produced a magnificent display of clean hitting to boost England's score . Good start: Jason Roy reverse sweeps his second ball in international cricket to the boundary . Disappointing: Moeen Ali was out for a duck as England stalled during the first powerplay . Yet England, who had owed their batting riches to a welcome return to form from Eoin Morgan, clawed their way back into the contest through excellent death bowling from James Tredwell, Steven Finn and Harry Gurney. Dhoni showed either incredible self-confidence or arrogance when India needed 17 off the last over from Chris Woakes, twice turning down singles and effectively telling his partner Ambati Rayadu to leave everything to him. But the man who has made his name and his fortune through guiding India home in last over finishes could not do it this time, managing only a single off the final ball when his perfect script called for him to clear the ropes for victory. ‘There are smiles in the changing room after a very tough summer,’ said stand-in England captain Morgan. ‘It’s great to be part of games like that, it’ s why you play the game. For young guys to experience this was brilliant and it was amazing to see how calm Woakes was during that last over.’ The match was almost a replay of last year’s Champions Trophy final in that the vast majority of the sell-out crowd were supporting India and the pitch, used and dry, was more like Bangalore than Birmingham. Happy boy: Eoin Morgan takes to Twitter to thank fans for their support . Long way: Alex Hales hit three fours and three sixes in his quick-fire 45 at the top of the order . Spectacular: Ajinkya Rahane takes a flying catch to dismiss Hales,as India fielded brilliantly . Big hitting: Morgan came in and began to dismantle the Indian bowling attack, hitting to all parts . Out of the ground: Morgan strikes one of seven maximums as England accelerated at the end of the innings . Yet that did not stop England taking the attack to India from the moment Alex Hales and Jason Roy, the big-hitting debutant, took 17 from Ravi Ashwin’s first over and set the tone for a refreshing, modern performance. Roy’s first international innings was to end in disappointment, as did that of Moeen Ali, who was disgracefully booed loudly by a majority of the Indian support, presumably because of his Pakistani heritage. The trouble with that is that he was born and bred in Birmingham, as was his father. At least the rest of England’s batsmen thrived in the ‘away’ atmosphere, with Hales hitting three sixes in his 40, to lay the foundations for a quite brilliant assault from Morgan, who looked so out of sorts in the one-day series. It has been the most difficult summer for Morgan, whose form in 50-over cricket had collapsed to such an extent that questions were being asked about his place and he had appeared to lose ground in the captaincy stakes to Joe Root. Yet this was vintage Morgan, displaying the unorthodoxy and pure timing that has made him one of the best limited-overs batsmen in the world. Keeping it going: Ravi Bopara took over the reigns after Morgan fell in the final over, blasting 21 from 9 balls . India were brilliant in the field, with Ajinkya Rahane’s sensational running pouching of Hales the best of his four catches, but their bowling was not at its best as one low full toss after another disappeared over the boundary. An inability to force the pace against spin was England’s downfall in the one-day series but after another tentative start in the middle orders Morgan soon found his range, 100 coming off the 12 overs of spin England faced. England saved their best for the last five overs, 81 runs being thrashed by Morgan, who finally holed out going for his eighth six of the innings, and Ravi Bopara, who returned to the side with a crucial unbeaten 21 off nine balls. Quicker one: Moeen Ali saw his second ball go for six before producing a flatter delivery to take a wicket . Help yourself: Shikhar Dhawan helps another leg-side delivery to the boundary as England bowled poorly . It was to prove a decisive contribution with India falling four runs short of the 40 they needed from the last four overs once the key wicket of Kohli, who hit 66 off 41 balls, had been claimed by Finn thanks to an excellent catch from Hales. Woakes had won the domestic Twenty20 tournament for Birmingham by keeping his head in the last over and he did it again here despite Dhoni hitting the first ball of the final over, and far from a poor one, over mid-wicket for six. But Woakes and England were to have the final word. ‘Rayudu is not used to batting at six or seven and it’s very difficult for a batsman to come in and just hit the ball,’ said Dhoni. ‘He wasn’t really middling many deliveries so I thought it was a better option for me to keep the strike.’ Class act: Virat Kohli put his recent poor form behind him, showing that he is a different player in T20 cricket . Maximum punishment: Finn walks back to his mark after being dispatched for another six . Bowled him: Woakes beats Shikhar Dhawan to slow the Indian charge but Kohli kept the runs coming . It was a decision that backfired for an Indian captain and his team, who have shown much more desire in the limited-overs games than they did in those last three woeful Test match performances. That 3-1 Test series triumph will remain the highlight of England’s summer but they will have enjoyed ending this most up and down and sometimes traumatic of transitional summers on a high note. Beauty: Raina can do nothing to keep out a fabulous yorker from Harry Gurney as England fought back . Final act: Dhoni hits the last ball of the innings, knowing that anything but a boundary isn't enough . Over the line: Woakes celebrates as the ball is fielded securing a win for England that had looked unlikely .","Morgan smashes seven maximums as he makes 71 off 31 balls .

The senior royal is pictured above with its captain Patrick Cazin (right) Prince Charles boarded HMS Duncan, a £1billion Royal Navy T45 vessel, where he met officers and staff . He presented Chief Petty Officer Engineering Technician (Weapon Engineering) Wayne Peake with a long service and good conduct medal. CPO Peake, who joined the Navy in 1984, at the age of 17, was involved in Operation Desert Storm while serving on HMS Gloucester in 1991, as well as the liberation of Kuwait. 'It has been an absolutely brilliant career so far, a real eye-opener. Being presented with this medal by the Admiral of the Fleet is a pinnacle,' the father-of-two told Wales Online.

In addition, the Royal Navy's HMS Biter patrol boat and HMS Express fast patrol boat will be part of the contingent . After his visit, Prince Charles briefly spoke to some of the crowd, who had been kept entertained by Her Majesty's Band of the Royal Marines. Tonight, he is hosting a reception for 60 world leaders on the first evening of the 2014 Nato Summit at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport. The summit is being dominated by the situation in Iraq, as well as the stand-off with Russia over Ukraine. There are 9,500 police officers from 43 forces involved in the security operation for the event, along with 12 miles of security fencing.

In response to the Ukraine crisis, the US has vowed to contribute troops and equipment to a rapid response force in Eastern Europe that would be able to deploy within 48 hours. Nato has already stepped up its air, land and sea rotations in the region. And Mr Obama announced last night that he would send more Air Force units and aircraft to the Baltics, most likely to Estonia's Amari Air Base. The alliance is also planning to establish forward operating bases in eastern Europe where fuel, ammunition and other supplies can by stockpiled ready for use in operations.

Barack Obama and David Cameron speak before taking their seats at the start of a Nato-Afghanistan round table meeting during the summit at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales today . With Britain and the US two of only four member states to meet the alliance's obligation to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence, Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Obama will be pressing other leaders to raise their spending on their armed forces. The US president had some harsh words for European members who had failed to deliver on their commitments in the past. 'For I think a certain period of time there was a complacency here in Europe about the demands that were required to make sure that Nato was able to function effectively,' he said. 'Obviously what's happened in Ukraine is tragic, but I do think it gives us an opportunity to look with fresh eyes and understand what it is that's necessary to make sure that our Nato commitments are met.' Mr Cameron and Mr Obama will hold talks tomorrow with president Poroshenko - together with Mr Hollande, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi - ahead of the main summit meeting. Leaders hold a meeting on Afghanistan during the Nato 2014 summit today. It has been billed as the most important summit since the Cold War got underway with calls to stand up to Russia over Ukraine and confront Islamic State extremists .","Reception at Celtic Manor in Newport to promote Wales and thank community for its hospitality .

"New video has been released showing  the moment police escorted a woman off a Delta flight earlier this week, after it was forced to reroute due to a passenger argument. Amy Fine of Boca Raton, Florida caused a disturbance on the flight to West Palm Beach, when the older woman sitting in front of her reclined her seat to knit and accidentally hit Fine in the head. Fine caused a commotion and the flight was forced to land at Jacksonville Airport in the third incident of its kind in less than a week. In a video recorded by a passenger, Fine is seen being escorted off the plane by three officers as someone in the background yells out 'Thank you'. Scroll down for video . Kicked off: 52-year-old Amy Fine (circled) was escorted off a Delta flight Monday night, after she forced the flight to land early after getting into an argument with another passenger . Passenger Aaron Klipin told WPTV that a woman sitting next to him got into an argument with a passenger behind her. The woman reclined her seat so she could knit while the other passenger was trying to sleep on the tray table. Klipin said the woman who was trying to take a nap started screaming and swearing, drawing the attention of the flight crew. According to the passenger, when a flight attendant came over, the dispute between the two women became even more heated, and the woman with her head on the tray table demanded that the plane be diverted. Klipin recalled hearing the woman say: 'I don't care about the consequences; put this plane down.' Another traveler who spoke to ABC's Good Morning America described the woman as 'nuts,' saying that she launched into a tirade about her dead pets. 'She said, ""I lost two dogs in the last month. I want her [the reclining passenger] off of here, or I'm going to leave; or I want you to stop the plane.' The stewardess went to talk to the pilot, who made the decision to land the plane 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a Delta spokesman. A few minutes later, the flight touched down in Jacksonville, where it was met by local law enforcement officials who removed the unruly woman from the plane. The flight later continued on to West Palm Beach, arriving after 11pm. A spokesman for the airline said: 'Out of an abundance of caution, the captain elected to divert to the closest airport. Local law enforcement met the flight and removed the passenger.' According to the airline, the diversion was 'due to safety reasons in regard to a passenger issue' but Florida television station WPTV reported that the plane rerouted due to a dispute over a reclining seat. Flight 2370 was forced to land in Jacksonville due to an undisclosed passenger disturbance. Above, a file photo of a Delta jet . This is the third similar incident, after diminishing leg room contributed to two clashes just last week. On Wednesday August 27, a American Airlines Miami-to-Paris flight was rerouted to Boston after air marshals had to restrain a man as two passengers came to blows when one of them attempted to recline their seat. The male passenger, Edmund Alexandre, of France, continued to be disruptive when a  crew member tried to calm him, following him down the aisle and grabbing his arm. Two undercover federal air marshals on the flight then subdued  and handcuffed the 61-year-old traveler. And on August 24, a fight started on a United Airlines flight when a male passenger resorted to using a Knee Defender, a $21 gadget designed to prevent the person in front  from reclining. A female passenger, sitting in the middle of Row 11 tried to recline, but found she couldn’t. When it emerged that the man in the seat behind had attached a Knee Defender, she asked a member of cabin crew  to remove it. He refused, saying that he would no longer be able to work on his laptop, and the situation escalated, with the woman hurling a glass of water in the man’s face. The New Jersey-to-Denver flight was diverted to Chicago, and both of the passengers were booted off. Reclining has long been a contentious issue, with surveys finding that as many as nine out of ten passengers believing that reclining seats should be banned on shorter flights. There is even a campaign on business networking site LinkedIn to make airlines remove reclinable seats on short-haul journeys.","Amy Fine, 52, was kicked off a flight from New York to West Palm Beach, Florida for getting in an argument with another passenger .

"Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco are prepared to take Petr Cech on loan for a year, in a deal which will appeal to Chelsea if they can secure the right to recall him. Cech is facing the prospect of a year on the sidelines after Jose Mourinho selected Thibaut Courtois for the opening game of the season at Burnley. Mourinho, who is also exploring the idea of swapping Fernando Torres with 23-year-old Roma striker Mattia Destro, would prefer to keep both goalkeepers at the club but accepts Cech’s desire to play regularly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say he wants Petr Cech to stay at Chelsea . Off? Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco are prepared to take Petr Cech on loan for a year from Chelsea . Dropped: Cech was replaced by Thibaut Courtois in goal for Chelsea against Burnley on Monday . Chelsea are in a position where they must cut one foreign player from their Premier League squad and two from their Champions League squad before the transfer window closes on September 1. Cech is an obvious candidate to leave, although Mourinho is concerned in case Courtois suffers any problems with fitness or form as he adjusts to the English game. There were no adjustment issues at Turf Moor though and Courtois has played consistently well on loan at Atletico Madrid. Back-up keeper Mark Schwarzer will be 42 in October and Mourinho will have doubts that he can play for an extended run as Chelsea challenge on four fronts, should it be necessary. The loan with a recall option would deliver Chelsea some peace of mind, although any recall would only be possible in January. The deal for Destro and Torres is less straightforward as it requires an agreement over Torres’ wages. Happy with both: Jose Mourinho insists he wants both to stay but must cut a foreign player from his squad .","Petr Cech set to join Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco on year-long loan .

"Jack Wilshere is enjoying his new deep midfield role for England, and wants to improve by watching videos of Andrea Pirlo and Javier Mascherano. The Arsenal midfielder occupied the position at the base of Roy Hodgson's midfield diamond for the first time on Monday night, and believes he can only get better in his new position. Wilshere usually plays further forward, but in England's first competitive game since the World Cup he was happy to fill the position vacated by former captain Steven Gerrard. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere say he'll study Pirlo to improve his game . New role: Wilshere was asked in the week to step into a deeper position for his national team . Improving: The Arsenal midfielder was happy with his first game in the position, but wants to get better . Learning form the best: Pirlo (right) and Mascherano are two of the best holding midfielders in world football . 'I spoke with the manager and  Gary Neville in the week and they told me they wanted me to play that role and I quite enjoyed it,' Wilshere told the FA's website. 'It was my first time ever playing there, so over the next month or so I am going to look at a few videos of the game and of players who play in that position regularly - Pirlo, Mascherano and players like that and I'll get better. You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . 'I felt it went well tonight but next time we meet up I feel it can only go better.' While Wilshere was playing in an unfamiliar role, his new club team-mate Danny Welbeck was given a chance back in his preferred position as a central striker, and the switch produced both of England's goals. 'As good as they get': Wilshere praised his new club-mate's finishing during the 2-0 win over Switzerland . No surprises: Wilshere said England were always confident that they could get the win in the qualifier . 'He really enjoys playing up front,' said Wilshere.

"Misfiring strikers Emmanuel Riviere and Siem de Jong need 'just one break' in front of goal to kick-start Newcastle's season, according to Alan Pardew. Newcastle eased to a 1-0 Capital One Cup second-round victory at Gillingham on Tuesday - but only courtesy of John Egan's own goal. Newcastle's entire squad have drawn blanks in the first three matches of the new campaign, leaving Pardew admitting his St James' Park stars must quickly sharpen up. Off target: Newcastle's summer striker signings Siem de Jong (left) and Emmanuel Riviere are yet to yield a goal for Alan Pardew's side after three games this season . Optimism: Newcastle manager Pardew says his strikers 'just need one break' Chance will come: Pardew has put faith in Riviere with the Frenchman starting both Premier League games . The Tyneside club's boss believes his new forwards will need a crucial slice of finishing fortune to see off Crystal Palace in Saturday's home Barclays Premier League clash. 'I just think we've shown real solid team performances in the three matches so far, without really getting a break in front of goal,' said Pardew. 'So many times we could have got a break tonight and we could have got a second or third goal and it didn't happen for us. 'I'm hoping to get a break on Saturday, we just need one break. 'It would be nice to score two or more goals on Saturday. 'The way Palace play, how quick they are on the break, you sense that they could score, so it might mean we do need to get two or three goals so that's what our focus must be.' Sky Bet League One side Gillingham never threatened Newcastle's chances of coasting to victory at Priestfield Road, the hosts also toothless in front of goal. Pardew admitted relief at victory but slight frustrations at his side's lack of cohesion. Hard luck: John Egan gets the last touch for Newcastle to score Gillingham's fourth own goal in six games . Summer signing De Jong was unable to forge a flowing partnership with Riviere, despite lively showings from Gabriel Obertan and full debutant Rolando Aarons. 'The scoreline didn't really reflect our dominance,' said Pardew. 'I've been here many times as a manager. I've played here, and done a lot of scouting here too. 'It's a very, very difficult place to come. And yet we controlled the game more or less all the way through. 'I'm pleased but a bit frustrated we didn't score more than the one. 'They gave up a lot of space in midfield to play that extra centre-half. It was difficult to penetrate their three centre-halves. 'But I can't be too disappointed, I thought our application to the game was great. Our two centre-halves typified that, particularly the skipper. Enough to win: Gabriel Obertan (25) celebrates the goal his dangerous cross can be credited for creating . 'Absolute respect we showed Gillingham tonight, and that's how you get wins at places like this.' Gillingham boss Peter Taylor was at a loss to find reason for his side's fourth own goal in six matches of the embryonic season. 'It's absolutely amazing; incredible,' said Taylor of Gillingham's own-goal glut. 'That's the way it goes, hopefully there will be no more. 'It's a little unlucky on John, and being a Sunderland boy as well. 'He's got a great head on him, so he'll be fine. 'I don't think it's anything we're doing wrong. 'There's nothing we're doing to encourage that, it's just one of those things. 'The only thing I'm disappointed with is that we didn't have 90 minutes' belief.'

"The Pentagon dispatched a shadowy veteran of their 'dirty wars' in 1980s Central America to train the sectarian militia units in Iraq that allegedly tortured and killed tens of thousands of people. Colonel James Steele, a 58-year-old veteran special forces retiree was sent by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2004 to utilize his expertise in counter-insurgency a special investigation by The Guardian newspaper of the UK claims. Accompanying Steele, who worked as an advisor in El Salvador's bloody civil war of the 1980s was retired Colonel James H. Coffman, who reported directly to former CIA director and retired General David Petraeus. Allegedly inseparable, Steele and Coffman both oversaw operations at Iraqi detention centers, and Coffman described himself as the decorated general's 'eyes and ears out on the ground'. Colonel James Henry Coffman (left) trained Shia Iraqi paramilitaries in an attempt to quell a Sunni insurgency along with Colonel James Steele (right- 2nd to the right) Colonel Coffman reported directly to General David Petraeus - seen here in Iraq with U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney in 2006 . It is the first time that Petraeus - who . resigned in November from the CIA after a sex scandal - has been . implicated through a subordinate to torture in Iraq, which was brought . to the brink of all-out civil war by the sectarian Shia commando units . who ran amok across the country after the U.S. invasion of 2003. The 15-month long joint BBC Arabic/Guardian examination was launched after reporters trawled through the classified U.S. military documents released by Bradley Manning which ended up as part of Wikileaks. Manning, 25, is likely to be sentenced to 20-years in jail after he confessed to leaking the documents. According to the probe, in 2004, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld picked 58-year-old retired special forces veteran and counter-insurgency specialist Colonel James Steele to assist in creating Shia militia's to crush Sunni insurgents backed with millions of U.S. dollars. Keen to exact revenge against Sunni's who backed Saddam Hussein's brutal regime, the U.S. backed Special Police Commando (SPC) units set up secret detention centers where bloody and gruesome sectarian torture was acted out. Torturers: Special Police Commandos stand guard on top of their vehicle in Najaf, 160 km (100 miles) south of Baghdad in January of 2007 - the country was brought to the brink of all out civil war by sectarian violence by these militias . Members of Shi'ite's Mehdi army hold their weapons as they patrol a road in Baghdad's Sadr city June 23, 2006 . Colonel Steele answered directly to Rumsfeld and his right hand man was Colonel Hoffman, who reported directly to General Petraeus, who was at the time training the post-Saddam Iraq security forces. But according to American and Iraqi witnesses interviewed for the explosive piece, the two military consultants and Petraeus either saw or knew about the deadly daily torture of detainees who were in SPC custody. 'They knew everything that was going on there,' Iraqi General Muntadher al-Samari, who worked with Steele and Coffman to organize the commandos according to The Guardian. Claiming that Steele and Coffman worked 'hand in hand', al-Samari said that he never saw either them alone and came into contact with them about 50 times. Photojournalist Gilles Peress (left) and New York Times reporter Peter Maass both reported hearing and seeing clear signs of torture at a detention center in Samarra . 'They knew everything that was going on there ... the torture, the most horrible kinds of torture,' said al-Samari to the British newspaper. Apparently, the investigation uncovered no evidence at all that Steele or Coffman tortured prisoners themselves, but still claims they were present at detention centers where it happened. One witness, photographer Gilles Peress, said that he encountered Steele while on assignment for the New York Times at one of the detention centers in the Iraq city of Samarra. 'We were in a room in the library interviewing Steele and I'm looking around I see blood everywhere,' said Peress to The Guardian. New York Times reporter Peter Maass accompanied Peress and said,'while this interview was going on with a Saudi jihadi with Jim Steele also in the room, there were these terrible screams, somebody shouting: 'Allah, Allah, Allah!' But it wasn't kind of religious ecstasy or something like that, these were screams of pain and terror.' Steele, who now works as a motivational speaker did not respond to any questions put to him during the course of the report and Coffman declined to comment. An official, who spoke on behalf of General Petraeus said, 'During the course of his years in Iraq, General Petraeus did learn of allegations of Iraqi forces torturing detainees. In each incident, he shared information immediately with the US military chain of command, the US ambassador in Baghdad ... and the relevant Iraqi leaders.' The Guardian newspaper discovered that the Shia Muslim 'death squads' were so out of control that they used to parade suspected Sunni Muslim's on a television program called 'Terrorism in The Hands of Justice.' The premise of the show was to display suspected insurgents on television but began to be seen as distasteful. Regardless, Samari is reported to have remembered being in the home of General Adnan Thabit – head of the special commandos - when a representative of Petraeus phoned to demand that tortured men ceased to appear on the program. Disrespect:  A picture released by ABC News May 19, 2004 shows a woman identified as Specialist Sabrina Harman posing over the body of detainee Manadel a-Jamadi in Abu Ghraib prison . 'General Petraeus's special translator, Sadi Othman, rang up to pass on a message from General Petraeus telling us not to show the prisoners on TV after they had been tortured,' said Samari to The Guardian. Othman has denied that his former boss endorses torture and called any suggestion to the contrary 'horses**t'.","General David Petraeus was the direct senior of Colonel James H.

"'Scandalous': Mother-of-11 Heather Frost (pictured) is having a six-bed 'mansion' built for her by the council because she can't cope in her current home . With six bedrooms, three bathrooms, a huge kitchen and the very latest in energy-saving eco-friendly design, it is a house that a great many of us would be very happy to buy and move into. We’d probably be even happier – and perhaps a little humbled – if it was being specifically built for us and paid for by the taxpayer. But not Heather Frost. Far from simply being grateful for her good fortune, the jobless mother of 11 says that if she doesn’t like the house she’ll just tell the council to build her another one. She is due to move into the property – valued at £400,000 – in July after ‘struggling’ to survive in two adjacent houses in Churchdown, Gloucestershire, which have been joined together by the council. Her new home will slash water and energy bills with its modern design using natural, locally-sourced materials. Extra large windows will fill it with natural light. But Miss Frost, 37, who is also a grandmother, said the move is still subject to her approving the two-storey accommodation with its 355sq ft kitchen and dining area. Neighbours say Frost currently lives with 14 people: all her eleven children, two grandchildren and her partner Jake, who they claim is also unemployed. ‘It’s being built especially for me,’ she said. ‘If I go there and I say to them I don’t like it or it’s too small, then they will just have to build me a bigger one, won’t they?’ Miss Frost says living in her current accommodation has been a nightmare. A minibus and two battered cars were parked on the lawn of the house yesterday. At the rear of the property the fence is falling down and two satellite dishes hang from the wall. After years of complaining, the council arranged for the 1,850sq ft two-storey eco-home to be custom built for her as part of a housing development. 'Nightmare': The jobless 37-year-old currently lives in two houses (pictured) in Churchdown, near Gloucester which were knocked through five years ago to accommodate her massive brood . Trashy: The back of their current home in Churchdown, Gloucester . Deal: Tewkesbury Borough Council bosses have sold a plot of land in Northway Lane, Tewkesbury, for around £210,000. In return, the housing provider is building the six-bed super-house along with 12 other homes . Grand designs: The plans for the family's plush new eco-home which the council has agreed to build . Miss Frost, who lives on benefits, says she has been waiting years for the council to offer suitable housing. ‘We got this three-bed house and they knocked a doorway through to the one next door. It was meant to be for four months but we’ve been here for five years now. ‘It is a nightmare because you can’t keep an eye on the children in the other house and there’s only one door between them which is a fire risk.’ She added: ‘The older children are living over there while I am with the younger ones in this house.’ Her neighbours say she currently lives with 14 people – all of her 11 children, two grandchildren and her unemployed partner Jake. The six-bedroom house in Tewkesbury half way through construction for the large family . Spacious: The house comes with six bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen/ diner and two bathrooms . Money-saver: The new house will boast an energy efficient design to help keep Heather's energy bills down . Controversial: Councillor Derek Davies said it was a 'great example' of how the council works with housing providers to ensure affordable housing is provided for all our residents' housing needs . Miss Frost first became pregnant at the age of 14, to a man of 23 who ended up in jail. She is now sterile after having cervical cancer in 2011. According to official records her children are: Sophie, 21, Toby, 19, Megan, 18, Angel, 16, Jay, 14, Chloe, 13, Paige, 12, Emily, ten, Bethany, nine, and Ruby, seven and Tilly, two. She is grandmother to Sophie’s son Ashley, two. Miss Frost, who says she is married, added: ‘Some other mums have called me a slag but I’d love to have more kids if I could.’ Tewkesbury Borough Council came up with a solution to housing her family after selling a plot of land in the town to Severn Vale Housing association for the knock-down price of £210,000. The condition of the sale was that one of the 15 affordable homes they built on the site would be one for the Frosts. Miss Frost (pictured with one of her sons) first fell pregnant at just 14, to a 23-year-old boyfriend who ended up in prison, and has gone on to have ten more children . What a state: Miss Frost's current home in Gloucestershire is blighted by a bashed-up minibus, car and a skip . Taxpayer groups describe the situation as a ‘scandal’. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Benefits are there to help those who need support, not subsidise a lifestyle that most people paying for them could not afford.’ Miss Frost may be less than impressed with her impending move, but some of her current neighbours can’t wait. One said of the family: ‘They’re hell. When they finally go, we’re having a street party.’ Tewkesbury councillor Derek Davies said: ‘This is a great example of how we work with housing providers to ensure affordable housing is provided for all our residents’ needs.’","Heather Frost, 36, lives in two houses which have been knocked together .

"A four-year-old cancer survivor's dream Make-A-Wish Foundation trip to Disney World has been cancelled by her own father - because he thinks only dying children deserve the charity's money. McKenna May, from Haskins, Ohio, was granted $3,500 (£2,235) to fund a once-in-a-lifetime holiday to the Florida theme park, after spending half her short life undergoing agonising treatment for leukemia. But the brave little girl has been left devastated after her father William May refused to sign a consent form allowing her to go, . McKenna May, here with her mother Whitney, spent two years of her short life fighting leukemia and she's now finally free and clear . Dream trip denied: May's father banned her from accepting a free trip to Disney World, because she's not dying of cancer . Since she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2010, McKenna has undergone 15 spinal taps, multiple chemotherapy treatments, and a series of steroid injects. She has been hospitalised numerous times. She underwent her final treatment last month after showing signs of beating the disease, but won't won't be officially cancer-free for another five years, . To cheer her up during the painful treatments, McKenna's mother Whitney Hughes and grandmother Lori Helppie applied to the Make-A-Wish foundation. Moved by her plight, the charity granted McKenna her wish and agreed to pay for the family to travel to Disney World in Florida. Fund-raising: McKenna's mother and grandmother are now trying to raise the money so she can meet her hero, Mickey Mouse . But before the trip could be booked, both parents had to sign a consent form. And William May refused. Speaking to the Bowling Green Sentinel-Tribune . newspaper, he argued the gift was an improper use of donations, and . that handouts should be reserved for 'kids who only have six months to . live'. Mrs Hughes is convinced her . ex-husband is trying to punish her after he was granted just visitation . rights to his daughter earlier this year. And . Mr May admitted he is angry with his ex-wife and her mother, who he . claims are preventing him from seeing his daughter. He told the . Sentinel-Tribune: 'I wasn't allowed to be involved. It ticked me off.' Ms . Hughes and Ms Hellpie have refused to give up hope they can still take . McKenna to Disney World and are attempting the raise the money . themselves, passing around collection jars in their local community. Ms Helppie said: 'The important thing is to get her there.She loves Mickey Mouse. She loves Cinderella.' Ms Hughes added: 'She's really excited. It's all she's talked about for the last three months.' Charity chiefs are, meanwhile, bewildered by the row - having ruled McKenna was clearly deserving of the trip. Susan McConnell, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish for Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana, told the Sentinel-Tribune: 'The doctors are the ones who determine if she is qualified. She's been through a lot. What I really feel bad about is she is stuck in the middle.'","McKenna May, 4, has spent half her short life fighting leukemia .

"For years Muhammad has been racing up the chart of the country’s most popular baby names – and now he has been joined by his sisters Nur and Maryam. The two girls’ names have been among the most popular of 2014, according to website BabyCentre. The data shows a surge in Arabic names in the UK this year, with Omar, Ali and Ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time. Scroll down for video . The data shows a surge in Arabic names in the UK this year, with Omar, Ali and Ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time . For girls, Maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35, while Nur is a new entry in the girls’ top 100, jumping straight to number 29. And Muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys. Sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year’s biggest riser within the girls’ top 100 was Maryam, while the highest new entries were Nur, Emilia and Gracie. For baby boys, Teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100. The highest new entry was Kian. Sarah Redshaw, managing editor for BabyCentre, said: ‘With the increase of Arabic names, the top 100 shows the ever-increasing diversity of the UK today.’ The Royal relegation continued with George falling a further five places. The name slipped out of the top ten to number 13 shortly after the future king’s birth last year. Other royal names – such as Harry and William – also continued to fall in popularity this year. Popular names from the 1970s seem to be making a comeback, with Emma, Sarah and Maria up 10, 32 and 12 places respectively . Miss Redshaw said: ‘Parents have also been influenced by celebrity name choices. The Beckhams and Simon Cowell have been big influences this year. Eric, the name Simon Cowell chose for his son, increased by 314 per cent.’ The names of David and Victoria Beckham’s offspring proved popular with parents. Harper is a new entry in the top 100 this year, while Romeo is up 67 per cent and Cruz is up 400 per cent. Ariana entered the top 100 girls’ names for the first time, with singer Ariana Grande topping the charts this year. Game Of Thrones star Emilia Clarke inspired new entry Emilia at number 53 and Piper was up 267 per cent, thanks to TV series Orange Is The New Black. Breaking Bad also continued to influence parents, as Skyler, Jesse and Walter all increased in popularity. But Miss Redshaw added: ‘Parents are wary of names associated with celebrities who exhibit bad behaviour, the controversial pop singer Miley Cyrus being a prime example.’ The name Miley has fallen, as have Amy and Nick, following the release of the mystery thriller book and movie Gone Girl. Popular names from the 1970s seem to be making a comeback, with Emma, Sarah and Maria up 10, 32 and 12 places respectively. Angela, Joanne, Claire and Karen also all increased in popularity and John made it into the top 100.

"Just weeks ago 15-year-old Ruta Meilutyte was sitting with classmates at Plymouth College.Today she's an Olympic champion. The Lithuanian swimming prodigy, taught and trained at an English secondary school, stormed to victory in the 100m breaststroke final. Nobody expected Miss Meilutyte to even reach the final and she was so shocked by her own success, the teenager held her hands over her mouth when she first clapped eyes on the scoreboard. Scroll down to see Ruta interviewed . I don't believe it! Lithuania's Ruta Meilutyte reacts with shock after discovering she has won the women's 100m breaststroke final . Hands up if you've won gold: Meilutyte's emotion soon turns to one of joy as it sinks in that she is Olympic champion . The 15-year-old Plymouth schoolgirl celebrates with her medal . When the BBC approached her for an interview poolside, the shaken Miss Meilutyte told retired British swimmer Sharron Davies: 'I can't believe it. It's all too much for me. I just can't believe it.' The 15-year-old not only became the first swimmer from her country to win an Olympic medal she did it in under extraordinary circumstances. The start, a time when swimmers are already battling their nerves, was delayed by a technical malfunction that saw the starter's gun go off before he had called 'on your marks'. American Breeja Larson dived into the pool on the gun but was able to race because of the malfunction.

Happy family: Meilutyte with, left to right, brother Mindaugas, father Saulius, grandmother Aldonas, and brother Margiris . High emotion: Meilutyte cries on the podium with her gold medal before composing herself to give a big smile for the world's press . The eight finalists sat down while the problem was fixed and an unfazed Miss Meilutyte still got off the blocks fastest and led at the turn but then had to survive a fierce challenge from American Rebecca Soni, the reigning world champion in the event. The more experienced Miss Soni drew level in the final few strokes but Miss Meilutyte kept her cool and got her hands on the wall first in one minute, 05.47 seconds. Miss Soni was second in 1:05.55 while Japan's Satomi Suzuki finished third in 1:06.46. Australia's . Leisel Jones, the defending Olympic champion who won a silver medal at . the 2000 Sydney Games when she was 15, finished fifth overall in her . fourth and final appearance at the Games.

Fine margins: Meilutyte, right, touches to win just inches ahead of Rebecca Soni of the US . 17-year-old US swimmer Missy Franklin celebrates winning the women's 100m backstroke final . Franklin celebrates with Britain's Gemma Spofforth, who finished fifth . Speaking before the final, Rudd, who describes his pupil as 'super human', told the Plymouth Herald: 'The only limit to what she is capable of achieving is herself. 'There are girls out there with long standing experience and they are going to bring that to the final. 'But what Ruta (left) brings is youth and vibrancy. She is not worried about reputations. 'She has already achieved her ambition by reaching the semi-finals.' She wasn't the only teenage success story at the aquatics centre last night,. Missy Franklin started a fantastic night in the pool for Team USA, claiming the first of two golds when she stormed to victory in the 100m backstroke final. The 17-year-old, competing in seven events at her first Games, overhauled Australia's Emily Seebohm in the final few strokes, to win her first individual medal of London 2012. The night quickly got better for the American team when Matt Grevers and Nick Thoman powered to a gold and silver one-two in the men's 100m backstroke. The jubilation made up for Ryan Lochte's disappointment earlier in the night. The heavily fancied 27-year-old crashed out of the medal positions during a scintillating 200m freestyle final, which was won by Frenchman Yannick Agnel. Franklin's victory was made all the more impressive considering she had swum in a 200m freestyle semi-final just 20 minutes earlier. It didn't stop her storming past Seebohm, who led the turn under world record pace, but had to settle for silver ahead of Japan's Aya Terakawa was third. British world record holder Gemma Spofforth finished fifth. The American gold medal winner said afterwards: 'I knew it was going to be tough, and I somehow managed to get the gold medal and I have never been as happy in my whole life.' Giant Grevers collected his first individual gold medal in the final of the men's 100 metres backstroke. Using every inch of his 6ft 8 in frame, Grevers stretched his long arms out to win in a time of 52.16 seconds, a new Olympic record and just 0.22 outside the world record set by Aaron Peirsol. American Nick Thoman finished second in 52.92 while Japan's Ryosuke Irie got the bronze medal. Brit Liam Tancock finished in fourth, just four tenths of a second outside the bronze medal position. The final American medal of the night was collected by Rebecca Soni, who had to settle for silver when she couldn't overpower 15-year-old Lithuanian Ruta Meilutyte. The medal haul makes up for the disappointment in the night's first final when favourite Ryan Lochte was stunned out of the medal positions during an electric 200m final in the Aquatics Centre. United States' Ryan Lochte reacts after failing to win a medal in the men's 200m freestyle . The American faded in the last two lengths as Agnel powered away from the chasing pack to claim gold. Yang Sun and Taehwan Park shared silver, ahead of Lochte in fourth and Britain's Robbie Renwick in sixth. Speaking after his sixth place finish, Glaswegian Renwick said: ""If I can keep going the way I am going then who knows maybe in the next four years I could actually get a medal. It all went well, it was another PB for me. It's all about getting amongst the medals but sixth place I can't have done much more.' Spofforth was equally philosophical after her fifth place finish. The 25 year old has come close to quitting swimming in the past and insisted tonight's performance in a strong field dominated by Frankling, justified her decision to return to the pool. She said: 'I've always said it's the journey and not the destination. I am disappointed but everything happens for a reason and I am just really enjoying my swimming right now. 'I have been rock-bottom but it's great to be back enjoying life again and have my passion back for life and swimming. Training with Ryan (Lochte) and working with Olympians is what really inspires me and I work with children back at home and want to inspire them.' Brit Liam Tancock came agonisingly close to a medal in the 100m backstroke, finishing just four tenths of a second outside third place . After coming so close to landing a gold for Britain, Liam Tancock, the world champion at 50m, has vowed to return in four years time - when he'll be 31. A Brazilian who won bronze in judo broke his medal when he wore it into the shower, and faces a fight to have it replaced. Felipe Kitadai said he decided to take his medal into the shower as a joke, but dropped it. The Brazilian Olympic Committee admitted the IOC had no obligation to give Kitadai another one. He said: 'I went out there and gave it everything, it didn't quite come off for me but Rio is only four years away. I just love what I do, swimming is an amazing sport. It's an absolute dream to swim in a pool like this, in front of a crowd like this. 'I was walking before and saw the poster about inspiring future generations and I hope we are doing that, not just me but the whole of team GB, hopefully we will inspire the next generation of swimmers.' Earlier in the pool, Britain's Caitlin McClatchey qualified for the women's 200m freestyle final with a strong second place finish in her semi-final heat. McClatchey led world champion Federica Pellegrini at the final turn, but was eventually overtaken by the Italian - qualifying sixth fastest. She said afterwards: 'I could hear the crowd the whole way through, it was incredible. I have had a really tough two years and thought about quitting but I am really enjoying it now. I have got a fantastic team at Loughborough University and without them I couldn't have done it.'","Brits Spofforth, Renwick and Tancock miss out on medals .

"Australian billionaire James Packer came to blows with his TV boss best friend in the street because he believed a camera crew was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr, it has emerged. David Gyngell, 47, had gone to the casino owner's $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure him after an alleged exchange of heated text messages. But the pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows. Explosive pictures showed 46-year-old Packer and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly before being pulled apart by a bodyguard. The morning after: TV boss David Gyngell leaves James Packer's Bondi Beach house on Monday, the day after the fight . Close shave: Gyngell held a crisis meeting with his childhood friend less than 24 hours after they were seen at each other's throats . Gyngell can be heard shouting: 'I didn't even know you were in f***ing Australia,' in video footage of the punch-up, reports The Daily Telegraph. Packer's face was scarlet with rage and some images showed his neck veins bulging. He was left with a bruised right eye and a a swollen left cheekbone. 'They were beating the hell out of each other — fists were flying,' said photographer Brendan Beirne, who had been tailing the billionaire in the hope of getting a picture of him with Kerr. 'It just exploded. I've covered riots before, but nothing like this involving two such wealthy and high-profile people,' he said. Casino boss: James Packer has been friends with Gyngell for 35 years . This morning a grim-faced but clean-shaven Gyngell paid a brief visit to Packer's mutli-million dollar home in Bondi, Sydney, which was the scene of yesterday's fight. A short time later the pair, who have known each other since childhood, issued a joint statement downplaying the incident. 'We have been friends for 35 years and still are,' it read. 'In that time we have had our fair share of ups and downs. We respect each other and neither of us will be commenting further.' Karl Stefanovic, who initially played down the impromtu fight, was seen leaving Packer's home on Monday evening. He insisted to the MailOnline that the two friends had since made up. 'I think they've resolved their differences, it's all good, the lads are all good,' he said. 'I think Gyng and James are as good as they can be, they're good mates, they'll get through it.' Asked if the two regretted their now infamous afternoon scuffle, Stefanovic said: 'I'll leave that up to them to talk about...I'm just there to support them.' The TV star was put in an awkward position as mediator between the media supremos, due to his close friendship with James Packer and the fact Nine boss David Gyngell pays his wage. Packer has been bunkered down in his huge Bondi Beach mansion for nearly 36 hours since he came to blows with his childhood mate. Throughout the day he has had deliveries of vegetables, streaky bacon and pizza brought to the door. Rupert Murdoch's son Lachlan, a former business associate of Packer's also visited the house today. He emerged from the mansion at 2.25pm to a waiting chauffeur driven limousine but refused to answer questions about what Murdoch's News Ltd had paid the fight photographs, which reportedly went for a six figure amount with some estimates  going as high as $210,000. Packer fury: James Packer is said to have erupted in fury because he believed a television van from David Gyngell's Nine Network was in his street trying to capture images of Miranda Kerr (pictured above in Sydney this week with son, Flynn) visiting the casino mogul with whom she is rumoured to be romantically involved . Packer and Gyngell are understood to have fallen out after the casino boss split from his wife of six years Erica Baxter, who is mother of his three children. Unconfirmed rumours of a relationship with Kerr are said to have caused further strain between the pair. The Victoria's Secret model, who broke up with actor Orlando Bloom last year, arrived in Sydney in the weekend. This seems to have prompted Packer's fear that he was being followed by a film crew. Gyngell, the head of Nine Entertainment Group, turned up at the house just after 2pm on Sunday to tell his friend that the van actually belonged to an on-call television staffer who just happened to live in the street. Stuck in the middle: Karl Stefanovic was seen leaving James Packer's home in Bondi on Monday evening . 'Packer basically told [Gyngell] to remove his f***ing truck from his street,' claimed a source. Gyngell had come straight from surfing and was barefoot. The board was still strapped to the roof rack of his white Audi SUV, which he parked on the driveway while he waited around 20 minutes for Packer to arrive. He came straight from Sydney Airport where he had flown in on his private jet. Witnesses said the pair squared up to one another and then exchanged a string of blows before tumbling to the footpath. Packer's bodyguard finally forcibly separated by grasping the billionaire around the chin from behind and pulling him away. One of the men was heard saying: 'Leave it James, just leave it.' Gyngell, who was best man at Packer's wedding, looked stunned and off kilter, before leaving the scene. A doctor visited the house a short time later. Witness Chris Walker tweeted that both men went 'toe to toe' in 'a big street fight', each landing heavy punches. The men wrestled for five minutes on the pavement. Young tycoons: friend and TV mogul Lachlan Murdoch, a former business associate of James Packer, has turned up at the Packer residence following the 'make up' statement by the casino boss with David Gyngell . Empathy: Lachlan Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has known both James a Packer and David Gyngell for many years and can empathise with Packer about the pressures of being a media heir . 'Packer packed a punch but copped a couple of hits straight to the jaw... Then they all fell on the concrete fence and I think the other guy broke his face ... They were looking for teeth after he left,' Walker said on Twitter. Packer, now an international casino mogul, and Gyngell, were boyhood friends whose fathers started the television industry in Australia. David Gyngell's father Bruce was the first man on Australian television. Kerry Packer, James's late father started the Nine Network which David Gyngell now heads up. Gyngell Snr, who died in 2000, is credited with creating the 'sofa format' of breakfast television in the UK, and rescuing TV-am in the 1980s. He injected chatty presentation, cheery weather forecasts, breaking the so-called 'rules' of television and risking the cold shoulder of the British television establishment. A ruthless cost cutter, but outwardly charming, he became Margaret Thatcher's favourite broadcasting executive when she was prime minister. Six-years together: Erica and James married in 2007 in the French Riviera, and split in 2013 . Best man: At the 2007 wedding of James Packer and Erica Baxter (above, left), in the south of France, David Gyngell (above right, on wedding platform) stood by Packer . Kerry, the father of James Packer, was Australia's richest man before he died in 2005. He established Australia's most dominant television network, Channel Nine, and a magazine empire, Australian Consolidated Press. Kerry Packer was one of Australia's most influential men - with an abrasive personality, fantastic wealth, and an expensive gambling habit - who became involved in legendary clashes with the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian media. Outside Australia, Packer was best known for founding World Series Cricket, which he did in defiance of the staunch opposition of the British cricketing establishment. James Packer appears to have inherited some of his father's love of verbal confrontation. In 2008, James confronted David Leckie, one of Channel Nine's former longtime executives, who had defected to rival station Seven, and told him to 'f*** off' and challenged him to a more physical encounter, saying, 'You want to go outside now? Let’s do it'. Packer also tore strips off a female News Corp gossip columnist for an alleged item she had written about his private life, swearing at her and thrusting his hands in her face. When his father was being treated at a New York Hospital for kidney failure, James came outside and told waiting media to 'f*** off'. Following his father's death, James Packer began divesting himself of the Packer media interests, including the Nine Network and the magazine empire, in favour of international gaming assets. James Packer's worldwide gambling empire, Crown, owns Crown Aspinall’s in London, and casinos in Melbourne, Perth, Macau and Las Vegas. Packer, who has been married twice, split from his second wife Erica Baxter in 2013 after six years together. Mrs Packer now lives in Los Angeles with their three children, Indigo, 5, Jackson, 4, and 18-month-old Emmanuelle. David Gyngell and his wife, television presenter Leila McKinnon, are expecting their second child. Famous fathers: Bruce Gyngell (above, left) and Kerry Packer (above, right) were lifelong friends and prime movers in the development of the Australian television industry and British breakfast television.

"The British girl who was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men in Majorca has been forgiven by her family of born-again Christians, a friend today claimed. The 18-year-old blonde, from Northern Ireland, was captured on video working her way through holidaymakers at a nightclub in the island's notorious party capital of Magaluf. Donning . pink hotpants and a loose-fitting white vest top, she was cheered on by revellers as . she moved from man to man, encouraging each of them to take their . trousers down. Organiser: Alex Collinson (left) organised the Carnage Magalluf event during which a British girl (right) was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men.

But now, a friend has revealed she has been 'fully forgiven' by her family, who are said to have been 'deeply involved' in a born-again Christian movement for a number of years. 'She . made a terrible mistake a few weeks ago and she has been fully forgiven. Her family love her and will protect her in their faith,' the family friend told the Irish Daily Mirror. 'She has been a victim, a target of evil, of wickedness and she has most definitely been led astray in a vulnerable moment. She . dropped her Godly protection for a moment – but that’s all it takes.' Party capital: The 18-year-old blonde, from Northern Ireland, was captured on video working her way through holidaymakers at a nightclub in the island's notorious party capital of Magaluf (pictured) Footballer Nathan Redmond was among Twitter users who condemned the act, calling it 'sickening' Under . Ellie Stevenson branded the footage 'vile' as social media users took . to Twitter to vent their outrage after the minute-long clip was posted . But the friend added that while the girl's family have forgiven her, they remain 'heartbroken and devastated' by the incident, which took place during a Carnage Magalluf event last month. The girl's father, who was said to be . 'praying for strength and guidance' at the family home, refused to comment on his . daughter's actions yesterday. It comes as the organiser of the event has claimed that he 'doesn't know what all the fuss is about' as it was just 'an average night' in Magaluf. Alex Collinson, 28, whose Carnage bar crawls help fund his luxury Spanish villa and swimming pool, took to Facebook to defend the video, even describing those taking part as 'stubs'. Luxurious: Mr Collinson's Carnage bar crawls help fund his luxury Spanish villa and swimming pool (above) 'Don't no what all the fuss is about, it's an average night on Carnage bar crawl... turning inbetweeners into studs in six hours (sic),' he wrote on the social-networking site. Mr Collinson, a fan of kickboxing, was investigated by police in May after allegedly attacking four members of a stag do, according to The Sun. Two of the men reportedly had their jaws broken, while the other two suffered facial and head injuries. On Thursday night, . police launched an inquiry into the girl's actions, which were said to be the result of an 'out-of-control' party atmosphere in which everyone was 'wasted'. Backlash: The images have provoked a debate on Twitter, with some coming to the defence of the girl . A . man called Kieran, 26, who said he was at the club at the time, said . the girl had agreed to perform the sex act after being told by party . organisers she would win a 'holiday'. But her prize, in fact, reportedly turned . out to be a cocktail named 'Holiday', made from gin, vodka, peach . schnapps, blackcurrant liqueur and fruit juice. Geordie . Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video but did not take . part in the game, claimed the girl had been swept up in . Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture. TV star: Geordie Shore's Jay Gardner, who also featured in the video, said the girl had been swept up in Magaluf's 'wild, everything-goes' culture . 'This girl's gone on holiday, got . fuelled with alcohol, someone's suggested it, she's smashed and thought . it's a good idea,' he told The Sun yesterday. The . shocking video, posted on local newspaper sites, shows the DJ . apparently counting the number of men the girl notched up on the . dancefloor, while playing the song Sexy and I Know It. The . men can be seen sporting T-shirts from Carnage Magalluf, which is not linked to Carnage UK, a . separate party organiser. Meanwhile, several holidaymakers are captured taking photos of the 'game' on their mobile phones. The . girl, who is reportedly still in her job as a mobile phone sales rep, is believed to . have flown to Spain for seven-night holiday with a friend last month. Locals immediately suggested she was British, as are the vast majority of tourists in a resort which has a reputation for excess. Dozens . of posts about the incident appeared on Carnage Magaluf's Twitter feed, . with some claiming it happens ‘everywhere every day’. Reports said other tourists were being offered free drinks in similar sex competitions. But the footage has been described by many as a new low in Magaluf, where pub crawls were . regulated for the first time this year following complaints. On Thursday, Spanish mayor . Manu Onieva voiced his ‘absolute indignation’ and said police were . investigating the practice that local press have dubbed ‘mamading’ – a . play on the crude Spanish word for a sex act, ‘mamada’.

Benefits Street star White Dee was a . guest of Carnage Magalluf in May and was photographed at a party wearing . the company’s T-shirt. The . 42-year-old mother of two, real name Deirdre Kelly, claims £10,000 a . year in benefits but flew to the resort despite being ‘too depressed’ to . work. She . returned to the resort last month and had been due to go on another pub . crawl organised by the firm. Earlier this week, Spain’s Women’s Institute called the video ‘degenerate, discriminatory and unfair’ towards women. Meanwhile, the . More for Majorca opposition party demanded that the activity be . penalised, saying it was ‘an absolutely irresponsible and unhealthy way . of enjoying leisure time’. Politician David Abril asked: ‘Where is the responsible tourism we all want?’ Residents . of Magaluf have long complained about drunken Britons wreaking havoc on . the island, injuring themselves during all night drinking sessions and . blocking off roads through towns. The destination, popular for its cheap clubs and bars, has earned its reputation as one of the top places for drinking and clubbing holidays in Europe. It is especially popular with British tourists, who will fill the hundreds of bars on a 24-hour basis until September.

"Spain plans to offer foreigners residency permits if they buy houses worth more than 160,000 euros - approximately £128,500 - to try and reduce the country's bloated stock of unsold homes. Spain currently has more than 700,000 unsold houses following the collapse of its real estate market in 2008. Trade Ministry secretary Jaime Garcia-Legaz said the plan, expected to be approved in the coming weeks, would be aimed principally at the Chinese and Russian markets as the domestic demand was stagnant and showed no sign of improving. Badly hit: Spain has more than 700,000 unsold homes sitting vacant after its property boom collapsed in 2008 . New measures: Foreigners who buy property worth more than 160,000 euros - approximately £128,500 - would be given residency permits under new proposals . The country's economy is still struggling and is currently in recession with 25 per cent unemployment. Thousands of houses have been repossessed by banks and their owners evicted because they cannot pay their mortgages. The government last week approved a decree under which evictions would be suspended for two years in specific cases of extreme need. The country's offer beats others in bailed-out countries such as Ireland and Portugal, where residency papers are offered to foreigners buying houses worth more than 400,000 euros - around £322,000) and 500,000 euros - approximately £402,000 respectively. It was not immediately clear if the residency would only refer to Spain, and not the European Union. The stricken state of the country's real estate market was highlighted Monday by figures from the Bank of Spain which showed that the level of bad debt in the country's banks had risen to a record 10.7 per cent of their loan total in September. Struggling: Many home owners in Spain have been struggling to pay their mortgages . Unhappy: Residents in Madrid pictured protesting against evictions at the beginning of November after an estimated 350,000 were evicted from their homes in the wake of the recession . The bank said the amount totaled 182 billion euros, up from 179 billion euros in August - the 15th monthly increase in a row. The 16 other countries that use the euro have agreed to lend Spain up to 100 billion to help support the country's banks weighed down by these bad loans and investments. On top of the bank loan, Spain has been under pressure to apply for more outside financial aid to help it manage its debt and deficit. The European Central Bank has insisted on the move before it will make good on its pledge to buy the bonds of certain troubled countries to help lower their borrowing costs. Spain says it is waiting to know all the conditions that might come attached to the rescue package before making a decision. New rules: A new decree means housing evictions for failing to pay mortgages can be suspended for two years in extreme cases .

"Rochdale is home to the most deprived estate in the country, with four out of five children growing up in poverty. But such hardship did not stop residents of the Lancashire former mill town from gambling £72million on high stakes betting machines last year, chasing jackpots of up to £500. The total, the equivalent of £340 for every man, woman and child in the town, will fuel the claim that casino-style fixed odd betting terminals (FOBTs), described as the ‘crack cocaine’ of gambling, risk causing serious addiction among the poor. Frightening: The people of Rochdale, one of Britain's most deprived areas, gambled £72million on fixed odds betting terminals in the last year, which are as addictive as crack cocaine . A bookmaker became hooked on slot machines after playing them 'for fun' at work – and ended up stealing £20,000 from her bosses. Lorraine Bennett  began playing the machines at the Glasgow shop where she worked using her staff card, before progressing to using her own money. Soon she was embezzling from the shop by cashing in fake winning slips. At trial, Bennett, 27, received three years’ probation and was ordered to get counselling and do 225 hours of community service. Another case of someone who has become hooked on the machines is a father who wishes to remain anonymous to protect his family. Neil, a married father of three, aged 51 and hooked on playing electronic roulette in high street betting shops. He bet £1,000 some weeks and has gambled £90,000 to £100,000 away. He lost his own business, almost lost his wife, and although he has found a job in advertising he is struggling to keep his £400,000 house in Enfield, North London. ‘I have always enjoyed a gamble on the horses, but my problems started when those machines came into the high street. Once you get started, you can’t imagine the buzz and adrenaline. Neil joined Gamblers Anonymous 18 months ago and says he has now controlled his gambling. In Rochdale the economy has been hit . so hard by the recession that even McDonald’s has left the centre. The . town’s Falinge estate has 72 per cent unemployed and 59 per cent with no . employable skills. The housing estate was named the most deprived area in England for a fifth consecutive year this month. More than 200 children on the estate are growing up in poverty, with around 800 people claiming council tax or housing benefits. People living in Falinge are not expected to live beyond the age of 69 - while those living just two miles away in Norden and Banford can expected to live for 10 years longer. The council's own statistics show Falinge also has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the country, with one in 10 girls giving birth under the age of 18. Yet there are 69 of the machines . spread across 19 betting shops in the town. They allow players to gamble . as much as £100 a time in games such as virtual roulette. Coun Linda Robinson, chairman of the council's health and overview . committee, said: 'I have said for a long time that we have become a . nation of gamblers. 'You find that every programme on TV is asking you to ring this number for a chance to win something. 'That is where it starts and people get hooked on gambling. I am against . there being too many of these machines in one area but you have to be . able to give people the choice. 'But some of these people who are making the choice to gamble on these machines cannot afford it.' Bookmakers deny targeting vulnerable communities, saying the claim is ‘false and offensive’. But in the poorest areas of the UK more than £5.6billion was staked on 4,454 fixed odds betting machines last year. Unacceptable: Three quarters of the Rochdale Falinge estate are on benefits in a town that councillors fear is addicted to gambling . Decline: Four out of five children on the estate are growing up in poverty, according to Government data . In Liverpool Riverside, which has the . fourth highest rate of child poverty in the country, more than . £197million was staked on 189 machines in 52 betting shops. Last night . the constituency’s Labour MP, Louise Ellman, urged the Government to . review the laws surrounding the machines. She said: ‘It’s a sad fact that poorer people use these machines more than others. It’s a very disturbing and worrying trend.’ Adrian Parkinson of the Campaign for . Fairer Gambling, which collated the figures, said: ‘The high stakes and . speed of play have led to the machines being called “the crack cocaine . of gambling”.' ‘You see people on the machines for . hours on end. No matter how big the win or the loss they keep coming . back for more.’ Last year Channel 4’s Dispatches found William Hill . netted an estimated £416million a year from FOBTs, while Ladbrokes made . around £359million, Coral £290million and Paddy Power £41million. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling is urging the industry to make FOBTs less profitable by reducing the maximum stake to £2. Liberal Democrat MP Tessa  Munt wants a . change in planning laws to stop the proliferation of betting shops. She . said: ‘I would go further and suggest that all betting shops should be . on the first floor and not on ground level.’ Earlier this month Sports . Minister Hugh Robertson ruled out taking immediate action against the . fixed odds machines. Mr Robertson insisted the Government . was ‘seriously concerned about problem gambling’, but told the Commons . there was a lack of evidence that the terminals were a major problem. Almost £195million was staked on 131 machines in deprived Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency in North-East London. In another deprived constituency, Bethnal Green, East London, £243million of bets were placed on 164 high-stakes machines. 1. Bethnal Green and Bow £243,270,300* . 2. West Ham £227,052,280 . 3. Bermondsey and Old Southwark £227,000,000 . 4. Brent Central  £216,240,267 . 5. Liverpool Riverside £197,198,213 . 6. Hackney North and Stoke Newington £194,616,240 . 7. Manchester Central £189,613,667 . 8. Camberwell and Peckham £189,210,233 . 9. East Ham £183,804,227 . 10. Vauxhall £178,398,220 . *By parliamentary constituency (in millions) FOBTs were introduced in British . betting shops in 2001 under the previous Labour Government, after the . then Chancellor, Gordon Brown, abolished duty on individual bets in . favour of a tax on bookmakers’ gross profits. Ever since many Labour MPs have campaigned for it to be reversed. Had . there not been a change in law, bookmakers would not have installed . FOBTs as the tiny profit margin they make per stake would have been . wiped out by the duty. Experts say FOBTs have stopped thousands of . bookmakers from going out of business. Gambling industry figures show that each FOBT machine earns a betting shop just under £1,000 per week. As . bookies across the country have on average four machines – the maximum . allowed – FOBTs are earning a bookmaker about £4,000 per week before tax . and deductions. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling is calling for the industry to make the machines less profitable by reducing the maximum stake to £2. Betting shops are classified as financial services, meaning that if a bank or similar business closes, a betting shop can open in the property unchallenged. Adrian Parkinson, Campaign for Fairer Gambling consultant said: 'The high stakes and speed of play have led to the machines being called ""the crack cocaine of gambling"", and the Gambling Act 2005 limits each betting shop to four FOBTs - so bookies leapfrog regulations by opening up as many shops as possible, which is why we get clustering, especially in poorer areas as our research has shown.' Critics: Campaigners say that high streets in more deprived areas, like this one in Deptford, south east  London, are being filled with betting shops to target the poor . A spokesman for the Association of British Bookmakers said betting shops are heavily regulated and socially responsible businesses. They added: 'According to independent planning reports they add to the vibrancy and vitality of the UK's high streets. 'The industry employs 45,000 people and supports a further 60,000 jobs in the economy. 'Our members pay £1 billion in taxes, far more than any other comparable retail businesses.' Gamblers Anonymous can give help and support to people with gambling problems, for more information visit www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk . Following the publication of this article, The Association Of British Bookmakers Limited has asked us to point out that Fixed Odd Betting Terminals are not addictive, according to their own research. They say only 3.5 per cent of gambling adults play on FOBTs; the number of problem gamblers playing on them is 8% and this figure is declining and that 70% of machine players play only about once a month.","Town has estate where 3 out of 4 are unemployed and 4 out of 5 children live in poverty .

"A plan to ban a new drug that would help thousands of women with an incurable immune system disease has been put on hold. The NHS rationing body said Benlysta was too expensive at £9,000 a year despite there being no alternative treatments for lupus. But patient groups, doctors and drug makers GlaxoSmithKline won an appeal against the decision not to fund the drug on the NHS. Cure: Benlysta can help treat the symptoms of lupus . The National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) will now reconsider banning the drug, which is available in the US, Germany and Spain. Around 25,000 Britons, mostly women, suffer from lupus, in which the body turns on itself by producing antibodies that attack tissue and organs, causing pain, fatigue and potentially life-threatening damage. Benlysta is the first treatment specifically developed to treat the disease for half a century and trials show it improves patients’ health and wellbeing. At present patients are given cheap, off-patent steroids to reduce inflammation and occasionally an anti-cancer drug that has no proven efficacy. An estimated 5,000 patients a year whose disease cannot be controlled would be eligible to receive the new drug, given monthly by infusion. But in April NICE, which covers England and Wales, and its Scottish equivalent the SMC said Benlysta, also known as belimumab, was not cost-effective. However, GSK claims it has priced the drug ‘responsibly’ through a discount scheme that will cut the amount actually paid by the NHS. The appeal to NICE was made by GSK and the charity Lupus UK and the Primary Care Rheumatology Society, representing GPs. The Worldwide Lupus Patient Organisations also called for a re-think, saying a ban could have a ‘devastating international impact on the survival of this important new treatment. ‘It may have a chilling effect on the future development of new lupus drugs thereby denying physicians and patients appropriate treatment options’ it said in a 5,000-strong petition. Erik van Snippenberg, General Manager, GlaxoSmithKline UK said the drug was the first specifically developed for lupus in 50 years. He said ‘The outcome of the appeal is a positive step towards potentially gaining NHS access to Benlysta. Support: GSK brought the appeal against plans to ban the drug . ‘However, the restrictive nature of the NICE appraisal and appeal process remains a challenge and we continue to be concerned about our probability of achieving a successful outcome and reversing the negative determination. ‘Ultimately, gaining access to Benlysta for UK patients remains our primary objective and we are committed to making this happen, as we believe that this is a really important treatment innovation for certain types of adult patients living with lupus.’ The ban heightened criticism of NICE by drug companies and campaigners who say NHS patients are failing to benefit from drugs – some of which have been developed here – because they are judged too expensive. A NICE spokeswoman said ‘The appeal panel has upheld two points and has directed that the final appraisal determination be returned to the independent appraisal committee. ‘Once this has been added to the committee’s work schedule the website will be updated accordingly. ‘The Institute is not in a position to make any further comments on the appraisal until after the committee has had the opportunity to consider and address the points which have been upheld by the appeal panel.’","The NHS rationing body said Benlysta was too expensive at £9,000 a year despite there being no alternative treatments for lupus.

"A new pill is promising to make the wrinkle-smoothing effects of Botox injections last for 30 per cent longer. The Zytaze tablets are also said to help the cosmetic injections – which cost up to £400 – take effect faster. More than one million people in the UK use the cosmetic jabs to combat wrinkles, but the downside is that the benefits last for just three months. Botox has become big business since its launch but one problem is the effects only last around three months, meaning regular trips to the clinic to maintain the wrinkle-free look . The new pill appears to be little more than a vitamin supplement which contains a high dose of zinc combined with an enzyme called phytase which helps the body  absorb zinc. It is being marketed to Botox fans at £45 for a pack of ten – significantly more than the price of  a standard zinc supplement from high street stores, which costs about £8 for a pack of 100 tablets. However, British distributor Eden Aesthetics say the pill is unique and can reduce the price of Botox for regular users. Eden also claims just taking a cheaper zinc supplement bought from the high street will not have the same effect. A clinical trial of the pill, published in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, found that 92 per cent of patients taking Zytaze reported Botox treatments lasted for several weeks longer than normal, and also helped the jab to take effect more quickly. Cosmetic surgery experts in the UK said the results were interesting but further research should be done. Botox, a tiny quantity of the toxin botulinum, is injected into human tissue – mainly in the face – and works by blocking nerve endings, which prevents electrical signals from moving through muscles. Zytaze capsules will be launched in UK to help extend the effects of Botox by up to 30 per cent . This has a ‘freezing’ effect that smooths out wrinkles and fine lines. Zytaze patients are told to take two 25mg pills a day for four days prior to having Botox and on the day they receive the jab. Consultant plastic surgeon Kevin Hancock, a member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Council, said: ‘We do know that zinc is crucial in helping injured patients to recover, for example burns victims, so it’s fundamental in repairing tissue. 'That may well be influencing the action of the Botox. But the pill is just a vitamin supplement and it may be that lots of people are just slightly zinc-deficient anyway.’ Zytaze does not have to be approved by the drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, because it is classed as a dietary supplement. Patients do not need a prescription. There are warnings about taking too much zinc and more than 50mg a day can affect how well your immune system works. Zytaze involves taking 50mg a day for four days, but this is not thought to be prolonged enough to have a detrimental effect.","Pills contain zinc and an enzyme called phytase which helps the vitamin to be absorbed .

"Humans have used up the natural resources the Earth can provide for the year and are now in 'overdraft', campaigners have warned. The world has reached 'earth overshoot day', the point in the year that humans have exhausted supplies such land, trees and fish and outstripped the planet's annual capacity to absorb waste products including carbon dioxide. For the rest of the year, the world is in ecological debt, with fish stocks and forests being depleted, land degraded and carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere, the Global Footprint Network said. The world has reached 'earth overshoot day', the point in the year that humans have exhausted supplies such land, trees and fish and outstripped the planet's annual capacity to absorb waste products including carbon dioxide. Pictured is the remnants of a forest that has been logged and deforested in Washington State . Earth overshoot day is calculated by . comparing the demands made by humans on global resources - our . 'ecological footprint' - with the planet's ability to replenish . resources and absorb waste. This year, in less than nine months we have used as much of nature as the Earth can regenerate in a year. Earth overshoot day has fallen a couple of days earlier than it did last year. The Global Footprint Network said that in 1961, humanity only used around two-thirds of the available natural resources on Earth, but by the 1970s increased carbon emissions and consumption began to outstrip what the planet could provide. Humans now need the equivalent of 1.5 planets to sustain us, and by mid century it will have risen to two planets, the campaigners said. China has the biggest total ecological footprint, because of its large population, but other countries have much higher demands on resources per person. If everyone were to live like U.S. residents we would need four planets to supply demand, the report said. Earth overshoot day is calculated by comparing the demands made by humans on global resources - our 'ecological footprint' - with the planet's ability to replenish resources and absorb waste . Four-fifths of the world's population live in countries that use more than their own natural systems can provide. In this country, we would need the equivalent of three and a half UKs to sustain current consumption levels. Not all countries use more than the . resources within their own borders can provide but even their 'credit' or reserves is shrinking, the campaigners warned. The . world can no longer sustain the widening budget gap between what nature . is able to provide and how much our infrastructure, economies and . lifestyles require, they said. Alessandro Galli, Global Footprint . Network regional director, said: 'Everyday life in many Mediterranean . countries is showing us what it means to live beyond financial limits. 'Ecological . and financial deficits are two sides of the same coin. Over the long . run, nations cannot deal with one deficit without addressing the other.' The world can no longer sustain the widening budget gap between what nature is able to provide - such as with commercial fishing (pictured) - and how much our infrastructure, economies and lifestyles require, campaigners have warned . Andrew Simms, climate economist at Global Witness, who came up with the concept of earth overshoot day at UK think tank the New Economics Foundation, said: 'The Government consistently tells us that we must buckle down and live within our financial means, but seems intent on pushing us to break our environmental budget. 'The maths is simple - the UK consumes and produces waste at a rate three and a half times greater than we can sustain, and today humanity has already exhausted what the planet's ecosystems can provide in a year. 'We're in the red and gambling with ecological bankruptcy, as the fracking debate shows. If it chose to, the Government can always print more money, but it can't print more planet. Ecological overshoot should lead the political agenda.'","The world has now reached 'earth overshoot day', the .

"Very few people have lived to tell the tale of what it is like to be inside a tornado – and you can’t rely on Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz. But now a video has emerged taken from inside a car, which survived a tornado passing over it. The dashboard-mounted device recorded the incredible transformation of the weather from persistent rain to a terrifying cyclone of wind uprooting trees and whipping debris through the air. Scroll down for video . A dashboard-mounted device recorded the incredible transformation of the weather from persistent rain to a terrifying wall of wind uprooting trees and whipping debris through the air (pictured). The footage is thought to be coming from the eye of the storm . It was left switched on by its owner who was not in the car. The footage was filmed in Bashkiria, Russia last year, but was released this week on Reddit. The video shows the weather changing from calm to chaos in under a minute, starting with raindrops rolling down the car’s windscreen, with the sky a foreboding grey and descending into large pieces of wood being flung through the air and the car’s previously clean glass covered in pieces of debris. The video shows the weather changing from calm to chaos in under a minute, starting with raindrops rolling down the car’s windscreen, with the sky a foreboding grey (pictured) The end of the video (pictured) shows large pieces of wood being flung through the air and the car’s previously clean glass covered in pieces of debris . A tornado is a narrow, rapidly spinning column of air around an intense low pressure centre that reaches the ground from cumulonimbus clouds, also known as thunderstorm clouds, according to the MET Office. Tornadoes have a narrow width, usually up to 100m but the damage can be concentrated and severe. As they develop, funnel shaped clouds extend from the base of the cloud and when these reach the ground, a tornado is formed. Tornadoes can have wind speeds up to 300mph, and when they touch the ground can destroy trees and buildings in their path, throwing heavy objects like cars though the air like a Frisbee. Tornadoes which occur over water are referred to as a waterspout and those which do not touch ground are referred to as a funnel cloud. The highest surface wind speed ever recorded of 302mph is a result of the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak. The greatest distance travelled by a single tornado was 219 miles (352km) from Ellington, Missouri to Princeton, Indiana, on 18 March 1925. The most tornadoes in a single year were recorded in 2004. There were 1,820. Incredibly, despite trailers and trees nearby being thrown around and uprooted, the car remains intact and on the ground, indicating perhaps it was in the eye of the storm, which if so, was not as calm as many might imagine. It has not yet been confirmed by Russia's meteorological services whether the footage really does capture a video from the centre of a tornado. Dr Catherine Muller told MailOnline that it is very hard to tell and that there are few specifics available. 'We can’t be sure of the exposure of the car – it appears to be surrounded by buildings which will give it some protection,' she said. 'The type of car will also have had an impact – a solid 4x4 is less likely to be lifted compared to a small car.' A spokesman for the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that the car could actually be places on the near edge of the tornado. This is because, 'early on, everything is moving away from the camera and there's very little that comes towards the camera at the end.' 'Even if it had had a direct passage by the middle of the tornado where, in some cases, the winds might be weaker, you've have had all the strong winds on either side of the tornado go by.' Based on how the wood flies through the air, he thinks that the tornado may have reached speeds of up to 113mph (217kph). Eyewitness accounts from people who claim to have been inside a tornado are rare, but seem to support the theory that the eye of the storm is eerily calm. Will Keller, a farmer from Kansas claims to have been in the eye of a storm in 1928 and said that once he was inside a tornado, everything was ‘as still as death,’ How Stuff Works reported. He said there was a strong gassy smell, which made it hard to breathe and looked up to see the circular shape of the tornado around him. Another farmer called Roy Hall found himself inside a tornado in Texas in 1951. He ran inside his house when hail stones that size of tennis balls began raining down. He then reportedly heard a low rumbling and then silence. The roof of his house was ripped off and he was surrounded by a wall of clouds illumined blue from lightning, he said. The footage was filmed in Bashkiria, Russia (marked on the map) last year, but was released this week . The American Meteorological Society defines a tornado, known as a twister, ‘a violent rotating column of air, in contact with the ground, either pendant from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud.

"A woman has claimed that she was forced to strip naked at gunpoint when Department of Homeland Security officials inexplicably raided her Florida home at dawn - and left with nothing. Kari Edwards posted surveillance footage on YouTube that she claims shows the 6am raid on her house in Homestead on June 10, as well as images showing the officers inflicted on her property. She says the footage shows a SWAT team swooping in as a helicopter hovered overhead, before they smashed in her front door and deafened her cat with smoke grenades. The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to MailOnline's requests for comment. Scroll down for video . Raid: Officers and an armored vehicle can be seen outside Kari Edwards' home in Homestead, Florida earlier this month. She claims that agents burst in and made her sit in handcuffs naked . Swoop: Agents, seen in light after dawn, did not seize anything from the property, Edwards said . On the video she posted to her YouTube page, Edwards said she and her boyfriend were inside the home when the SWAT team burst in at 6.16am. 'Armed men... demanded that I drop the towel I was covering my naked body with before snatching it off of me physically and throwing me to the ground,' she wrote. 'According to my boyfriend, the agent with his assault rifle to my back kept eying me up and down like I was eye candy.' Edwards, who said she had previously worked for the DHS but has been disabled since 2006, recognized some of the agents as working for the federal agency and asked them for ID. 'The agent pointed at his uniform that read POLICE and said ""Isn't this ID enough for you?"",' she wrote. 'When I told him I could buy that up in Miami he called me retarded and said I was f***ing stupid.' Damage: She shared a photo showing burn marks from a flash bang grenade on tiles that need replacing . Destruction: She also shared an image of belongings that had been thrown about in the bedrooms . Broken: She claimed that the agents also smashed her shower door and said she had no idea why . Smashed: She said that they also broke a sculpture outside, left, and the lock to their front door, right . She added to PoliceStateUSA.com that she saw 'ICE', 'Gang Task Force' and 'Special Agent' on the men's shirts. She said that she was put in handcuffs that were so tight 'I could not feel my hands' and said that agents refused to cover her body, even though she repeatedly asked. The video is about 20 minutes long, but she claimed that the raid went on for two hours. 'My boyfriend, who is asthmatic, started having trouble breathing due to the lingering smoke created by the flash bang grenade,' she said, and agents helped him find his inhaler. The team eventually handed her a warrant signed by Jonathan Goodman, a federal magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, she said. Claims: Kari Edwards said she still has not had answers from authorities about why they were raided . The warrant authorized the agents to search for computers and electronics - with the agents suggesting it was for child pornography - but Edwards said they did not seize any items. Images . shared on Facebook shows burn marks on the ground of her home from the grenade, as well as . damaged door frames, smashed shower doors and even a smashed sculpture. Edwards said the incident was 'two hours of pure hell' and she has filed complaints with authorities. 'After filing complaints with the FBI, DHS-OIG, ACLU and the White House as well as calling the chambers of Judge Jonathan Goodman, I still have no answers as of yet,' she wrote on Facebook.

"With nearly half of all suicides in the U.S. military committed with a privately owned firearm, Congress and the Pentagon are moving to implement policies that will discourage at-risk members of the armed forces from retaining their personal weapons. As suicides continue to rise in 2012, the Defence Department officials are developing a suicide prevention campaign, part of which will encourage friends and family of the potentially suicidal to convince the soldiers to give up their weapons. The Pentagon’s move would be hugely controversial as some lobbyists may construe it as gun control. Concern: Almost half of all suicides in the U.S military are committed with a private firearm, not service weapons . Gun rights groups – along with many service members themselves - are likely to oppose any policy which could seem to limit a citizen’s private ownership of a firearm. ‘This is not about authoritarian regulation,’ said Dr Jonathan Woodson, the assistant secretary of defence for health affairs. ‘It is about the spouse understanding warning signs and, if there are firearms in the home, responsibly separating the individual at risk from the firearm.’ Dr Woodson said the campaign would also include measures to encourage friends and family of at-risk soldiers to remove possibly dangerous prescription drugs from their homes, but declined to provide any further details. Another significant step is the fact that Congress appear willing to implement legislation which would allow mental health counsellors and commanders to discuss the issues of privately owned weapons with the troops. The measure would amend last year’s legislation, that prohibited the Defence Department from collecting information from members of the armed forces about lawfully owned, personal firearms. The measure was part of the Defence Authorisation Act and was backed by the National Rifle Association. The NRA claimed the provision was in response to efforts by defence officials to maintain records of all firearms owned by their personnel. The new amendment, which is part of the defence authorisation bill for 2013, has been passed by the House of Representatives but not the Senate. It would allow mental health experts and commanders to ask service members about their private firearms if they have ‘reasonable grounds’ to believe the soldier is at ‘high risk’ of harming himself or others. Trauma: Congress are taking steps to prevent at-risk soldiers from retaining their private weapons . The NRA are wary over the moves, and have said that, although they are happy for the commanders to ask questions of those they are concerned about, the commanders should not be confiscating firearms. ‘We’re OK with the commanding officer being able to inquire,’ said Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the NRA., ‘but they can’t confiscate.’ Senator James M Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who sponsored the 2011 restrictions, said he would support the new amendment ‘if it clears up any confusion.’ ‘This is a national tragedy that Congress, all branches of D.O.D. and numerous outside organizations have been working together to solve,’ Mr Inhofe said. The Senate is not expected to take the bill until after the general election. Suicides in the US military rose rapidly between 2005 and 2009, and reached 285 active service members, along with 24 reservists in 2009. Opposition: Gun rights lobbyists are likely to oppose any policy that would result in the confiscation of weapons . The numbers plateaued in 2010 and 2011, but the 2012 figures look set to exceed those of 2009, according to the New York Times. As of last month, 270 active-duty service members killed themselves this year alone, and half were from the Army. More than six out of 10 military suicides are by use of firearms, and nearly half of those involve privately owned guns. Guns are also the most common method of suicide among young males across the country. When troops are identified as high risk, commanders have the authority to confiscate their service weapons, but under current legislation they can not ask them to hand over their personal firearms. The rising figures are of greater concern to the military staff considering the efforts from the suicide prevention campaign. John Ruocco, a helicopter pilot, killed himself in 2005 between deployments in Iraq. His wife, Kim, said he felt unable to seek help. She said: 'He was so afraid of how people would view him once he went for help.' 'He thought that people would think he was weak, that people would think he was just trying to get out of redeploying or trying to get out of service, or that he just couldn't hack it. In reality, he was sick. 'He had suffered injury in combat and he had also suffered from depression and let it go untreated for years.'","Pentagon and Congress to back policies encouraging the separation of at-risk soldiers from their private weapons .

"A blog post titled '5 Reason To Date A Girl With An Eating Disorder' has drawn thousands of angry tweets and offended comments from both men and women, as well as medical experts. Posted by Return of Kings, a website for heterosexual and 'masculine' men, the blog post outlines five reasons why dating a woman with an eating disorder is beneficial to men: 'Her obsession over her body will improve her overall looks' and 'She costs less money,' it states. Since it went live on November 13, the writer has been accused of 'dangerously and absurdly' trivializing the disease, which affects 20 million women and 10 million men in the U.S., according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Author Tuthmosis says people offended by his blog advising men to date women with eating disorders need to get 'perspective' 'It trivializes the illness -- and it is . an illness, it’s a disorder,' Dr Robyn Silverman, body-image expert and . author of Good Girls Don’t Get Fat: How Weight Obsession Is Messing Up . Our Girls and How We Can Help Them Thrive Despite It, told Yahoo! Shine. 'People make jokes about a lot of things, though. And bottom line . is, it’s not funny.' The Return of Kings blog post states that eating disorders are a 'luxury reserved for only the most privileged . members of the female race'. 'In . other words, the presence of one of the classic eating disorders is a . reliable predictor of various socio-economic, cultural, and personality . traits in a young woman -- features that, in the end, are desirable to . today’s American man,' the writer, who says he has dated 'several' girls with an eating disorder, explains in his post. He states that 'Her obsession over her body will improve her overall looks.' His reasoning? 'A . girl who spends inordinate mental and physical energy on her looks is . rarely fat,' and: 'While . they may have a ""distorted body image"" on the inside, that usually means . staying trim and fit on the outside'. The writer also believes that a women with an eating disorder 'costs less money,' because: 'In most cases, she’ll get a . small dish–like a side salad'. Also: 'She’s fragile and vulnerable,' he writes, adding that 'an . inflated ego and an unearned high self-esteem are among the most . unattractive traits in a girl'. 'You’ll be dealing with a . tastefully insecure girl, who’s eager to please, and wants nothing more . than your approval. She’s quick to apologize for transgressions, and . will make the extra effort to see you -- instead of flaking on you . constantly,' he insists, adding: 'A girl with a . mild-to-moderate eating disorder -- that hasn’t excessively marred her . appearance -- is today’s best-buy in the West’s rapidly plummeting dating . market.' 'This piece mocks not only . those who suffer, but their loved ones who know firsthand how dating a . girl with an eating disorder really looks' Temimah Zucker, a graduate student at . the Wurzweiler School of Social Work who has battled anorexia, said . promoting the idea that an eating disorder is a luxury is 'not only . infuriating, but dangerous'. 'An eating . disorder is a mental illness and one that destroys the lives and . functioning of those who suffer,' she writes in an opinion piece for the Times of Israel. 'Not only [is it] insulting countless people who are suffering, but [it] is . stereotyping an illness which brings death to too many people. 'I wish . that I could take this man to a treatment center and have him hear the . pain and stories of those who are fighting for recovery. . . I wish I . could sit this man down and explain why what he’s doing can cause harm . to countless people who truly desire help,' she writes. 'This piece mocks not only . those who suffer, but their loved ones who know firsthand how dating a . girl with an eating disorder really looks.' Christina Grasso, an activist for Project HEAL, which promotes awareness of . eating disorders and raises funds to provide treatment for those who suffer, agrees, telling MailOnline: 'I've become incredibly thick-skinned and especially tolerant of ignorance toward eating disorders. But this degree of mockery is unprecedented in my experience, and is reprehensible.' Actress Chloe Grace Moretz also weighed in on the blog post; the writer has been accused of 'dangerously and absurdly' trivializing the disease, which affects 20 million women and 10 million men in the U.S. Return of Kings, which 'aims to usher the return of the masculine man in a world. . . that allows women to assert superiority and control over men,' has also been accused of trolling in an attempt to attract more readers. Common headlines on the site include: '20 Things Women Do That Should Be Shamed, Not Celebrated,' and '10 Tell-Tale Signs She’s A Secret Internet Fatty'. Activist and lawyer . Brian Cuban, brother of business magnate Mark Cuban, wrote in the . comments section of the site: 'The post went viral so they got what they . wanted and made whatever revenue they did off it,' adding that it was 'one of the most . appalling pieces of crap' he has ever read. The publisher of Return of Kings, who goes by the name of Roosh and also runs a blog called RooshV which publishes articles titled 'It’s Time To Start Delivering Death Blows To Feminists,' has defended the post. On Wednesday he wrote that the original article 'contains value for men who want to date . thin women in America, a country that is currently facing a devastating . obesity epidemic,' adding that it 'attempts to reduce stigma by encouraging our male readership to give women with anorexia and bulimia an opportunity for real intimacy.' He added: 'We are educating our masculine readers not to pass on eating disorder victims just because they have an illness, yet instead of receiving thanks, we’re receiving hate instead.' Roosh, who has refused to take the blog post down or offer an apology, said he has 'come to the conclusion that there is nothing in it that endorses eating disorders or slanders those who have them. '[The writer] has simply shared knowledge and insights that can aid single men in their pursuit of sexual happiness without hurting women,' he said. A petition to remove the article has received nearly 11,000 signatures on Change.org at the time of posting.","Return of Kings, a website for 'masculine' men, outlined five reasons why dating a women with an eating disorder is beneficial to men .

"A gossip site has taken the controversial decision to post the name of every licensed gun owner in New York City online as the debate over gun control rages on. Gawker posted the list of names, which is already publicly available, today. It follows the move by the Journal News to publish home addresses of gun permit owners in Westchester and Rockland counties last month. The list was highlighted in the midst of heated debates over gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre in December where 20 schoolchildren and six teachers were shot dead. On the list: As well as Journal News the website Gawker published a 446-page list of licensed gun owners in New York City . The 446-page document is readily available from the NYPD with a Freedom of Information Law request - but contains only the names of gun owners and not addresses. However a secondary list exists online which shows both names and addresses as New York State requires that gun owners register with them and not just a local police department. Some 1.2 million New Yorkers are licensed to own handguns - and the addresses of 300,000 of these individuals have been online since 2010. An hour after the list was published on Gawker, the site reported that it had received death threats. Calling for change: The debate on gun control has been heightened following the Sandy Hook massacre on December 14 in Newtown, Connecticut . One caller said 'You're f****** dead' while another told a female employee that she better have protection when she left her workplace. The site had contacted police about the threats. Hundreds of comments were posted about the article and whether the decision to once again bring attention to gun permit holders was necessary. Referring to the earlier piece in the Journal News, one commenter wrote: 'The journal posted . my address and name for my gun ownership. My past stalker saw this. I . haven't heard from him in two years, because I disappeared. 'Now he is . back and calling me......thanks to people like you bunch of a*******, . looks like I will have to protect myself from becoming a murder victim. Gracias.' The New York Police Department demands that those who wish to obtain a handgun permit appear in person with their application at the license division. You must be 21 to apply for a handgun license or a rifle/shotgun permit. The license may be necessary for work, in which case, the applicant will be screened by an officer. The NYPD recommends that individuals think carefully about whether they wish to own a handgun due to safety concerns. The department also recommends that a potential owner receives safety instruction about handguns. Another post read: 'Don't really . understand the negative replies to this. It's public information that . apparently the majority of New Yorkers didn't know was available that . EVERY person who signed up for the permit knew was public info. 'Unless we're all going on the premise . that if people know you own a gun you are less safe. Which if true . pretty much defeats the entire non-sporting reason for owning one, . doesn't it?' After publishing the names and . addresses of gun permit owners in the upstate counties of Rockland and . Westchester last month, the Journal News  was forced to hire a team of armed guards to patrol its headquarters in West Nyack. The paper caused a stir on December 23 with an interactive map on its website of pistol permit holders. Journal News editor Caryn A. McBride . hired security guards to patrol the paper's offices amid a flurry of . angry emails and phone calls in the following days. Rob Seubert of Silver Spring, Maryland, . posted on the newspaper's web site: 'Do you fools realize that you also . made a map for criminals to use to find homes to rob that have no guns . in them to protect themselves? What a bunch of liberal boobs you . all are.' Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online.

"The mixed martial arts fighter known as 'War Machine' pleaded 'not guilty' today to 32 felony charges including attempted murder during his first appearance in a Las Vegas courtroom. Prosecutors, who originally charged Jonathan Koppenhaven with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013. The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault. Scroll down for video . Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, a mixed martial arts fighter known as War Machine, appeared in court Wednesday in Las Vegas. Koppenhaver was scheduled for arraignment on battery, lewdness, assault and coercion charges in the August 8 attack on adult film actress Christy Mack and her male friend at a Las Vegas home, but prosecutors charged him with additional felonies including kidnapping and assault and accused him of attacking Mack multiple times over 15 months . Ms Mack, 23, says that attack left her with 18 broken bones around her eyes, a nose broken in two places, and hair sawed off by a knife . Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaven held without bail, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she feared for her life. Ms Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping. She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Ms Mack, seen here in a self portrait she posted on Instagram, told police she had no idea how many times she was hit . Ms Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Ms Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Ms Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Ms Mack posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11 . She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts.'Ms Mack also alleged her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her. 'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. Koppenhaver, who pleaded not guilty, was ordered held without bail during his initial appearance in court Wednesday . 'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past. After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007. He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year. He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.","Jonathan Koppenhaven made the plea during his first appearance in a Las Vegas courtoom since his arrest for allegedly assaulting his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, and her friend .

"The little and large combination of Marin Cilic and Kei Nishikori combined on Saturday night to blow the tennis world off its axis by slaying two of the finest players the game has ever known. They set up the most unlikely US Open final by downing Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic with two seismic shocks at Flushing Meadows coming in quick succession. First the 24 year-old Nishikori, just 5’ 10” and eleven stone, braved fierce heat and humidity to beat world number one Novak Djokovic 6-4 1-6 7-6 6-3 in two hours and 52 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down for Marin Cilic quick fire interview . Defeat: Swiss star Roger Federer lost 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to Marin Cilic, who reaches his first Grand Slam final . Impressive: Croatian Marin Cilic was impressive against the 17-time Grand Slam winner . Then Cilic, the 6’ 6” giant from Croatia who served a doping ban last year, overpowered Federer as the weather turned more stormy, ousting him 6-3 6-4 6-4 in just an hour and three quarters. Monday’s totally unforeseen climax will be the first Slam final since 2005 without a member of the so-called Big Four, and the first in twelve years not to have anyone from the top ten in it. Cilic, now coached by former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, put in a performance of huge aggression that ended with three aces in the final game to take out a bewildered Federer, who had looked on for another Major title. Meanwhile Nishikori becomes the first player from his country to make a Slam final. He handled the brutal conditions better than the reigning Wimbledon champion, who for once was outlasted. History maker: Kei Nishikori celebrates beating world No 1 Novak Djokovic in the US Open semi-final . Performance: Federer was uncharacteristically poor when returning Cilic's serves . Power: After dispensing of Thomas Berdych in the quarter-final, Cilic excelled again to defeat Federer . It was a brilliant display from the number ten seed, whose nerve occasionally failed him but eventually held out to pull off a seismic result against the strong favourite for the title, who defeated Andy Murray in the previous round. 'It’s an amazing feeling I’m so happy,' said an ecstatic Nishikori afterwards. 'I hope I can recover for the final. I hope it’s big news in Japan.' Remarkably, world number eleven Nishikori came here having not played in August due to an operation to remove a cyst from his foot:' I just started playing points few days before the tournament,' he said. 'I didn't even know if I should come to New York, you know, so I wasn't expecting anything actually. But after playing first match and second match I get more confidence on my foot and it was no pain in these moments. I was start sliding little more. But my tennis was there already.” Helpless: Djokovic was formidable in the second set but Nishikori was otherwise in control . Quarters: Federer had endured a grueling quarter-final, beating Gael Monfils in five sets . Final: Marin Cilic reaches his first ever final at the US Open in Flushing Meadows . Djokovic was at a loss to explain a surprisingly lacklustre performance and was reluctant to blame the punishing environment: 'It was not easy to play in these conditions, but he had spent more hours on the court before this. So it's no excuse,' said Djokovic. 'I couldn’t control the ball, didn’t have the balance.' Trained at the Nick Bollettieri/IMG academy in Florida from the age of fourteen, Nishikori’s experience of American summers came into its own as he refused to flag against Djokovic. His coach Michael Chang seemed more animated than he ever was as player as he watched from the bench, urging on his young charge, who actually lost in the first round of this event last year to Britain’s Dan Evans. Nishikori, whose previous Grand Slam best was losing to Murray in the 2012 Australian Open quarters final, showed his potential earlier this year when he should have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in the Madrid Open final before seizing up with cramp, but this did not happen when in sight of the biggest win of his career.

"Kite's comments came during the launch of Get Britain Fertile, a campaign encouraging women to have children earlier . Yesterday, journalist Melissa Kite became the latest woman to publicly trash men in a sexist, undeserving rant - this time, by saying those exercising a human right not to become fathers were 'selfish'. Just days after champagne socialist Diane Abbott claimed that modern masculinity is Viagra-chomping, whiskey-swigging homophobia - even for the millions of men who are gay - Kite jumped on the bandwagon with her own sweeping statements. In a finger-pointing, foot-stamping article for MailOnline she said men 'do not always play fair in matters of fertility', adding that they 'increasingly behave with terrible selfishness when it comes to giving up their bachelor lifestyles'. She then added that men who date women without immediately signing up for parenthood are committing some sort of 'fraud'. The outrageous comments follow the launch of the Get Britain Fertile campaign, which actively discourages women from delaying pregnancy for health reasons. But, instead of making a balanced, rational point, Kite's comments simply revealed a sad, out-dated philosophy in contemporary gender relations. Namely, that a woman's desire to have a child is greater than a man's desire not to. She's wrong. In her article, she makes several references to former boyfriends who made the responsible decision not to become fathers half-heartedly - then scolds them for being 'cowardly'.  Here's a woman who assumes that a man's sperm - his lineage, his DNA, his family - is somehow hers for the taking. This couldn't be further from the truth. Yes, I sympathise that her many life choices never produced children, but it's not men who are to blame. For years feminism has declared that women don't need us; that we are redundant. Fine. But guess what - we don't need women either. And it's trending. In Asia there's a new tendency for men to go their own way - with thousands shunning marriage and kids for a life of independence and control, which no family court can destroy. The same thing is happening across America and Canada. In fact, author Helen Smith PHD recently published a book entitled Men on Strike, where she notes that: 'America has become anti-male. Men are sensing the backlash and are consciously and unconsciously going on strike. They are dropping out of college, leaving the workforce and avoiding marriage and fatherhood at alarming rates.' Wonderfully, it's happening here in Britain. 'Guys know that any child they have with a woman would be her baby, not their baby' This isn't because men are 'selfish' or commitment-phobic pigs (as chauvinistic women frequently like to suggest). Rather, it's because they're tired of being ousted from families, of being shafted by sexist divorce rulings and being denied the most basic paternal rights. These guys know that any child they have with a woman would be her baby, not their baby. In 2013, a so-called era of equality, three million UK fathers are still denied access to their children - simply because their bitter ex partners can manipulate the law. So where's the incentive? Quite frankly, men's reticence to enter fatherhood is justified. And long may it continue. Melissa Kite said men who didn't want children were being 'selfish' But Kite, and many women like her, still can't see these broader issues. Hilariously, she says: 'to suggest that somehow the age at which women conceive is within their control is naive and misleading.' Are we living on the same planet? By and large women have complete and utter control in the reproduction process - unlike men, who have none. Women have the full spectrum of contraceptive control, while men only have the condom - which isn't always practical - and a vasectomy. Women have the option to terminate or adopt a pregnancy, relinquishing responsibilities for whatever reason (and so they should), but men can't (yet they should). And if women don't manage to find an ideal 'babydaddy' they can use a sperm donor and go it alone. Anytime. So I find it pretty offensive that she's blaming men for a path she consciously chose. Quite frankly, she's a big girl who made her own decisions. Besides, men are not - and never should be - on stand-by for when a broody woman calls. Becoming a parent is a meeting of minds. It is a mutual, life-changing decision. The maxim 'my body, my choice' applies to both genders, no matter how much it may inconvenience certain women. But that's equality - it cuts right down the middle. It is inflexible. It's also a basic human right to make your own decisions on parenthood. If we switched the genders in Kite's story and had a man saying 'Women are selfish because they won't give me the child I deserve' there'd be uproar. But, once again, we have stiletto sexism telling us that female-on-male chauvinism is acceptable. Yet, while her sense of entitlement astounds me, I do respect Kite for not trapping men - something she comes perilously close to recommending. 'Recently, a girlfriend in her 20s told me she was feeling broody but felt it was too early to ask her new husband to have kids,' she writes. 'I wanted to yell: 'Then don't ask him!'… I felt a shameful urge to tell her to secretly stop taking the Pill.' 'By and large women have complete and utter control in the reproduction process - unlike men, who have none' But this is raping a man's choice and must never be accepted. In fact, it should be enforced by law. Particularly as it happens all the time - which is precisely why the culture of having children needs to be less about women and more about both parents. While Harriet Harman is worrying about old women on TV, families in fathers are the much bigger priority. Fortunately, Kite retains control of her maternal destiny. She could still adopt, foster or conceive and be a wonderful mother. But I'd still worry if she ever had a son. Not because I doubt her potential for raising another human being, but - if she's happy to trash men for making their own decisions - what else would she encourage her son to compromise? As a man, I'm sick and tired of such things. Fortunately, I'm not the only one. Only last week I bumped into actor Jude Law and we chatted about Diane Abbott's recent criticisms of male identity. Right there, being the wonderful father he is, he summed up the reality in an instant by saying: 'Peter, men are no more in crisis than women.' Judging by the opinions of women like Melissa Kite, he's spot-on.","Journalist Melissa Kite said men who don't want children are selfish .

"Officers at an Arkansas police department failed to notice their ex-military Humvee had been stolen from the parking lot for more than a week. Palestine Police Chief Stanley Barnes says 'it never crossed [his] mind' that anyone could take the  5,000lb Humvee - it doesn't even have a set of keys. However, last December a young man climbed into the Humvee, given to the Palestine Police Department as part of a controversial government program, and headed off on a joyride that concluded when he drove it into a tree and completely wrecked the vehicle. Tiny town: The Palestine, Arkansas Police Department failed to notice their 5000lb Humvee was missing from the parking lot for a week after a man stole it and drove it into a tree . War machine: Humvees like this one have been distributed to towns all over the U.S., including Palestine, Arkansas, which has a population of fewer than 700 people . It was such an unlikely event that the department didn't notice the military armored vehicle - which cost up to $350,000 new - was missing from the parking lot for more than a week. Once Barnes noticed it was gone, the department swung into action. 'We just do what police officers do - we find out who done it,' Barnes told Yahoo! News. 'People talk.' Eventually the vehicle in some woods one county over and is now being used for spare parts for the department's other Humvee. That a tiny town such as Palestine (population 700) could possibly need such a vehicle is the basis of criticism of the Department of Defense Excess Property Program (DOD 1033), which gives used military equipment to U.S. police departments to help fight crime. Almost 200 police departments in the United States have already been suspended from the program for losing military-grade equipment, including assault rifles, pistols, shotguns and Humvees. An Associated Press investigation of the Defense Department military surplus program this year found that a disproportionate share of the $4.2 billion worth of property distributed since 1990  has been obtained by police and sheriff's departments in rural areas with few officers and little crime. Militarized response: The White House is reviewing the Department of Defense's 1033 program, which redistributes used military gear to U.S. police departments, following events in Ferguson, Missouri . Exacerbated: The heavily armed police response to protests in Ferguson following the death of Michael Brown caused many to question the wisdom of treating civilian streets like war zones . Think-tank the Cato Institute is running a project on criminal justice. Director of the project Tim Lynch called on Congress to revisit the program 'promptly.' 'We don't know where these weapons are going, whether they are really lost, or whether there is corruption involved,' he told Fusion, adding that the lack of accountability is very 'unsettling.' The militarized response by police in Ferguson, Missouri to protests following the death of teenager Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer drew sharp criticism and prompted President Obama to announce a review of the 1033 program. 'I am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message,' Attorney General Eric Holder said. A report by the American Civil Liberties Union in June said police agencies had become 'excessively militarized,' with officers using training and equipment designed for the battlefield on city streets. Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said police responses like that in Ferguson have 'become the problem instead of the solution.' Representative Hank Johnson, D-Ga., said he will introduce legislation to curb the trend of police militarization.","An ex-military Humvee was stolen from an Arkansas police department .

Santiago, seen breastfeeding with his mother Eunice Fandino, was rescued by the foundation after she was unable to deal with his insatiable appetite which saw him balloon to three stone aged just eight months . Earlier this year, the foundation came to Santiago's rescue after his mother was unable to deal with his insatiable appetite. At eight months old, Santiago reportedly weighed more than three stone - as much as a six-year-old - and his life hung in the balance.

Colombia's most obese baby Santiago Mendoz (pictured with therapist Salvador Palacios) used to weigh the same as a six-year-old child . The 20kg child, pictured at a centre for the obese, has been taken from his mother due to his size . He was flown from his home in the northeastern city of Valledupar to the capital Bogota on Sunday after his mother called the charity asking for help with her child's size .

"Thousands of people have taken to social media sites to declare their support of Christopher Dorner who has become an anti-hero since his death, according to experts. More than 20,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook group called We Stand With Christopher Dorner, while thousands more have taken to Twitter under the banner of 'Teamdorner'. By yesterday afternoon, there were 4,000 original posts using that hashtag. Scroll down for video . Thousands of people have 'lionized' Christopher Dorner since the manhunt was launched last week and his death . Experts say people are attracted to the ex-Los Angeles Police Department because he was an underdog and compared the week-long manhunt as like watching a real-life Django Unchained. Some conspiracy theorists were still speculating today that Dorner, 33, who was accused of killing four people, is still alive and fled to Mexico or faked his own death. Supporters have seized Dormer's 15,000-word manifesto as proof he was a man seeking justice. In it, Dorner describes being a victim of racism and claims he was fired from the LAPD for trying to expose corruption and brutality within the force. Marc Lamont Hill, associate professor of English at Columbia University, said Dorner has become a 'real-life superhero to many people.' He told CNN: 'People aren't rooting for him to kill innocent people, they're rooting for somebody who was wronged to get a kind of revenge against the system. 'It is almost like watching Django Unchained in real life.' Experts say Dorner's antihero status has fuelled support. Supporters such as Chantel Cardiel, pictured, stood with signs pleading with Los Angeles police not to kill Dorner . The story has exposed anger from some people about alleged police corruption and brutality . The biggest US manhunt in recent memory began after Dorner allegedly killed Keith Lawrence, 27, and Monica Quan, 28, the daughter of a police captain who assisted Dorner during his disciplinary hearings in 2007. Four days later he allegedly shot two officers in Riverside, California, killing one and injuring another. He went on the run for five days before the firefight at a cabin in Big Bear where Dorner was hiding. The cabin caught alight and Dorner died. Since his death the internet has been awash with the views of supporters. One supporter wrote on the Facebook pages: 'He killed CORRUPT cops, cops kill INNOCENT people!' On Twitter, @Rep_DanGordon wrote: 'Badges don't give cops special rights. This is what happens when a corrupt system pushes an honest man too far.' Another, going by the name gR1zZ_LBC wrote: 'I don't agree with what he did but I hope they never find him lol.' Some supporters claim Dorner was an honest man who was fighting corruption and racism . One man, called @becomeyoung wrote on the social networking site: 'Apparently burning people alive is now considered appropriate behavior for the police. Judge, jury and executioner.' Dorner died after the cabin caught fire during a shootout with police. One Facebook user wrote: 'Imagine burning someone alive and not even knowing for sure who it is.' BuzzFeed Radio host Jack Moore said the way the story unfolded made it even more attractive to supporters. He told CNN that the Dorner story 'resembles a Denzel Washington movie where someone is wronged, and he stands up for himself and goes down in a blaze of glory.' The drama has also exposed high levels of anger at police forces across the country. Dorner died during a police shootout and fire at the cabin in Big Bear, California, where he was hiding . One Dorner supporter wrote that anger levels are so high that more police will be killed. He said: 'It's about to get worse... police killings is about to rise believe it or not it gone happen. 'Police all work together... how do you win... if u say something and the police say something who you think they done believe sure as hell not us.' Civil rights attorney Connie Rice spoke on radio to say that some residents were 'lionizing and admiring Dorner.' She told CNN before the reforms - brought in after the LA riots that were sparked by the beating of Rodney King in 1991 - the relationship between the black community and police was a 'state of war'. However she said things had improved and said the black community could never 'condone this kind of violence.'","20,000 people have joined a Facebook group supporting Dorner .

"The prime minister of the southern African state of Lesotho has fled after claiming the army had staged a coup. The tiny kingdom's military seized two police stations today as gunfire rang out in the capital of the mountainous region. Prime minister Thomas Thabane said the actions amounted to a coup - though an army spokesman said the soldiers were only securing the country. Scroll down for video . Prime minister Thomas Thabane said the actions amounted to a coup - though an army spokesman said the soldiers were only securing the country (file picture) Reports suggest the capital Maseru is now calm. Political tensions have been high in the tiny kingdom that is completely surrounded by South Africa, since June, when there was a power struggle after Prime Minister Thomas Thabane suspended parliament to dodge a vote of no confidence. At the time, South Africa warned against simmering conflict. 'As we speak now, the situation in Lesotho, in the capital, is back to normal. It's business as usual,' defense forces spokesman Ntlele Ntoi told The Associated Press. The military had gathered intelligence that the police were going to arm factions participating in a demonstration planned for Monday by one of the coalition parties, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy, he said. The military disarmed police in the capital, Maseru, to avoid bloodshed, Ntoi said. An exchange of gunfire between the military, youths and police injured one soldier and four policemen, he said. 'The arms have been removed and they are in military custody. The military has returned to the barracks,' Ntoi said, denying reports of any coup attempt. The tiny kingdom's military seized two police stations in the capital Maseru, pictured, today as gunfire rang out in the capital of the mountainous region (file image) 'We are not in a position now or in the future to stage a coup. All we do is to carry out our mandate to secure our country and property.' He said that the military did not know if the march will still take place Monday. Ntoi said he had heard reports that radio stations had been down for a few hours. He said he could not say if they were down for technical problems or because of the military. But Lesotho's Prime Minister Thomas Thabane told South Africa's eNCA television that the military actions amounted to a coup. He said he did not give permission for the action and that something like this should not be happening in a democratic state. He is going to meet with South African officials, and expects South Africa to help his government restore law and order, he said. 'There is a situation unfolding in Lesotho and our interest is to see it resolved through peaceful means,' said Clayson Monyela, spokesman for South Africa's Department of International Relations and Co-operations. He said actions by Lesotho's military bore the hallmarks of a coup d'etat, but added, 'The situation in Lesotho is still unfolding. No one has claimed to take over government ... so we are monitoring that.' 'We are calling on the commander of the armed forces to return to the barracks and allow the democratically elected government to return to its business,' he said. There was a power struggle after Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, pictured, suspended parliament to dodge a vote of no confidence . Monyela said the actions taken by the military have forced the prime minister to go into hiding. However, the prime minister had earlier told BBC that he is in South Africa visiting his daughter and would return to Lesotho on Sunday. Calls to the prime minister's spokesman and office were not answered. Monyela said the 15-nation regional group, the Southern African Development Community, will intervene and they are trying to bring all players to the table for talks at this time. When asked if South Africa would send military, Monyela said that wasn't under consideration at this time. 'We prefer peaceful resolution to any crisis, particularly if it's a political crisis... Such things become last resorts,' he said. Bernard Ntlhoaea, a guard at the U.S. Embassy in Maseru, confirmed that gunfire was heard in the capital early Saturday. 'The military has been moving around from 3 o'clock in the morning, occupying police stations in Maseru and moving around to other districts,' said Ntlhoaea. He said the military was armed and he saw at least one armored personnel carrier on the streets. The landlocked country's first coalition government was formed in 2012 after competitive elections that ousted the 14-year incumbent Pakalitha Mosisili, who peacefully stepped down from power. The coalition has since been fragile. Lesotho has seen unrest in its past and has seen a number of military coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966. The constitutional government was restored in 1993, after seven years of military rule. Violent protests and a military mutiny in 1998 came after a contentious election prompted intervention by South African military forces. Political stability returned after constitutional reforms, and parliamentary elections were peacefully held in 2002. South Africa's Democratic Alliance Parliamentary leader Mmusi Maimane said 'today's events come after heightened political tensions in June this year, which led to the country's parliament being suspended, as a result of a breakdown of the coalition government.'","Prime minister Thomas Thabane says action in Lesotho amounts to a coup .

"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured, admitted that sometimes he has moments of doubt about whether God exists . The Archbishop of Canterbury has admitted that he struggles with doubt about the existence of God. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he wrestles with disbelief – most recently when out on his morning jog. He also acknowledged that Christians have trouble explaining why God allows suffering in the world. The extraordinarily honest admission – during which the Archbishop said he was straying into territory where an Anglican leader should not go – came as he spoke during a visit to Bristol Cathedral earlier this week. Asked if he ever struggled with doubt, the Archbishop said: ‘Yes I do. I mean there are moments where you think “Is there a God?”, “Where is God?”’ He added that there were moments when he was struck with doubt even while praying, including during his morning jogs near his official London residence Lambeth Palace. ‘I love the Psalms, if you look at Psalm 88, that’s full of doubt,’ he told the congregation. ‘I go, well I call it running, the dog calls it holding her back, in the morning. ‘The other day I was praying over something as I was running and I ended up saying to God “Look this is all very well but isn’t it about time you did something, if you’re there” – which is probably not what the Archbishop of Canterbury should say.’ But he added: ‘It is not about feelings, it is about the fact that God is faithful and the extraordinary thing about being a Christian is that God is faithful when we are not.’ Asked how to persuade people who think religion is outdated, he said Christians did not have the answer to why God allows suffering. ‘We turn the tide in a number of ways,’ he said. ‘We know about Jesus, we can’t explain all the questions in the world, we can’t explain about suffering, we can’t explain loads of things but we know about Jesus. We can talk about Jesus – I always do that because most of the other questions I can’t answer.’ Archbishop Welby admitted that Christians were unable to answer why God continues to allow suffering . This is not the 58-year-old’s first brush with controversy since his appointment in November 2012. He criticised payday lender Wonga without realising the CofE’s financial arm, the Church Commissioners, had indirect investments in the firm believed to amount to around £75,000. Archbishop Welby opened his attack on Wonga in an interview in which he declared: ‘I’ve met the head of Wonga and we had a good conversation and I said to him bluntly, “We’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence, we’re trying to compete you out of existence”.’ He suggested that 16,000 churches could form the basis of a network of non-profit lending organisations. However, it later emerged that it would take up to a decade before any sort of church network might emerge. And in June, the Church Commissioners said they would continue to invest in Wonga. The chairman of Church of England’s Ethical Investment Advisory Group, James Featherby, said that the row had ‘highlighted some misconceptions about ethical investment, and in particular that its objective is to achieve a morally perfect portfolio’. However in July the Church announced that it had ended its investment in the firm. The Archbishop told the BBC that he was ‘delighted’.","Archbishop Justin Welby said sometimes he questions if God exists .

"Brazil made a new start in the wake of their World Cup nightmare but only after being dragged back into an old quarrel with Colombia. Mercifully for Manchester United, new signing Radamel Falcao missed all but the last 13 minutes of another brutal encounter between these two rivals, exactly two months after their World Cup quarter-final had descended into the Battle of Fortaleza. Neymar left the stadium – and the tournament – on a stretcher that night, and it was perhaps fitting that he should return as Brazil’s new captain to settle the rematch with a magnificent freekick seven minutes from time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar score free-kick to lead Brazil to victory over Colombia . Goalscorer: Neymar (right) celebrates after scoring Brazil's winning goal against Colombia in Friday's 1-0 win . Captain fantastic: Neymar, pictured with Juan Zuniga, skippered Brazil against Colombia in Miami . Cameo: Radamel Falcao made a brief fifteen minute cameo for Colombia against Brazil . Making a point: Manchester United's new striker Falcao gestures to the fans ahead of kick-off . BRAZIL: Jefferson; Maicon (Elias 45), Miranda, David Luiz (Marquinhos 80), Filipe Luis; Ramires (Fernandinho 45), Luiz Gustavo; Willian (Coutinho 72), Tardelli (Robinho 77), Oscar (Everton Ribeiro 72); Neymar. Subs: Rafael Cabral, Gil, Marcelo, Danilo, Everton Ribeiro, Ricardo Goulart. Scorer: Neymar 83 . Booked: Ramires, Luiz Gustavo .

Subs: Ibarbo, Vargas, Muriel, Carbonero, Balanta, Aguilar, Quintero. Sent off: Cudrado . Booked: Cudrado, Sanchez, Zuniga, Valdes, Gutierrez . Referee: Dave Gantar . Attendance: 73,429 . He was once again on the end of some roughhouse treatment from the Colombians who lost Juan Guillermo Cuadrado to a red card three minutes after half-time for his second bookable offence on the Barcelona star. Four of Cuadrado’s teammates were also booked including Juan Zuniga for a foul on Neymar, having escaped any punishment in Fortaleza for the cynical knee to the back which fractured his opponent’s vertebrae. The Brazilians were far from innocent that night either as Fernandinho and Co went to work on James Rodriguez in a game that brought a tournament high 54 fouls. It was surprising that only two of their number were booked on this occasion by increasingly beleaguered Canadian referee Dave Gantar. So it was perhaps for the best that Falcao stayed out of the way, just nine days before he is due to make his debut for United at home to QPR following a £6m loan move from Monaco on transfer deadline day. Colombia coach Jose Pekerman decided that it was best to put his star striker on the bench at the end of a week in which he had travelled to Manchester by private jet to complete the deal, and kept him there until the 77th minute when Falcao replaced Rodriguez to a huge ovation. However, his only notable contribution was to head a 90th minute chance over the bar. Going to ground: Neymar is felled under the challenge of Colombia's Aldo Leao Ramirez . Taking a tumble: Neymar falls to the ground under the challenge in Miami's Sun Light Stadium . Challenge: Aston Villa new boy Carlos Sanchez battles for the ball with Brazil frontman Diego Tardelli . Determined: Brazil's former Chelsea defender David Luiz looks to get ahead of Sanchez in the area . By then, Brazil had snatched the decisive goal, Neymar curling his freekick into the top corner from the edge of the box. It was a reminder of his mercurial talent and of what Brazil lost at the World Cup following his sad exit. Could he have helped avert that tumultuous semi-final defeat to Germany in Belo Horizonte? Could he have saved Big Phil Scolari’s job? We’ll never know. All that matters now is that he gave Scolari’s successor Dunga victory in his first game back in charge and Neymar’s first as captain. It was also Colombia’s first since their quarter-final defeat and they did not look like a team who were willing to forgive and forget. This wasn’t a friendly in any sense of the word. A sellout crowd of over 73,429 in the Sun Life Stadium – tickets were apparently selling on the black market for up to $4,500 on Friday – certainly got a competitive game. The Miami Dolphins face the New England Patriots here on Sunday and it is unlikely to be any more physical. Battle: Brazil left back Filipe Luis holds off a challenge from Colombia wideman Juan Cuadrado . Committed: Filipe Luis, David Luiz and Ramires defend the area as Colombia striker Jackson Martinez looks on . There was just one minute 50 seconds on the clock when new Chelsea signing Filipe Luis hacked down Cuadrado. Ramires and Luis Gustavo were both shown yellow cards for fouling the Fiorentina winger, who was one of a number of players linked with United this summer, and were followed into the book by Zuniga, Carlos Valdes, Carlos Sanchez and Teo Gutierrez. When Cudrado, who had been the first to be cautioned for bringing down Neymar, pulled back the same player three minutes after half-time he was off. The litany of fouls, bad-tempered niggles and angry crowding of the referee by both sets of players once again denied us the chance to enjoy the skills of players like Neymar and Rodriguez. Protection: Luiz makes sure Brazil goalkeeper Jefferson has hold of the ball following a Colombia effort at goal . Eyes on the prize: Juan Cuadrado gathers the ball under pressure from Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo . It also overshadowed the rest of the goalmouth action that saw Filipe Luis denied by an offside flag, Zuniga send a magnificent rising shot just over the bar from 30 yards and Jefferson scoop an awkward effort from Rodriguez around the post. The Brazil goalkeeper had been brought in to replace Julio Cesar as Dunga started his second term in charge by ushering in a new era in Brazilian football. Only 10 of the World Cup contingent made his squad this time around and only four of the line-up in Fortaleza started here. It included four Chelsea players in Filipe Luis, Ramires, Oscar and Willian. Neymar’s late strike means that Brazil’s 1994 World Cup winning captain now has an impressive record that reads played 61, won 43, drawn 12. They won’t come any harder fought than this one.","New Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao came on as a substitute for Colombia against Brazil .

"NYPD officers have been warned to 'use common sense' when posting on Twitter during their first class on using social media . New York police officers are being sent to classes on how to use social media after a series of high-profile Twitter gaffes. NYPD officers were handed a memo which read 'USE COMMON SENSE' on their first day of classes at John Jay College in Manhattan, according to a source. The move comes after Captain Thomas Harnisch was reprimanded for insensitive tweets about a woman who was hit by a train, and a publicity campaign using the hashtag 'myNYPD' was mocked. Cops are being warned not to write off-the-cuff remarks and instead stick to posting wanted posters, along with information on crime stats and road closures. Other safe topics include praising community groups, warning of an accident-prone section of road, or posting images of 'cop of the month', according to the New York Post. The training comes after Harlem cop Capt. Thomas Harnisch was forced to apologise after tweeting about a woman who fell on to subway tracks while using her iPad. Writing to Transport Alternatives, a safe-streets advocacy group, using the official precinct account, Capt. Harnisch said: 'Let me guess, driver's fault right?' After being criticised for his message, Harnish responded: 'Isn’t that exactly what you do? Seize on a tragedy and assign culpability having no facts?' Captain Thomas Harnisch was forced to apologise after posting 'insensitive' messages about a girl killed on the subway on an official NYPD Twitter feed . He was later forced to apologise on the same account, saying his messages had been 'unprofessional and insensitive'. A publicity campaign for the police department, in which Twitter users were encouraged to post positive images of the police along with the tag 'myNYPD', also went badly wrong. The feed was instead bombarded with images of alleged police brutality, violent protests and controversial arrests. Recent tweets on the NYPD page include an announcement about a free schools programme, and a picture of a gun confiscated from a shooting suspect.","NYPD officers told to 'use common sense' online after recent controversies .

"Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush has successfully landed after going on a celebratory skydive at his family's seaside retreat in Maine to mark his 90th birthday. Today's jump was his eighth time parachuting out of an airplane, and the former Republican leader made sure to show his national pride with a patriotic parachute. The 41st president has been joined by friends and relatives, including his son former President George W. Bush and granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager, who watched proudly during his milestone jump.

Mr McGrath said that Bush felt 'great, exhilarated' after the skydive in spite of the 'hot' landing. This wasn't be the first time he showed . his daredevil side, but it definitely comes under different . circumstances than his first. The Republican leader first jumped out of a . plane during World War II  when his plane was shot down above the . island of Chi Chi Jima in the Pacific in September 1944. Today's tandem jump was confirmed by his granddaughter who shared a photo of balloons and a telling caption on her Twitter account this morning.

White House counsel Boyden Gray and political director Ron Kaufman are . among the guests, said spokesman Jim McGrath. His children, including former President George W.

While his activities are now limited, Bush still enjoys taking out his boat, Fidelity. 'He's always loved going fast. He loves the speed. He loves the adrenaline,' McGrath said. Jon Meacham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian who is writing a book about Bush, said the former president is used to being in motion, so it is not easy for him to slow down. The president feels lucky nonetheless, Meacham said. 'He had a remarkable great run of good health and good family and good friends,' he said. 'So I know his chief view of life at 90 is one of immense gratitude. 'He's very grateful for his parents, he's grateful for Barbara, he's grateful for his kids.

"Tim Sherwood has revealed he would have taken the Crystal Palace job had he been offered it earlier this week - but felt it was always destined to go to Malky Mackay. Sherwood was one of the names closely linked with the vacant managerial position at Palace as the Barclays Premier League club seek to replace Tony Pulis, who walked out on the eve of the new season. Even though he felt Mackay was favourite for the role, Sherwood met with Palace co-chairman Steve Parish last weekend and the former Tottenham boss admits he would have accepted the role had the chance arisen. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sam Allardyce on the managerial crisis at Crystal Palace . Confident: Sherwood says he will be ready when his time comes to return to the game . Writing in his column in The Independent, Sherwood said: 'I have to say, I took some persuading in the first place to go to see Steve last Sunday. 'My feeling at the time was that the race was already run and that the job was going to Malky Mackay. But in the end I thought it would be a worthwhile experience. 'After seeing Steve and I asked people who knew Palace well about the club. Their immediate response was that they could not put me off the job. The feeling was that Palace was a good club and that the best thing about it was the current group of players, as well as the fans. 'If I had been offered the job early in the process, soon after my interview, I would have taken it. Naturally, I am confident in my ability to do it.' However, Sherwood, who left Spurs in May after six months in charge, admitted the longer the process went on and the more names became linked to the job, he decided it was not for him. The 45-year-old added: 'I know a lot of managers were interested. But at some point, as a manager, you want to know the interviews have stopped and you're the club's first choice. 'That was why, on Thursday night, my agent sent a message to Steve to say that I was no longer interested in being in contention for the job.' Favourite: Mackay was poised to take over at Palace before the Textgate scandal was revealed by Sportsmail . As well as Sherwood, the likes of Martin Jol, Neil Lennon and Glenn Hoddle have been linked with the Selhurst Park post, along with Mackay. Mackay had been firm favourite to be appointed this week prior to allegations of racism and homophobia lodged with the FA by Cardiff, which also forced the resignation of Palace's sporting director Iain Moody. Sherwood added: 'There are some serious allegations made against Malky and he will have to deal with those. When I went to see Steve Parish last Sunday, Malky was still very much the lead candidate. I liked Steve and I thought that his passion for the club was impressive. 'Iain Moody was one of the people in the room during the interview. That did nothing to change my mind that Mackay was the favourite.' Regarding his future, Sherwood added: 'I am back in England this weekend watching games and training sessions and continuing my education. I have lots of invitations to do that at other clubs in England and around the world, and I intend to take them up. I will be ready when my time comes to return the game.'","Sherwood concedes he would have replaced Tony Pulis had he been offered it soon after his interview .

"Moeen Ali's father has hit out at the abuse directed towards the England all-rounder and labelled it 'disgraceful'. The Worcestershire cricketer was subjected to booing by some of the Indian support during England's T20 win over them at Edgbaston on Sunday. A complaint of racially motivated abuse from a member of the public has also led police to classify it as a 'non-crime hate related incident', various reports said. Targeted: England all-rounder Moeen Ali was the subject of abuse from sections of the Indian support . Upset: Birmingham-born Moeen was booed during T20 clash . Moeen's father Munir believes the booing had racial undertones and insisted the Birmingham-born spinner should not have to contend with any abuse. 'We are very disappointed with what happened. It should have been a special day,' he told ESPNcricinfo. 'Moeen was playing for his country in the city of his birth. It is the city I was born in and the city my mother was born in. The whole family was looking forward to it and we thought he would receive a warm welcome. 'Instead he was abused from the start. He was abused because he is a Muslim and because of his Pakistan heritage. That is disgraceful. Claim: Moeen's father, Munir, believes the booing had racial undetones . 'We have experienced so much kindness and goodwill from all communities - Indian, British and Pakistani - in recent months, so it is disappointing that some supporters let their team down with this behaviour. There is still a problem with racism between Asian communities in the UK.' The Association of Chief Police Officers defines a hate incident as: 'Any incident, which may or may not constitute a criminal offence, which is perceived by the victim or any other person, as being motivated by prejudice or hate.' The police would need more evidence to pursue the issue and Ali, who took one for 31 in the game which England won by three runs, does not want to make a complaint, his father added. West Midlands Police were unavailable for comment when contacted by the Press Association. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Moeen Ali booed by Indian support during T20 win at Edgbaston on Sunday .

"Sean Dyche tossed his jacket aside in this match and he’s now going to have to roll up his sleeves. That’s two games and two defeats for his promoted Burnley side. Granted, one was against Chelsea and this was away from home against a side who won at Manchester United on the opening day. But already, at this extremely early stage, the Ginger Mourinho looks like he needs a few more creative thinkers on the pitch. Time and again Burnley held possession — 45 per cent, which is good going in these parts — but lacked the wit to find a way through a backline that performed well, yet still appears the weak point of this side. Celebration: Swansea City goalscorer Nathan Dyer and his team-mates look delighted after he scores in the 23rd minute against Burnley . Goalscorer: Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton was unable to keep Dyer's shot out of the net despite his best efforts . Team effort: Swansea, pictured celebrating Dyer's goal, proved to be too strong for Premier League newcomers Burnley . Swansea (4-2-3-1): Fabianski 6.5; Rangel 6, Amat 6, Williams 6.5, Taylor 5.5; Ki 6, Shelvey 5; Dyer 7.5 (Montero 65, 6), Sigurdsson 6.5, Routledge 7 (Tiendalli 90); Bony 6.5 (Gomis 64). Subs not used: Tremmel, Bartley, Richards, Sheehan. Booked: Shelvey, Sigurdsson . Manager: Garry Monk 7 . Burnley (4-2-3-1): Heaton 6; Trippier 5, Shackell 6.5, Duff 5, Mee 4.5; Arfield 5.5, Jones 6 (Sordell 90), Marney 5.5, Taylor 6 (Wallace 70, 6); Jutkiewicz 5.5 (Barnes 81), Ings 6.5 . Subs not used: Gilks, Kightly, Reid, Ward. Booked: Duff . Manager: Sean Dyche 5.5 . Referee: Craig Pawson 6.5 . Att: 20,565 . MOM: Nathan Dyer . Unfortunately for Dyche, it was his own defence that buckled, making Burnley’s lack of penetration up front all the more telling. Nathan Dyer’s goal was avoidable, the ‘outstanding negative’ in Dyche’s words after Ben Mee made a hash of an interception and Michael Duff hesitated in closing Dyer down. ‘I was just explaining to them that we showed too much respect in the first half,’ said Dyche. ‘That can happen to promoted teams. I have been through it myself. ‘We are not naive enough to think the growth period doesn’t have to be quick because it does.’ The last point was telling. Indeed, they learnt something of a lesson in the break, re-emerging with far more purpose and disregard for what was coming at them. They were at least the equal of Swansea in the second half. But the test will come from creating proper chances and taking them, which is what Burnley failed to do here. Had they shown similar precision to Swansea, they might have taken a point, a reward more tangible than the ‘encouraging’ signs to which Dyche pointed. ‘Swansea are good but they are not Chelsea yet,’ he added. ‘They are a very good side. But it was a more realistic challenge. We didn’t get anything and that is the challenge. But at least the players will know they can compete at this level.’ For Garry Monk, this was a second win in two, increasing the sense that he is the right man to lead the club. He spoke this week of banishing mobile phones from Swansea’s canteen and kicking out agents two days before a game. The measures were aimed at fostering a more united squad than that of last season. Already, he has been able to point to a performance of more grit than usual. Monk said: ‘In the first half we controlled the game. We spoke at half-time that they would throw everything at us and we weren’t at our fluent best, but we dug in and defended well. ‘There are times when you have to dig in and the boys were magnificent in that respect. I have been involved in so many games where we play well and get nothing. ‘Six points in two games is all you can ask for,’ he added.

Initially, this looked like it could be a terrible afternoon for Dyche. Within a minute he was on his feet; within three Swansea had an excellent chance. Jonjo Shelvey won possession in his own half before the ball found Wayne Routledge on the right. He jinked into the box, saw that Wilfried Bony had been given too much space near the penalty spot and delivered a perfect cross. Jason Shackell cleared the Ivorian’s header off the line. Danny Ings then volleyed over, but for the first half that was as good as it got for Burnley. Their main issue, in the early stages, was midfield — or, more precisely, their lack of one. Swansea’s 4-2-3-1 system and the extra man they were afforded against a 4-4-2 proved significant, even if Shelvey was having one of those days in midfield where his good and sloppy traits took turns to show up. In one five-minute passage of the first half he passed straight into touch. Then he hit a precise pass 50 yards into the path of Routledge, who was wide on the left. The winger beat Kieran Trippier and his low cross perfectly met the run of Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Iceland midfielder glanced his shot from seven yards when something a little more forceful would have done the job. Tom Heaton made the save but it was a major let-off, albeit a temporary one. Within a further five minutes, Swansea were ahead. Sigurdsson was involved, playing a through-ball from the middle that Mee reached but allowed to squirm past. Dyer took possession, motored away from Mee and carried on his surge into the area when Duff continued to back away. Heaton got a hand to the near-post shot but not enough to stop it. Dyche estimated earlier this month that he had made 500 calls over transfers in a bid to keep Burnley up. He has acknowledged he might need to make a few more over the next week. Bony miskicked from the edge of the area after the restart and Dyche’s jacket came off. Monk, new to a suit after feeling he ‘earned the right to wear one’ in his caretaker spell last season, was less ruffled, despite a less than energetic start to the second half. Swansea almost paid for their lethargy when Ings took possession on the left of the Swansea area and threaded a pass to David Jones, whose shot across goal beat Lukasz Fabianski but was heading wide. Lukas Jutkiewicz was inches away from connecting with a lunge. It was close, but not close enough. And Dyche will know that simply won’t do.

"Ed Miliband was under fire from business leaders to today after kicking off the Labour Party conference with a general election pledge to increase the minimum wage to at least £8 an hour. The Labour party leader said the current £6.31 level - which is set to rise to £6.50 next month - was leaving ordinary workers out of pocket. Mr Miliband's proposed increase, which would be introduced gradually between 2015 and 2020 - would add around £3,000 a year to the pay packets of those earning the minimum wage. But business groups said if the minimum wage was increased any further it would hit jobs. Scroll down for video .

He said many of the 1.6 million Scottish voters who backed independence felt they had nothing to lose from leaving the UK . Katja Hall of the business organisation the CBI said the minimum wage had already reached ‘the highest rate it can be without putting job creation at risk’. She said: ‘It has risen more than average earnings throughout the recession and recovery and is set to increase by more than 3 per cent from October.’ Ms Hall also raised concerns that Mr Miliband was politicising the wage, which has been in the hands of the independent Low Pay Commission. She said: ‘The national minimum wage has enjoyed broad business support and a move to a politicised US-style system is not in the interest of companies or workers. ‘Raising wages in this way would put serious strain on businesses, particularly hard-pressed smaller firms with tight margins, which would end up employing fewer people.’ John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce added: ‘Businesses are in favour of an evidence based approach to the minimum wage rather than political parties using it to gain support from voters. ‘The Government should not intervene in such matters, unless there is market failure.’ John Allan, from the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said he was ‘increasingly concerned’ that the minimum wage was ‘becoming a political football’. Labour claims there are around 1.4 million people who would benefit from the pay hike. The announcement signals the start of a Labour blitz on stagnating living standards under the Coalition, as the party gears up for the general election next year. Mr Miliband said: ‘One in five of the men and women employed in Britain today do the hours, make their contribution, but find themselves on low pay. ‘But if you work hard, you should be able to bring up your family with dignity.’ Mr Miliband added: ‘This week Labour's Plan for Britain's Future will show how we can change and how we can become a country that rewards hard work once again. Because Labour is the party of hard work, fairly paid.’ He revealed that he was inspired to increase the basic wage after meeting a woman who worked in Burger King. He said: 'She had worked there for six years and I think she was number two there, but was paid just above the minimum wage.' Mr Miliband was joined in Manchester by Labour's leading female MPs, including Harriet Harman (left, grey jacket) and Gloria de Piero (right, white dress) The planned increase, which would affect around 1.4 million jobs, would be introduced in annual stages by the Low Pay Commission before October 2019. The promised rate is said to be similar to that in force in Australia and EU countries such as Belgium and Germany, but still lower than in France and New Zealand. Responding to the announcement, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said the Tories would not take any ‘lectures from Labour’ on helping people on low pay. He said: ‘By crashing the economy, Labour made everyone poorer. And they haven't learnt their lesson. Ed Miliband would make people worse off with the same failed policies that got us into a mess in the first place - more wasteful spending, more borrowing and higher taxes.’ But shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said the policy was a win-win because people would earning more and paying more in tax. Mr Miliband added: ‘It is actually going to save money in benefits.’ The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘What is happening at the moment is that we are spending billions of pounds subsidising employers who are paying low wages, billions of pounds in benefits, tax credits and housing benefit. ‘It is going to have no cost at all to the public sector, and it is the Government's own figures that say that... For every extra pound that the minimum wage goes up, some estimates say that we will save 50p in benefits and extra tax revenue. As the private sector pays more in the minimum wage, we save money in benefits and tax payments. ‘I can assure you, it doesn't cost money, it saves money. It saves hundreds of millions of pounds in getting the welfare bill down.’","Labour Party leader kicks of conference with general election wage pledge .

"Israel today unveiled evidence that shows the Islamist group Hamas stored and fired rockets from schools during the deadly Gaza conflict. The country's military presented a series of damning photos, as well as a breakdown of the toll inflicted on the militant group, during a briefing at its headquarters in Tel Aviv. The images showed how rocket launchers were hidden in graveyards and a school playground, while tunnels were used by militants to carry out and escape from the sites of attacks. Israel today unveiled evidence that shows Hamas fired rockets from schools during the deadly Gaza conflict. Above, militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian take part in a military show in Gaza . Explosion: The images showed how rocket launchers were hidden in graveyards and a school playground . Officers also claimed Hamas had 16,000 operatives placed across region during the 50-day war, while the terror group Islamic Jihad had a further 6,000. And they provided details of the ranges and number of rockets fired by both organisations. The briefing aimed to explain the severity of the threat Israel faced and justify the country's heavy tank shelling and air strikes during the 50-day war - tactics that drew international criticism. One set of photographs, laid out by a senior military officer, showed a school by day, its central . yard empty. By night, rockets appeared to be stockpiled in the . yard. Meanwhile, at another school, a canopy, where a hole had been torn for . a rocket launching, was further frayed after a projectile was allegedly . fired from underneath. 'We're dealing with a carefully structured and in many cases . well trained terrorist force,' said the senior officer, . who spoke on condition that his name not be used. Wounded: A Palestinian child, wounded in an Israeli strike on a compound housing a U.N. school in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, is seen crying as others lie injured on the ground . Attack: A Palestinian youth carries a child, also injured at the U.N. school in Beit Hanoun, into the emergency room of the Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, in late July . 'Hamas has at least 16,000 operatives organised into six . brigades across the Gaza Strip, each with its own commander, . while (Islamic Jihad) has a similar structure and a total of . around 6,000 operatives.' The war, the longest Israel has fought since it withdrew . from the narrow coastal enclave in 2005, left more than 2,100 . Palestinians, most of them civilians, dead, the Palestinian . health ministry said. Israel said 67 of its soldiers and six . civilians were killed. After two failed attempts, an open-ended ceasefire was . struck by Egyptian mediators on Aug. 26. Detailed talks on a . longer-term peace are supposed to start in the coming weeks, . although already there are doubts about their prospects. On the day before the war began, the IDF said it estimated . militants held 10,000 rockets in Gaza, including 350-400 with a . range of up to 50 miles)and a few dozen with a range of 100 miles, reaching Jerusalem. On top of that, the intelligence . officer said, there were 'thousands upon thousands' of mortars. Around 4,000 rockets were fired during the conflict and . 3,000 destroyed by Israel's operations, leaving between 2,500 . and 3,000 in the hands of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other groups. The officer described that as a 'major degradation' of the . groups' capabilities, alongside the destruction of 32 tunnels . built from Gaza into Israel and steps to hit Hamas's finances. He presented figures showing that civilians made up the . majority of those killed in the conflict, saying that of 2,127 . Palestinian deaths so far verified by Israel, 706 were . civilians and 616 militants. A further 805 are listed as 'unknown', but the officer said . once verification was complete it was likely 40-45 percent of . them would be found to be militants and the remainder civilians. He said the heavy civilian death toll was the result of . Hamas and others conducting operations from densely populated . areas or employing 'operatives' who may not have had a direct . militant affiliation but still participated in some way. During the war, at least 6 U.N.-run schools were hit by . Israeli artillery, killing at least two dozen people and drawing . heavy criticism of Israel. Militant rockets were also found in . three empty U.N. schools. The pictures shown by the Israeli officer were of other, . non-U.N. schools. 'We're a moral military. We want to learn from our . mistakes,' said the officer, adding that civilian casualties were 'a big . issue in the world' and one that Israel was keen to address. With the war over, various investigations are set to begin, . including an internal Israeli military one, another by Israel's . government watchdog and a third by the UN's human rights . commission, already criticised in Israel. While the officer, occasionally sipping tea from a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency cup, said Hamas had not managed to . surprise Israel during the war, he acknowledged that an attack . by commandos who swam from Gaza into Israel was well planned, . used advanced, Western equipment and was carried out by . militants who were 'in very good shape'. Other near surprises were the extent of the tunnel network . dug by Hamas and its attempt to use a small drone-like plane, . although it carried no weapons or explosives. Reconstituting those capabilities would take time, he said, . adding that this war had been more successful than previous ones . in 2012, 2008-9 and 2006 in knocking Hamas backwards. But he . still referred to 'the next escalation' with Hamas, seeming to . accept that another conflict in Gaza was all but inevitable.","Israeli military presented series of damning photos at briefing in Tel Aviv .
