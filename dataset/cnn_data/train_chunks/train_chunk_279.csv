"Slovyansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday ruled out holding a second international meeting in a bid to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, also saying it would be ""unusual"" to hold a presidential election in the country when the army was being deployed against the population. In what could be a sign of Moscow preparing to question the legitimacy of the May 25 presidential election if it is unhappy with the process, Lavrov said, ""In the situation where they use the army against their own population, it's quite unusual."" ""This is not Afghanistan; this is a completely different situation,"" he said, adding that constitutional reforms promised by Kiev's new leaders would not be implemented in time for the vote. Kiev's security forces have launched their biggest effort yet to dislodge the pro-Russian militants who have overrun the south and east of the country, reportedly seizing buildings in dozens of towns and cities. Both sides clashed at the rebel stronghold of Slovyansk on Monday. Ukraine's security services said 30 ""heavily armed"" militants had been killed in recent days as part of the ""anti-terrorist"" operation in the volatile region. The rising tensions could have an impact far beyond Ukraine's borders, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned on Tuesday. ""Today we are facing the gravest crisis to European security since the end of the Cold War,"" he told reporters. ""But this is not just about Ukraine. This crisis has serious implications for the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area as a whole."" Asked about a German proposal to hold a second international meeting on Ukraine, Lavrov said the agreements reached during the first round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, last month still had not been implemented. He also called for pro-Russian sympathizers to be involved in talks. ""We already discussed the framework of the possible actions of stabilizing Ukraine. We already discussed it. There's no point doing it again,"" he said. ""Of course, it is possible, but we will walk in circles, and we will repeat the same things, and we will say again and again that we have to stick to the decisions which were already made -- but it's up to the Ukrainians to realize that it's their country, that they have to live in peace between themselves."" Lavrov was speaking after a meeting of the Council of Europe in the Austrian capital of Vienna, where the Ukrainian crisis dominated talks, even though diplomatic efforts have done little to ease the situation. His words came as violence escalated, with Ukraine's military seeking to regain control of swaths of the country that pro-Russian militia groups have seized. Kiev and many in the West believe that the separatists are backed by Moscow and fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin is fomenting trouble to increase his influence in the region. Earlier, in remarks to reporters in Vienna, British Foreign Secretary William Hague accused Russia of seeking to undermine Ukraine's presidential elections. ""Russia seems to be intent on a course of preventing and disrupting those elections,"" he said. ""That is wrong, and I think there will be a very strong message from the great majority of countries here today that the Ukrainian elections must be allowed to go ahead."" Hague said the doors to a diplomatic solution remain open. But he said that any chance of breathing new life into last month's international pact on Ukraine agreed to in Geneva would depend on all parties implementing it, including Russia. The U.S., Russia, Ukraine and the EU struck a deal in Geneva that included the disarming of militants, the departure of activists from occupied public buildings and a Ukrainian national dialogue on constitutional reform. As Russia and Ukraine are among the 47 member states of the Council of Europe, Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia, attended the Vienna talks. Hollande warns of chaos, civil war . On French TV station BFMTV earlier Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande echoed Hague's concern that Ukraine's election should go ahead as planned. ""The main goal we have is that the presidential election should be held in Ukraine on May 25,"" he said. ""Otherwise, there will be chaos and civil war. Vladimir Putin wishes today that this election does not take place."" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay voiced concern about the escalating violence Tuesday and urged all sides to do more to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. ""Armed opposition groups must stop all illegal actions, including detaining people and seizing public buildings in violation of Ukraine's laws and constitution,"" she said. At the same time, Ukrainian authorities must ""demonstrate full respect for the rule of law and scrupulously protect the human rights of all, including the Russian-speaking population,"" she said. Pillay also called for an end to the harassment of journalists. Unrest has simmered in Ukraine since street protests forced out pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in February. The interim government scheduled presidential elections for this month, but pro-Russian activists in the eastern part of the country refuse to accept Kiev's authority. Flights suspended in Donetsk . With the unrest in eastern Ukraine, flights into Donetsk airport were halted for several hours Tuesday. Armed pro-Russian groups have seized a number of administrative buildings in Donetsk. The separatists in Donetsk plan to hold a referendum Sunday that will ask residents whether they want sovereignty from Ukraine, an echo of events that led to Moscow wresting Crimea from Kiev in March. Ukrainian government forces launched a military campaign last week, which focused on the rebel stronghold of Slovyansk on Monday. Military gains were evident on the main highway into the city as the security forces moved in. A CNN team on the ground saw militants bolster their defensive positions and checkpoints inside the city. One civilian car was hit in the fighting, its exterior damaged by bullet holes. At a local hospital, the CNN team saw several people injured from the heavy clashes. One woman had been shot in the head, probably caught in a crossfire, and two pro-Russian militants were also brought in. Ukraine's Interior Ministry quoted local residents as saying the attackers had shot at residential buildings and set them on fire. Militants blamed Ukrainian forces for the civilian casualties. In a statement on its website, Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said 30 militants died and state security forces suffered casualties, but it did not give numbers for the latter nor specify the location. A spokesman for pro-Russian militants in Slovyansk said 10 militants died and 30 were injured Monday. These numbers did not include civilians. Ukrainian authorities describe the separatists as ""terrorists."" But the rebels say they are defending Russian-speaking areas of the east against Ukrainian ""fascists"" trying to root out Russian influence. Kiev says the rebellion is backed by Moscow and led in the field by Russian special forces, an accusation the Kremlin denies. In its statement, the SBU added that Russians in Crimea were also heading into east Ukraine. It did not provide further details. Moscow has accused the Kiev government of ""continuing a war against the people of their own country."" Russia and the West squared off diplomatically over the fate of Ukraine when Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea after a hastily called referendum and Yanukovych's ouster. He was pushed from office after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Moscow. Odessa investigation . Violence has also spread to the southern Black Sea port city of Odessa, where pro-Russian sympathizers smashed their way into a police station Sunday, demanding that detained comrades be released. The unrest came two days after more than 40 people were killed in a street battle and deadly blaze in the city -- and was one more example of how Ukraine's new Western-backed leaders are struggling to maintain law and order. After the violence, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov dismissed the regional governor of Odessa, Volodymyr Nemyrovsky, and installed Ihor Palytsia in his place, Turchynov's official website said. At a news conference Tuesday, Deputy Interior Minister Sergiy Chebotar said that anyone wearing a balaclava or mask outside would be detained and questioned as police in Odessa step up security after Friday's riots. He also said police had detained some ""citizens from one country on the Odessa border"" on Tuesday but did not give details. A week in eastern Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- One of the most dramatic Grand Nationals in recent years ended in victory for 25-1 shot Pineau De Re, who ran on relentlessly to capture Britain's most iconic horse race. Ridden by Leighton Aspell for doctor-turned-trainer Richard Newland, Saturday's victory capped a fairytale return to racing for the jockey, following his premature retirement from the sport in 2007. Veteran jockey Richard Johnson narrowly failed to break his 17-year Grand National duck, finishing second on Balthazar King, ahead of A.P. McCoy and Double Seven in third and Alvarado, ridden by Paul Moloney, in fourth. The 167th edition of the most famous race in the National Hunt calendar did nothing to dispel its reputation as the ultimate test for horse and rider. Horses must jump 30 obstacles over the four-mile course, including notorious fences The Chair and Becher's Brook. Two false starts delayed proceedings at the Aintree course near Liverpool, the race eventually getting under way in driving rain without Battle Group, who refused to start. An error-strewn opening circuit saw further casualties, and just 18 horses completed the race. Many of the favorites, including Teaforthree, Long Run and Triolo D'Alene, succumbed to the course's notoriously challenging obstacles. By the halfway stage, loose horses were scattered among the runners. One of the most significant incidents occurred when a riderless Tidal Bay, having earlier parted company with jockey Sam Twiston-Davies, loomed upside the leader, Across The Bay, and carried him across the course and effectively out of the race. Across The Bay managed to rejoin the field and eventually finished 17th. Pineau De Rey's victory was memorable for both jockey and trainer. The 37-year-old Aspell spent two years working as assistant to flat trainer John Dunlop before making a surprise comeback to race riding in 2009. Trainer Dr. Richard Newland is a registered physician with around a dozen horses in training. He has quickly established a reputation as a trainer skilled at refreshing older horses, such as the 11-year-old Pineau De Re. The race has been marred by deaths in past years, but this time all 40 horses and jockeys returned safe and sound. ""It has given us greater confidence in the measures taken to make Aintree safer for horses,"" Mark Kennedy, head of science for animal welfare at World Society for the Protection of Animals, told CNN. ""In the UK alone, for each thousand horses that start a jump race, four will die. At this level of risk fatalities are not freak events; they are predictable.""","25-1 outsider wins prestigious Grand National at Aintree course in England .

"(CNN) -- A third case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the United States has been reported. An unidentified Illinois man was infected after having ""extended face-to-face contact"" with an Indiana man who was diagnosed with the MERS virus. Fortunately, he is no longer ill. The rise in the reported number of MERS cases in the United States, Asia and Europe has fueled concern that this may be the big one: the 21st century equivalent of the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed 3% to 5% of the world population. Concern is appropriate, because the coronavirus responsible for MERS can evolve to become more potent public health threats. However, I don't yet see evidence that will happen. For one thing, an increase in the number of reported cases is not equivalent to an increase in the number of actual cases. As MERS testing is expanded from people with severe disease to include those with mild disease or only a history of potential exposure, we will detect more cases of infection. The mortality rate associated with infection will decrease from the current estimate of 30%. In short, we don't yet know the extent to which an increase in the reported number of cases only reflects better case ascertainment. MERS, like 70% of all emerging infectious diseases, including influenza, SARS, HIV/AIDS and ebola, originates in wildlife. With MERS, both bats and camels may be implicated. Studies of camels in Saudi Arabia indicate that the majority have a history of MERS coronavirus infection. Infection appears to occur in early life and then clears. Up to a third of young camels carry this infectious virus. Because camels are born in the spring, there may be an increased amount of virus circulating in camels in spring and summer months. This may contribute to a seasonal spike in the reported number of MERS cases. Humans may become infected through contact with infected animals, meat or other animal products such as milk. However, pandemic spread cannot occur without efficient human-to-human transmission. The MERS coronavirus grows deep in the human respiratory tract, so it is less likely to be transmitted than viruses that grow in teh nose, mouth or upper airways where a sneeze or a cough is sufficient to create an infectious aerosol. Hospitalized patients with pneumonia-like MERS receive vigorous respiratory interventions such as intubation, assisted ventilation, drugs that dilate airways and chest percussion. These interventions may bring virus into the environment in aerosols and on the surfaces of medical equipment, resulting in infection of hospital personnel and other patients. Since the MERS coronavirus has been shown to be stable for up to 48 hours, it may be difficult to determine the source of infection as people and equipment circulate in the health care environment. To date, cases of human-to-human transmission have only been reported in hospitals and in families where there is intimate contact with an infected person. If we notice a change in this pattern such that clusters of infections begin to appear in communities with more casual contact, that would be a strong sign that the virus is evolving to become a pandemic threat. The MERS cases in new countries are disturbing but not surprising given how globally connected we are. International travel and foot traffic make it easier to spread a virus. The first two cases reported in the United States, in Indiana and Florida, were health care workers returning from Saudi Arabia. Although a third case has been linked to contact with the Indiana case, I am cautiously optimistic that a cluster of cases will not be triggered. Nonetheless, vigilance is essential. Saudi Arabia has more than 7 million foreign workers and hosts more than 3 million religious pilgrims annually. If new cases arise they will almost certainly be imported. The key to an effective pandemic response is to acknowledge that infectious disease challenges are global rather than national. Information and biological samples must be shared freely to facilitate surveillance and the development of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. In this spirit, the government of Saudi Arabia has recently invited teams of international experts to join forces in addressing the global challenge of MERS. Although we are focusing on MERS now, the reality is that viruses and antibiotic resistant bacteria with pandemic potential are continuously emerging and re-emerging worldwide. The recent MERS cases should not trigger an alarm. But if a pandemic happens, it is important we are prepared to combat it.","A third case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the U.S. has been reported .

"(CNN) -- Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived in Saudi Arabia Monday for a meeting to discuss transforming their six nations into a union similar to the European Union. The idea of integrating the GCC nations into one entity -- and replacing what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by Saudi Arabia in December. Monday's meeting in Riyadh will lay out the timetable for it. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. ""The threats of all kinds require the hard works of the GCC countries to shift from a current formula of cooperation to a union formula acceptable to the six countries,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said last month. He didn't specify what threats he was referring to. But some analysts have said the GCC move could be an effort to counter the growing influence of Shiite Iran. The GCC was formed in 1981, soon after Iran instituted a Shiite theocracy and went to war with primarily Sunni Iraq. Iran and Iraq have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. After U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq last year, Tehran expanded military and security cooperation with Baghdad. Also, GCC member Bahrain blames Iran for fueling the anti-government unrest that continues to roil the country. Tehran has denied involvement. Bahrain is a predominantly Shiite country, ruled by a Sunni royal family. Last year, at the height of the protests, Bahrain called in troops from member nations Saudi Arabia and the UAE and cracked down. Iran is also engaged in a longtime dispute with the UAE over three Persian Gulf islands; Abu Mousa, and Greater and Lesser Tunb. The UAE says Iran has illegally occupied the islands. Iran views them as part of its territory. ""I think President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, when he visited the Abu Mousa island a couple weeks ago, in a way he highlighted the need for the union to counter the adventurism of the Iranian government,"" said GCC Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg. In this climate comes the GCC move to form a union. ""Such strategic vision would include common approaches to defense, security, political and economic long-term interests,"" Aluwaisheg said in an opinion piece Sunday in the Saudi English-language daily, Arab News. Already, Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, has demanded that the Bahraini government put the idea to a popular vote before it agrees. ""The people of the states of the European Union voted on the union decision before the union was announced. The people of the Gulf should also have their say,"" said Al-Wefaq Secretary General Shaikh Ali Salman. Aluwaisheg disagrees. ""The GCC is much more popular among the people than the EU (is) among the people of Europe. It's extremely popular,"" he said. ""No need to take a vote because it's really a done deal. If anything, the GCC has always been criticized for being too slow.""","NEW: Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrive in Saudi Arabia .

"Miami (CNN) -- University of Florida researchers examining the carcass of a large, pregnant Burmese python said Monday they found a record 87 eggs inside, giving them important clues about the reproductive capability of the dangerous, invasive species. Scientists at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the university's campus examined the 164.5-pound, 17.5-foot snake Friday after it was brought there from the Everglades National Park. It is the largest one ever found at the park. ""This thing is monstrous -- it's about a foot wide,"" said Kenneth Krysko, the manager of the museum's herpetology collection. ""It means there's nothing stopping them and the native wildlife are in trouble."" Pythons wiping out mammals in Everglades, researchers say . Everglades National Park and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are working with other agencies on the problem of the Burmese python, a non-native but established species in Florida that is one of the deadliest and most competitive predators in the southern part of the state, according to the university. The snakes have no known predator, and population estimates range from the thousands to hundreds of thousands. Previous records for Burmese pythons captured in the wild were 16.8 feet long and 85 eggs. Scientists say research of the snake's biology is important in understanding how to stop the python's spread -- not just in the Everglades, but also in the state and around the world. ""I think one of the important facts about this animal is its reproductive capability,"" said park wildlife biologist Skip Snow. ""There are not many records of how many eggs a large female snake carries in the wild. This shows they're a really reproductive animal, which aids in their invasiveness."" 16-foot python devours deer in Florida . The snake was so big that researchers had to pile it on top of itself and wheel it into the examination room on a flat cart. They laid it on a series of tables lined up end to end, and then five researchers worked side by side to dissect the length of the snake. The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia and was first found in the Everglades in 1979, the university says. They were determined to be an established species in 2000. ""They were here 25 years ago, but in very low numbers and it was difficult to find one because of their cryptic behavior,"" Krysko said. ""Now, you can go out to the Everglades nearly any day of the week and find a Burmese python. We've found 14 in a single day."" There are state laws now that prohibit people from owning Burmese pythons as pets or taking them across state lines without a federal permit. Floridians can also hunt them during certain seasons if they have the proper license and permits. Florida has the world's worst problem with invasive reptiles and amphibians, the university said. In a study published last year in the journal Zootaxa, Krysko found 137 non-native species were introduced to Florida between 1863 and 2010, with pet trade determined to be the No. 1 cause.

"(CNN) -- Don Sterling's punishment for his racist remarks was swift and severe. It may also be good for business, according to several experts. The owner of the Los Angeles Clippers was slapped with a lifetime ban by the commissioner of the National Basketball Association on Tuesday. The blow came after tapes were leaked of him telling his girlfriend he didn't approve of her posting pictures of herself online with black people, adding that he didn't want her bringing them to games. Sterling admits that he made the comments, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in announcing that he planned to fine Sterling $2.5 million and force him to sell his team. On the recording, Sterling's girlfriend V. Stiviano pushes back, asking Sterling if he realizes that his players are black. (Through her lawyer, she denied leaking the tape to the media, but said the recording was genuine.) Stiviano has a point. More than three-quarters of pro basketball players are black, according to a 2013 report by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida. Perhaps equally important, basketball fans are disproportionately black, research shows -- which means that racist remarks could hurt the sport's bottom line. Some 45% of television audiences for basketball are black, according to 2013 Nielsen research. That's much higher than for other major U.S. sports. About 15% of NFL fans, 9% of baseball fans and 3% of hockey fans are black, Nielsen research shows. The country as a whole is just over 13% black, the U.S. Census Bureau says. ""There is a significant market segment of African-Americans who identify with the NBA and NBA players,"" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of sports business strategy and marketing at Coventry University in England. And it's not just about the fans turning their back on a sport, he said. Sponsors were also beginning to distance themselves from the Clippers. The auto company CarMax and the airline VirginAmerica both announced they were ending sponsorship of the team, as did State Farm Insurance, the second-largest NBA advertiser, according to Nielsen. CarMax specifically took a stance against racism in its statement Monday cutting off its sponsorship. ""CarMax finds the statements attributed to the Clippers' owner completely unacceptable. These views directly conflict with CarMax's culture of respect for all individuals. While we have been a proud Clippers sponsor for nine years and support the team, fans and community, these statements necessitate that CarMax end its sponsorship,"" the company said. And it could have gotten much worse, sports marketing expert Robert Tuchman said. ""It would have destroyed sponsorship not only with the Clippers, but with the NBA. There is no way any of these major brands would be associated with a league where this is one of the owners,"" said Tuchman, the president of Goviva. That's what prompted the league to act, he said. ""The owners aren't going to do anything until it hits their bottom line, as much as they dislike"" the kind of comments Sterling made. Chadwick calls this ""market-driven morality."" ""It's not like reading the Bible,"" he said. ""Essentially corporations are looking at markets, looking at their consumers, and if being associated with a racist, a sexist, a dog fighter is bad business, they increasingly are making commercial decisions on that basis."" ""Commercial partners had already expressed their willingness to bail. Adam Silver did what he thought was right for the fans, for the customers, but also for the commercial partnerships that were in place,"" said Chadwick. ""Market-driven morality"" is much more advanced in North America than elsewhere in the world, he argued, contrasting the reaction to Sterling's comments with European soccer's failure to stamp out racist abuse of players by fans. The same weekend that Don Sterling's remarks became public, a banana was thrown at Barcelona soccer star Dani Alves. The racist insult is thought to compare black players to monkeys. Alves made a joke of it, picking up the banana and eating it, and a Twitter campaign sprang up in his support, led by his teammate, Brazilian soccer star Neymar. But there was no top-down response from Spain's La Liga or world football's governing body, FIFA. FIFA's long-time head, Sepp Blatter, has been accused by critics of not taking racism seriously enough. He suggested in 2011 that racist incidents should be resolved with a handshake, and last year argued against punishing teams for racist behavior by their fans. ""Can we bring an end to violence or racism by docking points or relegating a team? Or would such measures lead people to come to games to get the match abandoned,"" Blatter said in a speech in April 2013 at a meeting of the company Early Warning System, with which FIFA works to fight against match-fixing. ""We should do all we can but there's a risk that if we have matches replayed or if we punish clubs on the sporting front, it will open the door to hooligan groups who will come to deliberately cause trouble."" Blatter tweeted support for Adam Silver and the NBA on Wednesday. But the NBA's response to Sterling could put pressure on him to act more decisively, Chadwick said. ""With the World Cup coming up, it really commits Blatter to taking action,"" he said of the global soccer tournament that starts in Brazil in June. ""Sepp Blatter could do this. However, I don't think it's just a moral decision, it's a business decision too.""","Basketball audiences are disproportionately black, TV surveys show .

"(CNN) -- A Florida primate sanctuary on Thursday maintained its chimpanzee named Cheetah, who died last week, was more than 80 years old and acted in the Tarzan movies during the 1930s, amid doubts about his age. Cheetah died Saturday after suffering kidney failure the week before, the sanctuary said on its website. Several chimpanzees appeared in various Tarzan movies, many of which were popular in the 1930s and 1940s. Debbie Cobb, outreach director at the Suncoast Primate Sanctuary in Palm Harbor, Florida, said Cheetah appeared in the Tarzan moves from 1932 through 1934, meaning he was older than 80. ""I've been around this chimp for 51 years, so we know he's 51, and he was an adult when I met him,"" Cobb said. But several primatologists said Thursday they were skeptical that Cheetah was in his 80s when he died. Chimps commonly live into their 40s, and in captivity they can live up to age 60, according to Friends of Washoe, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the welfare of chimpanzees. ""It's hard to doubt folks who are caring for the chimp if they say they've had the chimpanzee that long consistently -- I'm not in any position to question it,"" said John Mitani, a primatologist at the University of Michigan. ""What's a bit surprising about the story is that the chimp is reported to be as old as it is."" He said it would be ""quite remarkable"" to find a chimpanzee anywhere who could live to 80. Cobb said her grandparents acquired Cheetah for the sanctuary in about 1959 or 1960. ""They used to pick up their own animals,"" she said. She told CNN affiliate WFLA that Cheetah came from the estate of Johnny Weissmuller, who played Tarzan in movies through 1948 with other chimpanzees. Weissmuller -- the first speaking Tarzan, according to the Internet Movie Database website -- died in 1984. Steve Ross, a primatologist at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago and a leading authority on chimpanzees, administers the Chimpanzee Studbook, a record of chimpanzees who live in North American zoos. He said ""only a small handful"" of chimps in records dating to 1901 have even approached 70. ""I think in that light, it's a pretty unlikely claim"" that Cheetah was older than 80, Ross told CNN. The likelihood of a chimp living to 80-plus is ""slim to none,"" said Mireya Mayor, a primatologist who has worked with National Geographic. Said Mary Lee Jensvold, dierctor of the Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute in central Washington state, ""It makes me scratch my head a little bit."" Cobb said the life expectancy of chimpanzees can be higher in sanctuaries because of the quality of care they receive. At Suncoast, they are fed five times a day and receive attentive care. ""They can go so long, and they can mask illnesses so greatly,"" Cobb said. Another chimpanzee in a Florida sanctuary named Little Mama is said to be 74 years old and believed to be the oldest living chimp now, said Jennifer Berthiaume, a spokeswoman for the Lion Country Safari in Loxahatchee. Ross said even Little Mama's age is ""pushing it a little bit,"" and Mitani said that age exceeds what scientists have been able to document. Another chimpanzee named Cheeta lives on a primate sanctuary in Southern California named C.H.E.E.T.A (Creative Habitats and Enrichment for Endangered and Threatened Apes), both named after the chimp character in the Tarzan movies. The California sanctuary's creator, Dan Westfall, said on its website that he was saddened to hear of Cheetah's passing in Florida. He said he and others at the sanctuary ""send our deepest sympathies to our colleagues at Suncoast."" Westfall said he was told his Cheeta was one of the original chimps in the Tarzan movies during the 1930s and 1940s. But when he began working with Washington Post writer R.D. Rosen on Cheeta's biography several years ago, research revealed ""that our Cheeta is unlikely to be as old as we'd thought, although he is clearly old,"" Westfall wrote. ""It is also difficult to determine which movies, if any, our Cheeta may have been in,"" Westfall wrote. Cobb said several primates at her Florida sanctuary have been in the entertainment industry. ""To me, they're all celebrities,"" she said. On the Cheetah matter, she said, ""We know there's going to be naysayers. We don't run in that mode.""","A Florida primate sanctuary maintains Cheetah was 80-plus .

"(CNN) -- Olympic gold medalist Sherone Simpson of Jamaica plans to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after receiving an 18-month doping suspension Tuesday, with her agent calling the ban ""incredibly unjust."" Simpson, who won gold at the 2004 Olympics in the 4x100-meter relay, silver in the 100 meters at the 2008 Games and silver in the 4x100-meter relay at the 2012 Olympics, tested positive for the banned stimulant oxilofrine at last year's Jamaican national championships. The 29-year-old revealed last year -- on the same day former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell of Jamaica and former world champion Tyson Gay of the U.S. said they had tested positive for banned substances -- that she would never ""intentionally take an illegal substance of any form"" but Jamaica's anti-doping disciplinary panel Tuesday claimed she was ""negligent,"" The Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported. The ban is backdated to last June, which means Simpson would be able to return to competition this December. ""The panel has given no written explanation as to how or why they came to this decision,"" Simpson's agent, Paul Doyle, said in a statement sent to CNN. ""We feel that this ruling is incredibly unjust and we will be appealing to the Court of Arbitration (for) Sport immediately."" Doyle added that the case for CAS should be ""very straightforward."" ""Sherone took a legal supplement that was contaminated with oxilofrine,"" said Doyle. ""Two different labs that we commissioned to test the supplement both determined that oxilofrine was present and that it was not declared on the label. ""Additionally, on our advisement (the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency) ordered the supplement directly from the company and tested it themselves and confirmed the same. Subsequently, USADA has posted a warning on their website warning athletes not to take the supplement because it contains banned substances that are not declared on the label. ""These are the core facts of Sherone's case and cannot be disputed. Typically in such a case, the athlete is given a punishment ranging from a public warning to three months of ineligibility.

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela will always have a place at Yankee Stadium after the U.S. baseball giants unveiled a plaque in his honor, Wednesday. The late South African president visited the home of the New York Yankees in 1990, just four months after he was released from his 27-year incarceration. Wearing a Yankees cap and jacket, Mandela arrived at the stadium 24 years ago and announced to the assembled crowd: ""You know who I am. I am a Yankee."" Mandela has now been immortalized in Yankee history with a plaque inside Monument Park, a museum which normally only recognizes former team greats. The dedication to Mandela reads: ""Nobel peace prize winner and global leader, whose tireless efforts dismantled apartheid in South Africa. ""As president of his country, he would use South Africa's enthusiasm for sports as a unifying force for reconciliation. ""In words and deeds, he became an inspirational leader to the world."" Nelson Mandela: A fighter's life . The commemorative plaque was unveiled as part of Major League Baseball's Jackie Robinson Day, which celebrates the first African-American to play in the modern era. Robinson's wife Rachel and daughter Sharon attended the event. Civil rights activist the Reverend Jesse Jackson, singer and activist Harry Belafonte, Zondwa Mandela, Nelson Mandela's grandson, and his wife and president of the New York Yankees, Randy Levine, were among a gathering of special guests. Mandela died at the age of 95 in December 2013. He is remembered as a freedom fighter, prisoner, moral compass and South Africa's symbol of the struggle against racial oppression.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian authorities arrested 10 people believed to be gay men under a bill signed this week that bans same-sex marriages, a human rights group said. Police detained men in various states and have dozens of pending arrests based on perceived sexual orientation, according to Amnesty International. ""Those arrested under this draconian new legislation must be released immediately and the charges against them dropped. Locking someone up for their sexual orientation violates the most basic human rights standards,"" Makmid Kamara, a researcher for the rights group, said in a statement Wednesday. Nigerian police spokesman Frank Mba angrily suggested no one had been arrested due to the new law. ""I challenge Amnesty International to publish details of persons alleged to have been arrested in connection with the new anti-gay law, stating clearly when they were arrested, where they were arrested, the police station or department that carried out the arrest, etc.,"" Mba told CNN Thursday. ""The new anti-gay law is primarily designed to prevent same sex marriages and unions in Nigeria. So far, (to the best of our knowledge) no Nigerian has come out to declare his intention of engaging in such an illicit union. Therefore, the question that naturally arises is: how can the police arrest 'suspects or offenders' not known to them or to the law?"" In Bauchi state, Amnesty said an assistant commissioner of police confirmed that authorities had placed ""a list of suspected gay people"" under surveillance. The group said police arrested the men in Anambra, Enugu, Imo and Oyo states. ""Reports that the police in one state are apparently drawing up lists of members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community to target are extremely worrying,"" Kamara added. Mba took issue with that claim as well. ""Who is this assistant commissioner of police? Amnesty International should provide his name and designation. Without providing details of the sources of their stories, third parties like CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity or accuracy of such stories. The anonymity of the story raises a big credibility question. ""Bauchi State Police Command alone has a total of seven assistant commissioners of police. There are hundreds of ACPs nationwide. Thus, without properly identifying the ACP in question, I will treat the story as mere fiction."" President Goodluck Jonathan signed the bill Monday after parliament passed it last year, despite international pressure against it. It bans same-sex marriages and civil unions, and includes sentences of up to 14 years in prison for gay couples. The bill also forbids the operation of gay clubs, societies or meetings in Nigeria. The punishment for such acts is 10 years in prison. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry joined the United Nations in condemning the bill. ""This law dangerously restricts freedom of assembly, association and expression for all Nigerians,"" Kerry said. ""People everywhere deserve to live in freedom and equality. No one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or who they love."" U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon expressed concerns, saying he was alarmed by reports of arrests and torture. He said he fears the bill will lead to violence and discrimination. . Last month, the Ugandan parliament passed controversial legislation that would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison. President Yoweri Museveni has not signed it yet. Homosexuality is illegal in most African nations based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era. The laws are perpetuated by cultural and religious beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. Last year, a Pew Research Center report found African and Muslim nations are the least accepting of homosexuality. Of the 39 countries surveyed, Nigeria was the most intolerant. At least 98% of respondents in the nation said homosexuality is unacceptable. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers reported from Lagos, and Faith Karimi from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Track and field star Tyson Gay was handed a one-year ban by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA) Friday and has had to return the silver medal he won at the 2012 London Olympics. Gay, a former world 100 and 200m champion, tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid at the U.S. Championships on June 23, 2013 and his suspension takes effect from that date -- making him eligible to compete later this summer. The standard ban for a doping violation is two years, but Gay has been treated more leniently because he co-operated with USADA, it said. ""We appreciate Tyson doing the right thing by immediately withdrawing from competition once he was notified, accepting responsibility for his decisions, and fully and truthfully cooperating with us in our ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding his case,"" USADA chief executive Travis T. Tygart told the organization's official website. Gay, who has been one of Usain Bolt's main rivals over the past few years, also accepted the forfeiture of all results and prizes dated back to July 15, 2012, when he first admitted using a product that contained a banned substance. That included his silver medal in the U.S. men's 4x100m relay squad at the London Games, where they finished second to Bolt's all-conquering Jamaican team. The shortened suspension length is subject to appeal by the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was satisfied with the punishment meted out to Gay. ""We note the athlete accepted responsibility for his actions and returned the medal from the London Olympic Games,"" it said in a statement. ""The IOC supports clean athletes and defends the integrity of sport against those who cheat. We will take all necessary steps with regard to the Olympic Games in line with our zero tolerance policy, and our full commitment to the protection of the clean athletes."" Gay is the joint second fastest man over 100m in history behind Bolt, with a 9.69 seconds clocking. He won the triple of 100, 200 and 4x100m relay gold at the 2007 world championships in Osaka. News of his positive test came on the same day that a similar outcome was revealed for former world 100m record holder Asafa Powell, shocking followers of track and field.

"Soma, Turkey (CNN) -- Police in Soma, Turkey, used tear gas, plastic pellets and a water cannon Friday on protesters angry over the government's response to a coal mine fire that killed at least 298 people. Protesters chanting ""Don't sleep, Soma, remember your dead!"" coursed through city streets a few miles from the disaster site, trying to reach a statue honoring miners. The clash came two days after a photograph surfaced of an aide to Turkey's Prime Minister kicking a protester, an image that quickly became a symbol of the anger felt by many against the government, and amid mounting questions over safety practices at the mine. The complex exploded into fire for unknown reasons Tuesday -- trapping many miners deep underground. Among other issues, mine officials indicated Friday that workers may not have had access to an emergency refuge where they could have sheltered from the flames and choking fumes. Site manager Akin Celik told reporters that the mine had closed one emergency refuge when excavation work moved to a lower area. Miners were building, but had not finished, a new safety chamber at the lower level, he said. The owner of the company, Alp Gurman, said the mine met the highest standards laid out by the law in Turkey. The company, he said, had no legal obligation to build safety chambers. Early Satuday, the Natural Disaster and Emergency Coordination Directorate said the number of dead in the mining disaster is now 298. It wasn't immediately clear how many miners may still be inside; authorities earlier said 18 remained trapped. If and when they are found, hopes have dwindled that they'll be alive. Rescue workers haven't found anyone alive since Wednesday. Smoke and fumes were still hindering search and recovery efforts Friday, officials said. Authorities have previously said the fire was sparked by a transformer explosion, but Celik told reporters Friday that the cause of the fire was still unknown. Asked what had happened, he said, ""We don't know either. Never seen anything like this before. We are trying to find out."" Kicking a protester . Friday's clashes are likely to further anger Soma residents already seething over the disaster and the treatment of the protester kicked by Yusuf Yerkel, an adviser to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The man, detained by special forces, can be seen lying on the ground as the suited adviser to Erdogan appears to aim a kick at him. The shocking image outraged many in Turkey, prompting an outpouring of anger on social media, and is seen as symbolizing the increasingly polarizing impact of Erdogan's authority in the country. Yerkel was quoted by Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency Thursday as saying that he had been deeply saddened by the previous day's events. ""I am sad that I could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation, insults and attacks that I was subjected to that day,"" he reportedly said. In another incident Wednesday, video footage showed a crowd outside a grocery store angrily booing Erdogan. As the Prime Minister entered the crowded store, he appeared to put his arm around the neck of a man who was later identified as a miner. After the confrontation, the video captured what appeared to be Erdogan's security guards beating the same man to the floor. The miner said later that Erdogan slapped him, possibly by mistake. He wants an apology for the way he was treated by the Prime Minister's staff. Huseyin Celik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, dismissed the grocery store incident and said the image of Yerkel kicking the protester was misleading. Political bonfire . Besides the anger prompted by the photo, Erdogan's comments Wednesday to relatives of dead and injured miners were seen as highly insensitive and drew scathing criticism. The Prime Minister glossed over the issue of mine safety, describing the carnage that was suffered as par for the course in the dangerous business. As public anger mounted through the evening, hundreds took to the streets in anti-government protests in Istanbul and Ankara, with police answering, in some cases, with water cannons and tear gas. As Erdogan took a stroll through the city, onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of ""Resign, Prime Minister!"" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu defended Erdogan in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. ""He was feeling all these pains in his heart,"" he said. ""Everybody knows that our Prime Minister is always with the people, and always feels the pain of the people. Otherwise, he wouldn't get such a high support in eight elections in (the) last 10 years."" But the disaster opened up an old political wound. Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. Erdogan's government rejected the proposal. It claimed that the mine, owned by SOMA Komur Isletmeleri A.S., had passed recent inspections. A Turkish engineers' association criticized mine ventilation and safety equipment this week as being ""insufficient and old."" A lack of safety inspections has caused 100 coal mines to be closed in the last three years, according to Turkey's Energy Ministry. A 'sorrow for the whole Turkish nation' President Abdullah Gul offered words of comfort as he visited Soma on Thursday, the day after his premier attracted public ire. The disaster is a ""sorrow for the whole Turkish nation,"" Gul told reporters, and he offered his condolences to the victims' families. An investigation has begun, Gul said, adding that he was sure this would ""shed light"" on what regulations are needed. ""Whatever is necessary will be done,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- London 2012 organizers could argue that one of the many attractions of holding the Olympics in the British capital is the number of great restaurants on offer for visitors harboring a hunger for tasty morsels. But gastronomy does not always entail gluttony. Eating the right food is vital to your health -- especially for the thousands of athletes who will be heading to the Olympic Park for the July 27-August 12 sporting showpiece. Team CNN's Zain Verjee traveled to Michelin-starred Danesfield House, on the outskirts of the city, with former British 400 meters runner Katharine Merry to help prepare a nutritious three-course meal that the Sydney 2000 Olympics bronze medalist described as: ""Nice and light. Like a pre-competition meal you would have the night before."" The first course delivered a simple blend of fruit tastes from England, strawberries being the berry of choice in July. But crucially it also delivered a hit of protein from the natural yoghurt and milk and a burst of energy via the natural fructose and xylitol. Nutritionist James Collins, an adviser for Team Great Britain during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, agreed that fruit smoothies were the perfect snack for training athletes. ""As a sprinter you need to make sure the protein intake is high enough to support muscle recovery. Things like meats and other dairy products are great for this,"" the director of London company Performance Nutrition told CNN. ""Berries and other fruits are full of antioxidants. They help athletes get rid of free-radicals, helping the muscles to be less sore the next day. ""Smoothies with milk or yoghurt are also a good source of calcium. A lot of athletes have high-impact workout sessions so they need a high calcium intake to make sure their bones are strong."" Merry, who retired in 2005 after injuries stopped her following up her medal achievement, now works as a television pundit. ""Smoothies are a good start to the day,"" the 37-year-old said. ""They can be very filling. Just an extra oomph of protein powder mixed into a smoothie like this really does kickstart your day."" Next up was a light lunch of fresh mackerel with cucumber relish and palm hearts. The raw fish and accompanying oysters were packed full of protein, essential for energy and muscle repair. Cut into bite-size pieces, the fish was both light and sustaining for Olympic athletes in training. ""I used to eat a lot of sushi because the rawer the meat is in terms of fish, the higher the nutritional value. The more you cook it, the more you'll lose out of it,"" Merry said. ""Meat is the essential part of an athlete's diet, and power-based sports as well need the protein to build muscle maintenance."" Collins said that eating fish helps assist muscle repair. ""Fish such as herring or mackerel have a high Omega 3 content, which helps the blood have more anti-inflammatory properties. It can really help them recover so you're not as sore the next day,"" he said. Last on the menu was a dessert of poached black figs with apple sorbet and goat's curd. The figs offered a sweet treat that was both low in calories and high in fiber. Merry said that anyone can follow an athlete's diet, which is similar to what everyone needs for a healthy life. ""Athletes must be looking out for high carbohydrates for energy to help you get through your training session and the race. They also need a good intake of protein to ensure muscle growth and maintenance,"" she said. ""Basically, an athlete's diet is the same as everyone else's -- as in eat sensibly, five fruit a day -- but in larger quantities."" To cook like an award-winning chef and eat like an athlete, follow these recipes from Danesfield House's head chef Adam Simmonds: . Strawberry Smoothie (ingredients in fact box) Remove the top of the strawberries. Halve the strawberries and place into the blender, add the yoghurt and milk blend until a smooth consistency is achieved. Add Xylitol to taste if you prefer the smoothie to be a little sweeter. Pour into 4 large cooled glasses and garnish with a sprinkling of granola and wild strawberries. Mackerel with Cucumber and Palm Hearts (ingredients in fact box) Relish: . Combine the sugar, water, vinegar and spices and bring to the boil. Remove and allow to cool. Dice the cucumber, minus the seeds and salt for for 1 Â½ hours with the chopped shallot. Wash excess salt and pat dry. Pour pickling liquor over the cucumber and marinade, preferably overnight. Cucumber Hearts: . With an apple corer, push down the center of an unpeeled cucumber several times, so that a number of cylinder shapes are achieved. With the remaining cucumber, put through a juicer and pass through a fine sieve. Season with salt. Place a little of the juice in a vac pac bag and compress tightly. Reserve the remaining cucumber juice for poaching the oyster. Assembling the dish: . Poach the oyster lightly in the remaining cucumber juice, drain and cut in half. Thinly slice the mackerel and brush with lemon juice, seasoned with salt to start the curing process. On a mandolin, slice the palm hearts into strips. Drain the relish and cucumber hearts and assemble in the middle of the plate, naturally. Place the oysters on the cucumber. In a pan of salted water, blanch the palm hearts, scurvey grass and rock samphire, quickly, to keep the nutrients. Scatter over the cucumber and lay the mackerel slices in and around. Garnish with pak choi flowers.","Michelin-starred chef Adam Simmonds cooks for former British runner Katharine Merry .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard is suspending its search off the California coast for a distressed 29-foot sailboat that was carrying a couple and two children, and said Tuesday the incident is ""possibly a hoax."" The mission's cost has reached several hundreds of thousands of dollars since Sunday, said Cmdr. Don Montoro. Searchers have been scouring the water off San Francisco for the people that a distress call claimed were on the boat: the couple, their 4-year-old child and the child's cousin, who the Coast Guard said was younger than 8. Coast Guard investigators will look into the incident and ""prosecute it and investigate it to the best of their ability,"" Montoro said. ""We're not investigating it directly as a hoax, but we are pursuing every avenue. It's certainly a possibility."" ""I know we do have successful prosecutions"" on such hoaxes, Montoro said, ""and it would be taken very seriously."" Since last June, the Coast Guard has been offering a $3,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for an apparent hoax that prompted a massive rescue effort off the coast of New Jersey following a distress call. In that incident, a search came up empty for purportedly injured and adrift passengers from a yacht hit by an explosion at sea. The agency found no evidence of people, debris or even a boat, it said. The investigation is still active, Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said Tuesday. Making a false distress call is considered a felony, punishable by up to 10 years behind bars and a $250,000 fine, the Coast Guard said last June. The person responsible could also be required to reimburse the government for the cost of the search. In 2011, the Coast Guard counted 54 probable hoaxes nationwide out of 7,274 mayday cases, Rowe said. One hoax cost the Guard $74,000, another $44,000 and another $5,200, he said. Those costs don't include local police or other first responding agency costs, he added. In one region alone -- New York City, Hudson River and northern New Jersey -- there were 80 probable hoaxes during the past six years, Rowe said. In this week's incident off the California coast, the weather offshore during the search featured gale-force winds and 25-foot seas, Montoro said. On Sunday afternoon, the Coast Guard received a radio communication that stated: ""This is the Charm Blow, we are abandoning ship."" The man on the radio told the Coast Guard that the boat had begun taking on water and its electronics were failing, the agency said. At that time, the boat was believed to be some 65 miles (105 kilometers) off Pillar Point, south of San Francisco. The focus of the search had been 60 to 65 miles off Monterey Bay, said Lt. Heather Lampert, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. At 20,000 square miles, the search area was nearly the size of West Virginia. The U.S. Navy from Point Magu and the 129th Air National Guard from Moffett Airfield participated in the search, Montoro said. More than 40 search-and-rescue assets were involved in the effort, he said. At one point, two Coast Guard cutters, HC-130 planes, MH-65 helicopters and a Navy E2-C Hawkeye were involved, the Coast Guard said on Monday. CNN's Dan Simon and Augie Martin reported from San Francisco. Michael Martinez wrote and reported from Los Angeles.","Coast Guard counts 54 probable hoaxes nationwide in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- He was once considered the obvious choice to become the next leader of world football, but that vision appears to be waning. Michel Platini is so disillusioned and frustrated at the way FIFA conducts itself that it would take an almighty change to persuade him to run for presidency of the ruling body, CNN has learned. While UEFA has yet to approach anybody to stand against incumbent Sepp Blatter, there is only a 10% chance that Platini will be that man, a source close to the Frenchman told CNN. Platini, the president of European football's governing body, believes there would need to be unrecognizable change within FIFA to eradicate all traces of corruption before he considered his candidacy, the source said. Last weekend, UK newspaper The Sunday Times published allegations claiming a Qatari official paid more than $5 million in an attempt to secure support for the Gulf state's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament. According to allegations, Mohamed bin Hammam made secret payments to soccer officials in the run-up to the controversial 2010 ballot. Bin Hammam, the former president of the Asian Football Confederation, was a member of FIFA's powerful 24-person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010. Bin Hammam, who was banned for life from football the following year after separate bribery allegations, said he would not be making any comments on the new scandal other than he believed ""that the truth will find its way to (the) public one way or another."" The Qatar 2022 bid committee strenuously denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of any payments made on its behalf. On Tuesday, the British Daily Telegraph reported Platini met with Bin Hammam just days before the World Cup was awarded to Qatar. The source confirmed to CNN that while Platini did meet with Bin Hammam, the subject of the conversation was the FIFA presidency and not the 2022 World Cup. According to the source, Bin Hammam wanted Platini to stand against Blatter in 2011 but the former France international player refused. It was then, according to the source, that Bin Hammam decided to challenge Blatter himself, but was unsuccessful after being found guilty by a FIFA ethics committee of offering cash for votes and was banned for life. In a copy of a letter written to the Daily Telegraph and provided to CNN, Platini describes the allegations as ""astonishing."" ""I have obviously met with Mr. Mohamed Bin Hammam on many occasions in 2010 as we were both members of the same FIFA Executive Committee since 2002,"" read the letter. ""During those conversations with Mr. Bin Hammam, the topic of the discussions was my potential candidature for the FIFA Presidency. Mr. Bin Hammam was indeed trying to convince me to become a candidate for the 2011 FIFA Presidential elections. ""Additionally, I wish to reiterate that I am the only member of the FIFA Executive Committee who publicly stated for which bid I have voted -- proof of my full transparency -- and that no-one ever dictates terms or conditions to me. ""Unfortunately, I am no longer surprised by the circulation of unfounded rumors which aim at tarnishing my image, especially in such an important time for the future of football."" The source told CNN that the current allegations have not damaged Platini's reputation within UEFA, although he is believed to have grown tired of the constant sniping, . While Platini has been one of the only men to reveal he voted for Qatar, the admission has left him open to attacks, while others who did likewise remain in the shadows. The episode has made Platini seriously consider whether he will ever run for FIFA, the source told CNN, adding that the Frenchman believes he may be best suited to remaining in Switzerland and working on a number of other football projects. While Platini, 58, does not intend to stand against Blatter in the presidential contest, UEFA would like to avoid a scenario where the 78-year-old runs for a fifth consecutive term unopposed. Blatter, 78, is expected to declare his intention to stand once again when he addresses FIFA's 209 members this weekend and go back on the promise he made not to stand again. The other man who could challenge Blatter is Frenchman Jerome Champagne -- a man who has already stated he is unlikely to win should Blatter stand again. His campaign has inspired little confidence at UEFA. UEFA is keen to ensure it picks a candidate, thought to be from its committee, which does not stand to lose their career if defeated. A number of UEFA officials are expected to stage a sit-down protest against Blatter at the FIFA EXCO meeting in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It is hoped that the protest will give FIFA an indication of the frustration and annoyance at the way the game's governing body is running football.","UEFA president Michel Platini unhappy with way FIFA runs world football .

"(CNN) -- Gabby Douglas winning the all-around gymnastics gold medal in London is over-the-top significant on so many levels. It's not only that she won the top prize in a dramatic and thrilling competition last week, featuring the top Russian gymnasts. More important is the powerful message Gabby is sending to young girls and women, especially those who are African-American, about doing what it takes to make your dreams happen. Young people need to reach for spectacular goals. This is not a message we hear often enough, and that is why is it so important. Monday may have been not quite as golden a day for Gabby -- she placed eighth in the women's uneven bars final -- but the audience did not seem at all disappointed in her performance; there was anticipation and excitement just to see her compete again. And it did nothing to diminish what she has accomplished; with her all-around victory Thursday, she created one of those iconic Olympic moments that will endure the test of time. Gabby became the best in her sport in front of the world, and was unapologetic about doing what it took to get her there. Her family's sacrifice, and the trust her mother showed in her daughter's goals, could be a lesson to parents and children everywhere. The story of an African-American single mom and her daughter reaching for greatness, and succeeding, will resonate with a whole new generation. I have been an elite athlete, coached an Olympic gymnast and since 1994 have provided free and low-cost gymnastics to over 10,000 young people in Harlem. I know the challenges of gymnastics, especially for minority families. Top-level gymnastics takes an incredible sacrifice from an athlete and her family in endless practice time, constant travel and lots of money. The fact that Gabby chose at age 14 to move halfway across the country to achieve her goal is a testament to her drive. It was a remarkable decision: According to research by the Women's Sports Foundation, by age 14, girls are dropping out of sports at twice the rate of boys. Gabby has become a key role model who may help reverse this trend. It is important to not focus on the possible ways to make money from sport. It did not work that way for Gabby Douglas; the appeal of the journey to greatness was already there and it cannot be underestimated. The reasons to participate in sport and fitness and the benefits can't be measured by dollars, unless you count how much it is costing this country to support a generation of overweight, unhealthy, unmotivated and unprepared-for-the-world young people. Yes, we need Gabby. Let's face it, you cannot take your eyes off her. When she is competing, her gymnastics is exciting. When she is being interviewed, her energy, love of her family, her sport and her faith together make a compelling impression. This is an exciting time for women's gymnastics. But it is an even more exciting time for young girls -- all the girls who now have Gabby to look up to. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendy Hilliard.","Wendy Hilliard: Gabby Douglas gold medal for all-around gymnastics is highly significant .

"(CNN) -- In the backwaters of India's southern state of Kerala, traditional village life goes on much as it has for the last 50 years. The occasional satellite dish, motorized houseboat or construction of a new guesthouse are the only nods to increased outside interest in this seemingly endless string of interconnected waterways, paddy fields and coconut groves that stretches down the Malabar Coast. Ferrymen still carry villagers on tiny canoes, as women in vivid saris wash clothes on stone steps near the river. Exuberant children in bright school whites run along the banks, shouting cheerful hellos to any new faces. Regularly hailed as one of the top 10 things to see in India, the backwaters offer a chance to witness another side of a country often known for its frenetic pace of life. The main spots to embark on a backwaters adventure are the cities or towns of Alappuzha, Kochi, Kollam and Kumarakom. Here are three great ways to experience them. Kumarakom Lake Resort . Kumarakom Lake Resort offers a rare opportunity for those who want to enjoy the beauty of the backwaters while enjoying five-star service and luxury. The UK's heir to the throne Prince Charles recently celebrated his 65th birthday at the resort with wife Camilla. Built on the edge of Vembanad Lake, the resort is a stunning union of nature and historic architecture. An array of birds hops around the perfectly manicured lawns while river otters swim in canals that snake through the property. Bridges connect different parts of the resort, mirroring the links between villages across the backwaters. Most of the property has been constructed using elements from Kerala's historic stately homes, such as ornate doors and elaborate roof structures. The three dining areas offer a good range of food options made with top quality ingredients. As the resort is on the banks of the backwaters' main lake, those wanting to see the smaller canals and waterways should take a boat trip, which the hotel can organize. Kumarakom Lake Resort, Kottayam 686 566, Kerala, India; +91 481 252 4900; rooms from Rs 17,500 ($289) plus tax . Traditional houseboat (kettuvallam) For centuries, Kerala's remote backwater communities used kettuvallam boats to transport rice from the paddy fields to market towns. Today these beautiful craft made of bamboo, rattan, coir and wood are a favorite with tourists. Usually measuring about 80 feet (24 meters) in length, Kerala's houseboats have been refashioned into stylishly furnished floating cottages. Depending on budget, options include houseboats with two floors, balconies, living rooms and even four or five bedrooms. The lure of the tourist dollar has brought in some ventures that do little to benefit the local community, while others guzzle fuel and dump untreated waste. Options such as Spice Coast Cruises run on solar power and are fueled by vegetable oil, and Goodearth, essentially run by a cooperative of villages, is ethically and ecologically sound. It's possible to spend an afternoon to a week on a backwaters houseboat, though two-day trips are the most popular. This allows travelers to lounge on deck as they cruise past a patchwork of pastel-colored houses, churches and temples. Most companies arrange for stops at villages selling local crafts and wares. River regulations require boats to dock overnight but it's still nice to stop in a secluded spot, gaze at the stars and listen to the sizzle of freshly caught fish roasting on the grill. The main rivers are like a watery highway, so the journey won't always be peaceful. The days of being only the houseboat on the water are long gone and cruisers can expect municipal passenger boats to motor past. But the journey also provides the chance to see duck farmers herd their flock along the river and lone fishermen in tiny boats laden with the day's catch. Emerald Isle Heritage Villa . Located in Nedumudi, about 12 kilometers from Alappuzha, this traditional Keralan house is the ancestral home of owner Vinod Job and his brother Vijo. Together they put together a remarkable experience that weaves together their own rich family history and village life. Upon arrival, guests are picked up from the far side of the river by a traditional canoe, known as a vallam, and transported to the idyllic 150-year-old property. There are a few sleeping options but The Cottage and The Granary are most charming and come with stylish outdoor bathrooms. Emerald Isle has its own paddy fields and coconut groves, and the food is almost all locally grown. Dinner is served in a communal space and is a showcase of traditional dishes such as karimeen pollichathu and neimeen curry. Visitors can rent bikes, explore on foot or take trips in a traditional vallum. The guesthouse can also arrange kayaking and fishing trips. There are dozens of little canals connected by ramshackle footbridges, while local shacks sell everything from candy and soft drinks to Toddy, a popular local alcoholic drink. Away from the action, Emerald Isle offers lazy afternoons in a hammock, Ayurvedic massages and beauty treatments.

"(CNN) -- The eyes of the world may be on Brazil with the World Cup about to kick off but the uncertainty which has engulfed Ukraine since the Russian annexation of Crimea remains. And if you believe everything you read, then half the squad of Ukraine's leading club Shakhtar Donetsk is ready to leave the troubled region and head for the top European Leagues. But reports of a mass exodus are premature, according to the club's general manager. ""Nobody wants to leave the club and nobody has asked to leave the club,"" Sergiy Palkin told CNN Tuesday. ""I understand the concerns and I've had lots of agents on the phone asking me, 'Is it safe and will my player be OK?' ""But I tell them that we can 100% guarantee the security and safety of the players and their families. ""I understand that the families of the players are worried but it is fine here. ""We have not had to give them extra security."" Tensions remain high in the region although the election of new president Petro Poroshenko has provided hope that the political situation may improve. The club, which regularly competes in the European Champions League group stages, expects the squad to return to Donetsk on July 26 following a preseason tour -- though contingency plans are in place if the political situation worsens. ""It is complicated here in Ukraine as everybody knows,"" Palkin added. ""But we hope we can resolve all the political problems and we're hopeful over plans to restart the league next season. ""At the moment, it is calm in Donetsk and there are no real problems. ""Of course, we have talked about contingency plans. We could move cities if the problems get worse but we do not expect that to happen. ""We are very confident we will all meet up on July 26 for the new season."" Shakhtar, which has won five consecutive league titles, boasts a number of players from South America including Brazil's Bernard. The midfielder, who has been included in the country's World Cup squad, has reportedly been attracting attention from a number of English Premier League clubs. But Palkin rejected claims the club is under pressure to sell off its prized assets. ""I've read everything in the newspapers but there is nothing in it,"" he added. ""We are not under pressure to sell and nobody has requested a move. ""Of course, if a team comes in with a good offer then we'll consider it but we have no intention of selling our best players.""","Ukraine remains in state of uncertainty following Russian invasion .

"(CNN) -- The historic vessel which provided the setting for Humphrey Bogart's only Oscar winning performance has been resurrected from the scrapheap by a movie-loving Florida couple. The African Queen is a 100 year old steam boat famed for its starring role in the 1951 hit movie of the same name. The classic picture -- which also starred Katharine Hepburn and told the story of a Canadian steam boat captain and a British missionary working in German East Africa during the First World War -- saw Bogart receive the 1951 Academy Award for best actor. After falling into a state of disrepair following the death of its previous owner in 2001, the vessel was spotted gathering rust in a Florida marina late last year by Suzanne Holmquist and her engineer husband, Lance. The couple have since repaired the ailing ship and opened it up to tourists and film enthusiasts, providing cruises around the Florida Keys aboard the famous vessel. See also: Historic vessel Cutty Sark rises from ashes . ""It's (the boat) held in a trust so we approached them and talked about restoring it,"" says Holmquist on how she stumbled upon the famous vessel. ""We have a tall ship business that operates right next to where the African Queen was stationed in Key Largo. It was just wasting away so we offered to restore it and put it into our charter operation,"" she adds. Although most famed for its role alongside Bogart and Hepburn, the African Queen had a long and colorful life before hitting the big screen, explains Holmquist. Built in 1912 at Lytham Shipbuilding Yard in England, the vessel was originally named the Livingstone and served as a cargo vessel for the British East Africa Rail Company. It spent most of its first 50 years operating in the waters of the Ruki River in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo where she was used to transport a mixture of hunters, mercenaries and cargo. In the early 1950's the ship was spotted by the director of the African Queen, John Huston, and pulled temporarily from service so it could be used in the movie. See also: HMS Victory gets $25 million revamp . By the late 1960's however, the African Queen had swapped the big screen and the rural hinterland of the Congo for the concrete jungle of San Francisco. An American businessman transported the ship to the Golden Gate city where he hoped to harness its Hollywood fame to operate it as a tour boat. This idea proved unsuccessful however and the vessel then changed hands a number of times before coming to the attention of Florida attorney and Humphrey Bogart enthusiast, Jim Hendricks Sr. in 1982. Hendricks Sr. eagerly snapped up his very own chunk Bogart movie memorabilia which he owned until his death in 2001. During this period Hendricks Sr. took the African Queen around the world, gracing flotillas that marked the 50th anniversary of the battle of Dunkirk in the English Channel and the Queen Mother's 90th birthday on the River Thames. Once Hendricks Sr. passed away however, the vessel once more fell upon hard times, wasting away on a lonely jetty in southern Florida. It was here that Suzanne Holmquist, herself a self-confessed Bogart and Hepburn buff recognized the boat. Late last year she made an offer to the owners to put it back in working order. ""It had big holes in it and was kind of like a sieve when it rained, all the water was just pouring out,"" says Holmquist. ""My husband has restored big boats before, some bigger than this one, so I knew that we could do it,"" she adds. The ensuing restoration project has been a detailed and thorough process taking fully six months to complete. See also: Tourism at the bottom of the deep blue sea . The hull has been equipped with a new steel frame, a replacement boiler has been installed and the original black African mahogany wood decks have been repainted. In order to maintain the boats worn and rustic charm however, Holmquist says it has been splattered with mud so as to make it look exactly like it does in the movie. ""Most of the interest so far in boat has come from movie fans ... so we wanted it to make it look as much like it does in the film as possible,"" says Holmquist. The ship has even had a special guest visitor in the shape of Humphrey Bogart's son, Stephen, who gave the freshly completed restoration efforts his blessing. But by using the African Queen's Hollywood past to draw people aboard, Holmquist also hopes to provide visitors with an understanding of the ship's rich history beyond the silver screen. This a story Holmquist herself says she has been fascinated to discover over the course of the past few months. ""I knew it was famous from the movie but as time has gone on I've found out a lot more about the history of it and where she has been,"" says Holmquist. ""Hopefully we'll be able to relay that story and all those who come to visit can learn a little more about the boat and her incredible life,"" she adds.","The African Queen is a steam boat that featured in a 1951 movie of the same name .

"(CNN) -- Manti Te'o -- one of the best defenders this season in college football -- defended himself in an ESPN interview, saying there was no way he was part of a hoax involving a deceased girlfriend. ""I wasn't faking it,""  Te'o told ESPN's Jeremy Schaap in an off -camera interview highlighted on the network Friday night. ""I wasn't part of this."" For days, the linebacker has been the subject of ridicule after reports surfaced that the girlfriend he'd said died this fall of leukemia never existed. Te'o rose to national prominence by leading Notre Dame's Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season, amassing double-digit tackle games and becoming the face of one of the best defenses in the nation. As he and his team excelled, Te'o told interviewers in September and October that his grandmother and girlfriend -- whom he described as a 22-year-old Stanford University student -- had died within hours of each other. The twin losses inspired him to honor them with sterling play on the field, Te'o said. He led his team to a 20-3 routing of Michigan State after he heard the news. Opinion: Te'o tale a mirror to our gullibility? ""I miss 'em, but I know that I'll see them again one day,"" he told ESPN. He was second in the Heisman Trophy race and led his team to the championship game, losing to Alabama. The fairy tale story ended Wednesday when sports website Deadspin published a piece dismissing as a hoax the existence of Te'o's girlfriend and suggesting he was complicit. Te'o released a statement Wednesday saying he was a victim of a hoax, but Friday night was the first time he publicly addressed the issue. ""When (people) hear the facts, they'll know,"" Te'o told ESPN. ""They'll know that there is no way that I could be part of this."" After a 2Â½-hour interview, veteran sports reporter Schaap said Te'o's story sounded convincing. ""He made a very convincing witness to his defense,"" Schapp said on ESPN. ""He answered all my questions pretty convincingly. If he is making up his side of the story, he is a very convincing actor."" The twisted tale of Te'o and the mystery woman named Lennay Kekua has left many with questions. Te'o sought to answer many of them Friday night. Timeline: How the story unfolded . Who created the hoax? Te'o told Schaap that the hoax was created by a man named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo and that Te'o had no role in creating the hoax. He said Tuiasosopo contacted him Wednesday via Twitter and explained that he created the hoax and he apologized, Schaap said. Tuiasosopo told Te'o he created the hoax along with another man and a woman, ESPN reported. CNN has not seen the tweets Te'o allegedly got from Tuiasosopo. ""Two guys and a girl are responsible for the whole thing,"" Te'o said, according to ESPN. CNN went to the California home of Tuiasosopo, where Titus Tuiasosopo, Ronaiah's father, declined to comment. ""But just wait, (the truth) will all come out,"" he said. ""God knows our character. People are going to say what people are going to say."" Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was named in the Deadspin article. Notre Dame's investigation into the matter confirmed that two men and a woman, including Tuiasosopo, were behind the hoax, a source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The source requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. A woman pretending to be Kekua called Te'o last month, claiming she had faked her death last fall because she was afraid of drug dealers, the source said. Following that December 6 conversation, Te'o went to his coaches with the story, which spurred Notre Dame to hire outside investigators to look into it. The investigation began the day after Christmas, and the results were presented January 4, days before the national championship game that Te'o's team lost. Who's who on the Internet? Who knows . Why did relatives say they had met her? In September and October, when the story of Te'o and his girlfriend received a lot of press attention, several stories appeared about how they met. One in October by Indiana's South Bend Tribune, the newspaper of Notre Dame's hometown, said the couple met at a football game in Palo Alto, California, in 2009. Te'o's father was quoted in the article saying they exchanged phone numbers and a love affair began. On Friday, Te'o said he lied to his father about meeting Kekua because he was embarrassed to tell his family he was in love with a woman he'd never met. The hoax over social media . ""I knew that -- I even knew that it was crazy that I was with somebody that I didn't meet,"" he told ESPN. ""And that alone, people find out that this girl who died I was so invested in, and I didn't meet her as well."" The lie he told his father led his family to tell reporters that Te'o had met his girlfriend, he told ESPN. The calls from the woman continued after December 6, but Te'o did not answer, Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick told reporters this week. At that point, Te'o confided in his parents and at least two friends and a girlfriend he had at the time about the calls, the source with knowledge of the matter told CNN. He and the ""real"" girlfriend have since ended that relationship. The Heisman Trophy was awarded December 8, and Te'o continued to make comments about losing his girlfriend. In the ESPN interview, Te'o said he wasn't fully convinced it was a hoax until Wednesday, Schaap said. Woman says her picture was part of hoax, though she didn't know Te'o . One woman whose photos were part of the hoax says that she was exploited herself. Donna Te'i told CNN earlier this week that she'd never talked to Te'o, nor did she have any involvement in the online plot involving the Notre Dame player and the woman he believed was his girlfriend. But the 26-year-old woman is part of the story. She was identified in pictures linked to a Twitter account using the name uilanirae, which has since been taken down, as the sister of the apparently nonexistent girlfriend known as Lennay Kekua, according to Deadspin. Donna Te'i acknowledged she was portrayed in the online images as Kekua's sister, but not of her own accord. Her father, Luteru Lou Te'i -- who spoke to CNN on Saturday, as his daughter was not at home -- said these pictures were illicitly taken from the Facebook page of another of his daughters. Donna Te'i herself met Ronaiah Tuiasosopo -- the Samoan-American, like her, who Mantei Te'o said created the hoax -- years ago through an acquaintance, and they came into contact again following the August death of her boyfriend, former University of Southern California football standout Fred Matua. Mutua was eulogized by Ronaiah's father, the Rev. Titus Tuiasosopo, according to Luteru Lou Te'i, who lives with his daughter in Carson, California. At some point, pictures of Donna Te'i became part of the scheme. Luteru Lou Te'i, 51, said his daughter believes Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was responsible, since he called her later to apologize for using her image. ""I ... don't know what his motive was, but (Tuiasosopo) admitted to her that he did it,"" said Luteru Lou Te'i, noting this conversation happened ""way before the story broke."" Donna Te'i has been ""distraught"" since Deadspin first ran with the story, according to her father. Ronaiah Tuiasosopo and his family have not responded to CNN requests for comment on this and other allegations tied to the hoax. CNN's Stan Wilson, Sara Weisfeldt, Susan Candiotti, Ross Levitt, Phil Gast and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","NEW: A woman whose picture is tied to the scheme says she was exploited .

"(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating whether it was an extreme case of bullying that led to the death of a 17-year-old student in Argentina, after she was attacked by two women and another girl last week. Naira Cofreces died Sunday of multiple injuries, including bruising to the left side of her brain, officials said. ""First there was a verbal altercation and then she was kicked, punched and Naira's head was smashed against a wall,"" Judge Maria Laura Durante told Telam, the Argentine state news agency. The judge also said this is a case of ""aggravated homicide because there might've been premeditation."" Officials say the teen was attacked last Wednesday at about 10 p.m., after leaving the night school she attended in the city of JunÃ­n, about 260 kilometers (161 miles) west of Buenos Aires. Her attackers, ages 17, 22 and 29, were waiting for her after school. The two younger ones were her classmates. All three have been arrested and charged with aggravated homicide, authorities said. ""There's no clear motive. We have testimony that suggests the motive could've been another girl or because they (the victim and her friends) acted as if they were more beautiful than the rest and dressed better than them,"" Durante told Telam. A close friend of Cofreces told CNN affiliate Channel 9 the dispute started over differences that the victim and her alleged attackers had over looks and demeanor. ""She (one of the attackers) would tell her that she had a snobby face, an old woman's face, that she thought she was more beautiful than her and that she walked as if she were a model. That's how the whole problem started,"" said the friend, who was not identified because she's a minor. Cofreces went home after the attack, but was taken to Agudos General Hospital the following morning. ""She came the day after she was beaten up, we did a tomography and discovered a big hematoma on the left side of her brain, so we decided to operate,"" Dr. Carlos Garbe told Telam. A new tomography revealed more bruising of the brain. leading to a second surgery. ""After the second surgery, she continued to show complications which worsened until she died,"" Garbe said. Cofreces was pronounced dead Sunday night, four days after the attack. The incident has caused a public outcry in Argentina. Nestor Ribet, education undersecretary for the Buenos Aires Province, says he has sent counselors to JunÃ­n to work with students and their families at the school where the attack took place. ""We're talking about the death of a 17-year-old child. Nobody can explain why this happened,"" Ribet told Telam. ""There is really nothing that can explain this.""","Two of Cofreces' alleged attackers were her classmates, officials say .

"(CNN) -- ""22 Jump Street"" wholeheartedly embraces the sequel formula, and critics couldn't be happier. As the follow-up to 2012's blockbuster comedy ""21 Jump Street,"" ""22 Jump Street"" essentially rehashes everything about its predecessor but does so in a self-referential way that doesn't sacrifice humor. It helps that the original team is back: Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have returned to the helm, and stars Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are once again playing a pair of hilariously ineffective undercover cops who report to an irritated Ice Cube. Really, the only thing that's changed is that Tatum's Jenko and Hill's Schmidt are going undercover at a local college instead of a high school. But for once, sticking to the formula has worked. ""22 Jump Street is damn funny, sometimes outrageously so,"" praises Rolling Stone's Peter Travers. ""It laughs at its own dumb logic and invites us in on the fun."" Somehow, the movie ""steers blessedly clear of common sequel traps, even while brazenly committing so many of the form's sins,"" says The Washington Post's Ann Hornaday. ""The truth is, the old-married-couple dynamic between the two men is still funny, especially in the deft hands of Hill and Tatum, who have built a comic chemistry worthy of Hope and Crosby â€” or at least Lucy and Ethel."" The leading comic duo were also irresistible to New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, who believes that the movie ""still tickles a comedy sweet spot partly because both actors are naturally likable and seem to be having a good time."" The only thing that seemed truly worn out were some of the jokes about sexuality, observes Village Voice critic Stephanie Zacharek. Part of the plot involves Jenko and Schmidt going their separate ways for a while as they fall into different social circles on campus, leading to ""numerous homoerotic references to this fading friendship, but only in a 'Totally yankin' your chain, bro!' way,"" Zacharek says. ""It's there that '22 Jump Street' wobbles off the rails. ... The recurring 'gay, not-gay' jokes are neither particularly funny nor insightful, and they push the movie slightly out of whack. ... (But) '22 Jump Street' isn't uncharitable or mean-spirited; at worst, it's just confused."" Despite those flaws, the sequel is projected to perform well at the box office this weekend, with observers betting on an opening of at least $50 million. And if you're seeing the movie this weekend, here's a tip from The Chicago Tribune's Michael Phillips: ""Be sure to hang around for the closing credits, which imagine all sorts of 'Jump Street' sequels to come, all of which look funnier than 'A Million Ways to Die in the West.'"" Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill's 'lucky' bromance . Review: '22 Jump Street' is a repeat .","""22 Jump Street"" is basically the same as ""21 Jump Street""
But critics are praising the comedy sequel for its smart approach .
The jokes about sexuality are a noticeable flaw, one reviewer says ."
"(CNN) -- When animal control officers were called to a Greenville, South Carolina, neighborhood to pick up a wandering pit bull on a cold Monday in December, they didn't expect a mystery to unfold. But inside a fold of the dog's collar, they found a wrinkled black-and-white photo. It had no name or date. A smiling man seated on a railing looks straight into the camera -- but, beyond that, the photo offers no clues. The friendly tan canine, now named Soldier because the man in the photo may be wearing a military uniform, was skinny but well-behaved, said Susan Bufano, community relations coordinator with Greenville County Animal Care. He was not neutered or microchipped. Bufano said the collar itself isn't old, which reduces the chances it was placed there long ago and forgotten. ""It's so bizarre,"" she said. ""Absolutely anything is possible."" After the photo was posted to the shelter's Facebook page, a few people tried to offer clues about the photo, but nothing substantial has surfaced. Bufano hopes a wider exposure will lead them to the owner, or at least help solve the mystery. ""This photo should mean something to somebody,"" Bufano said. Even if the owner isn't found, the dog is available for adoption. Because the shelter has limited space, it's possible that Soldier could be euthanized if he isn't adopted, Bufano said. Interest in Soldier makes that unlikely, she said Thursday. This isn't the first odd case the shelter has encountered. Years ago, Bufano said, a dog was found wandering the parking lot wearing a cape. Anyone with information about Soldier is encouraged to contact Greenville County Animal Care at petpr@greenvillecounty.org. Forgotten Challenger photos found .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- In the big drama this election year -- whether Republicans will take control of the Senate -- the answer may rest in the hands of women candidates. Especially after Tuesday's primaries. Women contenders grabbed headlines from a primary victory in Kentucky, where Democratic nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes emphatically told supporters: ""I am not an empty dress,"" to Oregon, where Republican hopeful and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby touted her own qualifications for Senate: ""I am a doctor, a mom."" And in Georgia, the retirement of a Republican senator drew an unexpectedly popular would-be Democratic replacement in Michelle Nunn, who boasted that ""Washington is going to learn a thing or two from our campaign."" Add these candidates to the list of vulnerable female senators in Louisiana, North Carolina and New Hampshire and it's clear the balance of power in the Senate could depend on how women candidates in both parties fare. 5 things we learned from Tuesday's primary . In no place is gender more at play than in Kentucky, where Grimes is running a fierce challenge to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""I am a strong Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker,"" Grimes told supporters Tuesday night. Grimes is already leaning way in -- using her gender to appeal to female voters, who make up more than half the Kentucky electorate. And she's playing up the fact that polls show 30-year Senate veteran McConnell is especially unpopular with women. Grimes connected to big donors, big hitters . On the eve of his Republican primary, we asked McConnell whether he suffered from a gender gap problem. ""We'll find out in November, won't we?"" McConnell said. ""I mean, the point is women in Kentucky have been treated just as badly in this environment as men have."" But McConnell's overt appeal to women belies that bravado. In his victory speech Tuesday, the most powerful Republican in the Senate spoke glowingly of both his late mother and his wife Elaine Chao, a former cabinet secretary under George W. Bush. And McConnell told the stories of three Kentucky women he said were hurt by President Barack Obama's health care law. Democrats' other big hope for picking up a GOP Senate seat is Michelle Nunn, daughter of veteran Sen. Sam Nunn, in Georgia. ""I believe that change is possible,"" she said in a speech on Tuesday. Gloves are off in marquee Senate battle . As for Republicans, Monica Wehby is a pediatric neurosurgeon hoping to unseat Democrat Jeff Merkley in Oregon, running as a political outsider. ""I'm not a career politician,"" Wehby said in a speech Tuesday night. Republicans are favored to pick up a Democratic seat in West Virginia with Shelley Moore Capito, but even if she loses to Democrat Natalie Tennant, either way the state would elect its first female senator. There are currently 20 women senators, a record but still far from representative of the country, which is more than 50% female. 2014 could mark another historic number.

"(CNN) -- It seemed innocent enough: two famous men running into each other at a public event by coincidence, exchanging pleasantries and small talk, and posing for a selfie later posted on Twitter. But the meeting between ""House of Cards"" actor Kevin Spacey and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto this month in Cancún is at the center of a political controversy in Mexico that caught both the Hollywood star and Mexican government by surprise. Spacey, who plays a president on the Netflix series, posted the selfie with the Mexican leader on May 7. ""1 President is real. W/Pres Nieto in #Mexico. Good meeting a man also making progress in 1st year in office. @EPN"" was the caption on Twitter. The selfie was taken at Tianguis Turistico, an international tourism conference held in the beach resort of Cancún. Tour operators and tourism entrepreneurs and companies from around the world as well as Mexican officials and celebrities attend the event organized by the Mexican government. The Mexican President also posted a picture with Spacey on his Twitter account, although it was a more formal, sit-down meeting, with the two men talking and looking at each other. ""It was nice to be with actor @KevinSpacey, special guest of #TianguisTuristico, last night in Cancun,"" Peña Nieto wrote on his Twitter account May 7. ""To fans of @HouseofCards, I'm sorry, I can't give away details of the third season,"" the President jokingly wrote later. He also retweeted Spacey's selfie. Controversy erupted May 12 after Mexican columnist Salvador García Soto wrote in the 24 Horas newspaper that Spacey had been paid $8 million by the Mexican federal government. Political analysts immediately started questioning whether the meeting had truly been ""a coincidence"" or a shameless, self-promotional ploy by the President, paid for by Mexican taxpayers. Spacey was the first to react to the storm of criticism in Mexico. ""Story about Mex Gov paying 8m or any amount for selfie not true! Was In Mex for Tourist Board event. Meeting President not planned at all,"" Spacey tweeted May 16. He had earlier tweeted that his endorsement of Peña Nieto was not necessarily personal. ""I guess nobody got the joke. I was in character as Francis Underwood in House of Cards, not myself! I don't know jack about Mexican politics,"" Spacey said. CNN reached out to Mexican officials for comment. In an e-mail, Rodolfo López Negrete, chief executive officer of the Mexico Tourism Board, said that Spacey was paid to appear at the tourism event but not to pose with the President. ""Kevin Spacey's participation at the Tianguis Turistico was part of the event's general program. The Tianguis is self-financed through the sale of booths and entry fees. We also have sponsors through which tourism service providers finance some costs,"" López Negrete wrote. López Negrete didn't specify the amount Spacey was paid for his appearance but said the entire event had a cost of between 40 million and 45 million pesos (almost $3.1 million to $3.5 million). This and other explanations have done little to silence criticism in Mexico. A reader of 24 Horas, the newspaper that originally reported the payment, cynically asked his fellow Mexicans to pay their taxes. ""Let's not stop in complying with our fiscal obligations,"" the reader wrote, ""so that Peña the Clown can keep on paying his favorite actors. Imbecile. So many children on the streets and families without a job and he's spending Mexico's money in his (expletive) hobbies.""","Kevin Spacey meets Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto at tourism conference in Cancún .

"Atlanta (CNN)  -- Ernest Green hit the roads of the segregated South as a teen in the 1950s, using a travel guide that pointed out safe havens where African-Americans could eat and stay. The pamphlet promoted vacation without humiliation. On that trip in the 1950s, Green journeyed the 1,000 miles from Arkansas to Virginia with his mother, aunt and brother to attend his sister's college graduation. His aunt and mother used the travel guide to plot the entire trip. ""It was one of the survival tools of segregated life,"" Green says. Ernest Green became a symbol of the civil rights movement as one of the Little Rock Nine, a group of African-American students who braved death threats and harassment to become the first black students at Central High School in the Arkansas state capital in 1957. A man with the same last name, but no relation, was behind the African-American travel guide, an institution among black families as they traveled the nation at a time when many businesses wouldn't allow them inside. Victor H. Green was a mail carrier in New York City's predominantly black neighborhood of Harlem. He was tall, handsome and personable. In 1932, he came up with the idea for a travel book to prevent African- Americans from being humiliated, especially in front of their families. ""The Green Book,"" as it was known, was first published in 1936. Initially, it pointed out friendly restaurants and hotels in New York. It eventually expanded to include everything from lodging and gas stations to tailor shops and doctor's offices across the nation, as well as in Bermuda, Mexico and Canada. ""Through this guide a number of white business places have come to value and desire your patronage,"" Victor Green wrote in the 20th anniversary of his travel guide. ""Without your support (the guide) could not have remained in business and no doubt would have failed as others did. ""We trust, in the future, your faith will be justified as in the past; and in so doing, you will tell others of your satisfaction."" In the guide's early years, Victor Green would travel to most locations his guide touted. But as the book expanded and he got older, he couldn't visit every spot. In 1949, the Green Book -- officially called ""The Negro Travelers' Green Book"" -- noted Wrigley Field in Chicago as a great place to stop. The book especially recommended the town of Robbins, Illinois, for being ""owned and operated by Negroes."" In Boise, Idaho, Hotel California got a thumbs up. Susan Sessions Rugh is the author of ""Are We There Yet?"" a book about how the road trip became part of the American lexicon after World War II. She says African-Americans had a much different experience than white travelers because they ""were not free to travel throughout the nation,"" especially in the segregated South. ""They wanted to educate themselves and their children, and they had a desire to see the country and go on vacation just like anyone who was white. And so they set about doing that,"" she says. ""To know where to stay, they could consult the Green Book."" Cotten Seiler, an associate professor of American studies at Dickinson College who has written extensively about automobiles and American society, adds that the Green Book steered African-Americans ""to these little oases for people of color."" ""It gives us a history of what we might call 'driving while black,' "" Seiler says. History had largely forgotten about the Green Book. Then came author and playwright Calvin Alexander Ramsey. He'd never heard of the book until the funeral of a family friend in Georgia about a decade ago. An older relative, coming from New York, asked him, ""Do I need a Green Book?"" ""I said, 'What's the Green Book?' ... and that kind of sent me on a search."" Ramsey's play, ""The Green Book,"" debuted last year in Washington and featured former NAACP head Julian Bond as Victor Green. Ramsey also wrote a children's book, ""Ruth and the Green Book,"" about the perils a Chicago family faced while traveling to Alabama in 1952 to visit a grandmother. The family was welcomed at Esso gas stations, which sponsored the Green Book. ""People were traveling but they were still having difficulties,"" Ramsey says, adding that his works are a tribute to Victor Green for helping African-Americans navigate their first American road trips. Ramsey recently read his children's book to a group of fifth graders at an Atlanta school for Black History Month. He encouraged the children to never forget the past -- and to keep on journeying across the country. The Green Book eventually stopped being published in the 1960s, following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, which outlawed forms of discrimination, including racial segregation. Unlike most businessmen, Victor Green had always looked forward to the day his business would no longer be relevant. ""There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published,"" he wrote in his foreword in 1949. ""That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. ""It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication, for then we can go wherever we please, and without embarrassment.""","Travel guide, known as the ""Green Book,"" helped African-Americans travel nation .

"(EW.com) -- Let me put my cards on the table. I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching ""Creature Double Feature"" smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah. There was something about seeing these behemoths stomp Tokyo to dust that made me absolutely giddy: the primal doomsday terror of a beast created by A-bomb radiation, the model-shop ingenuity, the laughable man-in-a-rubber-suit campiness. It's been 16 years since Hollywood nearly soured that love affair, thanks to Roland Emmerich's 1998 atrocity. And I was hopeful that the splashy new 3-D reboot might rekindle the old flame. Unfortunately, Gareth Edwards' ""Godzilla"" feels like two movies Scotch-taped together. In one, Bryan Cranston plays a nuclear engineer with a tragic past who's racing to expose the truth about a series of seismic anomalies, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is his estranged soldier son, and Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins are a pair of exposition-spouting scientists trying to keep straight faces while talking about electromagnetic pulses and mankind's hubris. In the other, mammoth CG beasts knock the snot out of one another. Only one of these movies is any good. Thankfully, it's the monster one. Edwards, whose only previous film was 2010's low-budget ""Monsters,"" has been given a quick call-up to the majors with the reported $160 million ""Godzilla."" He doesn't seem too interested in his actors â€” they're more plodding than their reptilian costars and you don't care about a single one of them â€” but Edwards does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem. Taking a cue from ""Jaws,"" he wisely delays Godzilla's appearance, building suspense. In movies like these, it's all about the slow tease and the big reveal. As an appetizer, though, he gives us a pair of ''MUTOs'' (massive unidentified terrestrial organisms) â€” a male and female duo of giant, Giger-esque creatures with sleek pincer jaws that resemble humongous staple removers. The MUTOs, who arrive on the scene after leveling a Japanese nuclear reactor, care about two things: feeding on the radiation that created them and mating with each other in...San Francisco of all places. Tony Bennett would be proud. When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ''restore balance,'' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new. As big as a Sheraton and with a shriek that rumbles your insides, he appears beefier and meaner than you remember. But looks can be deceiving. Godzilla is humanity's only hope for destroying the MUTOs. Or as Watanabe's Dr. Serizawa says, ''Let them fight!'' And fight they do, in an epic clash that turns the Bay Area to rubble. Unlike last year's disappointing Pacific Rim, Godzilla actually shows us its monsters without a scrim of rain and a cloak of darkness. And the thrill of the film is getting the chance to fetishize their sheer size and physicality as they rip through power lines and demolish buildings with their lashing tails. In its handful of moments like these, ""Godzilla"" almost makes you feel like a kid again. Grade: B- . See the original story at EW.com.

"New York (CNN) -- A man whose murder conviction was overturned after he served 22 years in prison will receive a $6.4 million settlement from New York City, according to attorneys on the case. David Ranta, 60, who was imprisoned for the killing of a Brooklyn rabbi in 1990, was granted the settlement this week before his claim against the city was even filed in federal court, his attorney Pierre Sussman said Thursday. New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer settled the pre-litigation claim for wrongful conviction and imprisonment in response to a $150 million claim that Ranta filed last year, according to a statement from his office. ""After a review process and negotiations, my office was able to reach a settlement with Mr. Ranta that is in the best interests of all parties and closes the door on a truly regrettable episode in our City's history,"" Stringer said in a prepared statement. According to New York City law, the comptroller has the authority to settle claims against the city, the statement said. ""It is such a significant case,"" said Sussman, who said he believes the quick settlement is a testament to the weakness of the city's defense against the suit. ""This is the first time in an exoneration case that a settlement has been reached without the claim making it to the city's law department,"" he added. Sussman said Ranta still plans a lawsuit against the state. Ranta was freed from prison in March 2013 but suffered a heart attacked the day after his release. His attorney said Ranta looks forward to the stability the settlement will provide as he continues to get medical treatment for his heart condition. Ranta's second-degree murder conviction stemmed from the 1990 killing of Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger during a diamond heist. A witness two decades later came forward and said he had been coached to identify Ranta from a police lineup. After an investigation, prosecutors recommended that Ranta's conviction be tossed out. Since Ranta's trial, another man's widow has identified her now-dead husband as the killer; a onetime jail inmate has said he made up statements about Ranta to boost his own fortunes; and the man who, as a boy, picked him out of a lineup has come forward to say a detective coached him. Prosecutors have determined the evidence underpinning Ranta's conviction ""has been degraded to such an extent"" that it would no longer support the verdict, John O'Mara, the deputy district attorney in charge of Brooklyn's conviction integrity unit, said in March 2013. When detectives questioned him, Ranta initially denied any involvement in the killing, but he then acknowledged knowing Alan Bloom, a man facing trial on his own robbery charges who gave Ranta's name to police, according to prosecutors. He later admitted he had been near the scene of the crime and that he knew his friends had planned a holdup. Then he admitted he had been involved in planning the diamond heist, acted as the lookout and had seen Bloom and another jailed witness, Dmitry Drikman, with a gun. Ranta insists that he was framed by police and that detectives coached the witnesses against him. ""No way that happened,"" said Louis Scarcella, one of the detectives who investigated the case. He told CNN last year that Ranta admitted his involvement in the heist attempt and that he stands by the arrest. Upon Ranta's exoneration in March 2013, his attorney told CNN, ""The detective work that was done on this case was at best shoddy and at worst criminal. And I don't use that word lightly. But when a closer examination is done of the detective work ... it becomes clear that there were so many leads that weren't followed, there were so many notes that weren't taken and just a general lack of attention to an investigation that required nothing but close scrutiny of the scene, of witnesses and so forth. That didn't happen."" About 50 cases in the District Attorney's Criminal Investigation Unit handled by Scarcella came under review after Ranta's second-degree murder conviction was tossed out. Scarcella retired from the New York Police Department before the investigations began. CNN's Laura Ly, Mary Snow, Matt Smith, Catherine E. Shoichet and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.","David Ranta served nearly 22 years for a Brooklyn rabbi's killing .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Never wear your makeup to bed,"" implore the beauty editors. But Dolly Parton was never one for following conventional advice on looking good. Dolly Parton has no plans to step out of the spotlight: "" I hope to just fall over one day in the middle of a song."" She sets her own standards, from her striking sculptured hair to the bright lashings of eye shadow caked on a face that she has admitted in the past owes a lot to modern surgery. ""I know I'm a bit over-exaggerated; I wear too much makeup, too much hair,"" the singer-songwriter and theme park co-owner told CNN's Revealed. And it's not just for the stage or public appearances. The truth, Dolly told CNN, is that when she's in California or New York ""where anything could happen"" she goes to bed with her makeup on. ""I think I'm not going to wash my face until morning, and then I'll clean it off and I'll put it on in case I have to get up in the middle of the night,"" she said. ""If I go out in public, people expect me to look a certain way and if you say 'There's Dolly' or whoever it may be, you expect to see them in the way that you see them, the way you know them.""  Watch Dolly Parton on a photo shoot for a magazine cover » . Dolly's dedication to her image has helped push the small town country girl up the ranks from gifted singer and songwriter to international icon complete with her own Dolly-branded theme park. Parton introduced herself to the country music charts in 1967, at the age of 21, with her debut album ""Hello, I'm Dolly."" A successful partnership with Porter Wagoner, the host of the television show of the same name, put her on the national stage. Forty albums have followed, including a succession of No. 1 hits, awards and high-profile performances on television and film. ""She is so full of life and spirit and she loves playing jokes on people and she likes to keep you on your toes, but musically I have never met anyone who can walk out on stage and consistently sing as in tune and proper and right as Dolly Parton does,"" her sometime duet partner Kenny Rogers told CNN. She recently wrote the score for ""9 to 5: The Musical,"" a stage version of the 1980 comedy ""Nine to Five,"" a film she not only starred in but for which she also composed the award-winning title song. The musical was nominated for four Tony Awards this year, but failed to win any. After a disappointing four-month run, the curtains are set to close on September 6. Perennially upbeat, Parton later said she ""couldn't have asked for a better experience on my first Broadway show."" In 1986, Parton's megastar status was confirmed with the opening of her own theme park ""Dollywood."" In 2001, a water park, ""Dollywood's Splash Country,"" opened next door. Both are in Pigeon Forge, a small town at the foothills of Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park where Parton famously grew up as one of 12 children crammed into a three-room cabin. Dolly is without doubt the town's most successful daughter. Every year, for the past 24 years, locals have lined the streets to wave and cheer as Parton rides atop the leading float in the Dolly Parton Annual Parade of Pigeon Forge. This year was no different. Her float was transformed into a snowy scene, complete with fir trees and a log cabin from which she waved at well-wishers, many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with her photo.  See photos of the 2009 Dolly Parade » . One man even had her image etched onto his back in a large tattoo. ""It's just the magic she brings you and that heart-warming feeling. The music just blows you away, blows my mind away, I just love it,"" he told CNN. The locals' love of Dolly is hardly surprising. She's a one-woman PR machine for Pigeon Forge, and through ""Dollywood"" is Sevier County's biggest employer. You don't want to upset your boss. Many members of the extended Parton family are on the payroll at ""Dollywood,"" and entertain the park's 2.5 million visitors when the main attraction can't be there. One of them is Bill Owens, her uncle, who is credited with taking the young Dolly Parton out of the Great Smoky Mountains and into the big smoke. ""I took Dolly to Nashville when she was very young,"" Owens told CNN. ""I've worked with her since she was 10 years old, when I heard her singing. We'd take the wagon back and forth to the radio stations and the minute she graduated we was (sic) gone the same day to Nashville."" It would be easy to say she never looked back, but that isn't true; she's always looking back. ""I always thought when I was young, if I ever made it -- and I hoped I would, and dreamed that I would -- I thought I would love to be able to come home and do something special to honor my family,"" she said. ""You always want your people to be proud of what you have accomplished."" Parton told CNN she's accomplished everything that she set out to do, and she has no plans to ever step out of the spotlight. ""I don't want to retire, I hope to just fall over one day in the middle of a song and that's how I want to go -- with a smile on my face hopefully.""

"(CNN) -- While a Russian-flagged vessel remains stuck in Antarctic ice, recently discovered photo negatives remind us this cold continent has been stopping explorers in their tracks for a century. New Zealand's Antarctic Heritage Trust found the negatives in an expedition hut from Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's failed 1912 quest to become the first man to reach the South Pole. The photos were taken during Ernest Shackleton's 1914-1917 Ross Sea Party, another failed exploration whose members were forced to live in Scott's hut after their ship blew out to sea. The cellulose nitrate negatives were found clumped together in a small box in the darkroom of Herbert Ponting, Scott's expedition photographer, the trust said. The trust took the negatives to New Zealand, where they were separated to reveal 22 images. Many images were damaged, but the trust says it was able to recognize landmarks around McMurdo Sound. It's unknown who took the photos. Scott was a British explorer who became famous during what historians call the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. He arrived at the South Pole in January 1912 to discover his rival, Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, had beaten him to the spot by an estimated 33 days. Scott and several comrades died in March 1912 during the return journey. Several years later, Shackleton attempted the first land crossing of Antarctica from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea via the South Pole, according to the Museum Victoria website. Ten members of the group were stranded when their ship, the Aurora, blew out to sea and they were forced to live in Scott's hut. Three men died before they were rescued in 1916. Nigel Watson, Antarctic Heritage Trust's executive director, said the new photos are a historic treasure. ""It's an exciting find and we are delighted to see them exposed after a century,"" Watson said.","Negatives discovered in explorer Robert Scott's 1912 expedition hut .

"Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- The cause of a mysterious illness that has claimed the lives of more than 60 Cambodian children has been determined, medical doctors familiar with the investigation told CNN on Wednesday. A combination of pathogens, disease-causing micro-organisms, is to blame for the illness, the World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Cambodian Ministry of Health, has concluded, the doctors said. The pathogens include enterovirus 71, which is known to cause neurological disease; streptococcus suis, which can cause infections like bacterial meningitis in people who have close contact with pigs or with pork products; and dengue, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The inappropriate use of steroids, which can suppress the immune system, worsened the illness in a majority of the patients, the doctors said. The World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to advise health care workers to refrain from using steroids in patients with signs and symptoms of the infection, which include severe fever, encephalitis and breathing difficulties. While not all the microorganisms were present in each patient, doctors concluded the illness was caused by a combination of them and worsened by steroid use. The WHO sources did not want to be identified because the results of the health organization's investigation have not yet been made public. ""I'm very confident for the reason of the epidemic,"" said Dr. Phillipe Buchy, chief of virology at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia and one of the doctors who cracked the case. ""The first thing that goes through your mind is, is this one of the usual suspects you haven't detected before?"" said Dr. Arnaud Tarantola, chief of epidemiology and public health at the Institut Pasteur. ""If it is, has it mutated, or changed in a way that it causes more severe disease? Or is it something completely new?"" On the steroids issue, Tarantola said, ""When you have a dying child, you try to use what you have at hand, and they were right to try that."" But, he acknowledged, ""from the cases we reviewed, almost all of the children died, and almost all of them had steroids."" Parents face anxious wait over mystery illness . ""I think we can close the case and move ahead asking different questions,"" Buchy said. ""Not what is the illness, but now, how long has the virus been circulating? What is the extent of the circulation of the virus? How many mild diseases are we missing? That's the next step."" Over the past four months, doctors at Kantha Bopha Children's Hospitals in Phnom Penh have been faced with the mysterious syndrome, which kills children so fast that nearly all of those infected with it die within a day or two of being admitted to the hospital. Dr. Beat Richner, head of the children's hospitals -- which cared for 66 patients affected by the illness, 64 of whom died -- said that no new cases of the illness had been confirmed since Saturday. Other hospitals in the country have reported similar cases, but far fewer than the children's hospitals in the capital, which are the most popular. In the last hours of their life, the children experienced a ""total destruction of the alveola(e) in the lungs,"" Richner said. Alveolae are the air sacs where oxygen enters the bloodstream. Most of the children who have contracted the illness have come from the south of the country, though health officials cannot find what is known as a cluster -- a lot of cases coming from one specific area. By June 29, the WHO had been contacted and Cambodian officials were scrambling to instruct health providers across the country to spread information about the illness as quickly as possible. Officials search for clues in disease killing Cambodia's children . The WHO and the Cambodian authorities' announcement of the situation drew criticism from Richner, who said they were ""causing unnecessary panic."" The WHO said the unexplained nature of the outbreak obliged it to communicate the information. Over the weekend, lab tests linked enterovirus 71 (EV71) to some of the cases. But the tests didn't solve the whole puzzle and health officials continued their investigations, noting the detection of other elements like streptococcus suis and dengue. The link to EV71 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness, as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections and no vaccine is available. In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy. But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. Outbreaks of the enterovirus ""occur periodically in the Asia-Pacific region,"" according to the CDC. Brunei had its first major outbreak in 2006. China had an outbreak in 2008. Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC. ""It looks like (EV71) has emerged strongly, probably because it hadn't circulated with the same intensity in the past years,"" Tarantola said. Reported cases of streptococcus suis have risen significantly in recent years, notably in Southeast Asia, according to a paper that appeared last year in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The rainy season in Cambodia, which lasts from May to October, is a key problem in trying to control diseases like dengue. Because of a lack of indoor plumbing in many homes, people collect rainwater in vats, creating potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In Cambodia, as with many places around the world, parents first try treating their child at home. If that doesn't work, they typically then go to a local clinic. A hospital visit, which often involves a long trip, is a last resort. Mystery illness claiming dozens of lives .

"(CNN) -- An Afghan designer and former refugee has developed a low-cost, wind-powered mine detonating device inspired by the toys he played with as a child. Massoud Hassani's Mine Kafon is composed almost entirely from bamboo and biodegradable plastics, with a skeletal structure of spiky plungers that resembles a giant spherical tumbleweed from another planet. At 70 kilograms, Hassani says his invention is light enough to be propelled by a normal breeze, while still being heavy and big enough - 190cm in diameter - to activate mines as it rolls over them. According to the U.N., there are more than 110 million active mines scattered across 70 countries, with an equal number stockpiled around the world still waiting to be planted. Meanwhile, manual diffusion by trained mine-clearing experts remains the most common method of removal globally, according to the Landmine Monitor, an industry publication published by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. But this method can be prohibitively expensive - in some cases it costs thousands of dollars to clear just a single mine. By contrast, Hassani claims the Mine Kafon -- which includes a basic GPS tracking device used to record the area ""cleared"" by its tumbling path - costs as little as $40 to build. ""The core sphere that contains the GPS system is high enough from the ground to avoid damage from most anti-personnel mines,"" explained Hassani. The lengths of the spikes are based on the height of an adult's leg - because the kinds of mines that it is designed to clear are those that will take a leg off below the waist of an adult. ""So, as it moves the spikes get blown off, but the center stays intact,"" Hassani said. ""It can withstand up to four explosions before it loses too many of its legs to carry on."" As a young kid growing up in Afghanistan, Hassani did what children the world over do: made up games and created his own toys. ""One of them was a little rolling object that was carried by the wind,"" he recalled. ""We would race them against each other in the local fields. ""Sometimes, due to the presence of landmines, they would roll off into places that we weren't permitted to go."" After his father was killed in a rocket attack during the late 1980s, Hassani fled Afghanistan with his mother, brother and sisters. Living first in Uzbekistan, then traveling through central Asia and ending up four years later as a refugee in Holland, Hassani went on to study at the Design Academy in Eidenhoven. What started life as his final graduate design project has since undergone strength testing at the hands of the Dutch military. This year, a full-scale mock-up was tested in the deserts around Morocco and Hassani hopes to fundraise $100,000 so he can engineer the design to mass produced, industry standards. However, some are skeptical about Mine Kafon's chances of ever meeting the official International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) -- considered to be the minimum grade of delivery for responsible mine clearing operations. ""There are many citizens who live in mine-affected areas who carry out their own DIY clearances, and while this is noble it is also very dangerous,"" explained Adam Komorowski, head of operations at the UK-based Mine Advisory Group. ""For any mine clearing technology to be adopted by a serious mine action organization, it needs to conform to IMAS. ""As much as I welcome all new ideas -- and I think this is a nice concept with great potential to raise awareness and perhaps inspire other solutions -- I can't see it meeting those standards in anything like its current form,"" he said. Komorowski, who stresses that his assessment is based solely on what he has read and viewed online, believes that Hassani's creation is undermined by its dependence on the ""serendipity of random gusts"" -- making it a haphazard option in a field traditionally characterized by highly methodical techniques. ""Every square centimeter of land should be properly checked,"" he said. ""I'm also not convinced that the device can be relied upon to necessarily detonate every mine it crosses,"" said Komorowski, who argues that if a couple of its spikes are blown off during a clearance, then the holes in its structure could cause it to miss other mines as it rolls on. ""It looks to me that there is also a huge limitation in terms of terrain,"" he added. ""I can't see it working on hills or areas with dense vegetation."" Hassani says he is aware of these limitations, and claims to have a number of solutions in the pipeline. ""We are developing a remote-controlled model with a motor and a metal detector -- so that even if it fails to detonate a mine, it should map-out the presence of metal structures underneath,"" he said. Whether the Mine Kaffon can be engineered to overcome the criticisms of industry insiders like Komorowski, the strikingly-designed structure with its poetic symmetry has already brought the issue of landmine clearance to new audiences in the design world. It was recently showcased during Dutch Design Week and the Lodz Design Festival, and in March of next year will enjoy a run at New York's prestigious Museum of Modern Art. ""The design industry is perhaps too focused on tables and chairs,"" said Hassani. ""I think we can use our talents to find design-based solutions to more serious problems.""","Mine Kafon is a cheap, light, wind-powered mine detonating device .

"(CNN)  -- Police are investigating whether a North Carolina country road may have become the dumping ground for a serial killer, a man one woman believes could have given her a terrifying ride she will never forget. Jackie Nikelia Thorpe's body was found along Seven Bridges Road in August 2007. Since May 2005, the remains of five women have been found near Seven Bridges Road outside Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The road snakes northeast out of town into rural Edgecombe County. Rocky Mount Police Chief John Manley Jr. thinks the women's deaths are related. ""They seem to have some connection,"" he said. Lanessa Williams of Rocky Mount thinks she narrowly missed joining the ranks of the slain women, saying she is not sure whether a man who offered her a ride to a friend's house last year is responsible for their deaths. The longer the two drove, the more she felt a sense of danger, said Williams, 38. The man -- whom she described as thin and African-American, with a mustache and glasses -- rarely spoke and ""looked crazy."" ""He kept on going, and he rode through lights, and he wouldn't let me get out,"" she said. Eventually, her fears were confirmed when he demanded sex. ""He told me that if I didn't do what he wanted me to do, he was going to kill me and throw me in the river."" The man eventually stopped his truck in a dark wilderness area, she said. When he got out, she ran away. ""I laid in a ditch and stayed there for a while,"" she said. ""He was riding around looking for me."" Police are talking to Williams about her experience. She told authorities she noticed something strange: The large block letters saying ""Chevrolet"" on the back of the man's truck appeared to be painted on. All five of the slain women were African-American, authorities said. Four lived in Rocky Mount, about 55 miles northeast of the state capital, Raleigh. According to the Edgecombe County Sheriff's Office, they were: . • Melody Wiggins, 29, whose body was found May 29, 2005. • Jackie Nikelia Thorpe, 35, whose body was found August 17, 2007, behind a house on Seven Bridges Road. • Ernestine Battle, 50, whose remains were found in a wooded area on the road March 13, 2008. • Taraha Shenice Nicholson, 28, whose remains were discovered March 7, 2009. • Jarneice Latonya Hargrove, 31, whose skeletal remains were found June 29, 2009, in the woods off the road. Manley said it appears that the women ""suffered a similar death,"" but authorities are not divulging further details, including the cause of the deaths. Edgecombe County Sheriff James L. Knight is leading the investigation, working with Rocky Mount police and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. The three agencies have created a joint task force to investigate the unsolved killings. Knight is asking the public to be vigilant. ""Watch for vehicles if they are on a path or stop along that roadway, and give us a call."" Anyone with more information is asked to call the sheriff's office at (252) 641-7911.","Remains of five women found since 2005 along road outside Rocky Mount .

"Washington (CNN) -- What had been speculated before is now very public -- the United States and Israel differ on how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions. While both governments reject any possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran, they are clearly at odds over a possible agreement as soon as this week that would loosen economic sanctions against Tehran in exchange for a suspension of part of its nuclear program. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that he didn't know if what he called an interim agreement with Iran could be reached, but he said the goal was to ensure Iran gave up any ambitions to develop nuclear weapons. The negotiations would buy time so ""we could see if they could get to the end state of a position where we, the Israelis and the international community could say Iran's not seeking a nuclear weapon,"" Obama told business leaders at a Wall Street Journal forum. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects the agreement sought by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry at the international talks that resume Wednesday in Geneva. ""It's a bad deal -- an exceedingly bad deal,"" Netanyahu told CNN on Sunday. In a sign of the level of disconnect, the two countries were unable to agree on when Kerry would next travel to Israel for talks with Netanyahu on the Iranian issue. Netanyahu said Sunday that Kerry would meet with him on Friday, but Kerry told reporters Monday he would be unable to make the trip so soon. The split involves international diplomacy and domestic political issues in both countries, and comes as Kerry and Obama also push Netanyahu to work with Palestinian officials on forging a Middle East peace agreement. While Netanyahu and Obama have long acknowledged that close friends can disagree on issues, the direct language on both sides about their differences over a possible agreement with Iran shows the volatility of an issue with major regional and global implications. Iran insists it seeks to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes. The international community led by Israel, the United States, France and others demands that Tehran dismantle its ability to enrich uranium and other technology needed to develop nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Israel of wanting to ""torpedo"" an agreement on his country's nuclear program. ""We have reason to be suspicious of every move they make,"" he said at a news conference in Rome, adding that ""every move they make is about spreading tension and mistrust."" In the CNN interview Sunday, Netanyahu made clear he opposes lifting some sanctions now -- as called for under the agreement being negotiated -- without getting further concessions to ensure Iran would be unable to continue with uranium enrichment and other steps. ""I think you should not only keep up the pressure; I think you should increase the pressure, because it's finally working,"" Netanyahu said, labeling Iran's economy as close to paralysis. ""If you give it up now, when you have that pressure, and Iran doesn't even take apart, dismantle one centrifuge, what leverage will you have when you've eased the pressure?"" Russia: Now is time to make deal with Iran on nuclear program . At the same time, Netanyahu repeated his insistence that Israel ""always reserves the right to defend itself against any threat,"" which is diplomat-speak for a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities to stop development of a weapon. In Congress, some legislators, including conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats, share the concerns of Netanyahu and the powerful pro-Israel lobby in Washington. On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of six senators urged the administration to reject the proposed deal with Iran under discussion and only accept an agreement that better dismantles Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. In a letter to Kerry, the senators -- Democrats Chuck Schumer of New York, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, and Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine -- said any easing of sanctions ""should require Iran to roll back its nuclear program more significantly than now envisioned."" ""It is our belief that any interim agreement with the Iranians should bring us closer to our ultimate goal which is Iran without a nuclear weapons capability,"" the letter said. Obama later noted that the current sanctions put in place during his administration had forced Iran to the negotiating table because of economic contraction and frozen oil revenue. The interim deal under discussion in Geneva would ""open up the spigot a little bit"" on some of the frozen revenue while leaving in place the bulk of the most effective sanctions involving Iranian oil exports and banking, he said. ""Let's test the proposition over the next six months that we can resolve this in a diplomatic fashion while maintaining the central architecture of the sanctions,"" Obama continued. At the same time, he emphasized that all options, including military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, remained on the table as far as the United States was concerned. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that ""no daylight"" exists between the United States and Israel on the end goal of preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Kerry told reporters Monday that Netanyahu had ""every right in the world"" to state his position and defend his interests. A former U.S. senator, he noted that he had been a consistent supporter of ""our friends in Israel"" throughout his political career, and added that ""I can assure those friends and everybody watching this that nothing that we are doing here, in my judgment, will put Israel at any additional risk."" McCain calls Kerry 'a human wrecking ball' on Iran negotiations . The Geneva talks involve Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- as well as Germany in what is known as the P5+1 in diplomatic shorthand. According to a senior U.S. administration official, the talks are ""getting close"" to an interim deal with Iran that would prevent its nuclear program ""from advancing, and roll it back"" in key areas. The last round of negotiations broke up without a deal earlier this month, with each side blaming the other's reluctance. A key issue is enrichment of uranium, which is necessary at different levels for both power production and developing nuclear weapons. Iran says it has the right to enrich its own uranium, while the United States and its allies reject enrichment as a right of nations. ""We've long said that certainly we're open to discussing a peaceful program,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday, adding that no right to enrich uranium exists under existing international agreements. Obama met Tuesday with Senate leaders as well as the top Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Banking, Foreign Relations, Armed Services and Intelligence committees to provide an update on the P5+1 negotiations heading into the next round later this week. After the meeting, Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee told reporters he remains concerned that the United States and its allies might be about to give away too much to Iran, although he cautioned that an agreement this week in Geneva remains uncertain. ""I think you had some folks in the room who were satisfied. I think you had some folks in the room who were very unsatisfied,"" Corker said, adding that any Senate action on additional sanctions or other measures involving Iran would occur only after the coming Thanksgiving break. Last week, Kerry told a Senate panel that new sanctions imposed on Iran by Congress now ""could be viewed as bad faith"" in the negotiations. ""It could destroy the ability to be able to get agreement,"" he added, ""and it could actually wind up setting us back in dialogue that's taken 30 years to achieve."" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who was elected earlier this year, has made lifting tough economic sanctions against his country a priority. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's moderate diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Rouhani's visit culminated in a phone call with Obama and a meeting between Kerry and his Iranian counterpart. It was the first such high-level contact between the two nations since Iran's 1979 revolution. Iran recently signed a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency that agrees to give the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency access to long-unseen nuclear sites, including a heavy-water reactor in Arak. On Tuesday, British Prime Minister David Cameron called Rouhani to talk about this week's Geneva talks and other issues, Cameron's Downing Street office announced, adding it was the first such call in more than a decade. A Downing Street spokesman said on traditional condition of not being identified that ""both leaders agreed that significant progress had been made in the recent Geneva negotiations and that it was important to seize the opportunity presented by the further round of talks which get under way tomorrow."" ""The Prime Minister underlined the necessity of Iran comprehensively addressing the concerns of the international community about their nuclear program, including the need for greater transparency"" the spokesman said. CNN's Elise Labott, Jim Acosta, Jill Dougherty, Jason Seher, Ted Barrett, Jamie Crawford, Gabe LaMonica, Virginia Nicolaidis and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama says sanctions that brought Iran to the table will continue .

"London (CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's hair is no laughing matter. Not for the country's embassy employees in London, at least. Chalk it up to British humor when London barbers hung a poster in their shop of Kim and his signature hairstyle: a longer top, with the sides of his head shaved. The barbers don't consider that cut too appealing. So they used Kim's hair to try to drum up business for their M&M Hair Academy. ""Having a bad hair day?"" asks the sign, which features an image of Kim. ""15% off all men's haircuts through the month of April from Tuesday to Thursday."" The day after the sign went up, two men in suits entered the barber shop and confronted the manager, according to the manager's son, Karim Nabbach, 26. The two men weren't laughing. They told manager Mo Nabbach, ""We are North Koreans, and that is our leader on your poster,"" Karim Nabbach said. The two men apparently worked at the nearby North Korean Embassy. Mo Nabbach refused to give his name and told them to get a lawyer if they had a problem. He asked them to leave. The manager then reported the incident to police in case anything happened to his shop, Karim Nabbach said. Police acknowledged the dispute between the North Koreans and the barbers over what is -- and isn't -- bad hair. They even looked into the matter, but they found no crime. ""We have spoken to all parties involved, and no offence has been disclosed,"" a spokesman for Scotland Yard said. Calls to the North Korean Embassy in London for comment went unanswered. CNN's Lindsay Isaac and Carol Jordan contributed to this report from London. Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles.","Barbers Mo and Karim Nabbach put up a sign about Kim Jong Un's hair .

"(CNN) -- It's Christmas, but not as you know it: a new book released this week by Pope Benedict XVI looks at the early life of Jesus -- and debunks several myths about how the Nativity unfolded. In ""Jesus of Nazareth -- The Infancy Narratives,"" the pope says the Christian calendar is actually based on a blunder by a sixth century monk, who Benedict says was several years off in his calculation of Jesus' birth date. Read more: Egypt's Coptic Christians pick new pope . According to the pope's research, there is also no evidence in the Gospels that the cattle and other animals traditionally pictured gathered around the manger were actually present. He also debunks the claim that angels sang at the birth, a staple theme of Christmas carols. The book, which is being published in multiple languages in time for Christmas, is the third in a series by the pontiff. The previous two volumes dealt with Jesus' adult life and his public ministry. Read more: Jews did not kill Jesus, pope writes in new book . Alessandro Speciale, Vatican correspondent for the Religion News Service, told CNN the pope was not so much aiming to debunk myths as trying to show that the Jesus depicted in the Gospels is a real historical figure, who walked on earth and talked to people like anyone else. The pope also looks at scholarly studies of the Bible, some of which have indicated for decades that the traditionally accepted birth date for Jesus is wrong, Speciale said. Read more: Vatican newspaper calls fragment referring to Jesus' wife 'a fake' But while the book points out that the Gospels do not support the presence of animals at Jesus' birth -- a detail apparently added in later centuries -- the pope does not suggest they should be thrown out of the Nativity scene, Speciale said. ""The pope is a traditional man and he doesn't want people at all to change their traditions,"" Speciale said. The 176-page volume, which comprises a brief foreword, four chapters and an epilogue, traces Jesus' life up to the age of 12, when, according to the Gospels, he was presented by his parents in the Temple in Jerusalem, the Vatican said. The initial worldwide print run is more than a million copies, it said, with the book released this week across 50 countries in Italian, German, Croatian, French, English, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. In the coming months, the book will be translated into 12 more languages for publication in 72 countries in total, the Vatican added. The Vatican quotes Anthony Valle, a professor of theology, as saying the pope has been open to scientific inquiry in his own study of Jesus' life. ""The pope is not against the historical critical method at all, in fact, he uses it, he appreciates it,"" Valle said. He sees the pope as using ""both faith and reason"" in his efforts to bring the life of Jesus closer. Monsignor Philip Whitmore, who translated the book into English, said the pontiff used his writing to explore ""the inner meaning of the infancy narratives, showing how they pick up on Old Testament themes and develop them in new and unexpected ways."" ""The pope helps us to understand the world where Jesus was born. Caesar brought peace to the Roman Empire, but this tiny child brought something much more wonderful: God's peace, eternal life, an end to sin and death,"" Whitmore added. ""Anyone who's wondering why Christmas came to be such a great celebration in the West can find the answer right here. The pope explains how the birth of Jesus changed history forever.""

"(CNN) -- When Sadako Sasaki lay in her hospital bed sick with leukemia, she showed her father origami cranes from local school girls. ""When you fold 1,000 paper cranes, you will get well,"" her dad responded. Sadako was just 12. Hoping to get better, she began folding tiny origami cranes, using paper from get-well gifts and wrappers from medicine. She had survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Yet 10 years later, her fragile body suffered the effects of exposure to radiation. ""Please treasure the life that is given to you,"" Sadako said before her death on October 25, 1955. ""It is my belief that my small paper crane will enable you to understand other people's feelings, as if they are your own."" Sadako's death inspired a memorial in Japan's Hiroshima Peace Park, complete with a statue of her holding a golden crane. Now, one of her last origami cranes resides in a new memorial thousands of miles away, in the country that dropped the bomb. It was given to the Tribute WTC Visitor Center in New York by her aging brother. ""I thought if Sadako's crane is placed at Ground Zero, it will be very meaningful,"" says Masahiro Sasaki, in an education program produced by the tribute center and the Japan Society. ""Commonly, in Japan, the crane is regarded as a symbol of peace. But for us, in the Sasaki family, it is the embodiment of Sadako's life, and it is filled with her wish and hope."" ""I hope by talking about that small wish for peace, the small ripple will become bigger and bigger."" The delicate red crane, smaller than a fingernail, is on display at the center. Hanging near it are origami cranes that were placed on the fence around Ground Zero after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Another 10,000 cranes from families and colleagues of Japanese victims of 9/11 surround Sadako's. ""This little girl believed that the world could be made better if we all worked together,"" says Lee Ielpi, the co-founder of the center, whose grown son, Jonathan, was killed on September 11. ""It sends that beautiful message: Even in death, we're going to carry on that little girl's wish. ... I'm so tickled we can carry on her wish."" Meriam Lobel, the center's curator, says staffers were speechless when Masahiro Sasaki presented the gift. ""He lifted it out with this little, tiny tweezer and there was this beautiful red glistening crane,"" Lobel says. ""It was like a gem, like a little red ruby."" For Tsugio Ito, the symbolism of the crane holds special meaning. ""When the atomic bomb was dropped, I was exercising in the schoolyard at the elementary school. My brother was a student at the high school,"" he says in the center's educational program. He survived. His brother was killed in the bombing. Fast forward six decades. Ito's son was working for Fuji Bank in the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11. Kazushige Ito, 35, was one of 24 Japanese killed on 9/11. ""After September 11, we waited for him to call. One month passed, then two months, then I came to accept that perhaps this means he is gone,"" he told the center. ""Every time I visit the World Trade Center site, I wonder where my son was and where he suffered."" What happened that day only reinforces ""how important it is to have peace."" ""We must have peace,"" Ito says. ""I feel that stronger now than ever before."" Tom Johnson has been active on the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation ever since 9/11 when terrorists killed 2,976 people. His 26-year-old son, Scott, was among the victims. When he visits the center, he cherishes two items in particular: his son's death certificate, which lists ""homicide"" as his cause of death, and Sadako's origami crane. ""You have to derive some kind of message of meaning that will make the world heal,"" he says. Sadako's brother says the spirit of his sister lives on in the crane, ""because she had a heart of kindness."" He had five of her original cranes. He hopes to give the others away to museums on other continents. ""As a victim of war or a victim of terrorism, we share the same grief, and share the sense of duty to tell the stories to our children and our children's children,"" he says. ""Although the incidents were different, I hope we can help each other work for world peace from now on.""","Origami crane, made by girl that inspired a nation, is now on display at 9/11 center .

"(CNN) -- ""Pulp Fiction."" ""Django Unchained."" ""Gangs of New York."" ""Kill Bill."" ""Inglourious Basterds."" All are celebrated, popular films containing what some saw as excessive, graphic violence that glorified as much as humanized the bloodshed. And all have uber-producer Harvey Weinstein to thank for bringing them to the big screen. No more. Weinstein told CNN's Piers Morgan on Friday night that he can't in good good conscience advocate against on-screen violence while promoting movies that some claim revel in it. He promised to steer clear of such projects in the future. ""I can't do it,"" Weinstein said. ""I can't make one movie and say this is what I want for my kids, and then just go out and be a hypocrite."" The co-founder -- with his brother Bob -- of Miramax Films and now the Weinstein Co. spoke days after announcing plans for a movie that will be critical of the National Rifle Association. He stressed Friday that ""the movie will be entertaining,"" and not a documentary, characterizing it in the same vein as the classic ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" In this case, the Mr. Smith role -- of a U.S. senator who goes toe-to-toe with the NRA -- will be played by Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep. ""I know the power of what a movie can do,"" Weinstein said of his hopes for the project, ""because a movie can galvanize a country."" There's been a sharp backlash to this initiative from conservative news outlets to rock star/gun rights advocate Ted Nugent, who has speculated that the movie will backfire and end up bolstering the NRA. But Weinstein -- a well-known Democratic party donor -- says he isn't backing down. He characterized the resistance to gun control in the United States as a byproduct of the big business of the gun industry. The producer said he felt compelled to do more, and change his tack, after the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut -- some 20 minutes from where he and his children live -- left 20 young students and 6 others dead. Weinstein recalled calls to action to address gun violence in the wake of such mass shootings, only to have that momentum seemingly fade after a few days. He says he'd been among those who spoke out for such measures, even as some of his movies had their share of blood and gore. That won't happen any longer, Weinstein said. While he has no problems with real-to-life films like ""Lone Survivor,"" the current hit chronicling a team of Navy SEALs in Afghanistan, the producer vowed, ""I'm not going to make some crazy action movie just to blow up people and exploit people."" ""I've done a good job of feeling sympathetic for it over the years, but I've done also a good job of ignoring it and saying that's somebody else's fight,"" Weinstein said. He added, ""But It's in my backyard now. And as much as I want to ignore it, as much as I want to go on with my regular life, I can't shake it this time.""","Harvey Weinstein says he won't back ""crazy action (movies) to blow up ... and exploit people""

"(CNN) -- Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba made a successful defense of her Olympic 10,000 meters crown to round off the first night of track and field finals Friday. Dibaba used her famed finishing kick to pull clear of Kenyan pair Sally Kipyego and reigning world champion Vivian Cheruiyot with a 62 second last lap to win in 30 minutes 20.75 seconds. It was the third Olympic gold medal for Dibaba, who is a seven-time world champion and holds the world record for the 5,000m. Dibaba's teammate Werknesh Kidane pushed the pace after halfway in the grueling 25-lap event to whittle down the medal contenders to two Ethiopians and two Kenyans. Kidane paid for her efforts but an ever confident Dibaba hit the front before the bell and victory was a formality with Kipyego claiming the silver. While Dibaba was doubling up, Poland's Tomasz Majewski became only the second man in history to retain the Olympic shot put title. The 30-year-old threw 21.89 meters to edge out Germany's world champion David Storl, who had a best of 21.86m. Reese Hoffa of the United States took bronze with 21.23m. Majewski matched the feat of American Parry O'Brien, who won successive golds in 1952 and 1956. The Pole took the lead in the third round and finished off in style with his best effort. Earlier, the home crowd in an 80,000 seater Olympic Stadium with few empty seats, had reason to cheer as Jessica Ennis took a commanding lead in the women's heptathlon. Ennis, the poster girl of the 2012 London Games, set personal bests in the 100m hurdles and 200m on the way to a first day score of 4,158 points, 184 clear of Lithuanian Austra Skujyte. With the long jump, javelin and 800m to go, Ennis has a healthy lead over defending Olympic champion Natallia Dobrynska of Ukraine and Russian world champion Tatyana Chernova, who were 10th and ninth respectively. Britain's Christine Ohuruogu made a successful start to her defense of the women's 400m title with a 50.80 seconds clocking to come through in the first round. Her old rival Sanya Richards-Ross of the United States also progressed. Amantle Montsho of Botswana was fastest qualifier in 50.40 seconds.

"(CNN) -- Documents recovered from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan show that al Qaeda spoke of attacking President Barack Obama and Gen. David Petraeus, a source familiar with the materials recovered from the compound said Friday. The documents refer to an attack that would destroy the aircraft carrying Obama and Petraeus in the region, the source said, referring to the Afghanistan, Pakistan area. The documents also referred in a more general way to a desire by al Qaeda to attack the president and Petraeus, who was will be departing soon as the U.S. military commander in Afghanistan. A U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, described the Bin Laden documents as ""him in his brainstorming mode ... hey, I have an idea, what if we did this."" U.S. forces killed bin Laden during a raid on May 2. They recovered documents and other material during the raid. Petraeus declined to comment, a spokesman said Friday. Another U.S. official said the documents showed bin Laden was interested in attacking the United States on the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. According to that official, bin Laden wrote about ""identifying a team of operatives to attack the homeland."" But the official said there was nothing specific and ""it's unclear his discussions about those operatives were more than discussion."" The first official said overall, the documents indicate ""these were ideas, not fully or even partially planned plots."" Other materials taken from Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan have confirmed that the al Qaeda leader communicated with the Yemen-based group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to a third U.S. official, familiar with the ongoing U.S. analysis of the documents. The search through bin Laden's materials has also found direct evidence that while in hiding in Pakistan, bin Laden was encouraging direct plots to attack Americans and U.S. interests in Europe late last year, according to the U.S. official. There were several threats at the time that led the United States to issue an October 2010 alert for Americans traveling in Europe, the source emphasized. Bin Laden was ""aware, supportive and trying to motivate his operatives in Europe. He was pushing them,"" the source said. The U.S. intelligence community had classified information at the time suggesting that bin Laden was involved, the U.S. official said, but the documents taken from the compound have provided confirmation. Officials have previously said bin Laden always placed a top priority on trying to attack Americans.","Documents confirm that Osama bin Laden was pushing for attacks against Americans in Europe .

"Camp Virginia, Kuwait (CNN) -- The U.S. military is ordering that soldiers crossing from Iraq into Kuwait be returned home at a faster rate, a move that comes as commanders work to break up a bottleneck of troops who have been pouring across the border ahead of a year-end deadline to withdraw, CNN has learned. ""The order is to have these soldiers off the ground in Kuwait as soon as possible,"" a military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. The official, based in Kuwait, was not authorized to speak to the media. ""They don't want these soldiers sitting around here. They want them home."" The official did not immediately know whether the military was moving up or adding flights for troops from Kuwait. The order follows President Barack Obama's announcement last month that he would pull virtually all troops from Iraq by year's end, meeting the terms of a U.S.-Iraqi security pact that set a December 31, 2011, withdrawal deadline. The president's announcement followed news that negotiations to extend the deadline broke down after Iraq's top political leaders refused to grant U.S. troops legal immunity, opening up the prospect of soldiers being tried in Iraqi courts and being subjected to Iraqi punishment. Of the approximate 11,000 troops in Iraq, down from the 50,000 three months earlier, only about 150 will remain after the deadline to assist in arms sales, a U.S. official previously told CNN. The road home for most troops will require them to cross from Iraq, either by convoy or airplane, into Kuwait. There, they will turn in equipment before starting the journey back to the United States. The move to rotate soldiers more quickly out of Kuwait also is aimed at placating the oil kingdom. Kuwait has long been concerned that the U.S. military not increase its footprint in the country. Since mid-October, troops have been rolling almost every day into Camp Virginia, a short distance from the very border crossing used in the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. About 1,200 troops are permanently based at Camp Virginia. The population has swelled, at times, to more than four or five times that number. To accommodate the influx, the dining facilities extended hours of operation, expanded retail hours, opened a second PX, and increased the number of cleaning crews. ""We increased the space available for housing troops, as well as doubled our space for units to perform the administrative work they need to do to redeploy,"" said Lt. Col. Brian Bobo, commander of the 134th Brigade Support Battalion, a Minnesota-based National Guard unit deployed to Camp Virginia. ""We also increased showers and latrines to make sure we had enough."" In Iraq, a U.S. military spokesman says every step in the withdrawal is a ""deliberate operation in which we collect intelligence, coordinate with the Iraqi Security Forces, clear routes and ensure that every convoy has ground security and air cover."" ""We take that approach because force protection is inherent in every one of our operations, and we're going to do everything we can to protect our troops,"" Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan, the senior military spokesman for United States Forces-Iraq, told CNN. Buchanan said the U.S. withdrawal is on track, with all troops out of Iraq by year's end. While Buchanan did not address whether troops were being sent home at a faster rate, he said that the U.S. military in Iraq was working with counterparts in Kuwait to streamline the effort to move troops across the border. ""As a result, we're able to get them on a plane headed home quicker than before,"" he said. Meanwhile, the U.S. military is moving tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, including armored vehicles and equipment to counter improvised explosives, across the border from Iraq to Kuwait. More than 5,800 armored vehicles are expected to pass through Camp Virginia by year's end, though it will take months more before the equipment is either shipped back to the U.S. or Afghanistan, said Lt. Col. Ronald O'Bryant, a liaison officer with the team overseeing the receipt and shipment of equipment at Camp Virginia. CNN's Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","Military official: ""They don't want these soldiers sitting around. They want them home.""

"(CNN) -- Israeli warplanes struck five targets in Gaza on Saturday evening in ""retaliation"" for what a military spokesman called ""terrorist aggression."" Four of the ""targeted ... terror sites"" were in northern Gaza while one was in southern Gaza, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, said the strikes were ""precision"" and ""intelligence-based."" Dr. Ashraf Elkdra from Gaza's Shifa Hospital told CNN that there were no deaths or injuries reported as a result of the Israeli strike. The military actions follows what the Israeli military says were about 131 rockets launched from Gaza into Israel since last month. ""It is our obligation to seek out those that wish to attack us, eliminate their capabilities and pursue them wherever they hide,"" Lerner said in a statement. It also comes as a tenuous point in effects to reach an elusive peace deal between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. Efforts to reach an agreement stalled last week, as Israel reneged on a scheduled release of Palestinian prisoners and the Palestinians responded by signing on to join 15 international bodies in defiance of their own commitment not to seek international recognition as a state. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stated the obvious when he called both moves ""not helpful.""","Israel say its warplanes ""targeted"" five locations in Gaza .

"(CNN) -- When passengers boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 last week, they couldn't have known they were about to fly over a battlefield. But hours later, at 33,000 feet above eastern Ukraine, a missile ended the lives of 298 innocent civilians. That flight wasn't the only one in the corridor that day nor was it the lone one to fly above a conflict area. After MH17 was shot down the Federal Aviation Administration told U.S. airlines they could no longer fly in that region. And after a rocket launched from Gaza landed within a mile of Ben Gurion airport in Tel Aviv, the agency banned flights from the United States to Israel for 24 hours. In other areas, including ones where there is violence on the ground, the FAA restricts what U.S. planes can do. Over Iraq, U.S.-based airlines can fly as long as their planes are above 20,000 feet. That is out of range of most -- but as MH17 proved, not all -- missiles. There are warnings in effect for eight other areas, including Syria and Afghanistan. The threats include missiles and small arms fire, but airlines can fly there if they want. The decision for the airlines comes down to this: Do they just adhere to government regulations, which in effect establish minimum requirements, or do they use more caution? ""Government regulations are a floor. The government says, 'You can't be in the business unless you do this,'"" CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation Mary Schiavo said on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""You can go above it. Your airline can be safer, you can be more secure."" On the ground in Iraq, the well-funded terrorist group ISIS is fighting government troops, while above there is a busy highway in the sky with hundreds of flights. Every day Delta Flight 7 travels from Dubai to Atlanta and soars over Iraq. There are other flights with U.S. ties that travel over fighting. United Flight 82 each day goes over Afghanistan as it travels from Newark, New Jersey, to Delhi, India. It would be difficult to reroute these flights without increasing the time in the air by hours. ""Airlines have always had to make decisions about whether particular cities are safe to operate to,"" said Tony Tyler, the chief executive officer of the International Air Transport Association. MH17's route from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, would have been more than 6,000 miles. There were more than 800 flights that flew that corridor in the week before the shoot down. ""We followed that flight path accordingly,"" said Hugh Dunlavey, commercial director for Malaysia Airlines said. ""And it was accepted by the European air traffic control. And like many other airlines that had been flying that route for many, many weeks and with hundreds of airlines passing that route every day, we believed it was safe to do so."" After MH17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine, that region joined Crimea, north Korea, northern Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia as off limits to U.S. aircraft. Pilots have some input into the route. ""We have a collaborative decision process with the dispatcher,"" said 777 pilot Les Abend, a CNN aviation analyst. ""Myself as the pilot in command as captain of the plane and the dispatcher (who plans the flight). The dispatcher has a lot of the information; I can't get all of it. We get it in a NOTAM -- Notice to Airman (from the FAA). So this information, whether it be intelligence information about air space, information about weather, it's all part of that process. If there's something that we see that says, 'Hey, I don't like this,' we make a phone call. Most of the time we get this electronically."" In the case of MH17, the minimum altitude requirement (set by Ukrainian authorities) was 32,000 feet. It was supposed to be safe. ""Threat information is only as good as the intelligence supplied by air traffic control and its cooperating governments,"" Abend says in an editorial on why Malaysia Airlines is not at fault for flying where Flight 17 was traveling. Opinion: Don't blame Malaysia Airlines .","Planes also fly over Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries where bullets fly .

"Washington (CNN) -- A US Airways Express flight crew reported seeing what looked like a flare with a smoke trail in the vicinity of their aircraft while on approach to Philadelphia International Airport on Tuesday. According to authorities, what the crew witnessed remains a mystery. The aircraft with 34 passengers and three crew members landed safely. Flight 4321, originating from Elmira-Corning Regional Airport, was about 500 feet above the ground in Philadelphia when the incident took place. An audio recording of the communication provided by Live ATC.net between the air traffic controller and arriving planes indicated the initial confusion: . Pilot: ""It looks like a flare that was shot out."" Tower: ""Previous arrival said something about a flare being shot up. ... You said there was a flare being shot at you?"" Pilot: ""Yeah it wasn't probably more than 50 feet off our right wing. It looked like a flare gun."" Tower: ""OK, wow."" The tower alerted incoming aircraft to use caution as they approached the airport. No other incidents were reported. After landing in Philadelphia, the aircraft taxied to the gate, according to US Airways spokeswoman Liz Landau. Runway 17 was closed for about 30 minutes after the incident for investigation, the FAA said. Law enforcement authorities are investigating. The aircraft involved was a Bombardier Dash 8 twin engine plane operated for US Airways by Piedmont Airlines. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","A US Airways Express crew reports seeing what looked like a flare with a smoke trail .

"(CNN) -- Four more cases of a possibly fatal respiratory virus have been confirmed in Oman and Saudi Arabia, according to the World Health Organization. Three people in Eastern Saudi Arabia contracted the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and one of the patients has died, the WHO said. They ranged from 49 to 83 years old and all three had underlying medical conditions. The WHO is investigating what exposure might have caused their infections. The viral respiratory illness was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and since spread to at least four countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MERS unlikely to cause pandemic -- for now, experts say . The WHO says it has confirmed the first case of the virus in Oman, where a 68-year-old man from Al Dahkliya region became ill October 26 and was hospitalized two days later. Since September of last year, the WHO has confirmed 149 cases of MERS-CoV and 63 people have died from the illness. No cases have been identified in the United States, according to the CDC. It's believed the virus has spread through close contact with ill people. Symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea and -- in severe cases -- renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome with shock. The WHO is asking member countries to carefully review any case of severe acute respiratory infections.

"(CNN) -- Politics is a contact sport, and presidents tend to get tackled on every play, even the ones they've executed perfectly. There is no better example than the criticism being hurled at President Obama for the killing of Osama bin Laden. It was a daring mission, fraught with peril for the Navy SEALs, but also full of political danger for Obama. Had the attempt failed, Obama would have faced the same kind of political and policy disaster that confronted President Jimmy Carter after his helicopter rescue attempt of the Iran hostages crashed in April 1980. Everyone would have second-guessed Obama, just as they did Carter, who lost re-election six months later. Instead, bin Laden was eliminated, the SEALs became instant heroes and the nation rejoiced. Americans approved of the raid overwhelmingly, and Obama got a much needed, though brief, job approval spike in the polls. At the time, even Obama's fiercest foes gave him a salute for making the right, tough choice. Fast forward a year. Now President Obama is being reproached for taking too much credit for the success during his re-election campaign. Sen. John McCain called it ""cheap"" and ""a pathetic, political act of self-congratulation."" Democrats responded by questioning whether Mitt Romney would have gone after bin Laden, since he had criticized the expenditure of so much money to catch one person. Romney retorted that of course he would have grabbed bin Laden, adding that ""even Jimmy Carter would have given that order."" America's emotional high point in the last couple of years has become just one more partisan football. Too bad. It would have been nice if that special moment of justice for bin Laden had remained above politics. Perhaps President Obama and the Democrats have overdone the ""self-congratulation."" But did Republicans think Obama's most clear-cut achievement in his first term would go unmentioned? A campaign team that didn't focus on the key unifying event in Obama's entire presidency should be sued for political malpractice. The old rule still applies: A president should get the credit for all the good things, and must take the blame for all the bad things that happen on his watch. Politicians are not shrinking violets, least of all presidents. Naturally, Obama and his staff have capitalized fully on bin Laden and will continue to do so all the way to November. Instead of trying to diminish the accomplishment, Republicans would be better off conceding the point, congratulating Obama, and making the argument that the bin Laden mission was the exception that proves their contention that the president has failed to do what he promised in other spheres. Is the country better off economically? Most Americans don't seem happy with the weak recovery, which is the real issue that Romney will focus on in his pursuit of electoral victory. Obama promised a much stronger rebound after passage of his economic stimulus program, and he should be held to account for that. Similarly, Obama's health care legislation -- controversial from the start -- has remained consistently unpopular, to judge by the polls, and is a legitimate target for the GOP. A political party enhances its credibility if it mixes praise for something done well with criticism for the inadequacies that, in its view, should lead voters in a new direction. In our hyper-partisan era, political figures and both parties seem to be permanently stuck in petty attack mode, to their own detriment. The bin Laden success also illustrates an irony we should appreciate. The 2008 conventional wisdom about Obama was wrong. He was expected to be an effective domestic policy leader, but his lack of foreign policy experience meant he wouldn't know what to do when he got that dreaded 3 a.m. phone call. The reality of Obama's presidency has been the opposite. Domestically, Obama has failed to revitalize the economy to the satisfaction of most voters, and his divisive health care and energy proposals increased partisanship in Congress and around the country. Yet in foreign policy, he can tout many successes, from the ending of the disliked Iraq War and the scaling back in Afghanistan to the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi and the flowering of democracy in several Middle East nations. What parts of our current conventional wisdom about Obama and Romney are misguided? Since the future is unknowable, perhaps our projections should be less definitive and more tentative, if not humble. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Larry J. Sabato.","President Obama has been criticized for touting his success in killing Osama bin Laden .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- A cease-fire didn't last very long Thursday as more than a dozen rockets from Gaza were fired at southern Israel and the Israeli air force hit what it labeled as seven terror sites, according to Israel Defense Forces. Of the 18 rockets fired, eight struck Israel and eight landed in Palestinian areas, IDF tweeted. Two were shot down, Israel said. Palestinian security officials told CNN that Israeli warplanes bombed a training base of al-Qassam Brigades -- the military wing of Hamas -- while another targeted an old intelligence building. There were no casualties, the officials reported. IDF said it attacked four sites in the southern Gaza and three in northern Gaza. ""Militants attacking Israel from the Gaza Strip will not feel safe, will pay the price and will find that their actions are futile,"" Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a spokesman for IDF, tweeted. There was news earlier of an Egyptian-brokered truce. Islamic Jihad Khaled Al-Batash told CNN the truce started at 3 p.m. local (9 a.m. ET). Two hours later, two rockets were fired from Gaza, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Palestinian leader blames Israel . Israelis have been preparing for continuing violence, with IDF calling up reservists to man Iron Dome batteries that are intended to intercept missiles from Gaza, according to a spokesman. They intercepted three such missiles Wednesday night and the two Thursday. Another spokesman said the reserves were being brought in for ""operational assessment and accordance with the air force necessities."" Islamic Jihad said the flare-up came after three of its operatives were killed Tuesday by an Israeli military strike in Gaza. The operatives had traveled to Gaza to inspect an Israeli drone -- a small surveillance aircraft -- that had become disabled, Islamic Jihad said. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas blamed the Israelis for the outbreak. ""The Israeli occupation forces killed in cold blood three Palestinians in the West Bank and another three in Gaza, and we did not hear any condemnation or any apologies to these acts from the Israeli government,"" he said Thursday in a joint news conference in Bethlehem with British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""And, yesterday, the launching of rockets happened from Gaza and Israel retaliated to that, and we condemn this escalated military aggression in all its forms, including the firing of rockets,"" he told reporters, according to the Palestinian news agency WAFA. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon blamed the attacks on Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, two years after Israel disengaged unilaterally from the area. ""The Hamas is responsible for Gaza and if the Hamas does not know how to ensure the quiet, they will also be responsible,"" he said in Hebrew. ""We are prepared for all possibilities."" Only a few days ago, Egypt declared Hamas a terrorist organization and outlawed its activities in the country. This followed the military-backed government's fierce crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which is linked to Hamas. Airstrikes, rocket fire . Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman told Israeli army radio that ""the position of my party Israel Beitanyu is that we support the full occupation of the whole of Gaza in any possible future action."" Liberman opposed a response short of full occupation. ""I am against a limited operation,"" he said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked Wednesday evening for his reaction to Liberman's comments at a joint news conference with Cameron in Jerusalem. ""If it is not quiet in southern Israel, it will be very noisy in Gaza,"" Netanyahu said in Hebrew. The announcement of the cease-fire came shortly after four Palestinian residents were critically wounded in an airstrike on tunnels near the southern Gaza city of Rafah, Palestinian medical sources told CNN. A Hamas website reported five people were injured in two attacks. Security sources said one of the attacks struck west of Rafah, destroying two tunnels; a second attack struck east of Rafah on open land. Israel Defense Forces said that two rockets hit southern Israel Thursday and that the country's air force retaliated ""by targeting seven terror sites"" in southern Gaza. Since Wednesday, about 65 rockets have struck Israeli territory, five of them hitting populated areas, IDF said. Lerner said Thursday in a statement that there had been ""a substantial deterioration"" in the safety of southern Israel's residents. ""We have responded and will continue to do so in order to eliminate threats as they develop. This is our obligation and responsibility to those exposed to Gaza terrorism.""

"(CNN) -- An unmanned moon lander under development crashed and blew up during an engine test Thursday afternoon at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the space agency reported. There were no injuries in the failed test of the lander, dubbed ""Morpheus."" The craft had gone through several previous exercises in which it was hung from a crane, but Thursday was to have been its first free flight. Instead, the prototype rose a short distance, rolled over and slammed into the ground. The craft caught fire immediately and exploded about 30 seconds later. ""The vehicle itself is lost,"" Jon Olansen, the Morpheus project manager, told reporters. ""But we are working currently on gathering more data and information to understand what occurred in the test and how we can learn from it and move forward."" Read more about space and science on CNN's Light Years blog . Olansen said operators have recovered memory devices from the wreckage and will be pulling the data off of them for clues to the cause of the accident. ""From early indications, it seems to be within our guidance navigation control system, seems to point toward hardware,"" Olansen said. In a written statement, NASA said failure is ""part of the development process for any complex spaceflight hardware,"" and designers will learn from whatever caused Thursday's crash. The Morpheus lander is designed to carry up to 1,100 pounds of cargo for a future moon mission. Its engines are fueled partly by methane, which the agency says is easier to handle and store than other propellants such as liquid hydrogen or hydrazine. Olansen said the space agency has spent about $7 million on the project over two and a half years, and the test lander lost Thursday was ""in the $500,000 class."" Another one is currently under construction at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and may be complete in two to three months.

"(CNN) -- Chris Meek put his motorcycle in storage in Wilmington, North Carolina, to protect it from Hurricane Earl as the Category 4 hurricane headed toward the North Carolina coast. He fought crowds at the grocery store to stock up on supplies and tried to soothe anxieties among students in his sixth-grade class. About 175 miles away, in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Sarah Baker was bracing Thursday for her first hurricane. ""The locals have been really nice, telling me what I needed to buy to get ready,"" the recent college graduate said. Meek and Baker are two of millions of people watching and waiting as Hurricane Earl looms offshore, moving closer and closer to land. ""We were a little nervous yesterday because we were unsure of the track of the storm,"" but now it looks like it's going to miss his area, said Meek, who teaches social studies and science at Charles P. Murray Middle School. Several of his students live in Carolina Beach, just south of the zone covered by a hurricane warning. One student's mother bought a lot of water, and another, whose father is in the military, brought home dozens of MREs -- meals ready to eat -- that are normally issued to troops in the field. Meek said he's also seen a rush at several local stores, including supermarkets, as well as home improvement and hardware stores, as people try to get ready for whatever Earl brings. Some of his students talked about their fears of the impending hurricane, sparked by footage they'd seen of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Meek said. They were nervous that something similar could happen in their neighborhoods, he explained. But now that it looks like the worst of the storm might miss them, they're disappointed that they won't have a day off from school tomorrow, he joked. Baker said this is her first hurricane. ""I'm looking forward to it,"" she said, although she admitted she doesn't really know what to expect. The Oklahoma native, who works for a vacation rental company in Kitty Hawk, said she saw tornadoes in her home state and later experienced earthquakes when she moved to Southern California. Now, fresh out of college and newly established in Kitty Hawk, she's enjoying the scene. ""We had a beautiful sunrise -- I'm making a video of that now -- and it's just starting to get cloudy."" Baker, who contributed video of waves and surf churned up by Hurricane Earl to CNN's iReport, says she hopes she doesn't have to stay inside too much. ""There are some guys who do hurricane preparations and I'm going to go out with them for a while and shoot some more video,"" she said. Are people still out? ""Yes, they are. I saw some people out surfing this morning, but the rip tides are really getting strong so I don't think they'll be able to stay in much longer. I saw this one guy who went into the surf and just a couple of minutes later he was a quarter mile down the beach."" Many vacationers along the Carolina coast started to head home Wednesday, especially after a few counties issued evacuation orders for visitors. But that's not stopping Jason Bays, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, from making a planned trip to visit friends in North Carolina. ""Where we were going is actually a beach condo they own"" in Jacksonville, North Carolina, said Bays, 38. ""But they live in Greenville, which is kind of northwest of Jacksonville, so we're going to stay there instead. That's if there's power and things like that. I'm hoping it's not too bad."" Bays, an engineer for AT&T, said he was ""kind of bummed out"" when he first thought that Earl might affect his vacation plans. ""But then I found out that it wasn't going to be an exact hit, so we thought maybe we'll still try to make it, which we are going to go for,"" he told CNN. He previously lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for seven years, so he's experienced hurricanes before. ""I've lived through a few,"" Bays said. He said usually he drove north to get away from the storms, but on one occasion, about five years ago, he decided to ride out the hurricane. ""The wind was incredible. I couldn't believe it."" ""I remember thinking, I wish I would have left,"" he added. ""It's a scary thing."" Rusty Mace of Beaufort, North Carolina, said all he saw at one point Thursday were ""sprinkles,"" a dark gray sky, and tides perking up -- but not lightning and thunder. ""I hate to say it,"" said Mace, ""but we are used to this."" He lives right on the ocean and is expecting no more than wind, rain, and possible power outages. ""I guess you can say we're idiots,"" he said ""We've got our mobile home tied down and we're good to go."" Mace said only a couple of stores have closed, but no one is boarding up windows or taking extreme precautions. Mace's mother is ill so there is no way they could evacuate if they wanted to, but he states, ""Even if we could leave, we wouldn't."" ""My biggest concern,"" said Mace, ""is if the refrigerator is going to be running tomorrow."" Watch Mace's iReport from the coast . Scott Bard and his family have decided to ride out Hurricane Earl as they are visiting Sandbridge, Virginia. He thinks the storm will be a ""glancing blow,"" but his wife disagrees. ""The first thing she said to me this morning was 'we should evacuate,'"" said Bard, ""and I usually listen to her, but this time I'm pretty confident we'll be OK."" Originally from Richmond, Virginia, Bard said he experienced what he thinks will turn out to be a worse storm, Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Chris Hall -- president of Blue Water Yacht Sales in Hampton, Virginia, -- also remembers the ""really bad"" Isabel, and said some people are really preparing for this hurricane and others aren't. ""I'm personally concerned that if the storm doesn't turn, we'll have a big surprise,"" Hall said. Many of his customers are moving boats off the water where the surge is mounting up, and they are trying to create more room for boats that are evacuating the churning sea. ""We're sending trucks to New England to pick up additional stands,"" said Hall. ""And until we run out of real estate, we'll keep hauling."" Farther north in Belmar, New Jersey, 42-year-old Mary Wall owns the Matisse Restaurant -- right on the boardwalk by the ocean. She said the town has already started to prepare by erecting a storm fence in hopes of keeping sand from going onto the boardwalk. She's taking awnings and other things down -- tasks she usually performs in the winter. ""We've already got 8- to 10-foot waves. It's a little windy, but not that much yet,"" she said. ""I don't think it's going to get that bad. From what I'm watching right now, we're going to get 40 miles an hour winds. ... Hopefully, unless it turns, it's going to miss us."" The big negative is that this big holiday beach weekend could turn into a dud for some shore businesses. But, Wall said, ""this weekend might be a wash."" While the storm will keep many away, it might attract others. ""I'll get people who'll want to sit in the restaurant and watch the storm,"" she said. CNN's Melissa Gray, Randy Harber, Alan Silverleib, Kelsey Jones and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Crowds pack grocery stores in some towns along the East Coast .

"(CNN) -- You would think that President Obama's surprise trip to Afghanistan yesterday and speech to the troops would have quieted -- at least for one night -- the latest installment of the GOP's ""Faux Anger Chronicles."" While most of the president's critics were silent or praised him for the trip, others didn't disappoint in following along with the fad. Faux anger: It's all the rage. At least in politics. The president's speech honored and thanked our troops, reviewed our strength and resolve in Afghanistan and in killing Osama bin Laden -- who planned the 9/11 tragedy in that country -- and also in getting rid of 20 of 30 of al Qaeda's top lieutenants. It provided a slight break in the action from the GOP temper tantrum that began earlier this week. That one was over the Obama campaign's ad, which had the audacity in using the president's decision to move forward on the raid to bring down Osama bin Laden, no doubt a tremendous accomplishment for the administration and the country. The ad appalled GOP critics because we all know the Republicans would never have ""gone there."" Oh wait, they would and they have. Do we remember 9/11? With President Bush holding the megaphone, standing atop the rubble of ground zero? With caskets draped in the U.S. flag? These were not postcards being sold on the street corners of NYC to commemorate the event that changed our lives forever. These were images of President Bush's 2004 campaign ads. Back then of course, Democrats cried foul, and Republicans stood their ground. The difference now is that Democrats have taken a page right out of the Republican playbook, using strength on foreign policy to remind people of the courageous decision Obama -- a Democrat --made, ordering the raid on the bin Laden compound in Pakistan (more on that later). The Republicans don't much like being shown up on what has historically been their turf. As I say to my children whenever they throw a temper tantrum: tough noogies. Deal with it. Those who worked for Sen. John Kerry in 2004 and saw their candidate get bloodied by George W. Bush and allies have even harsher words. If the tables were turned, does anyone think Republicans wouldn't have used this accomplishment? No. Does anyone think that if -- God forbid -- the mission had gone sour, Obama's opponents would not have used it as the No. 1 reason to get him out of office? No. This is exactly what happened to Jimmy Carter and why it is so bizarre that Mitt Romney actually brought up Carter in his response when asked if he would have ordered the mission to kill bin Laden. We know Jimmy Carter would have, because he did order a difficult mission like this before. Unfortunately, Operation Eagle Claw failed, as did Carter's presidency because of it. What we don't know is whether Mitt Romney would have ordered the bin Laden raid. According to Mitt Romney in 2008, he actually wouldn't have done so under the exact same circumstances that President Obama said he would and in fact did. Let's remember that after the George W. Bush administration went into Tora Bora looking for bin Laden and didn't find him, the search took a back seat to going into Iraq and getting Saddam Hussein. Bush actually de-prioritized the search for Osama bin Laden. And this became the line that many Republican candidates would follow in the 2008 campaign. Before then, in 2007, Mitt Romney had said he would not move heaven and Earth to find Osama bin Laden. He did clarify his statements a couple days later and also in a debate, saying that getting bin Laden was important, but so was focusing on other top tier al Qaeda leaders. But the more damning statement came afterward, when he strongly criticized then-Sen. Obama for saying he would go into Pakistan to get bin Laden without the help of the Pakistanis if he had actionable intelligence to do so. Romney called those statements ""ill-timed"" and ""ill-considered."" Mitt Romney needs to learn that words matter. When he says in no uncertain terms that he would not in fact order a mission in Pakistan without the knowledge of the Pakistanis, and then criticizes his opponent for saying he would, why should we not judge him on exactly those words? So Mr. Romney, if you would like to now take back those words and concede you were wrong, you should do so. But don't expect the American people to buy into your faux anger when your opponent is questioning how you would have acted when you yourself have provided the words that lead to that legitimate doubt. Additionally, the Romney campaign and Mr. Romney himself is saying any president would have made the same decision President Obama did. Not true. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said he thought it was ""gutsy"" and one of the most courageous calls he has seen a president make. The intelligence available at the time was 50-50 at best that bin Laden was even in that compound. Vice President Biden said he had advised against it and that in fact the only person in that room that told the president to go was then CIA Director Leon Panetta. So in the infamous words of the GOP's beloved Newt Gingrich: Spare me the pious baloney. Or at least the faux anger -- even if it is politics' newest fashion craze. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona: Some in GOP have criticized Obama's Afghanistan trip this week .
She says GOP using faux anger, same as earlier criticism of Obama's bin Laden ad .
She says Romney had said killing bin Laden not a priority; he should own his words now .
Cardona: GOP hypocritical; would gladly claim credit if its candidate had killed bin Laden ."
"(CNN) -- A former associate of Osama bin Laden, described by authorities as a ""Pakistan-based attack planner,"" has been arrested in Afghanistan, a spokesman for the NATO-led coalition said Thursday. The International Security Assistance Force declined to identify the man, saying it was not releasing further information. ""It's part of an ongoing operation,"" Army Maj. Tim James, spokesman for ISAF's joint command, told CNN by telephone from Afghanistan. The man was arrested along with two others described as ""associates,"" according to ISAF, during a raid Wednesday in the northern province of Balkh, an insurgent stronghold that borders Uzbekistan. The arrest follows another a day earlier in the same area of a suspected al Qaeda-linked militant believed responsible for last week's suicide attack at a provincial governor's office that killed an Afghan police commander and wounded a German general, according to an ISAF operational update posted on its website. The operation comes a month after U.S. commandos killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in a raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In a statement posted on its website, ISAF released few details about Wednesday's arrest, saying only that it is ""suspected he was with bin Laden in Afghanistan in 2001."" He was captured during an overnight operation after he was tracked to a compound in Nahr-e Shahi, the statement said.","Coalition officials decline to identify the man, saying only he was bin Laden associate .

"(CNN) -- New York City's billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg can get pretty much whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Yet the item at the top of his wish list doesn't usually carry a price tag. ""In some ways, there's nothing more significant you can do for New Yorkers than making their lives better by giving them more life,"" explained Deputy Mayor Linda Gibbs. Since taking office in 2002, Bloomberg has unleashed a tsunami of public health initiatives intended to do just that -- cutting sodium in prepared meals, ordering that menus in chain restaurants carry calorie counts, posting restaurants' health department grades, as well as limiting the use of tobacco products. His first acts included a ban on smoking in restaurants and workplaces. In 2011, the restriction was extended to public parks and beaches. The restrictions spurred a backlash of criticism. ""I got a lot of one-fingered waves -- as I would describe them -- when I marched by bars on St. Patrick's Day, for example,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper last week. Now, Bloomberg said, attitudes have changed. ""Today, you march by a bar on St. Patrick's Day and everybody seems to love you,"" he said. In fact, the policies have worked and have been widely copied, according to Dr. Susan Kansagra, an assistant commissioner at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Since Bloomberg took office, she said, the city's smoking rate has dropped from 22% to just above 14%, ""one of the fastest declines in the country."" That drop would be hailed as a major success by any other politician, but Bloomberg is not easily satisfied. So this week, he unveiled the Tobacco Product Display Restriction Bill, which would force retailers to keep tobacco products out of sight of customers -- particularly young ones. ""What we're trying to do is just deglamorize, don't remind them, don't make it look like it's a normal product,"" Bloomberg said. ""Cigarettes are not a normal product."" Its passage would be unprecedented, Bloomberg said. That proposal too has stirred opposition. ""The notion of forcing licensed, tax-collecting, law-abiding retailers to hide their tobacco inventory is patently absurd,"" said Jim Calvin, president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores. Opinion: Why cigarettes are here to stay . ""This proposal arises from a wild theory that the mere sight of packs of cigarettes on a wall behind the store counter compels kids to start smoking,"" Calvin continuted. A spokesman for the parent company of Philip Morris USA, whose cigarette brands include Marlboro, said the manufacturer opposes the measure because ""we believe it goes too far."" Bloomberg's eat-your-vegetables approach to public health has triggered cries that the 71-year-old media mogul, politician and philanthropist has turned the city that never sleeps into a nanny state, one where finger-wagging admonitions about what to eat and drink and how to live have become annoyingly intrusive. But he is undeterred. This month, Bloomberg's attempt to limit the size of soda cups to 16 ounces was rejected by a state Supreme Court judge as ""arbitrary and capricious."" Not surprisingly, Bloomberg is appealing the ruling. Risk and reward . The mayor embraces risk and, though he doesn't particularly revel in failure, he is not afraid of it, said Gibbs. She recalled his telling a story of having spent a day skiing. Afterward, a skier remarked proudly that he had not fallen once. Bloomberg was unimpressed. ""He said, 'That means you didn't try hard enough,'"" Gibbs said. ""If you succeeded at everything, you left opportunities on the table."" Bloomberg himself has left few opportunities on the table. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University with a degree in engineering, he got an MBA from Harvard Business School and then, in 1966 at the age of 24, he moved to New York for a job with Salomon Brothers, an investment bank. He rose quickly, eventually overseeing the firm's information systems. In 1981, squeezed out of the bank in a merger, he started Bloomberg LP, the financial news and information company used by Wall Street's trading firms. It has made him rich. Since then, he has donated more than $2.4 billion to a variety of causes and organizations. About half of that -- more than $1.1 billion -- has gone to Hopkins, which named its school of public health after him. ""He's driven by the metric of how do we make the most impact in terms of improving health and saving lives,"" said Dr. Michael J. Klag, dean of the Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Mike is a data-driven guy, he's a numbers guy."" Klag credits the businessman's investments in public health with paying big dividends. ""New York is now the healthiest city in America because of what he's done,"" Klag said. It's also one of the safest, with the lowest murder rate of any big city in America. And traffic deaths and fire deaths are the lowest since the city started keeping records in 1916. ""Parents from around the country used to dissuade their kids from moving to New York because it was dangerous,"" Bloomberg said last week. ""That doesn't happen any more. Parents want their kids to move here because they're probably safer than where they're coming from."" Putting a dent in obesity . Bloomberg's focus on food is recent and the data to support it are not as strong. ""With tobacco, we have a pretty established set of policies we know are effective, but with obesity, it's still new,"" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas A. Farley told an audience at Fordham University in New York during a conference last fall on Bloomberg's public health legacy. But talking about legacy is ""a little presumptuous,"" according to Peter Zimroth, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, which has represented the restaurant industry. ""The legacy is yet to be written on some of these initiatives,"" he told the conference, adding that the evidence that such efforts would reduce obesity was itself thin and could wind up being counterproductive. ""There's a limited amount of capital, I think, that government has to engage in coercive measures,"" he said. Bloomberg sees restrictions on food as a critical component to his public health mission, according to Klag. ""He sees this avalanche of diabetes coming,"" he said. ""That's why he attacks the sugar intake."" In reaching for opportunities, Bloomberg has lost his footing several times. In addition to losing his effort to ban large, sugary drinks, he failed in his bids to get a soda tax adopted and to ban the use of food stamps to buy soda. The so-called soda ban provoked ridicule from some observers. ""I think this is what makes liberals look like elitist bullies who think they know everything and can tell people what to do,"" Bill Maher said on his HBO show ""Real Time."" ""You shouldn't have to clear what you eat with the municipal government."" Video: Sarah Palin mocks Bloomberg's soda ban . A executive with the National Restaurant Association -- which represents 500,000 restaurant businesses across the country -- called the city's efforts at change ""heavy-handed"" and was effervescent over Bloomberg's most recent loss. ""We very much questioned the efficacy of putting a dent in obesity by restricting the cup size in restaurants in New York City that sold sugar-sweetened beverages,"" said Scott DeFife, the association's executive vice president for policy and governmental affairs. ""We don't think that micromanaging food service packaging is the way to end obesity in New York City."" Bloomberg's attempt to limit the size of sodas inspired Mississippi -- whose 34.9% obesity rate is the nation's highest -- to pass an ""anti-Bloomberg"" law. ""It simply is not the role of the government to micro-regulate citizens' dietary decisions,"" Gov. Phil Bryant wrote. But Bloomberg lashed back. ""'Saturday Night Live' couldn't write this stuff,"" he said about Mississippi's move. ""We have a worldwide, nationwide problem on obesity. This year, more people will die from overeating than from starvation -- first time in the history of the world."" ""How can somebody try to pass a law that deliberately says we can't improve the lives of our citizens?"" he asked. ""It's farce."" Looking ahead . While his critics might accuse him of simply trying to expand his political power through his health initiatives, Bloomberg's colleagues say that's not the case. Bloomberg's focus is simple and singular, explained his former colleague Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Any time I came to him for a decision, he only asked one question: Was I certain that this would save lives?"" said Frieden, who served as commissioner of the New York City Health Department from 2002-2009. ""When it comes to failure - if he works on something for six months and it fails, the next day it's as if it didn't happen. He is always looking ahead."" Meanwhile, Bloomberg appears to be meeting his goal of adding length to the lives of New Yorkers. A New Yorker born today is likely to live three years longer than a New Yorker born a decade ago, a year after he took office. ""That's a huge surge, and it puts us a little more than two-and-a-half years ahead of the national life expectancy,"" Deputy Mayor Gibbs said. Gibbs predicted that Bloomberg will remain focused on public health, even after he leaves office at the end of the year. ""He's very clear that that will, in fact, be a large part of the work that he does,"" she said.","Mayor Michael Bloomberg has made public health a top priority for New York .
He has touted many controversial health measures since becoming mayor in 2002 .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Thirty years after Chinese officials instituted the country's controversial one-child population control policy, lawmakers in one of China's largest cities are weighing a one-dog policy for pet owners. Officials in Shanghai are considering new rules that would allow individual households only one dog because of limited living space in the densely populated city, the state-run China Daily newspaper reported Thursday. Under the proposed law, dog owners would be required to neuter their dogs, give away their puppies to adopters or send them to government-approved adoption agencies by the time they are three months old, China Daily said. Read more of CNN's China coverage . Other Chinese cities have similar policies, the newspaper reported, including Guangzhou and Chengdu. If passed, Shanghai's new law would go into effect next year. Violators of the law would face fines up to 1,000 yuan, China Daily said. In 2008, government statistics recorded 18.9 million people living in Shanghai, with 2,978 residents per square kilometer of land. Official figures showed there were about 800,000 pet dogs in the city and about 100,000 dog attack incidents annually, according to China Daily. But local pet lovers told the newspaper the proposed policy could be hard to enforce, and could put animals at risk. In September, officials said they planned to continue China's 30-year one-child policy, which limits most Chinese couples to one child. China Daily reported that an estimated 400 million births have been prevented by the policy, according to official statistics. Some Chinese couples -- such as those who are both only children, or some who live in rural areas -- have been allowed more than one child. Some critics have urged Beijing to relax the policy, saying it has skewed China's population and that better-off families have been able to bribe officials into allowing them more children.","The rules would limit households to owning one dog because of limited living space .

"Ann Arbor, Michigan (CNN) -- ""We did not have a right to choose where we lived ... freedom of speech, or freedom of actions. The traffickers had keys to our apartment. They controlled all of our movement and travel. They watched us and listened when we called our parents. They didn't let us make friends or tell anyone anything about ourselves. We couldn't keep any of the money we earned. We couldn't ask anyone for help."" -- Lena . Lena was an athletic student from Eastern Europe yearning to visit the United States through a study-abroad program at her college. She had visions of learning English and returning home to share her experiences with her family. But the human traffickers who ensnared her had a different vision for Lena, shipping her to America and exploiting her in the sex industry for profit. They met her at the airport with news that her study abroad placement had been changed. She was given new bus tickets and sent off to Detroit, Michigan. Once there they took her passport and her freedom. After almost a year of enslavement, Lena risked her life to make a daring escape. She is smart, resilient and funny, and I have been honored to be her attorney through the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School. Unfortunately there are thousands of adults and children like Lena who have not been able to escape their traffickers. These victims, especially the children, are in the same position Lena was: They're being exploited and can't ask anyone for help. The data on human trafficking is sparse, but what is known is terrifying. It's already the second largest criminal industry in the world -- behind only the trade in illegal drugs -- and it's growing fast. The global commercial sex trade exploits one million children annually. At least 100,000 and perhaps as many as 300,000 children in America are victims of sex trafficking each year. The grim reality of child sex trafficking in the United States is this: Human traffickers are selling sex with children in big cities and small towns throughout America. Child sex trafficking has been illegal in the United States since 2000 with the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Under this law it is illegal to recruit, harbor, transport, provide or obtain a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of a commercial sex act. Since the passage of the TVPA many states have passed their own human trafficking laws. Children who are selling sex in the United States are then, by definition, victims of human trafficking. Despite this, child victims of sex trafficking are frequently viewed as criminals rather than as victims. According to the Department of Justice in 2006, six years after the passage of the TVPA, 1,600 children were arrested for prostitution and commercialized vice. The children victimized by sex trafficking are often very young. On average, girls are first exploited for commercial sex between the ages of 12 and 14. For boys the average age is even younger -- between 11 and 13. But being a victim of sex trafficking does not have to be a life sentence. Victims can become survivors and build new lives. And while Lena is no longer the young college student she once was and it is too dangerous for her to return home, her speech and actions are now her own. She can choose where she wants to live. She is free. Through my work with Lena and other clients in the Human Trafficking Clinic we have identified a number of ways to fight sex trafficking. Raise awareness within your community: One of the biggest barriers to helping victims of sex trafficking is the lack of awareness about the issue. Human traffickers profit when we think human trafficking only happens in foreign countries. • Human trafficking happens everywhere, and sex trafficking cases involving children have been found in all regions of the country. No community is immune to the horrors of human trafficking. • Communities must prioritize the fight against human trafficking -- including providing enough resources to law enforcement. Change the conversation: Children who by law are too young to consent to having sex obviously cannot consent to selling sex, so: . • Victims should not be described as entering into prostitution; they are being exploited and should be described as victims of human trafficking. • Law enforcement officials often arrest and detain child victims of sex trafficking on either prostitution charges or other charges, such as truancy or curfew violations. Law enforcement must be trained about human trafficking. • Sellers of sex, especially when they are children, should not be guilty of a criminal violation. Buyers and pimps should be the only individuals at risk of criminal penalties. This would ensure that no victims are arrested or jailed. Reduce demand: The reality of sex trafficking must not be neutralized or glamorized. • Individuals who travel abroad to purchase sex from children are demonized in the media and identified as sexual predators, yet individuals who stay in the United States and pay to have sex with children are given the anonymous title ""john"" -- and frequently aren't even charged with a crime. • Individuals who pay for sex with children in the United States should be punished.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A singer known as ""Black Madam"" has been charged with murder in the death of a British woman who was injected with silicone at a Philadelphia hotel room last year, the city's district attorney Tuesday. Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, is already in police custody on separate charges stemming from another alleged illegal cosmetic procedure, also involving a silicone injection. The British woman -- Claudia Aderotimi, 20 -- died in February 2011 from a pulmonary embolism because of complications from a silicone injection to her buttocks, according to the district attorney's office. The cause of her death had previously remained uncertain. Aderotimi came to the United States from England after seeing an online advertisement for body enhancements by Windslowe, according to the district attorney's office. Police said Aderotimi paid $1,800 for buttocks enhancements that were performed in a hotel room, then experienced chest pains shortly after the silicone injection and died a short time later. Singer sought for questioning in cosmetic procedure death . Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams announced Tuesday that Windslowe has been charged with third-degree murder in Aderotimi's death, as well as conspiracy, reckless endangerment, possessing an instrument of crime and unauthorized practice of medicine. ""Padge Windslowe's arrogance and blatant disregard for human life is shocking,"" Williams said in a statement. ""Her conduct cost one young woman her life and placed countless others in danger. The defendant put her own greed above the public's health and safety, and instead of being remorseful, she bragged about prospective clients."" A phone call to Windslowe's attorney, Christopher Mannix, for comment was not immediately returned. Windslowe was arrested in March before she was about to host a ""pumping party,"" at which people pay for illegal silicone injections, police said. She was being held on $750,000 bail on charges of aggravated assault and deceptive business practices after an illegal injection of silicone was pumped into the buttocks of a 23-year-old woman in February, police said. The woman ended up in intensive care with possible silicone in her lung after paying $1,000 for the procedure, police said. Underground cosmetic procedures have become a growing concern for health regulators. Investigators have had a difficult time tracking these procedures because they are performed by unlicensed providers. What really killed the beauty queen? ""It's hard to tell how many people are utilizing that [type] of service,"" Tina Tan, a New Jersey state epidemiologist, said. Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said. Not surprisingly, injecting these materials can result in serious health complications and death, she warned. ""In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized,"" she said, adding that such injections should be done by licensed health providers.

"(CNN) -- For the first time in 78 years, a British man took to the grass courts of the All England Club as reigning Wimbledon champion. If 2013 winner Andy Murrray was feeling the weight of history on his shoulders, it didn't show as he secured a comfortable 6-1 6-4 7-5 victory over Belgium's David Goffin on the first day of the tournament Monday. Last year Murray became Britain's first men's singles champion since Fred Perry won the last of his three consecutive crowns in 1936. The third seed began his defense by seeing off the challenge of world No. 105 Goffin in two hours and two minutes. It was a milestone success for the Scot, who registered the 450th win of his career to set up a second round meeting with 92nd-ranked Slovenian Blaz Rola. Novak Djokovic also began his 2014 campaign in convincing fashion with a straight sets win over Andrey Golubev. Last year's losing finalist is ranked no. 1 for this year's tournament and showed why taking the opening 11 games of the match before going onto thrash his Kazakhstani opponent 6-0 6-1 6-4. Sixth seed Tomas Berdych also booked a second round spot with victory over Romania's Victor Hanescu. The big Czech, who reached the 2010 Wimbledon final, lost the opening set on the tiebreak on Court No. 2 before coming back to win in four sets 6-7 (7/5) 6-1 6-4 6-3. Berdych's reward is a second round match with Australia's Bernard Tomic who beat Evgeny Donskoy of Russia 6-4 6-3 6-2. Spain's David Ferrer eased through to the second round with a four-set win over his compatriot Pablo Carreno Busta. The seventh seed -- a two-time quarter finalist -- lost the second set on the tiebreak but was otherwise untroubled in a 6-0 6-7 (7/3) 6-1 6-1 victory. No. 11 seed Grigor Dimitrov is also safely through to the second round after comfortably beating Ryan Harrison of the U.S. The Bulgarian carried the good form he displayed in winning the Queen's Club title edging the first set on the tiebreak before notching a comfortable 7-6 (7/1) 6-3 6-2 win. Maria Sharapova's other half will play Luke Saville in round two. But 18th seed Fernando Verdasco is out though following defeat to Australia's Marinko Matosevic. The Spaniard, who lost to Murray in an epic five-set quarterfinal on Center Court 12 months ago, was dumped out in four sets (6-4 4-6 6-4 6-2) on court no. 8 by the Bosnian-born Matosevic. Italy's Fabio Fognini prevailed in a marathon match against America's Alex Kuznetzov out on court no. 18. Kuznetzov looked odds on to progress after taking a two-set lead but the Italian, seeded 16, won the next two before clinching the deciding set 9-7. Sloane and Sam slip up . The women's competition also got under way with former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka battling past spirited Croat Mirjana Lucic-Baroni 6-3 7-5. The Belorussian eighth seed will play Serb Bojana Jovanovski for a place in round three. Australian Open champion Li Na is also safely through. The no. 2 seed from China beat Poland's Paula Kania 7-5 6-2. Li's opponent in the final at Melbourne, Dominika Cibulkova made light work of Aleksandra Wozniak dispatching the Canadian 6-1 6-2. The 10th seed from Slovakia will play Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck in round two. But there was disappointment for rising American star Sloane Stephens, who failed to advance beyond the first round of a grand slam for the first time since Wimbledon 2011. The 18th seed was beaten 6-2 7-6 (8-6) by Russia's Maria Kirilenko, who will play China's Shuai Peng. Sam Stosur won't be improving here poor record at Wimbledon after being dumped out on day one by Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer in straight sets. The Australian, seeded 17, has never got past the third round and ended another dismal day in SW19 losing 6-3 6-4. Five-time champion Venus Williams enjoyed a happier time on court Monday with a three-set win over Spain's Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor. Williams, seeded 30 this year, took the first set 6-4 before Torro-Flor fought back to take the second by the same scoreline, but it was the 34-year-old veteran who asserted her authority in the final set taking it 6-2.

"(CNN) -- Helena Costa spent an hour talking about her landmark job as France's first ever professional female coach for a male team Thursday but her message was simple and succinct. ""Look at me as a normal coach,"" said the 36-year-old as she was unveiled by second-tier side Clermont Foot. Costa is the first female to be given the head job in the top two divisions of one of Europe's big five leagues -- Spain, Germany, England, Italy and France. More than 100 journalists -- as well as some of the club's players -- assembled at the Clermont stadium to meet the Portuguese who is hoping her appointment will inspire other female coaches. ""I know it's a big step,"" said Costa, who left her role as coach of the Iranian national women's team to accept the position with Clermont. ""I know because I had a career before in a man's world mainly, so I know it's an important day and it can open other doors, or not. ""I understand your surprise and the quantity of press and the impact but, we are in 2014, it should be a normal thing."" Costa, a sports science graduate, has been rewarded following her work with the Iran and Qatar women's national teams. She also led Benfica's male youth team to two World Youth titles and spent time as a scout with Scottish club Celtic. Her reputation has even spawned the nickname ""Mourinho in a skirt"" in her home country, a reference to Portugal's most high-profile football manager, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho. The football season has just finished in France and Clermont Foot finished 14th in Ligue 2 but Costa already has big plans for her first season in charge. ""I think that as in all leagues, if a club doesn't have a huge budget that doesn't mean that the players should not be ambitious and committed,"" she said. ""Between the team we will define our objectives but winning is the common word that we are going to speak. I'm here to win. ""I'm a demanding person with myself and my team, but especially with myself."" Costa will find herself under extra external scrutiny too as the highest profile female coach of a male professional football team in Europe. The 36-year-old is also pushing boundaries in France where match official Nelly Viennot previously broke new ground as an assistant referee, also featuring in Champions League games. Sexist society . French football writer Caroline Bauer told CNN World Sport that Costa's appointment was something of a shock. ""French society is a little bit sexist in sport, really sexist,"" she said. ""So it was a big surprise and a lot of people said it was a bad idea. ""At first in France everybody thought that Clermont just wanted to create a buzz with the appointment. ""But then Helena Costa came to France two weeks ago and she spoke a lot to the French media and she explained who she was. ""Now we understand that she has a real project with Clermont and she wants to prove she can be a real coach like men.""

"(CNN) -- Heather Reynolds, the head of the nonprofit organization Catholic Charities, tells the story she heard from an 8-year-old girl from Guatemala who recently crossed the border without her family. ""These kids were taken by drug cartels and others and would arrive back at their neighbors' dead with their organs cut out of them. Obviously, this little girl had seen stuff none of us could ever imagine."" The little girl's relatives hired a ""coyote"" to smuggle her into the United States. ""On her journey here, she was sold as a sex slave. Finally escaping, this 8-year-old crossed the Rio Grande,"" said Reynolds. The United States has a humanitarian crisis at its Southern border, as the number of unaccompanied children trying to enter the country has increased by 90% over just last year. The Republicans are also trying to turn this into a political crisis by accusing the Obama administration and the push for immigration reform for enticing more undocumented immigrants. Once again, Republicans are bashing President Obama, this time by using suffering children as their political pawns. Every parent can imagine it's not an easy decision to send your child with a stranger thousands of miles away to a foreign country. These are little kids, for crying out loud. That's not something you do because you want to, it's something you do because you have to. Escalating violence in Central America is driving the new wave of migrating children. As the Los Angeles Times reports, ""Although there has always been crushing poverty in Central America, violence in the region has escalated in recent years. For example, Honduras has the most murders per capita of any country. Drug cartels and gangs are at the root of the increased violence. Some of these children are fleeing gang initiations, according to several reports."" While historically most of the children who came to the United States illegally were from Mexico, that changed in 2013 when for the first time the number of unaccompanied migrant children from Central America eclipsed those from Mexico. Actually, the number of undocumented kids coming from Mexico has decreased in recent years. Nonetheless, Republicans insist it's Obama's fault. Republican House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte said, ""Many of the Obama administration's policies... have led to a surge of minors arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border."" Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner alleged the President's ""lax enforcement at Mexico's borders"" are giving a ""free pass"" to immigrants trying to come to the United States. These claims ignore the fact that President Obama has deported immigrants at a higher rate than President George W. Bush and is on track to have deported three million immigrants by the end of his presidency. One might call this rate of deportation inhumane or un-American, but no one could reasonably call it ""lax"" -- no one, that is, except Republicans fixated on attacking the President no matter what. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, implicating the President's program of administrative relief for young immigrant ""dreamers"" brought to the United States as kids, accused the President of ""incentivizing"" unaccompanied children to migrate with the promise of ""citizenship for anyone in the world who arrives illegally in the country by a certain age."" Sessions said, ""President Obama is responsible for this calamity."" Yet, the increase in unaccompanied children escaping Central American began back in 2009, long before President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. And for those who think that the United States should be even more aggressive in how it addresses the cases of kids who arrive here unaccompanied, it's worth noting that the current procedures for unaccompanied minors under our immigration system were created under President George W. Bush. Could the prospect of comprehensive immigration reform be part of the lure? Perhaps, though in a study of 104 migrant children from El Salvador, only one mentioned the prospect of immigration reform as a motivation. The White House has announced new steps to address the violence and poverty in Central America that is pushing children to migrate, including providing $9.6 million to help Central American governments repatriate citizens and additional USAID funds to reduce crime and violence in the region. And if there is misinformation spreading in Central America about immigration relief for children crossing the border, possibly a deliberate misinformation campaign as White House sources suggest, the Obama administration will be actively working to counter this with correct information, including the fact that young people recently arriving in the United States do not qualify under DACA. Although Republicans will continue to use this issue and other excuses to try to destroy the prospects for immigration reform, Democrats and the White House should keep pushing for reform, including a comprehensive path to citizenship. Our government has made it incredibly treacherous to cross our borders. Yet, people still take the grave risk to do so in order to seek security and opportunity. Currently, the avenues for legal immigration are largely backed up and broken, not keeping pace with the realities of why people migrate nor the needs of business in the United States that rely on their work. Our broken system is only working for the criminal coyote networks that take advantage of immigrants' hopes. If we fix our immigration system, people will have reasonable and accessible avenues beyond crossing the hot desert in desperation. Immigration reform is not the cause of the crisis at the border -- immigration reform is the solution. It would be nice if Republicans would face reality and be part of the solution instead of further exploiting these helpless kids in their endless vendetta against the White House.","Sally Kohn: Unaccompanied children trying to cross the border increased by 90% .

"Ometepec, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican officials were assessing damage Wednesday, a day after a strong earthquake left homes in ruins and rattled residents hundreds of miles away from the epicenter. At least 11 people were injured and hundreds of houses were damaged in the 7.4-magnitude quake, which struck midday Tuesday in southern Mexico near Ometepec, Guerrero. In some of the hardest-hit areas, residents surveyed rubble where adobe homes once stood. Nurses tended to patients in a parking lot beside a hospital damaged by the quake. Paulino Sisto said he sprinted toward his home in Ometepec when the quake hit, fearing for his family inside. ""I couldn't even walk because the earth was shaking. It was moving back and forth like a hammock,"" he said. From a distance, Sisto saw clouds of dust rising as houses collapsed in his neighborhood. His family survived, but their home didn't. ""No one has come to help us,"" he said Wednesday. ""These areas are very abandoned. There is no highway. There is no way here. Cars can't get through because of the earthquake yesterday. Dirt is blocking the roads."" The massive quake sent broken tiles and pieces of buildings falling onto sidewalks as far away as Mexico City, about 200 miles (320 km) from the epicenter. The city's mayor said the earthquake was the strongest to affect the capital since an 8.0 temblor that struck in 1985, killing about 10,000 people in the sprawling metropolis. Officials said no deaths had been reported after Tuesday's quake, despite the widespread alarm it caused. Although Tuesday's quake was strong, its magnitude was lower than the 1985 quake, which means significantly less energy was released, said John Bellini, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey. Going up one full magnitude would mean 10 times the ground motion. Even with the sixth-tenths magnitude difference between Tuesday's 7.4 temblor and 1985's 8.0 quake, ""you're talking about a big difference in the shaking and all the associated potential damage,"" he said. The relatively low population near the epicenter of Tuesday's quake and improved building codes in the Mexico City area also may have been a factor, he said. The quake's epicenter was about 15 miles (25 kilometers) east of Ometepec, a municipality of about 50,000 people, including enclaves of indigenous communities. ""You could see the fear on everyone's faces,"" said Olga Libia Ramos, the chief nurse in the city's general hospital. Officials evacuated patients into the parking lot after the quake shattered windows in the hospital, she said. At least 500 homes in the southern coastal state of Guerrero were damaged, Gov. Angel Aguirre said. Nine of the 11 injuries occurred in Oaxaca state, which borders Guerrero and also suffered damage from the quake, said Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire. Authorities said two people were injured in Mexico City, including the driver of a minibus that was crushed when a pedestrian bridge collapsed during the quake. Many residents in Guerrero, fearing aftershocks, said they slept outdoors overnight. Office workers rushed into the streets after feeling the temblor in Mexico City. Tourists and residents also felt the earthquake in the resort city of Acapulco, about 100 miles (200 km) from the quake's epicenter. Authorities in Mexico City were surveying buildings, schools and hospitals to evaluate damage, Mayor Marcelo Ebrard said. The USGS describes Mexico as one of the most seismically active areas of the world. The country sees an average of seven earthquakes daily with a magnitude greater than 3.0, according to Mexico's National Seismological Service.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Residents in parts of Bangkok cleared stores of bottled water and sought high ground to park their cars Thursday as government workers fought to contain flooding inching towards the capital city. Government officials ordered floodgates opened in an effort to relieve pressure on dams and levees as enormous amounts of water flowed towards the sea in Thailand's worst flood in half a century. As of Thursday, the death toll had risen to 320, with nearly 9 million others affected, authorities said. The decision to divert water through Bangkok means parts of the city will likely be flooded, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said. ""We need areas that water can be drained through so the water can flow out to the sea,"" the Bangkok Post newspaper quoted her as saying . Bangkok Gov. Sukhumbhand Paribatra asked residents to remain vigilant, but said the situation is not at a crisis level. Water has not topped the last barrier protecting the city and water levels north of the city are receding, he said. Yingluck said government officials would work to minimize the impact on populated areas. Government officials asked residents in seven districts at risk from flooding to move valuables to upper floors. Sukhumbhand said residents of three additional districts should be on alert for possible flooding. Officials predicted that water will enter northern Bangkok Friday. ""The situation is very uncertain as people are rushing to their homes to protect their belongings,"" said Natasha Cheung, who works in northern Bangkok for the Christian aid organization World Vision. Authorities also expressed confidence that the country's main international airport, Suvarnabhumi Airport, was prepared to withstand the water's impact. Airport officials said a 3.5-meter-high flood prevention wall protects the airport. Overall damage from the floods could top $2 billion, with the worst yet to come as the waters destroy shops and paralyze factories nationwide, the Thai Finance Ministry said. A massive effort is under way to protect one of the nation's largest industrial parks north of Bangkok that houses companies producing electronics and components for the automotive industry. At least 14,000 factories have been affected nationwide, with about 250,000 people out of a job due to the floods, according to Richard Han, the CEO of Hana Microelectronics. The flooding will also disrupt the production of computers, cameras and cars because a lot of Japanese companies have plants in the country, said Han, whose company is among those affected. Floodwaters have forced manufacturing sites north of Bangkok to halt operations. Last week, Honda said the closure of its plant there affected the production of at least 4,500 cars. In Bangkok, crews scrambled to widen canals and strengthen flood barriers amid fears that weekend rains and spring high tides would overwhelm parts of the city. In the ancient city of Ayutthaya, one of the worst-hit areas, officials said the water was starting to flow toward the rivers. The temples and monuments in the UNESCO-listed historical city have been submerged for days, prompting concern that much of the water damage will be permanent. Government officials said they have received $2.07 million in donations, including from other countries, as food and water aid pour in for the worst-hit areas.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than any other Republican lawmaker, Sen. Rand Paul has aggressively gone after nontraditional GOP voters in the past year, trying to lure Democrats and independents into his party's column as he considers a presidential bid. So it seemed odd last week when the libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky made a partisan joke about the prisoner swap that secured U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release. ""Mr. President, you love to trade people. Why don't we set up a trade? But this time, instead of five Taliban, how about five Democrats,"" Paul said Friday to cheers at the Texas GOP convention in Fort Worth. The Obama administration released five Guantanamo detainees in exchange for Bergdahl, who had been held captive for five years and was handed over to American forces at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border on May 31. To help bring back a U.S. marine currently detained in Mexico, Paul suggested trading ""John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, (and) Nancy Pelosi."" ""Couldn't we send them to Mexico?"" The audience roared. As would be expected, Paul's joke ignited a firestorm. His comment made national headlines, and the Democratic National Committee called his remarks ""completely out of line"" and uncivilized. DNC press secretary Michael Czin said the joke showed ""how unserious"" Paul is on foreign policy and argued he was trying to score cheap shots by riling the base. And as would be expected, conservative blogs and commentators found it funny--even ""hilarious""--and argued critics had no sense of humor. The following day, Saturday, Paul returned to Kentucky to help open the first state Republican Party office in the urban area of West Louisville, where he reiterated that the GOP has to be a ""more diverse party."" It's a theme he has taken on the road this past year, visiting areas unfamiliar to Republicans, such as the University of California Berkeley, a liberal hotbed. He has also traveled to inner-city Chicago and Detroit, as well as historically black colleges to help spread the Republican message to Democratic-leaning audiences. Rand Paul: GOP must reconnect with African Americans . And just last month, he told a Kentucky radio station that people are looking for a leader in Washington who carries ""the best parts of what Republicans stand for and also some of the good things the Democrats stand for."" So, why make a joke that rips some of the very voters you're trying to attract? Political experts say Paul is testing out his campaign language before it starts to count in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. ""He's really trying to figure out what he can and can't get away with on the stump,"" said GOP operative Ford O'Connell. ""If he can't broaden his appeal in the GOP primary, there is no general election."" Paul is also trying to place daylight between himself and other potential Republican candidates, O'Connell continued, as the GOP still lacks a clear frontrunner for 2016. Known for his non-interventionist views, Paul has to convince Republican donors and voters that he's strong enough to be commander in chief, O'Connell said. Rand Paul responds to GOP criticism of his foreign policy views . His joke was the latest in a string of comments last week expressing frustration with the Obama administration over the Bergdahl swap. On Fox News, Paul said he's not sure the prisoner exchange would have been a good deal, even ""if we were trading for a Medal of Honor winner, much less trading for somebody who may well have been a deserter."" While O'Connell argued the dust-up over Paul's Taliban joke at the convention will be nothing more than a ""blip"" in the long run, it was nevertheless ""out of character"" for the senator. ""If he continues to do that, it's obvious that he hasn't figured out how to brand himself distinctly from the others,"" he said. David Winston, also a GOP strategist, argued Paul would probably ""like to have that one back."" ""Here he is trying to do outreach, then he delivers a line like this. Clearly this statement seems to be at odds with the general direction he's going,"" Winston said. ""The remark was just unacceptable."" Paul highlights bigger GOP 'tent' in meeting with top Romney donors . Talking to reporters in Texas after his speech, Paul said his comment was simply a joke. ""Except for Nancy Pelosi, I was serious about her,"" he added, tongue fully planted in cheek. ""It's humor, and I hope there's room for humor,"" he continued after being asked about the comment again. ""I thought it was funny. It was meant to be humorous."" Winston, however, stressed that Paul would be better off staying on message, not offering ""some trite, strange comment."" ""I think up to this point in many ways he has engaged voters on a substance level -- that's why this particular statement was so dissonant,"" he said. Others say he was just serving up some red meat in the Lone Star State. Jordan Powell, a Republican consultant in Texas, said Paul's comment was in tune with the rabble-rousing rhetoric so often heard at state conventions held by either party. ""It was a line designed for partisans, to be responded to by partisans,"" Powell said. ""That quote happened in a vacuum to the outside world, but it didn't happen in a vacuum to those who were there at the convention and listening to other speeches."" Rand Paul criticizes the Clintons, urges GOP to engage minorities . Six analysts agreed that Paul's comment is unlikely to have a long-term effect if he decides to run for president. It's still early, they say, and almost all candidates make controversial statements along the way. ""I can't imagine that this will have an impact on Rand Paul's political career, one way or another,"" said Republican strategist John Feehery, adding the joke wasn't all that funny. ""When you are serving red meat to a crowd, sometimes it is served very raw. This was pretty raw."" Sometimes jokes can hurt a person politically if the comments mirror a deep-seated public fear about that individual, said presidential historian Doug Wead. As an example, Wead cited Sen. John McCain's 2007 joke where the then-presidential candidate parodied a Beach Boys song and called for the bombing of Iran. He also referenced Karl Rove's 2012 comment in which the GOP strategist joked about murdering then-Rep. Todd Akin, whose disastrous comments about rape ultimately cost him the Senate race in Missouri. But Wead argued Paul's outreach efforts and his work with Democrats on legislation -- such as measures aimed to limit the National Security Agency's domestic reach -- will outweigh any partisan jokes like the one he made last week. ""If the debate centers around bipartisanship and who has the most appeal from both sides, then let the debate begin,"" Wead said. ""Rand wins."" ""It is early, and he has to reassure his Republican base before he starts tapping the wide appeal he has among youth and others across the partisan divide,"" he added. ""The fact that liberals jumped on this reveals their concern about that appeal.""","Sen. Rand Paul joked the U.S. should trade five Democrats, not Taliban members, in next prisoner swap .
The partisan joke comes as Paul is actively trying to court Democratic voters .
Experts say the potential presidential candidate is just trying to figure out what he can get away with .

"(CNN) -- Mysterious explosions. Unexplained shaking. Something's going on in Clintonville, Wisconsin, but nobody seems to know what it is. The sounds -- variously described as rattling pipes, clanging metal, thunder or firecrackers -- have continued on and off since early Sunday night in just one part of the small town of 4,600, located about 180 miles northeast of Madison. Accompanying the sounds are vibrations that have shaken homes and household objects in the northeast corner of town, city manager Lisa Kuss said. The sounds were loud enough Monday morning that a CNN journalist could hear them during a cell phone conversation with Kuss. The baffling phenomenon does not appear to have caused any significant damage or injuries, according to Kuss. Workers peered into manhole covers and utility crews tested for leaking natural gas and other problems, but no one has yet to find anything amiss, Kuss said. Geologists and the military don't seem to have any quick answers, either, she said. U.S. Geological Survey records show no seismic activity anywhere in Wisconsin Sunday or Monday. ""It's like we're imagining things but it ain't, because we're all out and talking to find out what's going on,"" Clintonville resident Verda Shultz told CNN affiliate WLUK. Absent any better explanations for the sounds and sensations that have, well, rattled, the town, residents were left to their own devices to come up with explanations. ""My bet is on gremlins,"" one Facebook user jokingly posted to WLUK's Facebook page. Alien machinery buried for millennia, countered another. No, said one one tongue-in-cheek Twitter user. It's clearly mole men launching their attack on the surface dwellers. While the Wisconsin sounds have yet to be explained, mysterious booming noises are not all that unusual. Recent media accounts include reports from North Carolina, Idaho, Tennessee and others. U.S. Geological Survey scientist David Hill even published a paper in 2011 called, ""What is That Mysterious Booming Sound?"" In it, he said such sounds are so commonplace in upstate New York, they earned the nickname ""Seneca guns."" They're also well enough known to be named by residents of Belgium, the countries around the Bay of Bengal, Italy and Japan, among other places, he wrote. While the specific source of such sounds is rarely found, natural explanations abound, Hill said. One possible explanation is gas explosively escaping from underground rock formations. Another is a rock burst, which can happen when mining or quarrying uncovers long-buried rock, suddenly relieving stress and resulting in ""locally loud, explosive reports."" Others include meteorites, a phenomenon known as ""booming sands"" or even distant thunder, sounds that Hill wrote can be carried for significant distances under proper atmospheric conditions. CNN's Kara Devlin contributed to this report.","NEW: Booming sounds may be mysterious, but not particularly uncommon .

"(CNN) -- A lone backpacker was killed in a grizzly bear attack while hiking in Alaska's Denali National Park, the National Park Service said Saturday. The first sign of trouble came Friday afternoon, when three hikers noticed an abandoned backpack and signs of a struggle -- including torn clothing and blood -- along the Toklat River, the park service said in a news release. The hikers went back to a rest area, about three miles to the south, and alerted authorities around 5:30 p.m. Friday. About two and a half hours later, park rangers conducting an aerial search spotted at least one grizzly bear and, after touching down, the unidentified victim's remains. The body remained at the site Friday night after rangers decided to wait until Saturday morning to remove the remains because of the waning light and the number of bears in the area. The park service said that, based on ""initial evidence,"" authorities believe a bear attacked the backpacker by the river and dragged his body to a more sheltered, bushy area. The area of the Denali backcountry where the attack occurred has been closed -- prohibiting all hiking and camping in that area -- ""until further notice,"" the park service said. About 12 grizzly bears have been living this summer around where Friday's attack occurred, the park said, citing wildlife biologists. Grizzly bear attacks are not common, though they are not unprecedented. Last September, a grizzly attacked and killed a hunter in northwestern Montana within sight of another hunter. Earlier that year, grizzly bears killed two men in Yellowstone National Park, according to the park's superintendent.

"(CNN) -- In a new book, a ""60 Minutes"" interview and other recent public statements, Jose Rodriguez, a three-decade veteran of the CIA who rose to become head of the National Clandestine Service, has stoutly defended the CIA's use of coercive interrogation techniques on al Qaeda detainees. Rodriguez asserts, for instance, ""Information obtained from senior al Qaeda terrorists, who became compliant after receiving enhanced interrogation techniques, was key to the U.S. government learning of the existence of a courier who was bin Laden's lifeline."" Let us turn to what is available on the public record to consider if this is true. Between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003, the man who al Qaeda was grooming to be the 20th hijacker, Mohammed al-Qahtani, was interrogated at Guantánamo for 48 days, more or less continuously, rousted from bed at 4 a.m. for interrogation sessions that went on until midnight. If he dozed off, he was doused with water or given a sharp blast of some especially annoying music by Christina Aguilera. He was forced to perform dog tricks, often exposed to low temperatures, made to stand in the nude, and whenever he seemed to be flagging, he was given drugs and enemas so the interrogations could continue. This abusive treatment caused marked changes in Qahtani's behavior. An FBI official later noted that he began ""evidencing behavior consistent with extreme psychological trauma (talking to nonexistent people, reporting hearing voices, crouching in a cell covered with a sheet for hours on end)."" From the secret summaries of Qahtani's Guantánamo interrogations made public by WikiLeaks, it appears that it was only after the weeks of abuse that he told interrogators that the operational commander of 9/11, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, had introduced him to a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, ""the Kuwaiti,"" who had instructed him how best to communicate covertly with al Qaeda members once he was in the States. In July 2001, the Kuwaiti had taken Qahtani to an Internet café in the Pakistani city of Karachi and given him some lessons in secret communications. The admission from Qahtani that the Kuwaiti had given him training in operational security seems to have been the first time that U.S. officials realized that the Kuwaiti was a player in al Qaeda and a confidant of Mohammed's. American interrogators now knew that the Kuwaiti had helped train potential hijackers for the 9/11 mission, but as yet there was no sense that he might be bin Laden's key courier. Jose Rodriguez: Harsh interrogations were necessary, legal and effective . Mohammed himself was then captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and was transferred to U.S. custody. Despite being waterboarded 183 times and at one point kept up for 7½ days straight while diapered and shackled at a CIA secret prison in northern Poland, Mohammed did not confess to the Kuwaiti's key role in al Qaeda, instead telling his interrogators in late 2003 only that the Kuwaiti was now ""retired."" Mohammed's assertion that the Kuwaiti was retired was curious, as not too many members of al Qaeda were known to have retired. After Mohammed told his interrogators that the Kuwaiti was retired, an al Qaeda courier by the name of Hassan Ghul told CIA interrogators a quite different story. Ghul, a Pakistani, was arrested in mid-January 2004 in northern Iraq carrying a letter addressed to bin Laden from al Qaeda's leader in Iraq urging that he be allowed to embark on a full-scale war against Iraq's Shia population. Ghul obviously had access to al Qaeda's inner circle in Pakistan and so was taken to a secret CIA prison in eastern Europe, where he was subjected to a variety of coercive interrogation techniques, including being slapped, slammed against a wall, forced to maintain stress positions and deprived of sleep. At some point, it isn't clear when exactly, Ghul told interrogators that the Kuwaiti was bin Laden's courier and frequently traveled with al Qaeda's leader. It is quite possible, however, that Ghul gave this information up to his interrogators before he was subjected to coercive interrogations. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has undertaken a multiyear study of the CIA interrogation program and has generated a 6,000-page report that will likely be released in some form later this year. Once that report is made public it will surely definitively answer whether Ghul gave up this key information about the Kuwaiti while he was being subjected to coercive measures, or not. For the moment, we will have to content ourselves with a press release from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence dated April 27 that says, ""The CIA detainee who provided the most significant information about the courier provided the information prior to being subjected to coercive interrogation techniques."" This detainee appears to be Ghul. Peter Bergen: A visit to bin Laden's lair . Mohammed's replacement as the No. 3 in al Qaeda, Abu Faraj al-Libi, held that position for only a couple of years before he was arrested in Pakistan on May 2, 2005, in the city of Mardan, 100 miles from Abbottabad, where bin Laden himself would soon arrive to live for the next six years. A month after his arrest, Libi was handed over to the CIA. Coercive interrogation techniques (though not waterboarding) were used on him. Libi also told his interrogators that the Kuwaiti wasn't an important player in al Qaeda and that it was in fact ""Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan"" who was bin Laden's courier. Counterterrorism officials later concluded that Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan was a made-up name. So, did coercive interrogations lead to bin Laden? Such techniques were used on Qahtani, the 20th hijacker, and on Ghul, the Pakistani al Qaeda courier who was captured in Iraq. Certainly both Qahtani and Ghul gave interrogators information that led the CIA to focus on the Kuwaiti as a possible avenue to finding bin Laden, which to defenders of these interrogation techniques would seem to prove that they were effective. That said, it is quite possible, however, that Ghul gave up the information about the Kuwaiti before he was coercively interrogated. Critics of the coercive interrogation techniques can point out that harsh methods were also used by the CIA to get Mohammed and Libi to talk, and both those men gave their interrogators disinformation about the Kuwaiti. Since we can't run history backward, we will never know what conventional interrogation techniques alone might have elicited from these four prisoners. And there were other key steps along the way to finding bin Laden that had nothing to do with the information derived from al Qaeda detainees, whether coercive measures were used on them or not. The name ""Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti"" is an alias meaning ""the father of Ahmed from Kuwait,"" which is hardly a good clue as the population of Kuwait is around 3 million and Ahmed is a very common name. The first really big break in finding ""the Kuwaiti"" came in 2007 when another intelligence service provided the CIA with the courier's real name, Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, a man whose father had hailed from northern Pakistan and had moved to Kuwait decades earlier. Still there was as yet no sense that this was bin Laden's key courier. The next big break in the case came when the Kuwaiti in June 2010 made changes in the way he communicated on his cell phone that suddenly opened up the possibility of tracking the location of his phone. Soon the U.S. National Security Agency was able to trace the Kuwaiti's cell phone to the large western Pakistani city of Peshawar. But the courier practiced very good operational security and would turn off his phone and remove its battery far from where he was living in Abbottabad. On one of his occasional visits to Peshawar, CIA agents on the ground tracked the Kuwaiti and followed his distinctive white jeep 2½ hours' drive to the east to where he was living in a compound in Abbottabad. Living there, too, as we of course now know, was Osama bin Laden. In sum, CIA's ""liaison"" relationship with another intelligence service, signals intelligence by the National Security Agency and good old fashioned spying by CIA agents on the ground provided the critical leads that led to bin Laden. The role of interrogations, whether they were coercive or not, seems to have played only a partial role in the hunt for bin Laden, a tale that is more Agatha Christie than it is ""24.""","Peter Bergen: CIA learned of al Qaeda operative ""the Kuwaiti"" through harsh interrogation .

The recording is part of the New York Police Department's stepped up search efforts to find Avonte, who was last seen on surveillance video running out of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City on the afternoon of October 4, Keith Brooks, director of operations for CityWide Disaster Services, said Thursday. ""Avonte, this is your mother. You are safe. Walk toward the lights,"" the message repeats. The hope is the teen, who is unable to communicate verbally, will hear the sound of his mother's voice and approach the emergency vehicles. The reward for the safe return of Avonte grew this week to $77,500, as divers joined an ever growing number of police and rescue officers from several states who have been searching for him nonstop for more than a week. What is autism? Avonte's mother, Vanessa Fontaine, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" that she believes her son is still alive and that someone is probably holding him. ""My message to my son is that I love him and we're going to find him. You'll come home to your family. And for anyone who has him, please be kind and to let him go,"" she said Thursday night. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said he is not holding the school safety officer who was on duty when the teen ran out of the Queens high school responsible for the boy's disappearance. When Avonte approached the front door of his school the day he disappeared, the safety agent told him to go back upstairs, Kelly said at a news conference on Wednesday. Surveillance video then showed Avonte turning and going down another hallway, and exiting the building from a side door, he said. Surveillance video provided by the police department shows that no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out. ""Even though he's 14, it shouldn't matter. No one should be, you know, allowed to run around the hallways in school. And that security guard should have questioned him,"" Fontaine said. Growing up autistic . Police said Avonte was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Missing-persons posters are being handed out, and the search has expanded to areas outside New York City, Kelly said. The teenager is fascinated by trains, his family has said. Searches of train stations, tracks and tunnels are being conducted at the start of every shift by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, Kelly said, adding that 50 NYPD officers and a task force of detectives are working the case. Transportation officials in New York suspended overnight track maintenance on the city's transit system this past weekend as workers combed the underground network. All 468 New York City subway stations have been searched, and aviation, harbor and canine officers are mobilized and deployed periodically, the NYPD said. David Perecman, the Oquendo family's attorney, said it took school officials at least 45 minutes to call police after Avonte left. ""I don't understand how this happens to a special needs child unless there is something in there that failed the family,"" he told ""Piers Morgan Live"" on Thursday. Last week, Perecman said he was looking into how the child was able to leave school grounds unsupervised. ""Right now, we have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city and the various agencies involved, in order to obtain the information for us to know what occurred,"" he said. The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with police. The school is not commenting. The Oquendo family filed a ""notice of claim"" on Wednesday, said Perecman, marking the first step of a lawsuit against the city of New York. He declined to give further information about the claim. Anyone with information about Avonte is asked to contact the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit tips at the Crime Stoppers website, nypdcrimestoppers.com or can text to 274637 (CRIMES), then enter TIP577.

"(CNN) -- Check with your airline before you head to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport today. No, really. Airlines had canceled more than 3,200 flights within, into or out of the United States shortly before 10 p.m. ET, according to FlightAware.com. And many of those canceled flights involve the world's busiest -- but not the snowiest -- airport. The last time the Atlanta airport used its four snow plows to actually plow snow was the great snow storm of January 2011, said airport spokesman Reese McCranie. The airport also has six snow brooms, four de-icers, seven spreaders, 100,000 gallons of de-icing fluids, 50,000 pounds of de-icing solid material and 50,000 pounds of a salt/sand mix to clear roadways. Related: Deep freeze slams Deep South . As this latest winter storm crosses the country, flights at the Atlanta, Houston and Chicago airports have been the hardest hit by cancellations. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta is reporting 930 flights canceled, Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport is reporting 696 flights canceled and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport is reporting 548 flights canceled. The numbers of arriving and departing flights canceled are expected to increase. ""Some planes are getting de-iced ... and we're also putting preventative de-icing material on the (five) runways,"" said Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport spokeswoman Darian Ward. The airport has shut down an above-ground train that ferries passengers between terminals. Instead, passengers are being asked to ride buses. Airport operations may return to normal soon if it warms up today, Ward said. #ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . Chicago's O'Hare has been hit by airlines that are proactively canceling flights. O'Hare -- an airport with a bit of experience with snow removal -- reports only 15-minute delays for arrivals and departures. ""Our snow operations teams are out and doing their jobs,"" said Karen Pride, Chicago's Department of Aviation spokeswoman. Cleveland weather isn't slowing down most flights, either. Thirty percent of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport's Tuesday flights -- mostly smaller aircraft -- have been canceled. ""This is due to airline pull downs (reductions because of bad weather in other locations) and not because of weather,"" said airport spokeswoman Jacqueline Mayo. Call your airline to change your flight . Many airlines with flights departing and arriving at hardest-hit cities are offering flexible change policies for delayed customers. Check your airline website for more information. Delta Air Lines canceled more than 1,800 Delta and Delta Connection flights Tuesday, the vast majority at its Atlanta hub, said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant. The nasty weather forced American Airlines to cancel about 350 flights Tuesday, mostly regional flights across the Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, an airline spokesman said. While declining to give specific numbers, United Airlines is ""reducing operations at Houston Intercontinental Airport and other airports in the mid-South and Southeast regions today due to severe weather,"" said spokesman Charles Hobart, Tuesday. Citing near-record lows in the Midwest, United is also reducing operations Tuesday at their Chicago and Cleveland hubs and other Midwest airports. Make sure to confirm flights Wednesday . Depending on how-hard hit they are, Houston and Atlanta airports may still be recovering from storm conditions on Wednesday, said David Baker, FlightAware's chief executive officer. The Chicago and Cleveland airports could also face delays, depending on weather conditions in those Midwest cities. And what about your Amazon delivery? Severe winter may also affect the delivery of your packages. Remember how winter storms slowed pre-Christmas deliveries? FedEx, which is posting service alerts on its website, has already warned customers that hazardous conditions in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas may cause delays in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and 12 other states. UPS is reporting ""severe weather impacts"" in some of its delivery areas, according to company spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg. Check UPS.com to see which zip codes are affected. ""We make every effort to maintain service as long as safety permits,"" she wrote, via email. ""If deliveries are interrupted, we will resume service as soon as it is safe to do so.""","As latest storm moves across the country, airlines cancel flights .

"(CNN) -- When Joe Schroeder became a father in February, he did something a lot of working men in the United States only dream of: He took off from work for three months to stay home with his wife and newborn daughter, Alma Lucette. It was a ""blissful"" period, he said. He cooked breakfast and dinner nearly every day, something he never does when he's working. He perfected his diaper-changing technique. He took long walks with his wife and daughter around their home of Greensboro, North Carolina, occasionally stopping for lunch. Best of all, he got to spend hours holding his daughter and getting to know her without pressure to be anywhere else in the world. ""I wouldn't say it was like a vacation; it was all we could do to keep up with having a brand new baby. But I can't imagine doing it any other way,"" he said. His experience is far from the norm in the United States, which, unlike most countries in the world, does not provide paid leave for mothers or fathers around the birth or adoption of a child. The nonprofit Schroeder works for falls into a minority of just 11.4% of workplaces in the United States that provides paid leave for its employees, according to Department of Labor statistics. Instead, many people use a combination of vacation or sick days or unpaid leave, like Schroeder's wife, Lora Smith did. Still, without Schroeder's paid leave, the couple said they would have been unable to afford to both take the maximum 12 weeks allowed under the Family Medical Leave Act. ""It made me a lot more aware of how fundamental parental leave is to family stability,"" Schroeder said. ""It made me lament the fact that it's not a right that everybody shares."" Amid all the talk of women ""leaning in"" and ""having it all,"" men tend to get left out of the conversation. Even though the benefits of giving fathers equal time to bond with their children are pretty well established, parental leave worldwide for fathers tends to be shorter than it is for mothers. Yet, time and again, studies have shown that the United States is a ""total outlier"" in the area of work-family policy, said Janet Walsh with Human Rights Watch, which examined U.S. work-family policy in a 2011 report, Failing its Families. While it's great that the FMLA protects workers' jobs while they tend to family needs, evidence shows there's even more benefit to providing paid leave to help ease the financial burden on families of taking time off. Modern fathers face new expectations . ""It should be a basic workplace right and a basic human right,"" said Walsh, deputy director of the women's rights division. ""It's good for workers, families and the economy."" Beside, unpaid leave is not a financial option for most Americans, said Vicki Shabo, director of work and family programs for the National Partnership for Women & Families. ""The most common reason people don't take leave when they need it is because they can't afford it,"" she said. ""When people are living from paycheck to paycheck and unemployment is high, there's a real economic pressure to forgo the leave that's needed."" A 2012 National Partnership study found that 14 states and the District of Columbia have laws that go beyond FMLA. California and New Jersey in particular provide paid family leave insurance to eligible employees through payroll contributions. A study released in January found that fathers who took two or more weeks of leave upon their child's birth are more likely to be involved in the direct care of their children beyond leave. The study noted that fathers' use of paternity and parental leave was largest when leave was well-paid and designated specifically for fathers, Walsh pointed out. While immense progress has been made worldwide to provide women with access to leave around the birth or adoption of a child, there's still much work to be done for fathers, said Jody Heymann, dean of UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health and lead author of Children's Chances, the most comprehensive study to date on global laws and policies that affect children and families. Of 193 countries surveyed, the study found that 180 provide some form of paid leave for mothers and 81 guarantee similar rights to fathers, according to Children's Chances. The United States is not one of them. ""From the standpoint of children, we know that dads' involvement is just as important as moms' involvement,"" Heymann said. ""We also know that when fathers take leave during infancy they are more likely to be involved in their children's lives down the road."" Ensuring equal parental leave for fathers is also important to ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workplace, she said. ""Addressing equal participation in the workforce by new parents is critical to equity for both genders."" The Family Medical Leave Act, which applies equally to men and women, doesn't guarantee paid time off. It allows eligible employees of covered employees to hold onto their jobs for 12 weeks should they decide to take time off for the birth or adoption of a child. It also provides for the continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave. Employers, however, are not legally required to pay for the time off. What made Schroeder's situation exceptional was that his employer gave him three whole months of paid leave. That's 12 weeks in which he received a salary and benefits without having to use vacation time or sick days, unlike his wife, who used a combination of all three so she could stay home with him and Alma. Lora Smith said she also benefited from her husband's presence. She did the breastfeeding; he did the diaper-changing. They took turns waking up in the middle of the night and shared all the mundane tasks that don't simply disappear because a baby has arrived. ""We'd joke that I did input and he did output,"" she said. ""It's hard for me to imagine what it would've been like if he hadn't been home for the full 12 weeks."" Smith believes she might have succumbed to post-partum depression without her husband's presence at home. With him around, she could take naps during the day and sleep for longer stretches at night, catching up on much-needed sleep to recover from childbirth. Not having to wake up and go to work in the morning made it easier on both of them. ""It was a wonderful time for our new family to bond and spend time together, build connections and connect over the new life we had,"" she said. ""Paid leave for parents to stay home with a newborn has been made into a privilege when it should be a basic right,"" she said. ""We need comprehensive policy reform to address how we as a nation care for our families. Everyone has the right to experience the bliss of staying home and being fully present for those first months. It's an issue of fairness."" In contrast, parents in Iceland each get three months of paid parental leave plus an additional three months that either can use. Icelandic parents can take their leave any time before the child turns 2. Tumi Ferrer, a head waiter at ReykjavÃ­k's Dill restaurant, took his paternity leave from May to July 2012, when his son, Kolbeinn was almost 1 year old. Like Schroeder, he took pleasure in the mundane tasks of staying home, doing dishes, cooking and bonding with his son. ""Those were the best things about parental leave, taking care of nothing else but him and the home; at peace,"" said Ferrer, 25. ""I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be not to have that experience because in my opinion, (even) three to six months for each parent is way too little."" CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this report.","Fathers say paternity leave lets them bond with newborns .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russia's upper house of parliament voted Wednesday to revoke the right of President Vladimir Putin to use troops in Ukraine as efforts continue to calm a separatist uprising in Ukraine's east. The Federation Council had approved Putin's request for a resolution allowing the use of force on March 1. But Tuesday, Putin sent a letter to the speaker of the upper house seeking to cancel the resolution. One lawmaker voted against revoking the powers Wednesday, with 153 in favor. Putin's request was made in light of ongoing talks on how to settle the crisis in Ukraine's eastern regions, said presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March when Russia annexed the previously Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and massed troops along other parts of its border with Ukraine. Ukraine's new President, Petro Poroshenko, declared a cease-fire last week in Kiev's fight against pro-Russia separatists in an effort to calm the situation. The violence continued Tuesday when Ukrainian authorities said pro-Russia militants shot down a military helicopter in eastern Ukraine, killing nine. However, peace talks involving representatives from all sides were under way Wednesday in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Ukraine's official Ukrinform news agency said. Those participating included Ukrainian government officials, pro-Russia separatists from the restive eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, Russian officials and members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States and Europe plan on additional sanctions against Russia, depending on what choices it makes ahead. Asked if the parliament vote to revoke Putin's power to use force in Ukraine was sufficient action to delay sanctions, Kerry said that he needed to see more. The parliamentary action is a positive step, Kerry said, but it could be easily reversed. The greatest difference will be made when Putin publicly calls for separatists in Ukraine to lay down their arms, Kerry said. NATO chief: Peace plan a step forward . NATO foreign ministers on Wednesday endorsed a package of support strengthening the ability of Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance, to defend itself. Agreed to after talks in Belgium with Ukraine's new foreign minister, Pavlo Klimkin, the package includes ""the creation of new trust funds to support defense capacity building in critical areas such as logistics, command and control, cyber defense and to help retired military personnel to adapt to civilian life,"" according to NATO. ""Ukraine has a clear vision for rebuilding its defense and security sector and a clear strategy for resolving the crisis,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. Poroshenko's peace plan is ""a major step forward and we fully support it,"" he added. Rasmussen also called on Russia ""to create conditions for the implementation of the peace plan, to end its support for separatist troops, and to stop the flow of weapons and fighters across its border."" The meeting comes ahead of a NATO summit in Wales in September ""at a time when security challenges are multiplying beyond our borders,"" Rasmussen said. ""Today we stressed the importance of our collective defense."" The ministers from the 28 NATO members -- some of whom are former Soviet states whose nerves have been frayed by Russia's actions against Ukraine -- also agreed to maintain the suspension of practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia. ""There will be no business as usual with Russia until Russia comes back into line with its international obligations,"" Rasmussen said. Coordinated sanctions . Kerry met with Klimkin ahead of Wednesday's talks. Kerry also met Tuesday evening with EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and representatives of other world powers, a senior State Department official said. Kerry discussed their joint support for Poroshenko's peace plan and the importance of preparing additional coordinated sanctions if Putin does not take further steps, the official said. The United States and European Union have already imposed targeted economic sanctions against certain Russians and companies over Russia's activities in Ukraine. The resolution authorizing Russia to use force in Ukraine was passed three weeks before Russia completed its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region, which other world powers condemned. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. Journalist Victoria Butenko and CNN's Lindsay Isaac and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","NATO agrees to a package of support to help Ukraine defend itself .

"(CNN) -- Joe Marshall was cruising across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge when a piece of steel and a giant cable crashed down. He was just 50 yards away. The iReporter was just far enough away that he didn't see the debris as it fell. But he did see cars quickly move to the right lanes to avoid the mess. The falling debris forced the closure of the bridge and snarled traffic between Oakland and San Francisco, California, as commuters look for alternate ways to get to and from the cities. It's also forcing structural engineers to look at key questions around the nation's infrastructure: Has the nation done enough to address crucial bridges two years after the tragic collapse of a bridge in Minnesota that killed 13 people? The answer, experts say, is no. The pieces that fell this week raise even more troubling issues because repairs had just been made in September to the same section of the 73-year-old bridge, which spans the San Francisco Bay and carries an average of 280,000 vehicles daily. Over Labor Day weekend, crews worked to repair a damaged steel beam. ""The bridge has been inspected, and it is now safer than when we closed it,"" Randell Iwasaki, the director of the California Department of Transportation, said at the time. Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a structural engineering professor at the University of California, Berkeley, says he's concerned that authorities took a ""Band-Aid"" approach in September. ""It failed,"" he said. He's worried about what he calls ""fracture-critical"" bridges: roughly 460 bridges across the country that are in dire need of repairs. ""Following the Minnesota bridge collapse, there was a lot of discussion because of emotions,"" he said. ""I didn't really see a sustained effort that says, 'We are going to replace these fracture-critical bridges.' "" Federal regulators said support plates that were about half as thick as they should have been were the likely cause of the August 1, 2007, bridge collapse in Minnesota that killed 13 people and injured 145. The gusset plates -- metal plates that are meant to strengthen joists -- are believed to have failed on the I-35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. A new bridge has since opened in Minnesota, what the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials hailed as one of the nation's Top 10 transportation feats this year. ""It is critical that our transportation systems receive the funding necessary to keep America moving. But even more important is that our state and local governments use that money to deliver projects that quickly meet the needs of our communities,"" John Horsley, the group's executive director, said in a recent report. But engineers say that's the problem: Repairs aren't happening quick enough. If a tragedy like the Minnesota collapse doesn't get people's attention, they wonder, what will? ""I have seen some lip service, but I have not seen a lot of momentum and action,"" said William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at UC-Berkeley. ""Part of that is due to the economic recession. When California has a budget deficit of $25 billion, they don't worry about bridges. They worry about closing the budget gap."" Fari Barzegar, a civil engineering consultant based out of Oakland, says the Minnesota collapse put critical bridge problems front and center before the American public. ""In the engineering community, we knew these things many years ago, and there were requests for money, which wasn't coming,"" Barzegar said. But he says funding hasn't kept up post-Minnesota. According to a 2009 American Society of Civil Engineers report, more than 26 percent of the nation's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimated in 2008 that it would cost roughly $140 billion to repair every deficient bridge in the country. Bridges are typically inspected every two years. ""If we don't start making substantial progress in five years, we will have more collapses,"" Ibbs said. The Bay Bridge opened in 1936 and spans 8.4 miles. It was the largest and most expensive bridge -- $77 million -- of its time. The bridge is best known to most Americans from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed during the quake, killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake-tolerant. Part of the bridge, the West Span, is a suspension bridge. The other portion of the bridge, known as the East Span, is a truss-cantilever design. This week's falling debris happened on the East Span, which is in the process of being replaced.","Falling debris on Bay Bridge raises questions about repairs after Minnesota collapse .

"(CNN) -- From a Chinese pop idol to a champion of ethnic minorities in China, singer Dadawa is a musician like no other. Dadawa, whose real name is Zhu Zheqin, was a student in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou when she won a TV talent competition in the early 1990s. But despite finding herself on the fast-track to pop stardom, she knew from a young age her life and musical career would take her away from the mainstream. ""(Growing up) I always have my own idea. I imagine one day I will be traveler, travel all around the world,"" she says. ""At that time I told my mother and the other kids and they were laughing at me. At that time China was like your mother, father work in a certain unit and child will follow them."" Her imagination and travel led her away from the Chinese pop scene to Tibet that inspired the 1995 album ""Sister Drum"". It struck a chord with a global audience -- it was the first time in 45 years that a Chinese album had been launched globally -- but also brought criticism from across China including those in Tibet. ""That's really, really surprising me,"" she says. ""For a time I was so miserable for that because I didn't expecting. And I am always hoping in the future, for some other young generation, like the artist, who don't have to face that sort of problem."" Before becoming Dadawa, Zhu also faced a problem with her name in attracting a global audience. Tibet and her interest in surrealism inspired the transformation. ""I was thinking what kind of name I should have, of course should be very simple, you know the vowels very common language pronunciation. So I'm thinking about it, and at that time I was traveling in Tibet; I'm so in love with Tibet,"" she says. ""So in Tibet, Dawa means moon. And I'm also interested in Dali-ism, which is surrealism. So I put two concepts together and make a new name for myself."" Zhu has recorded four albums as Dadawa since her 1995 debut, but she has also spent much of her time promoting the ethnic culture and music of China as a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. ""My thinking is that we have to do something definitely, especially for the ethnic minority culture. You know the people have liked the culture when we are traveling there, they say 'wow that's a fantastic culture'. But when we left they always think that it's so far away from us.... That's why I thought I should do something with connect with other people.""

"(CNN) -- The world of golf is eager to know when Tiger Woods will return to action after back surgery, yet not even the man himself can set a date. Woods was forced to pull out of the Masters for the first time last month after undergoing an operation on March 31 -- having struggled for several weeks with a pinched nerve in his back -- and he has been sidelined ever since. The surgery was successfully performed in Utah by neurosurgeon Dr Charles Rich, with the world No. 1 being told he needed time to rest and rehabilitate. But while the recovery time from such an operation is usually three to four months, Woods remains clueless as to when he will next tee off on a golf course. ""As I've said several times, I hope to be back sometime this summer, but I just don't know when,"" he wrote on his official website. ""I'm doing everything I can and listening to my doctors and working on a strength program, and then we just have to see how my back is. ""Some people heal up in three months, some people take four months, some people take longer. I just don't know."" Woods, who has begun cycling and swimming as he builds up his strength and fitness, had been struggling since last year with the back injury, which severely hampered his game in the opening months of 2014 leading up to the Masters. In March, the condition forced him to stop playing after 13 holes of his final round at the Honda Classic. When he tried to return to action the following week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami, he aggravated the injury. And he then withdrew from the Arnold Palmer Invitational, explaining that neither the back spasms nor pain had subsided. ""I made the decision to have surgery because physically I just couldn't make a golf swing. That pretty much sums it up,"" said the American. ""Once I begin swinging a club again, I'm not sure if I will have to make any changes to protect my back."" He added: ""We have to make sure my back heals fine and I have the strength and mobility going forward."" Had Woods been fit, he would be preparing to defend his title at the Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach this week, with the event getting underway Thursday. While he is frustrated to be missing out on the action, the 14-time major winner is at least encouraged by the slow-but-sure progress he is making. ""My recovery from microdiscectomy surgery for a pinched nerve in my back is coming along, but it's a very slow process,"" added Woods. ""I'm still sore. Not from the procedure itself but the incision. I just need to get back to my day-to-day activities, and that's it. ""One reassuring thing from my medical exam is I have zero arthritic changes whatsoever. I've kept myself in very good shape over the years, and it has paid off. ""We knew going into this procedure that it really helps to be strong, especially in my glutes and my abs. I was strong in both departments, and that helps with the recovery and rehab, and you're able to come back faster."" Woods has been in a similar situation before, having had to undergo surgery on his knee in 2008, while he has also struggled with an Achilles problem in the past. The 38-year-old is able to seek solace from such experiences on his road to recovery, and in turn allow himself to plan for an eventful second half of the 2014 season. ""It's a building process, just like when I came back from my knee and Achilles injuries. You start from the green and work your way back: putting, chipping, pitching, wedging, mid-irons, long irons, woods and eventually playing. That's all a process and takes time,"" he said,. ""There's the Greenbrier Classic [to look forward to] and the Open Championship, and of the course the U.S. Open is about six weeks away. You can understand why I want to hurry up and get better. I'd also like to play in the FedExCup Playoffs and the Ryder Cup.""","Tiger Woods unsure when he will return from back surgery .

"(CNN) -- For the Oscar-winner and Hollywood A-lister, family takes priority over career goals. A recent brief trip to Hong Kong to film ""Contagion"" directed by Steven Soderberg fitted in well with how she wants her life to be: an enjoyable cultural experience then back home to be with her family and continue her other projects that include charity work and the website ""GOOP"". ""I am never away from [my children] for longer than five days, a week at the most.... I do one film a year, and then I do the rest of my stuff at home,"" she told CNN. ""It is a balance. Sometimes I have to not do something that sounds really appealing, but it just doesn't work for my family. You can't have it all."" Despite recent roles in big budget Hollywood films like the ""Iron Man"" movies, and being in the luxurious position of being able to pick and choose what roles she wants, she refutes her star status. ""I mean technically I'm really not a movie star, you know I kind of do more independent movies. I mean sometimes I'm in movies that make a lot of money, but I don't think that's my niche."" Married to British musician Chris Martin since 2005, she has skillfully taken herself away from the flashbulbs of the paparazzi as much as she can. Yet she was once the subject to fevered media gossip, especially when she was engaged to Brad Pitt in the mid-1990s. But media intrusion is much worse now, she says. ""The funny thing about it is, when I look back now, it's nothing compared to what people go through now with the tabloids. I think it's ramped up to a whole other level. It was strange to be followed around and photographed,"" she said. ""But in the ensuing 15 years or whatever it has got a hundred times worse. When I see high profile relationships now, I think, 'Oh my God' even though I'm technically in one. But we sort of don't do anything public, we try to keep it behind the scenes as possible. Because it just generates more interest, and more paparazzi and being followed, and it just undermines the quality of your life. ""It's just unnecessary to be a public couple, and to have your couple-dom or whatever be its own entity, it doesn't make sense to have that in the public world."" However she did make public her struggle to cope with postpartum depression after the birth of her second child Moses in 2006. It was personally shocking and she felt it was an issue that needed more public attention. ""I hadn't heard anyone say, 'I'm having a very hard time connecting to this baby' so I could say, 'Me too'. ""I just thought 'I am a terrible mother, I'm a terrible person, how has this happened, what's wrong with me, I just don't feel well.' And luckily, after about four months, I started to really come out of it, because some women experience it for much, much longer,"" she said. ""But I think that it's so important for women to know that it happens, it's common, and there's nothing wrong with them, and they're not a bad mother, and to seek help if they need it or at least a support group.""","Gwyneth Paltrow was in Hong Kong filming 'Contagion', Steven Soderberg's new film .

"(CNN) -- Not there yet, but the future of drone flight in the United States took another important step on Monday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) selected six research sites to help it test and map out the best way to safely bring unmanned aircraft into the heavily used U.S. airspace. FAA Administrator Michael Heurta said the facilities, strategically located, will work with the agency to develop standardized procedures and regulations -- elements that govern all areas of aviation. ""With these sites, what we have is the platform to conduct broad based research considering a wide variety of different factors, and we'll see where the research takes us as we introduce these into the national airspace system,"" Huerta told reporters. The six sites are: the University of Alaska, the state of Nevada, Griffiss International Airport in Rome, New York, the North Dakota Department of Commerce, Texas A&M University -- Corpus Christi, and Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech's research will also include a collaboration with Rutgers University in New Jersey. The FAA said it considered a number of factors in selecting the sites, including differences in climate and geography, available infrastructure, aviation experience, aviation traffic volume, and specific research proposals. It is currently working with the selected applicants to determine the airspace for conducting research, including test flights. Research will cover safety and logistical concerns, including that drones can detect and avoid other aircraft, and that they operate safely if they lose their link to their pilot, who is at the controls in another location. The research will also concentrate on environmental impact of drone use, and developing pilot training and standardized regulatory requirements. Current law requires a case-by-case certificate of authorization in order to fly an unmanned aircraft in U.S. airspace. The facilities are part of a comprehensive roadmap that the FAA has developed at the behest of Congress to develop a plan to safely integrate privately operated unmanned aircraft by 2015. Huerta said the FAA will work to get all six facilities up and running as soon as possible, but Congress requires at least one facility be operational within six months. The sites will operate until February 2017. Unmanned aircraft systems are currently used for a variety of reasons, including border surveillance, scientific and environmental research, and to support law enforcement. Overseas, drones have become a key counterterror tool. But rapidly changing technology has opened the door to privately operated drone use for recreational and commercial purposes domestically. Not without a warrant: Illinois bans the use of drones for law enforcement . Amazon recently announced 30-minute package delivery system using drone-like ""octocopters."" The FAA has not yet signed off on Amazon's plans, which CEO Jeff Bezos says he hopes to have in place by 2015. There also have been concerns raised in Congress and elsewhere over privacy issues involving expanded domestic drone use. Huerta said he envisions a staged process as drone technology and usage evolves, and as ""we learn a lot more about what these aircraft are, how they interact with other aircraft, and what are the things that we have to consider as we integrate them into differing airspace and climatic considerations."" ""The important thing about today's announcement is it provides the platform for this research to really be carried out a very large scale across the entire country,"" Huerta said.","The Federal Aviation Administration announces sites for testing .
Drones are used overseas in counterterror operations .
But they are also becoming more popular in domestic security, law enforcement .

"(CNN) -- David Wallechinsky didn't invent what's on the Internet. It just seems that way. In 1977, Wallechinsky, his father Irving Wallace and his sister Amy Wallace published ""The Book of Lists."" The compendium of cleverly presented facts, such as ""15 People Who Became Words,"" ""10 Men Who Were Supported By Their Wives"" and ""6 Positions for Sexual Intercourse -- In Order of Preference,"" wasn't just simple enumeration. It featured detailed explanations about its subjects, proving itself a worthy and entertaining reference work. ""The Book of Lists"" immediately took its place on another list -- the bestseller list -- and spawned three sequels. More than three decades later, in the Internet age, its impact is everywhere. Countless websites, including CNN.com, have turned to lists -- sometimes in the form of galleries -- to help tell stories in a digestible way and boost page views. Topics range from ""History's Biggest Mysteries"" to ""13 Team Names That Will Make a Lot More Sense When You Know Their Origins"" to ""11 Things You Didn't Know About Spinal Tap."" Sure, you can't copyright an idea that goes back to God and Hammurabi, but one might think that Wallechinsky might be seething about seeing his child so misused. Not in the least, says the author, Olympic historian and creator of the website AllGov.com. ""I was thrilled when the Internet came around,"" he says. He understands that the list concept makes it easier to process information, and ""I'm glad to have done what I could."" These days, Wallechinsky, 66, devotes his time to AllGov.com, an attempt to create a different kind of information repository: a site all about the business of government, including details about dozens of government agencies and names of hundreds of government officials. Currently AllGov features the United States, California and France; plans call for it to cover every U.S. state and every country in the world. ""We pride ourselves on accuracy, double-checking,"" he says. ""The Internet is so full of junk and not-researched material. ... We try to emphasize policy instead of politics."" CNN spoke to Wallechinsky about lists, government and finding himself referenced on Wikipedia. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview. CNN: Have you ever reflected on the impact of ""The Book of Lists"" on the Internet as we know it? David Wallechinsky: Oh, sure. But I can't take credit because I have in my collection a book of lists that goes back to the 17th century. Certainly the ideas have been there. I was thrilled when the Internet came around. CNN: Why do you think the Internet is so full of lists? Wallechinsky: I think we live in an era of over-stimulation -- too much information -- so lists are a way of grasping that information. It just makes it easier to do 11 of this or 7 of that. It just makes it easier to sort out that overwhelming amount of information. CNN: What sites using lists do you admire? Wallechinsky: I like Mental Floss. I feel like they've picked up the baton and done a wonderful job. They just have great categories. I really admire their obscure categories. I think the best lists are the ones you can't just look up -- you have to really think about and research. The ones that aren't easy. CNN: When ""The Book of Lists"" came out in 1977, it was a huge bestseller. Did you expect the reaction? Wallechinsky: No, not really. My father and I had compiled a book, ""The People's Almanac,"" and one of the chapters was lists, just list-lists. We got a lot of feedback on the list chapter, and my father said, look at all this. What if we did a whole book of lists? So we did it, and we thought, why just do one through 10, when you can tell a little story behind it. I think that's what really made it a success. CNN: Many websites use lists for clickbait, not for shedding any light on the subject at hand. Does this bother you? Wallechinsky: Oh, sure. One thing I don't like is where there's a list or a gallery and you have to click for No. 2, click for No. 3, click for No. 4. They're just trying to get you to have more page views and sell more ads. I don't want to have to do that. I just want to see the list on one page. CNN: What's the story behind AllGov.com? Wallechinsky: I was looking at the budget of the United States and I was overwhelmed by how much I didn't know as someone who follows politics. Something like 95% of what the government did doesn't get covered. I asked (Parade magazine, where Wallechinsky was a contributing editor) if I could do this article on where our tax dollars go. They said go ahead. I (also) did a sidebar on ridiculous projects about to be funded. The one I picked out to visit was the Bridge to Nowhere, which wasn't so well known at the time, and it (became) the cover story. But when all the publicity about this died down, it was the other article I couldn't get out of my mind. So I made this list of more than 300 agencies in the U.S. government, their budget, how many people they employ and that's how I got the idea for AllGov. (The site's been live since 2009.) CNN: The Internet is supposed to be the great leveler, now that there's all this information out there. But are you concerned we get caught up in bread and circuses? The Bridge to Nowhere got a lot of attention partly because it had a catchy name. Wallechinsky: Yes, certainly that's the case. All I can do with AllGov is put it out there. If people are interested in the Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Grain Inspection Bureau, then they will find this, and they will find the only independent view on the Internet of it. CNN: Do you think the Internet has made us more tribal? Wallechinsky: You started to see that with the introduction of cable television. It used to be that everybody watched the same news channels and that was it. The minute cable came in, you got that breakup of what people were watching. The Internet is just an extension of that. But what makes the Internet so great is that it's interactive. You can see opposing sources -- if you know how to use it. I'm so honored it happened my lifetime, just from an information point of view. CNN: I can't be the first person to ask you about creating the Internet. Wallechinsky: I haven't looked in the last year or two, but at one point on Wikipedia it actually mentioned that either ""The People's Almanac"" or ""The Book of Lists"" was the progenitor of the Internet. (laughs) I don't know if it's still there.","David Wallechinsky's ""Book of Lists"" used an influential format now all over Web .

"(CNN) -- Starting Monday, students at the University of California Santa Barbara will be getting an unapproved vaccine scientists hope will stop a meningococcal disease outbreak there, the university said. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis already has approval for its vaccine Bexsero in Europe, Canada and Australia. It is not approved for use in the United States. In this case, the Food and Drug Administration had to grant special permission for its use at UCSB. The FDA granted special permission to use the vaccine at Princeton last December to fight an unrelated outbreak there. Meningitis B outbreaks are rare but deadly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis; some 160 of those were group B, the agency said. There were eight confirmed cases at Princeton and four UCSB students were confirmed as sick with meningococcal disease, which can cause meningitis or blood infections. One case at UCSB was so advanced, doctors had to remove a student's lower legs in November. Aaron Loy had been a promising lacrosse and soccer player. After his operation his parents asked the FDA to pick up the pace on Bexsero's approval. ""We hope that Aaron's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the FDA of the vaccine"" for the type B strain, Mike Loy said. There are vaccines approved in the United States for other types of meningitis, but group B is the strain that does ""pack the most powerful punch,"" the CDC said. College students are especially vulnerable. Students who drink a lot of alcohol can be particularly susceptible to catching it. Dorms are the perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak. Meningitis B spreads through coughing, sneezing, and kissing. It can also spread when people forget to wash their hands or clothes, or among people who drink out of the same cup. Meningitis B is tricky since students who catch it may first think they have the flu. It starts with flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, stiff necks, vomiting and delirium. If the bacteria spread to the protective tissue around the spinal cord and brain, known as the meninges, patients can suffer hearing loss, permanent neurological damage and even death. The CDC sent a team of scientists to UCSB to study the outbreak in December. Fortunately, scientists said, a meningitis B outbreak moves slowly than others. ""It smolders,"" said Dr. Tom Clark, the chief of the CDC's meningitis branch. ""You have a bit more time to get everything in place."" Bexsero will be offered to some 20,000 students at UCSB. More than 5,000 were vaccinated at Princeton University and they are currently getting a second dose which is necessary for full immunity. Novartis says it is seeking U.S. license for the vaccine's use in all adolescents and young adults which they say would ""enable immediate response to future outbreaks,"" according to its press release. ""These recent outbreaks remind us how unpredictable the disease can be,"" said Andrin Oswald, division head for Novartis Vaccines. His company has submitted successful test results from 8,000 vaccinations of adults, children, adolescents and infants. That test data was used for vaccine approval in other countries. ""We will continue to work with the FDA to pursue a potential license for Bexsero in the U.S. to help fulfill this public health need,"" Oswald said.","Some 20,000 UCSB students are offered the meningitis B vaccine .

"(CNN) -- ""I love you Luke!!"" That's how Ryan Bresette closed a Facebook post on Saturday, a day after his Kansas family -- fresh off a beachfront vacation -- experienced the unthinkable when a display board crashed down on them inside Alabama's Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. The crushing weight of the digital sign killed Luke Bresette and left his mother, Heather, in critical condition at a Birmingham hospital, officials said. ""Words cannot describe the pain we feel,"" Ryan Bresette wrote Saturday on Facebook, urging people attending church to wear sports jerseys to services in tribute to his sports-loving son. ""Thank you all for the love and support. Keep praying and praying and praying."" Posts on what appears to be Anna Bresette's Twitter page said that her mother, Heather, broke both her ankles and her left pelvis; her brother Tyler suffered a concussion; and another brother, Sam, broke his left leg and nose. Justin Cohen, from Children's of Alabama hospital, told CNN on Saturday night that Tyler and Sam Bresette were in fair condition. ""Seeing all these little kids in the hospital breaks my heart,"" Anna Bressette wrote. What caused the large digital sign -- which showed when and where flights were arriving to and departing -- to collapse around 1:30 p.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Friday? On Saturday, authorities still didn't know. ""(Birmingham Airport Authority) President and CEO Al Denson and the staff are continuing to work with officials to investigate,"" said Gaynell Hendricks, the chairwoman of the authority's board. ""This includes discussions with contractors, subcontractors that are responsible for the modernization of the ... airport."" The incident happened in a new part of the airport, in a public area before security checkpoints. According to CNN affiliate WVTM, the area opened up March 13 and includes a covered parking deck, children's play area, eating establishments, a new baggage system and other features. Larry Snyder was riding up the escalator when he saw the display board fall, telling CNN affiliate WIAT that one family was especially affected. ""The family was crushed, little kids crushed underneath the sign. And everybody was scattering to lift it up,"" Snyder said, adding that he was among those who helped. Video footage showed people sweeping up the area and a cut-out spot along a wall with protruding wires, where the sign once stood. Whatever the reason, it was clear the Overland Park, Kansas, family was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Birmingham Mayor William Bell said he'd met with Luke's father, describing him as a ""heartbroken"" man who ""wants and deserves answers."" ""I cannot come close to understanding his heartache,"" the mayor said in a statement. ""But I will get answers."" Luke Bresette was a fifth grader at St. Thomas More, a Catholic school in Kansas City, Missouri, according to CNN affiliate KCTV. Father Don Farnan, a priest of the affiliated parish, described him as a ""normal kid"" who'd been on the city champion basketball team and was always at Mass on Sunday mornings. ""He lived a good moral life,"" Farnan told the Kansas City station. ""He was shaped with the behaviors and the attitudes and the strength of what helps make society a good one."" In the days prior, Ryan Bresette had put up several messages and photos on Facebook about the family's vacation in Destin, Florida -- including several showing two of his sons playing in the Gulf water, with no one else in sight. His post Saturday, by contrast, reflected his grief and affection for his late son. ""I miss and love Luke so very much."" CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Two brothers of the boy killed are in fair condition at an Alabama hospital .

"(CNN) -- Meet Heidi Klum: supermodel. Reality-show host. Danger to Web users everywhere. That's according to an annual list from Web security company McAfee, which ranks the year's ""Most Dangerous Celebrities"" online. The list is based on the likelihood that spammers, scammers or other ne'er-do-well residents of the Internet will use each celebrity's name to lure unsuspecting clickers to sites that host viruses and other malicious software. ""While slightly safer than last year, searching for top celebrities continues to generate risky results,"" said Paula Greve, director of Web security research at McAfee. ""Consumers should be particularly aware of malicious content hiding in 'tiny' places like shortened URLs that can spread virally in social networking sites or through e-mails and text messages from friends."" Klum, a former Victoria's Secret model who produces and hosts ""Project Runway,"" replaces last year's No. 1 celebrity, Cameron Diaz. According to McAfee, searching for Klum's name yields a nearly 1-in-10 chance of hitting a link that leads to a malicious site. Diaz slipped to second while, in what can only be called a surprise performance, CNN's own Piers Morgan (also a judge on ""America's Got Talent"") snagged the No. 3 spot. In addition to spurring questions about how he landed amongst a bevy of models and actresses, Morgan is the only man to make the top 10 list other than Brad Pitt, who barely made it in a three-way tie for 10th with Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams. Rounding out the top 10 were actresses Jessica Biel, Katherine Heigl, Mila Kunis, Anna Paquin and Scarlett Johansson and Victoria's Secret model (we're seeing a trend here) Adriana Lima. According to McAfee, sports stars and singers are a safer search than actors and models. Tennis stars Maria Sharapova and Andy Roddick, who came in at Nos. 13 and 14 last year, respectively, dropped to 44th and 56th on this year's list. Justin Bieber tallied only a 49th-place finish (tweens rejoice!), and Lady Gaga came in at No. 58.","Model, reality host Heidi Klum top's McAfee's list of Web's most dangerous celebrities .

"Cancun, Mexico (CNN) -- Latin American and Caribbean leaders meeting in Mexico approved the creation of a regional organization Tuesday that leaves out the United States and Canada. Approval for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States came from heads of state attending the final session of a two-day ""Unity Summit"" near the Mexican beach resort of Cancun. More than 30 heads of state attended the meeting hosted by Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Creation of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, which would bring together the region's 33 countries, was a top item on the agenda. Some leaders see it as an attempt to counterbalance the Organization of American States, in which the United States and Canada are members. The pledges of unity came one day after Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe got into a shouting match at a private luncheon for the heads of state. Tensions cooled Tuesday, with both nations saying they are willing to work within the framework of the new agreement to improve relations. In an exclusive interview with CNN en Español's Carmen Aristegui, Chavez gave his version of the headline-grabbing incident. ""What I did was respond. (Uribe) could not stand my reasoning and exploded,"" Chavez said. ""He said harsh things, I said harsh things, and then Raul Castro came and Calderon came and we sat down and talked, and continued."" Uribe had accused Chavez of enforcing an economic embargo on many Colombian goods, something that Chavez denied. ""I think that if the table hadn't been there as an obstacle, and our friends weren't sitting right there, that President Uribe physically would've attacked me,"" Chavez said. ""If this unfortunate incident served as catharsis for Uribe, and he can sleep well tonight because he told me what he wanted to tell me, then may he sleep peacefully. I am willing to speak with him, just like we have talked about a million times."" Published reports Tuesday in major newspapers in Colombia, Argentina, Spain and other nations said Uribe told Chavez to ""be a man,"" to which the Venezuelan leader replied ""go to hell,"" something that Chavez confirmed to Aristegui. In the interview, Chavez also addressed the creation of the new regional community and speculation that its addition may compete with the OAS. ""I think that it will be in addition to the OAS, and that the OAS will disappear in the future,"" Chavez said. The importance of the new organization, he said, is that it allows the region to work together without the overbearing influence of the United States. Referring to the United States, Chavez said, ""The 'gringo' empire has always wanted us to be at odds, divided, to impede what has started here, which I think is the most important: true integration from Mexico to Argentina."" The two nations have had poor relations for years, but they worsened last year when Uribe signed an agreement with the United States to allow the U.S. military to use some Colombian bases. Tensions have escalated as the countries have accused each other of attempts to destabilize the other. Colombia has said Chavez's government aids Marxist guerrillas waging war on Colombia, particularly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. Colombia bombed a FARC stronghold in Ecuador in March 2008, prompting Chavez to take Ecuador's side and move tanks to Venezuela's border with Colombia. Chavez also took economic and trade measures against Colombia that Uribe likened to an embargo at Monday's heated luncheon. Chavez, in turn, has accused Colombia of sending unmanned planes to spy on Venezuela. Monday's confrontation was not the first time in recent years that Chavez has had a run-in with a foreign leader. ""Why don't you shut up?"" Spanish King Juan Carlos asked Chavez during an Ibero-American summit in Chile in November 2007. Chavez had been criticizing former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, calling him a fascist several times. In September 2006, Chavez referred to then-U.S. President George W. Bush as the devil during a speech before the United Nations General Assembly. ""The devil came here yesterday,"" Chavez told U.N. delegates and world leaders. ""It still smells of sulfur today.""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The failed computer system that caused flight delays across the country has been restored, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday. FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto said the system went out at 5:06 a.m. ET and came back on about five hours later. He said officials working to pinpoint the cause know that there was a problem with the main telecommunications systems. ""It was an efficiency problem rather than a safety problem, but it was a serious efficiency problem,"" Takemoto said. Due to the outage, air traffic controllers had to enter flight plans manually, a problem that causes delays, according to the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The air traffic controllers' group said the problem will cause flight delays throughout the day because of a ""domino effect."" ""Air traffic controllers are without electronic decision-making tools and cannot keep up with the sheer numbers of flights -- resulting in delays,"" the controllers' group said in a statement during the outage. ""Air traffic controllers on the ground at major airports are getting no automated flight plan information and have to enter that information manually, a cumbersome and time-consuming process."" Carmen McDonald was among those passengers inconvenienced by flight delays when the computerized system that airlines use to file flight plans failed for several hours Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia, and Salt Lake City, Utah. McDonald said she thought her Spirit Airlines flight would leave on time around 7 a.m. ET from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But the 39-year-old model sat for an hour and 15 minutes amid the noise of loud kids before the plane was ready to leave a logjammed runway and take off to Boston, Massachusetts. ""I'm frustrated,"" she said, distracted by using Twitter and calling on her cell phone as her plane sat planted on the runway. ""I have somewhere to be."" iReporter records video from tarmac . AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline had canceled 22 flights around the country as of 8 a.m. ET and had delayed dozens more because of the flight plan filing system problem. He said most of the canceled flights were in Atlanta, AirTran's hub of operations, and others are spread throughout the country. White said the problem will have ""a pretty major impact on operations"" and the cancellations will have a ripple effect. ""We will be a mess all day,"" he said. AirTran, which operates about 700 flights a day, asked customers to check airtran.com before showing up at the airport. Delta Air Lines spokeswoman Susan Elliott said the airline was not providing numbers on how many flights were affected. But she said that Delta will give travelers some flexibility in rescheduling. American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith said that 300 to 500 flights had been delayed, virtually every one scheduled for takeoff. The longest delays have been a little more than an hour, but no flights have been canceled, and some might be consolidated, he said. ""Things are moving; they are just moving more slowly,"" Smith said, adding that American has been affected at LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports in New York as well as in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois. Smith said the problem reflects that the U.S. air traffic control system operates with what he calls ""1960s technology"" and needs to be modernized. US Airways spokesman Morgan Durrant said the airline had a few delays across the system, including some as long as 30 minutes but it doesn't anticipate any more. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport said officials there were ""monitoring the situation regarding the FAA's automated flight plan system."" ""The airport is working to minimize the impact on customers by bringing in additional staff and ensuring that all facilities are operational and fully maintained. All passengers are encouraged to contact the airlines regarding the statuses of their flights before they head to the airport,"" the airport said. At Indianapolis International Airport, most morning flights left on time with little impact from the computer glitch, but inbound flights from large hubs are expected to be delayed Thursday and possibly into Friday, said spokeswoman Susan Sullivan. The airport asked concessionaires to beef up staffing levels and has added employees to keep the facility clean and the passengers comfortable. The system -- the National Airspace Data Interchange Network, or NADIN -- appears to be the same one that failed in August 2008. The FAA said the information in the network is data required to launch planes expeditiously. Airplane safety was not affected, the FAA said, adding that planes in the air had radar coverage and communication. Weather also might have played a role in Northeast flight delays. The air traffic controllers said ""weather equipment was affected"" and information such as winds speeds was not ""processing."" The controllers said that ""airport efficiency is being cut at least [in] half at places like New York-JFK"" and that in the ""New York airspace, controllers are forced to put 20 miles of space between aircraft.""

"(CNN) -- To look at Julianne Talley, a statuesque 61-year-old beauty, one would never know she has conquered both obesity and cancer. The Ms. Senior Florida contestant glided through the Vero Beach High School Performing Arts Center with the humility of someone who underestimates her beauty. Little did she know, she was about to be crowned Ms. Senior Florida 2014. Talley's platform is one of self-acceptance and self-improvement: ""It's a message to the woman in the audience who thinks 'I'm always going to be heavy' or 'I can't dance'... yes you can,"" she said during dress rehearsal. While we're accustomed to beauty pageants featuring women in their 20s strutting in bikinis, the Ms. Senior America pageant seeks women with ""dignity, maturity and inner beauty,"" who are older than 60. There's no upper age limit and no bikinis are required. The oldest contestant in Florida this year was 86. Pageant organizers Hedi Headley and Helen McKnight worked for months gathering contestants from around the state of Florida. The 15 women who were selected rehearsed almost every week between January and March. The ladies were judged on their interview, philosophy of life, talent and gown presentation during the March 29 competition. The Ms. Senior America Pageant has been around for 35 years, but the state level competitions vary in their founding year. Headly and McKnight originally founded the Ms. Senior Arizona Pageant in 1990, when they weren't even 50 yet themselves. ""We saw a need to encourage the older adult and especially women that feel they become invisible as they age,"" said Headly. Semi-retired in Florida, Headly and McKnight took over running the Ms. Senior Florida Pageant last year. The contestants evolved before Headly's eyes. ""Most of the ladies have never even talked into a microphone before rehearsals,"" she said. The granny of yesteryear, sitting in a rocking chair knitting, is a thing of the past if the pageant is any indication. Today, women over 60 are rocking it on stage: singing, dancing, sharing their inventions and even belly dancing at senior beauty pageants around the country. The Ms. Senior pageants give contestants a chance to do something many of them never dreamed of doing in their 20s, 30s or even 50s -- take the spotlight and share their wisdom and talent with hundreds of people. In addition to the crown, Talley won ""Best Talent"" for singing and playing ""Sentimental Journey"" on the piano. Talley faced a long journey to get where she is today. Overweight most of her life, 10 years ago, she lost 100 pounds and kept it off. ""I decided to enter the competition after a lot of thought and prayer, when I realized that it was an opportunity to reach my dream to touch women across the country, to inspire them to take better care of themselves, and to set goals, dream dreams, and do what it takes to reach those goals,"" said Talley . She wants to encourage other women to become physically fit even as seniors, which is a message she will take to the Ms. Senior America Pageant this October at the Resorts Hotel Casino in Atlantic City. ""It has been my dream to reach women across the country to encourage them that we 'ain't dead yet'!"" said Talley. The second runner-up was Ann Palle, a 60-year-old baton twirler who leads a 105-person senior citizen baton twirling team that performs in about 55 shows a year. The oldest twirler is 95. ""It's nice to get together with these ladies because we all bring something very different, but this pageant brings us together,"" Palle said. Each of these women has a distinct philosophy, and if laughter is the key to longevity, Lauren Luccini ""Miss Congeniality,"" will live forever. ""When I used to date, men used to open the car door for you,"" she told the audience in her standup comedy routine during the talent competition. ""Now, I'm glad if they even stop the car."" Then there was, Julie Dohan, who at 81 went from modeling to art dealing to inventing, but believes ""the best is yet to come."" Raven-haired contestant Lucille DiBartolo is a 79-year-old Mediterranean beauty who still gets carded for proof of her senior citizenship. (Full disclosure: This lovely lady is my grandmother, and I attended the pageant to support her.) Encouraging young women to be more confident, she added that, ""it's not who you are but who you perceive yourself to be."" Last year's winner, Betsy Horn, stopped by to encourage the women. An ovarian cancer survivor, Horn wrote a book, ""A Little Touch of Cancer and How it Made Me Well,"" and encourages women to share their inspirational stories, which can come from hardship. ""You can't get through life without having some event that happens that challenges one deeply and emotionally,"" she said. ""As you get to know the ladies, you realize that everyone does have a story and that they were survivors."" Horn had high praise for 2014's Ms. Senior Florida contestants: ""I came away this year thinking these women all have a lot to offer, so they should all get out there and do something!""","The Ms. Senior Florida Pageant was held March 29 in Vero Beach, Florida .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities have stripped former leader Bo Xilai of his legislative membership, and prosecutors announced they have him under criminal investigation, state-run news agency Xinhua reported Friday. Once a rising political star, Bo's fall has thrown the ruling Communist Party into its biggest crisis in decades. The People's Congress of Chongqing, a southwestern metropolis governed by Bo until early this year, has removed his national delegate status, Xinhua said. The moves come ahead of China's 18th Party Congress, which is convening next month in Beijing. The body will decide who will occupy the top positions in the party hierarchy. Leadership changes once every decade. The Communist Party expelled Bo last month. His leadership positions were taken away in April. Timeline: Bo Xilai's fall from grace . Bo was once a contender for the Politburo Standing Committee, the team of nine politicians who effectively rule China. But he recently has come under scrutiny, and news reports say he is accused of corruption, abuse of power and improper sexual relationships. Investigators determined that his behavior tarnished the party's reputation, Xinhua reported, and discovered ""clues to his suspected involvement in other crimes."" The party investigators have sent their conclusions to judicial authorities. The report said Bo made ""severe mistakes"" related to the killing of a British businessman -- a crime for which Bo's wife was imprisoned -- and a diplomatic incident involving his former police chief in Chongqing, Xinhua said. It also cited influence peddling, bribery and womanizing as details found in the course of the party's investigation. Bo is a charismatic and controversial politician. He launched a ""smashing black, singing red"" campaign in the southwestern city of Chongqing that promoted Communist ideology and zealously cracked down on organized crime. His economic programs, which included millions spent on social welfare, made him a popular leader in Chongqing. But analysts say his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform-oriented faction that dominates the current party leadership. Bo's fortunes changed when the dramatic scandal involving him and his inner circle began to seep into the public realm. His wife, Gu Kailai, and family aide Zhang Xiaojun were arrested in early April, suspected of poisoning British businessman Neil Heywood. Heywood died in November in Chongqing, where Bo was the Communist Party chief. His death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption. Bo was soon stripped of his top posts for ""serious breach of discipline."" In August, his wife received a suspended death sentence after a seven-hour trial. Days later, four senior Chongqing police officers were also sentenced to jail for covering up the murder. In an e-mail dated early October obtained by CNN, Bo Guagua, the son of Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai who lives in the United States, reiterated his belief in his parents' innocence and asked his maternal grandmother to find a lawyer for his father. ""Although I miss my parents every minute, I feel they are with me in my heart,"" the younger Bo wrote. ""Wherever they are, they will hold their heads high and be the fearless and transparent people that they are."" ""I don't know politics -- but since the state wants to have the rule of law, I believe its decision on my father also must go through a fair legal process,"" he continued. ""Now I am helpless and you are the person closest to me -- I would like to entrust you with the task of finding an appropriate lawyer to defend my father."" A friend of the Bo family, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the story, told CNN the family has hired two Beijing-based lawyers to represent the former politician in impending criminal proceedings. The lawyers have not been allowed to visit Bo but they don't expect a trial to take place for another few months, the friend added. Wang Lijun, the former police chief of Chongqing, set off the Bo story on February 6, when he fled to the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu and told American diplomats that Gu was a suspected accomplice in a murder case. After his request for asylum was turned down, Wang left the consulate and was taken away by Chinese officials. But his accusations rocked the world's most populous nation. Wang was sentenced to 15 years in prison last month for defection, cover-up, bribe taking and abuse of power. The party expelled Bo after an investigation of the killing and Wang's visit to the consulate, a trip made ""without permission,"" Xinhua said. The investigators said Bo ""bore major responsibility"" in the Wang incident and the killing, Xinhua reported.

"(CNN) -- For the first time since his release, Russian dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky is telling the world about the 10 years he spent behind bars as a critic of the Kremlin. The oil magnate, who backed an opposition party, had been in prison since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. He was due for release next year, but President Vladimir Putin signed an amnesty decree for him Friday. In his first television interview, the former Yukos oil tycoon told CNN's Christiane Amanpour there were no conditions for his release. ""Mr. Putin, on a number of times, publicly said that he was ready to consider the question of my pardoning -- but I had to say I was guilty for that,"" Khodorkovsky said during the interview in Berlin. ""That was an unacceptable condition for me."" Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man. Countries such as the United States have accused Russia of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system. Khodorkovsky made a fortune in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union and used the wealth of his Yukos oil company to enter Russian opposition politics. He has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s. While in prison, Khodorkovsky said, he was stabbed in the face. ""When I was stabbed with a knife I was lucky -- he tried to get to my eye but he got my nose,"" he said. ""As a result, the dentist who was there -- someone who was also a plastic surgeon -- carried out an operation on me, which means it was virtually not noticeable."" Putin's decision to pardon Khodorkovsky, who was supposed to be released next August, is seen by many as an effort to improve the country's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. Officials say Khodorkovsky was released on humanitarian grounds because his mother is ill. When asked whether he forgives Putin, the former political rival replied, ""I would put it differently, perhaps. I don't think that revenge would be any rational behavior. And something that is rational behavior I can always deal with."" 'Not interested in a fight for power' Speaking at a press conference at the Berlin Wall Museum on Sunday, Khodorkovsky thanked those who stood by him and aided in his release. He said he was still thinking about his future plans. ""I do not intend to be involved in political activity. ... I intend to be involved in social activities,"" he said, adding he also did not intend to go back into business. ""I am not interested in a fight for power."" Khodorkovsky said many political prisoners remain behind bars in Russia and urged Western politicians to keep that in mind when they meet Putin. ""You should not see me as a symbol that there are no political prisoners left in Russia,"" Khodorkovsky said. ""I am a symbol that the efforts of civil society may lead to the release of people whose release was not expected by anyone."" CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Diana Magnay and Olga Pavlova contributed to this report.","NEW: Khodorkovsky says he'll be involved in ""social activities,"" not politics or business .

"Washington (CNN) -- During his two weeks aboard a ship to the United States, Ahmed Abu Khatallah was questioned by FBI interrogators over his alleged role in the 2012 Benghazi attacks that left four Americans dead. As it turns out, he was interrogated both before and after authorities told him of his Miranda rights -- which give him the right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination, a U.S. official told CNN. But Abu Khatallah continued providing information to officials after being advised of those rights, the official said. The handling of his case has triggered fallout in Washington. ""I have serious concerns that conducting a rushed interrogation onboard a ship and then turning Abu Khatallah over to our civilian courts risks losing critical intelligence that could lead us to other terrorists or prevent future attacks,"" Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, said in a statement Saturday. A U.S. official told CNN that Abu Khatallah denied participation in the Benghazi attacks during his interviews with interrogators -- but provided information on others he said participated and were behind the attacks. It wasn't clear if he provided the information before or after he was advised of his Miranda warning. Shortly after the White House announced the capture earlier this month, Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio criticized the Obama administration because they believed the alleged terrorist should go through a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay instead of being tried in a federal court. ""If they bring him to the United States, they're going to Mirandize this guy, and it would be a mistake for the ages to read this guy his Miranda rights,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham has said. But the White House has defended its decision, saying that they have successfully tried a number of terrorists domestically and that no new captives have gone to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in years. Abu Khatallah arrived on U.S. soil Saturday. After two weeks aboard the USS New York sailing from the Mediterranean Sea to the East Coast, Abu Khatallah was flown by helicopter to Washington and was driven to a federal courthouse. There, he pleaded not guilty to one count of providing material support to terrorists. Prosecutors say he is the ringleader of the 2012 attacks on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, which killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans. More charges possible . The single count is part of a legal strategy by federal prosecutors, who plan to file additional charges later, according to U.S. officials. The aim is to delay releasing to the public and Abu Khatallah's lawyer the FBI affidavit detailing the evidence the government has against him. An earlier criminal complaint in July 2013 said the FBI believed it had evidence to charge him with murder and firing a weapon at the scene of the Benghazi attacks. Those additional charges, if formally added, could bring the death penalty. In his court appearance, Abu Khatallah, a Libyan national, requested consular assistance from the Libyan government. U.S. authorities were working with Libyan embassy officials in Washington to provide him the assistance. After the hearing, armed guards accompanied Abu Khatallah from the federal courthouse in downtown Washington, a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol and near the White House. He was then moved to the detention center in Alexandria, Virginia, which is across the Potomac River from the capital. Details of the attacks . Authorities say Abu Khatallah is among the senior leaders of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the attacks on U.S. government facilities in Benghazi on September 11-12, 2012. The attacks spawned political controversy in the United States because some Republican lawmakers claim the Obama administration tried to mislead the public about them and should have done more to prevent them. The GOP critics say they plan to make Benghazi an issue for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, under whose watch the attacks occurred, should she decide to run for president. The criminal investigation led by the FBI has been extraordinarily challenging, authorities say, partly because the lack of Libyan government control in the city prevented investigators from visiting the crime scene for weeks. But U.S. officials say they collected surveillance video, phone recordings and witness statements to bring charges against Abu Khatallah and others involved. Abu Khatallah became the face of the militant attack and a top target for the U.S. after he cultivated a celebrity profile in the wake of the attacks, meeting with journalists and granting interviews. He denied to CNN's Arwa Damon that he participated in the attacks. U.S. military commandos captured Abu Khatallah in a nighttime raid June 15-16. U.S. intelligence assets concocted a ruse to lure him to a villa where the Americans surprised him. The commandos, accompanied by several FBI agents, had come ashore by boat and quickly took him back out to sea with them. Abu Khatallah was appointed a public defender, Michele Peterson. He was ordered to remain in custody until hearings set for Wednesday and Friday. Timeline of the Benghazi attack . What's next for Benghazi terror suspect?

"(CNN) -- As darkness falls on Copacabana, the floodlights flick on and locals gather for a game of kick-about late into the night. The bars, restaurants, sidewalks and beaches of Rio de Janeiro all seem to pulse to the beat of football. It's a Brazilian love affair that dates back to 1894 when Charles William Miller -- a Brazilian of English-Scottish decent -- returned from studying in England to help establish the Sao Paulo Football Club, bringing with him some equipment, a rule-book and two balls. One was round and one was oval shaped. Football was quickly adopted and thrived, but rugby remained in the shadows of its closest competitor, a sport largely played by expatriates from rugby-playing nations. But times are changin' in Brazil. New opportunities are bringing new life to an old game and over the past five years 10,000 Brazilian players have taken up the sport. Rugby sevens' inclusion in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, with a guarantee of automatic qualification for the home nation, has encouraged new clubs to spring up in diverse and remote regions across the country with players seeking to represent their country. Part of this rugby revolution are four Rio brothers -- Max, Marcos, Maicon and Maxwilliam Paixao -- who live in the Cantagalo favela, one of the city's largest slums, perched on the hillside above Ipanema Beach. All four siblings play to a high standard, but Marcos has already represented Brazil Internationally and shows huge promise. They reside in a toppling multistory space which is held together with brick, plastic and corrugated iron in the heart of Cantagalo. ""Because the family kept on growing we converted it,"" Marcos told CNN. ""On the ground floor is my mother, my dad. The second my sister and her children ... above that my sister with her daughter. Above is me, my brother, cousin and his baby. He's on one side, I'm on the other with that little window."" On the top floor, stuck to the left panel of the little window is a sticker saying ""I LOVE RUGBY"" -- the only visible evidence that one of Brazil's brightest rugby talents lives here. Like many sports that make inroads in Brazil, the brothers' first encounter with rugby came on the beach. ""A friend of mine used play on the beach,"" explains Marcos. ""Out of curiosity I asked him what rugby was and he said, 'C'mon I'll show you.' ""At first I didn't want to because it seemed like a violent sport. The following week I went to watch and they asked me to join them, so I did. I've stayed ever since."" The brothers are being helped to achieve their potential by Rio Rugby, one of several initiatives designed to grow the game in Brazil. ""Rugby welcomed us like a family and we accepted it like a family. It showed us things, like how to respect others,"" adds Marcos. Just as importantly, rugby has helped provide a respite from the toughness of favela life. ""A lot of people who grow up here in this community don't have the mentality to do anything,"" says Marcos. ""They think they're 'made-men,' but no ... The education that my parents gave me -- to follow what is right and leave what is wrong behind -- is just like rugby. ""They've helped us to not only stay in the favelas but take us out of the community and travel."" Efforts by the Rio authorities to squeeze out criminal gangs and drug lords in order to make the area safer for its residents have led to an escalation of tension with the police, who have been criticized for their heavy handed and some times violent approach. Against that backdrop the boys continue their training, using a small clearing outside their home when space on the beaches and practice areas is in short supply. ""This was something crazy that I came up with,"" says Marcos, pointing to a set of handmade weights -- four metal bars and plastic tubs filled with cement. ""I've been playing rugby for some time now, and I made this out of concrete because I wanted to grow stronger. It struck me as something that I needed to do."" Down on the vast expanse of Ipanema beach, laughing and joking the brothers deftly toss the rugby ball to and fro. When their feet touch the sand they launch into action, leaping, spin-passing and sprinting, demonstrating well-rehearsed drills. Paixao means ""passion"" in Portuguese, and these brothers are full of it. Beside them a group of locals are playing football, but the boys don't give them a second glance. Even in World Cup year, Brazil doesn't begin and end with football, and rugby is beginning to march to the beat of its own drum.","Rugby arrived in Brazil at the same time as football .
While football thrived immediately, rugby has taken longer .
But inclusion of rugby sevens in 2016 Olympics has encouraged its growth ."
"(CNN) -- The Obama administration urged Qatar on Thursday to allow an American couple convicted of wrongdoing in the death of their adopted daughter to return to the United States. A heightened State Department appeal comes after the family increased pressure on U.S. officials to do more to secure the release of Matthew and Grace Huang. When their daughter, Gloria, died in January 2013, the couple was immediately arrested on charges they starved her to death. The Huangs, who maintained their daughter suffered from an eating disorder, have denied any wrongdoing in connection with her death and are fighting the conviction. Matthew Huang was employed in Doha by an international company working on construction projects for the 2022 World Cup. Convicted at trial . After a lengthy trial, the Huangs were convicted of endangering the life of their child. They were sentenced in April to three years in prison. The State Department has expressed concern about the fairness of the legal proceedings in the case and disappointment in the verdict. It suggested that cultural misunderstandings were at the heart of the charges and that the evidence provided by the defense was not carefully considered. Several U.S. officials have privately expressed confidence in the Huang's innocence, but have sought to exhaust all legal proceedings before seeking the Qatari government's direct intervention in the case. After spending nearly a year in prison, the couple was released last November. They are prohibited from leaving Qatar during their appeal. The case suggested racial overtones when questions were raised by the prosecutor and police about why the Huangs, who are Asian, adopted children from Africa. State Department meeting . The Qatari prosecutor has sought to paint Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane, alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty-stricken parents in Africa and has since threatened to seek human trafficking charges. The Huangs also have two adopted sons from Africa. On Wednesday, Grace's brother, Daniel Chin, met with lawmakers and administration officials in Washington, urging them to make the Huang's case a greater priority. He met with Assistant Secretary Anne Patterson and Undersecretary Wendy Sherman. Chin said he was assured more efforts would be made on behalf of his sister and her husband. ""Our family cannot afford to take people's word,"" Chin said. ""We are starting to feel as if the State Department is abandoning Matt and Grace and our family."" Chin, who has given up his job in California to work on the case full time, does weekly skype chats with the Huangs and has traveled several times to Doha for their judicial proceedings, which the Qatari court continues to postpone. ""Justice deferred is justice denied,"" Chin said. ""Enough is enough."" Difficult spot . The case puts the United States in a difficult situation with a close ally it is working with on hot-button issues in the Middle East, including the civil war in Syria and the conflict in Gaza. The Qatari government also helped the United States secure the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity this year. ""We understand there are a lot of delicate things going on,"" Daniel said. ""We understand Qatar is a big ally. But in all the discussions they are having with Qatar, why can't they bring more attention to the urgency of Matt and Grace's case? Seems obvious to me."" On Thursday, the State Department issued a statement saying that ""assisting U.S. citizens in need overseas was among the department's highest priorities."" ""The State Department will continue to engage Qatari officials at the highest levels. We seek the Qatari government's assistance in providing a fair and expeditious conclusion to the proceedings,"" spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement. ""We also urge the Qatari government to lift the current travel ban and allow Mr. and Mrs. Huang to return home to the United States to be reunited with their two sons and the rest of their family,"" she said. Two sons back in U.S. The couple's two sons were temporarily placed in a Qatari orphanage after the couple's arrest, but have since been back to the United States to live with Grace Huang's mother. ""It is heartbreaking to watch this family go through this,"" says Eric Volz, who heads up the firm David House that is assisting with the Huangs case. ""Matt and Grace are fearful to go out in public. Being so far away and isolated and unable to be with their children is extremely stressful."" The case has garnered international attention and raised questions in the media about the prosecution, the overall fairness of the Qatari justice system. ""The Huangs case highlights the risks of Americans traveling to Qatar,"" says Richard Grenell, a spokesman for David House. ""You could find yourself having to deal with an Islamic country's legal system with rules of evidence and procedures based on the whims of judges and their government controllers.""","State Department steps up pressure on Qatar over U.S. couple's conviction .

"Berlin (CNN) -- The story of the so-called Forest Boy -- a riddle that has perplexed people in Germany and elsewhere for months -- is a lie, police in Germany said Friday. The 20-year-old hoaxer, who claimed he was 17 and lived in the German woods for five years, is actually from Hengelo, in the Netherlands. He never lived in the forest and made his way to Berlin some time last year, police said. He had been declared missing in September when he was 19. But because he was an adult and could determine where he wanted to live, there was no further investigation by Dutch authorities, police in Germany said. Police say the man has admitted his story is a lie and confirmed his identity. He will have to leave a Berlin city youth home since he is not under age. The hoax ended after German police released a photograph of who they said was a 17-year-old known only as ""Ray"" who turned up at Berlin City Hall last year after claiming to have been living in the woods for five years. Police say that not long after the first pictures of the man were published, a female acquaintance recognized him and told a Dutch TV network. The network informed the Dutch police, who then notified authorities in Berlin. Ed Koch, a spokesman for the youth services office of Berlin's Tempelhof-Schoeneberg district, where the young man has been staying in the youth home, told CNN he is very angry about the hoax. ""He received funds from us for seven months that could have gone to other people in need,"" he said. Koch says that the man will be given a notice to leave the youth home but will not be kicked out immediately. ""He will get some time to prepare. We might also just put him on a train to the Netherlands. We are not sure yet,"" he said. Koch confirmed that authorities are looking into legal action against the man for ""social fraud,"" for illegally getting housing and board for months, as well as a German language course, a cell phone, clothes and other items. The release of the photograph, along with details of his appearance and scant possessions at the time of his discovery, was part of an effort by German authorities to unravel the mysterious identity and family background of a young man who spoke English and a little German. According to authorities, he claimed to know only his name, his date of birth of June 20, 1994, and his parents' first names. After months of investigation, German authorities said they were stumped. The man told authorities upon his discovery last September that he had been living in the woods with his father, Ryan, but decided to leave after his father died, investigators said. He couldn't explain why his father died. Ray was unable to name or show the place he buried his father in the forest underneath stones, officials said, so investigators couldn't find the body. ""They were hiking with the help of maps and a compass only and stayed in tents or caves overnight,"" Berlin authorities cited the boy as saying, in a statement released Tuesday. Ray provided police with ""some vague information"" about his mother, saying her name was Doreen, and he wore a gold-colored necklace around his neck that held a pendant with the letter ""D,"" police said. He claimed that his mother had died in a car accident when he was 12 years old, but he didn't remember the details of the accident, authorities said. He said he presumed the accident caused the scars on his face. After his father died last August, he said, he roamed north for five days until he arrived at Berlin City Hall and asked for help last September 5, authorities said. He couldn't ""specify anything about cities, countries or regions him and his father had traveled through,"" they said in a statement. A guardian was appointed, and German authorities tried to establish his identity through Interpol. ""The Youth Office and the Berlin Police have great doubts on the boy's story. That is the reason why the Youth Office now decided to publish a photo of 'Ray' and ask for your help,"" authorities had said in the statement. The story was compared to that of the ""Piano Man,"" who was found wandering near a beach on the isle of Sheppey, Kent, in southern England in 2005. He was wearing a waterlogged dinner suit with all its labels cut out and a tie. It initially was reported that he stunned witnesses with a ""virtuoso performance"" on the piano. The man was identified as a 20-year-old German national from Bavaria after telling staff at a hospital that he had been attempting suicide when found by police, the Times of London reported in August 2005. The man could not play the piano as well as initially reported, the newspaper said. The man, whom authorities did not identify because of confidentiality laws, flew back home to Germany, the Times said.","NEW: German authorities say they are angry, may sue the man for ""social fraud""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Army private charged with leaking an airstrike video and downloading documents remained in solitary confinement Saturday. Military officials told CNN that Pfc. Bradley Manning is also the prime suspect in the latest leak of documents to the WikiLeaks website. Manning was routinely processed Thursday at the Quantico detention facility, a military spokesman said Friday. Manning arrived at 9:30 p.m. Thursday and was given a physical exam and medical screenings, according to Lt. Col. Rob Manning (not related) of the Military District of Washington. The suspect is in solitary confinement and is being observed in accordance with normal operating procedures, the spokesman said. Manning's legal future is complex. He has already been charged with leaking a 2007 airstrike video and downloading documents from classified military systems. And he is suspected in the latest leak of thousands of Afghanistan field reports to the Wikileaks.org website. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks founder, has declined to say where his whistle-blower website got about 91,000 U.S. documents about the war. About 76,000 of them were posted on the site Sunday in what has been called the biggest leak since the Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam War. The documents are divided into more than 100 categories and touch on everything from the hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to Afghan civilian deaths resulting from U.S. military actions. Thousands of pages of reports document attacks on U.S. troops and their responses, relations between Americans in the field and their Afghan allies, intramural squabbles among Afghan civilians and security forces, and concerns about neighboring Pakistan's ties to the Taliban. Manning could go before a military judge in August in Washington, but given the complexity of the case it could likely be delayed, the military official said. Investigators are gathering evidence on the initial charges, which they will present to a military judge who will approve a court martial if the case adds up, the military official said. Manning, the military spokesman, said no hearing dates have been set, as the uniformed code of military justice is a ""very deliberate process."" All parties are working to assure that the private's rights are protected, he added. Requests for comment from Manning's attorney, Capt. Paul Bouchard, were not returned. The investigation has also been expanded, with the help of the FBI, in the wake of the new leak. The FBI is assisting the Defense Department in the Wikileaks investigation of Manning but remain tight-lipped on what or who they're looking at or interviewing. On background, one FBI official acknowledges the Bureau is involved in the investigation of potential civilian co-conspirators who may have played a role in the leaking of the classified material. The FBI official says that while Manning would appear in a military court, any civilian, whether a government employee or not and regardless of the charges, would be charged in a U.S. District Court . The official on background did refer to FBI involvement in past ""espionage"" cases, a signal the FBI is considering whether particular espionage statutes may be applicable in any potential prosecutions of civilians who played a role in the leak. The official gave no indication whether WikiLeaks or Julian Assange are under investigation.","Pfc. Bradley Manning is in solitary confinement .

"(CNN) -- One of the key questions asked after any serious airline incident is, how do we stop this happening again? Malaysia Airlines has changed its cockpit regulations as a result of Flight 370's disappearance. Many other incidents in the past have led to safer flying conditions for us today, as a result of improvements and changes to protocol, laws and technology in planes. Below we outline some of the most important ones. These helped pave the way to making 2013 one of the safest years in aviation history according to the Aviation Safety Network, with only 29 known accidents worldwide and 265 fatalities (the 10-year average is 720 fatalities per year). 1. Collision Avoidance Systems . Collision Avoidance Systems have been a priority in the aerospace industry since the inception of flight. In 1956, a TWA jet crashed into a United Airlines flight above the Grand Canyon. The incident was the first of many that illustrated the need for increased communication between planes. A few years later, the Federal Aviation Administration was formed to set guidelines for aviation in the United States, but still, issues remained. Several other two-plane accidents -- including a 1996 collision near New Delhi that resulted in 349 casualties -- emphasized the need for advanced anti-collision technology. After a congressional ruling in 1991, the FAA implemented the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, which monitors the airspace around an aircraft independent of air traffic control. ""TCAS really came about in the late '90s, and since then, I don't think we've really seen a collision between two airlines,"" noted Phil Seymour, president and COO of the International Bureau of Aviation, a consultancy that offers analysis and advice to the aviation industry. And the world's safest airline is ... 2. Roomier seats . Coach may seem pretty crammed these days, but according to Seymour, there's a limit to how much plane manufacturers are allowed to shave off the space around seats. In fact, modern-day seat layout has been rigorously calculated to carry out the most effective evacuation. This is in part thanks to research carried out by the Cranfield Institute after a 1985 incident when a British Airtours 737 caught fire before takeoff at Manchester International Airport. An engine caught fire, and the flames spread quickly. Unfortunately, the lack of space between seats meant that bottle-necking occurred at the doors, and some passengers couldn't escape. ""The aisles became jammed with people panicking to exit, and there literally wasn't enough space between the seats,"" Seymour recalled. ""Now, there are limits in terms of the minimum space between seats as well as the distance to an emergency exit."" 3. Weather radar . Severe weather has played a role in some crashes, most notably that of Delta Airlines Flight 191, which crashed in 1985 while approaching Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in a thunderstorm. ""Rain is one thing, but if a pilot gets into wind shear and the currents are there, it will literally just push your aircraft onto the ground. There have been some incidents where aircraft have crashed when making their final approach,"" Seymour said. In 1981, the FAA required all turbine-powered commercial planes be installed with wind shear detection systems by 1993. Since then, the models have become increasingly sophisticated. ""A lot of the more advanced weather radar don't just detect bad weather but predict wind shear. If a pilot sees wind shear coming, instead of landing, he can circle around the airport until it disappears."" Language of air travel: How traffic control keeps you safe . 4. Manual training . It took two years for search parties to recover the black box from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean en route to Paris from Rio. On reviewing the recordings, the French Bureau d'EnquÃªtes et d'Analyse blamed pilot error, in particular an overdependence on the automated flight control system. ""The senior captain was on his break, and the aircraft was being piloted by two less experienced pilots,"" recalled Seymour. ""Since then, Airbus and Boeing have both changed their operation procedures and have put more focus on manual training."" In the wake of the incident, Air France also revamped its training procedures and introduced a ""gatekeeper"" position. Gatekeepers are tasked with contacting the flight crew in the event of an incident and providing pilots with on-the-spot training, tools and advice. 5. Retiring old planes . The FAA addressed the issue of how long planes should fly in 1988 when it created the National Aging Aircraft Research program, which monitors the structural integrity of older planes. The measure was a result of an Aloha Airlines accident. While flying at 24,000 feet, a large section of the roof blew off, leaving passengers flying in the open air. The plane -- a Boeing 737 -- was 19 years old, and investigators blamed the incident on the plane's age-related wear and tear. Air New Zealand's new swimsuit safety video: Fun or offensive? 6. Reviewing repairs . When it comes to making repairs to old aircraft, airlines have also become increasingly stringent. This is mainly the result of Japan Airlines Flight 123, which crashed in the mountains 62 miles from Tokyo. The crash was the result of a poorly executed repair made several years earlier. ""The repair covered a crack in the bulkhead, but many hundreds of flights later, it corroded, and the air pressure bulkhead just burst open,"" recalled Seymour. Boeing responded by monitoring its repairs more closely. ""After that, the types of repairs allowed on an aircraft skin were much more rigorously controlled,"" Seymour said. 7. Retrieving data . Both the Air France 447 crash and the more recent incident involving Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have spotlighted the need for better access to data. ""There were several recommendations stemming from AF447, mainly centered around the flight data recorders and, more specifically, on ensuring the ability to locate them more easily and quickly,"" said Ilias Maragakis, communications officer for the European Aviation Safety Agency. In the aftermath of the Air France incident, the agency published a notice of a proposed amendment to retire older recording technologies and recommended that cockpit voice recorders have a minimum recording duration of two hours. Unfortunately, it may be a while before the necessary changes are implemented. ""Changes to regulations do take time. It's taken almost two decades for aircraft to be manufactured and older aircraft to be modified to have a system that means an empty fuel tank can't explode on an aircraft,"" Seymour pointed out.","After disaster, new tech and performance regulations prevent the same thing recurring .

"(CNN) -- Pale, blond and blue-eyed, the 4-year-old girl looks shyly into the camera. This is no ordinary photo, though. The little girl pictured is at the center of a mystery. Police in Greece say they found her Thursday with a Roma couple posing as her parents but have no idea who she is or where her real parents are. They hope releasing the pictures of her might prompt people to come forward with information. The girl was discovered during a search of a home in a community of Roma, also known as gypsies, near the town of Larissa in central Greece, police said. Photo blog: The plight of the Roma . Police first became suspicious because the girl, who is blonde with very pale skin and blue eyes, did not resemble the couple who claimed to be her parents. When the couple were then questioned, ""they changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child,"" a police statement said, compounding the officers' suspicions. DNA testing then ""showed that there was not any genetic compatibility"" between the girl and the 39-year-old man and the 40-year-old woman, the police said, meaning they cannot be her biological parents. The girl was immediately taken from the couple and entrusted to the care of a charity called The Smile of the Child. The charity said it would look after her ""until a solution in the best interest of the child is found."" The two people posing as her parents have been arrested and face charges of abducting a minor, as well as counts of falsifying identity documents, said the state-owned Athens-Macedonian News Agency. Among the suspect documents found by police was a 2009 birth and baptism registration from Athens authorities, the news agency said. The 40-year-old woman also had two different valid identification documents and, based on family registration records, appears to have given birth to three children between June and November 1993, and another three children between October 1994 and February 1995, it said. In fact, the state-run AMNA news agency reported this woman had two family residence registrations indicating she was mother to 10 children -- five girls and a boy in Larissa, plus four girls in Trikala. The 39-year-old man is registered as the father of four more children. Greece's government has promised to help the child. In the meantime, the little girl is being given support by a police psychologist, the police said. Anyone with information is asked to call the European Hotline for Missing Children or contact The Smile of the Child. The girl's discovery will likely prompt speculation she may have been abducted or trafficked -- which, if proven, could serve to fuel prejudice against the Roma community within Greece and elsewhere. Rights group Amnesty International has called on the European Union to take action to end discrimination against the 6 million Roma, describing them as ""the largest and most disadvantaged minority in the region."" In May, Amnesty International said Greece had been found guilty of discrimination against Roma schoolchildren in three separate rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. CNN's Joseph Netto and journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","NEW: State news: Woman had 10 registered children in 2 locations; man had 4 others .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's presidential elections will take place on May 26 and 27, Egyptian media reported Sunday, citing an announcement by the country's Presidential Elections Commission. Army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced Wednesday that he would resign and declared his candidacy in the national polls. El-Sisi, 59, Egypt's defense minister, had to leave the army in order to run for president. El-Sisi deposed President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's first freely elected leader, last year following mass protests against the latter's rule. The officer is popular among Egyptians who supported the army's decision to remove Morsy from power a year into his term -- seeing el-Sisi as the kind of strong man needed to end the turmoil dogging Egypt since a popular uprising in 2011 ended Hosni Mubarak's three decades of one-man rule. But el-Sisi is reviled by the Islamist opposition, which sees him as the mastermind of a coup against an elected leader and the author of a fierce crackdown on dissent. Egypt has suffered bloody internal strife since Morsy was overthrown. Also on Sunday, unknown gunmen opened fire on a security personnel carrier in Egypt's Sinai region, killing one soldier and injuring three policemen, the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper reported, citing a military source. The security personnel carrier was traveling on a motorway in the North Sinai town of Sheikh Zuweid, the source told the Al-Ahram Arabic news website, without elaborating. Militants based in the Sinai peninsula near the Israeli border have stepped up attacks on soldiers and policemen since Morsy's ouster. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","Army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has declared his resignation and candidacy in the national polls .

"(CNN) -- For a player to succeed in the high pressured, multi-million dollar world of professional golf they must marry their special talent to an unshakable sense of determination. That shouldn't be a problem for U.S. PGA Tour rookie Erik Compton. After two heart transplants, the 32-year-old American has finally earned the chance to compete on the Tour, fulfilling a destiny that had seemed a distant dream. ""What I did was pretty special, considering where I'd been and what I'd had to deal with,"" Compton told CNN ahead of his debut as a full-time card-holder in Hawaii this week. ""It was very overwhelming. ""I couldn't believe it when I made the PGA Tour -- I've had to fight for everything my entire life, so you think, 'Did that really happen?' "" Compton had been toiling on the second-tier Nationwide Tour, but victory at the Mexico Open helped him finish 13th on the money list and secured his place for 2012 alongside stars such as Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. ""I got sick right after that tournament, I ended up in hospital, and the doctors put me on a lot of medication -- that's when it sunk in and I realized what I'd accomplished."" RoboPutt: Rise of the golfing machines? Compton was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy at the age of nine, a condition that limits the heart's capacity to pump blood, and had his first transplant three years later. Heavy medication restricted a sport-obsessed kid who was once bigger and faster than most of his peers, stunting his growth. But as he got stronger in his teens, his love for golf flourished. By 1998 Compton was ranked as the top junior in the United States, competing against -- and beating -- the likes of 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman and current world number six Adam Scott. But bad health still dogged his progress, and even caused him to pass out during an early attempt at the PGA Tour's qualifying school. After appearing in the Walker Cup, a team event between the best amateurs from the U.S. and Europe, he turned pro. Despite taking the order of merit on the Canadian Tour in 2004, and winning an event in Morocco in 2005, Compton was far from fulfilling his potential when his health began to deteriorate again in 2007. Fit-again Stricker scores win in Hawaii . He was on course to make the cut at an event in Idaho, until a hook out of bounds on a closing hole resulted in him taking a nine shots and a making early exit from the tournament. As fate would have it, it was one of his worst shots that saved his life. ""I wouldn't be alive if I had made that cut,"" he said. ""The only reason I survived was because I was close enough to drive to the hospital when I felt a heart attack coming on and they put in a stent immediately."" Compton's heart attack -- known as a ""widowmaker"" because few survive its intensity -- forced another anxious period spent waiting for a donor. ""Obviously, it put things in perspective, all I wanted to do was stay alive,"" he explained. ""I was sitting in a chair, coughing up blood -- I couldn't breathe at night. I thought maybe I'll just have a house and live a quiet life. ""I never really enjoyed life until after a few weeks, the heart was shutting down, I couldn't sleep. Just doing simple things, lying down on couch watching TV, I would instantly start coughing up blood."" Surviving one heart transplant, let alone two, is a feat to be proud of, but Compton says it took less than a week after surgery for his mind to turn to swinging a club again. Incredibly, just five months later he made a return to competitive action, tying for 60th at the Children's Miracle Network Classic on the PGA Tour -- a high-pressure elite circuit where millions of dollars are at stake every weekend. His courage, and talent, propelled him into the limelight. ""The surgeons thought I was crazy,"" he laughed. ""I slowly picked up my swing; I wasn't as strong as I am now but I figured out a way to get it done. I have a gift to be able to play sport and have the co-ordination to do it, so I've been blessed that way -- not so blessed in other things."" Compton's desire to fulfill his dream of qualifying for a PGA Tour card helped to energize his recovery, as did the birth of his first child -- another miracle given that doctors had been unsure if he'd be able to have kids due to the medication he has taken all his life. He gradually regained full power but did have to seek special dispensation from the authorities to use a golf cart to get round the course, and to be absolved from their drug testing process, due to the medication that was vital for his survival. ""I got some letters from Ireland saying I was compromising the integrity of the game by using a cart and that Ben Hogan never would have done that! My goal was not to use it but, hey, there may be one day I have to use it again."" In 2009 Compton received the Ben Hogan Award, for courage, presented to him by golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, and after two steady seasons he clinched his PGA Tour place with that momentous win in Mexico. ""The whole of last season was tough, I was playing but I wasn't 100%,"" he said ahead of Thursday's opening round at the Sony Open. ""This year coming up I'm really excited playing on the Tour -- I've played a lot of events in the past but now I'm healthy and I can handle a lot of it. ""The only issue I have is trying to capitalize -- 100% for me, is maybe 65-70% for someone else, so when I have a cold or I'm not feeling the best it's hard to compete at a high level. ""My body has taken a hit over the years, I don't know the difference because I feel pretty strong, but that's the stuff I deal with on a day to day basis. My immune system is lower so I catch more colds and it takes me longer to fight them off but I'm used to that."" Compton's inspirational journey is sure to make even more headlines now that he will be playing side by side with the best golfers on the planet every week. ""I just try to live my own life and make the best out of what I can -- if that inspires others then that's great. But I'm just trying to live my life the best I can,"" he said. ""I think the message is more powerful than the game itself because it can touch everybody. I enjoy speaking my message to those who understand and get life, I don't enjoy telling it to people who don't understand. ""Golf has given me a reason to get out of my bed, so it's been very important. I'm very blessed to have a passion and ability. Golf has kept me alive, there's no doubt about it.""","Golfer Erik Compton will tee off as a fully-fledged PGA Tour member on Thursday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Justin Bieber is allowed to stay in the United States -- for now. The White House won't comment on a petition signed by more than 270,000 asking for the pop star to be deported for his repeated starring role in famous-people-behaving-badly. You might not care about the Canadian and his ""beliebers,"" but the 20-year-old's misbehavior and run-ins with the law raise some serious questions about immigration law enforcement. Like, is Bieber getting some serious special treatment? President Barack Obama has deported more people than any other president, causing him to be known as the ""deporter-in-chief"" in some sectors of the immigration community. But isn't Bieber here legally? He sure is. But it's not only illegal immigrants who are receiving deportation orders. The Immigration Policy Center estimated that 10% of the people deported between 1997 and 2007 were legally living in the United States. While the Obama administration deported nearly 1.6 million people in the last four years, it's unclear how many were in the country legally. The administration doesn't reveal those statistics. An immigration tracking division of Syracuse University, TRAC, is currently suing the Department of Homeland Security for failing to release a wide range of data on deportations and detentions. But immigration advocates believe the number has gone up since Obama came into office, not only due to an increase in deportations, but also because of anecdotal evidence. They are seeing an increase in home raids of legal residents and there are stories like that of Navy veteran Howard Dean Bailey, who was deported in 2010 over a years-old drug offense. Yes, legal residents are getting kicked out because of a previous crime. According to a 1996 immigration law, it doesn't matter how long ago people committed their crime and the types of crimes eligible for deportation are vast and expanding. For instance, shoplifting and marijuana possession often qualify. Justin Bieber has a lot of potential charges under his belt. In January he was charged with driving under the influence in Miami. He also has a pending assault charge and separate vandalism charges for egging his neighbor's house. As with all deportations, the president has the ""inherent power to choose which cases to act on,"" said Richard A. Boswell, immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law. It's called ""prosecutorial discretion."" Obama said he can't stop deportations of immigrants, but maybe he can . But fortunately for Bieber -- and possibly the President who would upset millions of teen fans -- is that his DUI is not a deportable offense. His vandalism charge probably isn't either. His assault charge might be, experts say. Matthew Kolodziej, legislative fellow at the Immigration Policy Center, said Bieber could potentially be charged with a crime of moral turpitude, which he described as ""an abstract concept whose definition has expanded over the years."" In sum, it's a judgment of a person's character and intent for purposes of immigration. ""A good immigration lawyer won't let that happen and I'm sure (Bieber) will be very well represented,"" Kolodziej said. Bieber also has another advantage. He never got a green card. Bieber is in the country on a visa for people with ""extraordinary"" abilities. His visa has to be renewed at some point, however, and moral turpitude could be taken into consideration. But, like Kolodziej said, his well-paid legal team probably won't let that happen. Bieber's attorneys are reportedly working out a plea deal for some of Bieber's crimes. If his legal team is any good, they would advise him that even a plea doesn't protect him from future immigration consequences. But for many legal immigrants, they don't have the resources to hire top immigration and criminal attorneys to help navigate the system. You get what you pay for.","White House won't comment on petition asking for the pop star to be deported .

"(CNN) -- Pat Summitt, the all-time winningest major college basketball coach, says in an affidavit filed Thursday that she felt forced out as head coach of the Tennessee women's team after her diagnosis with early-onset Alzheimer's . In April, the coach announced her on-court retirement eight months after revealing her diagnosis. ""I just felt like it was the time to step down,"" Summitt said at her retirement. ""It's never a good time, but you have to find a time you think is the right time."" Summitt lauded as she steps down . But according to an affidavit she filed in conjunction with a lawsuit filed by a friend and former colleague against the university and its athletics director, the legendary coach didn't make the decision to step down on her own. In her affidavit, Summitt described a meeting in March with athletic director Dave Hart, in which she said she was told she would no longer be coach after 38 seasons. Summit wrote in her affidavit that she had wanted to make that decision herself. ""This was very surprising to me and very hurtful,"" Summitt wrote in her affidavit. Summitt's statement also said that Hart met again with her and he ""indicated that I misinterpreted what he said."" Summitt's affidavit came in a lawsuit filed by a former media relations director for women's sports, Debby Jennings. Jennings is suing the school for age and gender discrimination and for retaliation. Jennings said in her lawsuit that she wrote an e-mail to Hart the day after his initial meeting with Summitt, with Jennings saying in the e-mail that she opposed the decision regarding Summitt and considered it discriminatory. POTUS honors Tennessee's Pat Summitt . Jennings said Hart retaliated against her two months later by giving her the option to resign, retire or be fired. She alleged that even before that, she had many of her work responsibilities taken away and given to younger men. Efforts to reach Hart Thursday night for comment were unsuccessful. Jennings, who had worked at Tennessee for 35 years, retired in May. In her complaint filed in U.S. District Court, Jennings said she was forced out because ""certain members of the athletic department ... wanted to model UT-K's athletic department as a good 'ol boys club."" A spokeswoman for the university said she could not comment because the legal case was ongoing.

"(CNN) -- He was Spain's ultimate matador and golf's greatest escape artist. There was seemingly no situation Severiano Ballesteros couldn't extricate himself from, whether his golf ball was rooted behind a tree, in a stream, buried in a hedge or deep in the car park. And the Spaniard did it all with such infectious brio that his career in the sport genuinely redefined it. Now, 25 years after Ballesteros secured the first of his five major titles at the British Open, and three years after his death, a film entitled ""Seve"" charts the career of golf's most charismatic star. Taking its cue from a similar sporting opus ""Senna,"" about the life of Brazil's Formula One star, it is produced by Stephen Evans, whose credits include ""The Madness of King George"" While a large portion of the film is made up of stirring archive footage, a thread of dramatized reconstructions chart the story of Ballesteros' formative years as a teenager. From a poor farming family, Ballesteros taught himself the game by hitting pebbles on the beach in his home town of Padrena after tying the discarded head of a three iron onto a stick. ""I think he was certainly the most charismatic of his or any other generation, certainly the first one to stir the young ladies hearts when they were watching,"" Evans told CNN. ""But unless you understand Ballesteros' background, you won't understand Ballesteros. ""Seve had this poor background, he had a good time with his loving parents and was the spoiled little boy in the family, but while there was always food on the table there was no money. ""He was up against it and you can see that in his personality as he developed. He had this aspect that everyone loved because he had charisma, style, intelligence. ""And because of learning the game in this famous way -- playing the game for two years with one club -- he'd got to know how to improvise. ""I think everyone would agree he's one of the game's greatest ever improvisers."" Ballesteros was the son of a shepherd determined to gatecrash the exclusive world of golf, and his rags to riches story was ripe for adaption on the big screen. Often he would scale the walls of the exclusive Royal Padrena Golf Club near his home just to hit a few shots in the fading light of day, or under a full moon. It was this round-the-clock dedication to golf that indirectly led to his expulsion from school, when snoozing in class as a 12-year-old resulted in a confrontation with one of his teachers. By the time Ballesteros hit 13 whispers of his potential prompted a winner-takes-all contest against the region's under-25 champion with a purse of 50,000 pesetas at stake. That contest provides one of the centerpieces of the film, but having decided on a cinematic strand to recreate Ballesteros' childhood, Evans now needed someone who could play a young Seve. Enter Jose Luis Gutierrez, who not only bears an uncanny resemblance to Ballesteros at that age, but is also a very accomplished golfer from Cantabria, on Spain's northern coast. The 16-year-old had, by his own admission, only filled the role of an extra in school plays previously, but was persuaded to audition by the secretary of his golf club due to his resemblance to Seve. ""I said to her 'Are you kidding?' How am I going to be Seve because I have never been an actor,' Gutierrez explained to CNN. ""I went to just have fun, after a month I had a golf tournament and I received a phone call that said 'We want you to play the role of Seve.' I remember I started screaming."" But was the prospect of playing one of Spain's favorite sporting sons daunting? ""I thought it was going to be difficult in the way he was such a unique player who showed such great effort, hard work and will power,"" Gutierrez said. ""But also, it was easy in the way that he has always been my idol, the master that I always tried to be like."" Learning all facets of the game with such a primitive tool afforded Ballesteros seemingly miraculous powers of recovery. He'd often hit few fairways during his round but still come in under par. Perhaps his most famous escape was en route to his first major win in 1979, at the British Open in Lytham, after which he became dubbed the ""car park champion."" Smashing his drive into a car park off the 16th fairway, a clutch of vehicles had to be moved before Ballesteros took a drop, chipped onto the green and made a birdie, going on to win the Claret Jug by three shots. It was the signpost for a career that would be rife with invention and magnetism, as well as the odd ill tempered rant, that injected new vigor into a hitherto conservative sport. Ballesteros became the first European to win the Masters in 1980, adding another green jacket in 1983, and won The British Open twice more after Lytham, in 1984 and 1988. Add over 90 career titles into the mix, eight Ryder Cup appearances for Europe as a player and one as captain, and Seve's mantel as a founding father of the modern day European Tour was secured. And all of those riches can be traced back to thousands of hours of practice on the beach in Padrena with a makeshift club. ""I think this is probably the key of his magic because if he could do everything with just a 3 iron I can't imagine how good he could have done with all the clubs,"" Gutierrez added. ""I had to practice because it is not the same playing with the irons of today -- they are really small. With a driver especially the difference is really big."" After retiring in 2007 Ballesteros suffered a brain tumor in 2008 and finally succumbed to cancer in 2011 aged 54. ""It's relatively recent that Seve died but I think this is the right time for the film -- we still have perspective on him,"" Evans explained. ""Seve does seem to cross over, this is the big thing. Whether I'm proven right or wrong we'll see in the next few months but people who don't play golf have heard of Seve."" And in this age of better access to facilities and media trained stars, does Evans ever think golf will see his like again?

"(CNN) -- A volunteer at a golf tournament in 2012 accused embattled Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito of inappropriately touching her with a golf club, according to a newly disclosed police report. No charges were filed, according to CNN affiliate WPLG-TV, which first obtained the police report. The station reported that the woman declined to comment, saying she had signed a confidentiality agreement. The Dolphins also declined to comment, the station said. Attempts by CNN to reach Incognito's attorney and the NFL team late Thursday night were unsuccessful. The team suspended Incognito on Sunday for unspecified allegations of improper conduct. ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets have reported that representatives for teammate Jonathan Martin submitted voice mails and text messages in which Incognito used racial slurs and threatened physical violence. Martin left the team left week and is now considered ""on leave."" Incognito declined to comment on those reports but predicted Tuesday he would ""weather the storm."" Also Tuesday, gossip website TMZ posted a video of Incognito in a bar shouting profanities and using a racial slur to refer to a teammate who was with him. TMZ said the video was recorded this year. The latest report from police in Aventura, Florida, concerns a golf tournament sponsored by the Dolphins' charitable foundation on May 18, 2012. The police report quoted the 34-year-old woman, who was a volunteer at the tournament, as saying Incognito had been drinking before he approached her. The woman said Incognito used his golf club to touch her crotch, stomach and chest and then knock sunglasses off her head, the police report said. The woman said Incognito then leaned against her buttocks as if dancing and finally emptied a water bottle in her face, the police report said. The woman said Dolphins officials were notified, but she believed they took no action, the police report said. The police report said she wanted an apology from Incognito. The police report classified her allegations as simple battery. The report showed police listed the case as ""cleared"" the same night it was filed, although the woman was told how to proceed if she wanted prosecutors to file a criminal charge.","Police report: Woman said Incognito touched her with golf club, leaned against her .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is amassing dictatorial power as U.S. troops leave the country, risking a new civil war and the breakup of the nation, his deputy warned Tuesday. Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq told CNN that he was ""shocked"" to hear U.S. President Barack Obama greet al-Maliki at the White House on Monday as ""the elected leader of a sovereign, self-reliant and democratic Iraq."" He said Washington is leaving Iraq ""with a dictator"" who has ignored a power-sharing agreement, kept control of the country's security forces and rounded up hundreds of people in recent weeks. ""America left Iraq with almost no infrastructure. The political process is going in a very wrong direction, going toward a dictatorship,"" he said. ""People are not going to accept that, and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country. And this is going to be a disaster. Dividing the country isn't going to be smooth, because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that."" Neighboring Iran views al-Maliki as its man in Baghdad and has dictated the shape of the current government, al-Mutlaq said. But he said al-Maliki is playing games with both Washington and Tehran. ""There will be a day whereby the Americans will realize that they were deceived by al-Maliki ... and they will regret that,"" he said. The last U.S. troops are scheduled to be out of Iraq by the end of December, nearly nine years after the 2003 invasion that topped Saddam Hussein. More than 4,000 Americans and an estimated 115,000 Iraqis died in the invasion and the years of insurgency and sectarian warfare that followed. Al-Maliki won a second term as prime minister in 2010 after a months-long dispute among the leading parties in the country's parliamentary elections. Al-Mutlaq's largely secular Iraqiya movement won two more seats than al-Maliki's party, but a merger of the premier's Shiite Muslim slate with a smaller Shiite bloc put him first in line to form a government. The standoff raised fears of renewed bloodshed between Iraq's majority Shiite and minority Sunni populations and prompted U.S. officials to work out a power-sharing agreement, bringing al-Mutlaq's Iraqiya movement into the government. But al-Mutlaq -- a Sunni who was originally barred from running because of allegations that he supported Hussein's Baath Party -- said he has no authority. He said al-Maliki has flouted the deal's provisions by refusing to name permanent ministers to lead the defense and interior ministries, which concentrates control over the military and police in the prime minister's hands. But quitting the government carries the risk of being branded as terrorists and arrested, he said. ""We are in a real problem now,"" he said. ""If we pull out of the government, he will be left to do what he wants to do, with us and with the others."" He said U.S. officials, who brokered the power-sharing deal, either ""don't know anything in Iraq and they don't know what is happening in Iraq, or because they don't want to admit the reality in Iraq, the failure in Iraq, the failure of this political process that they set in Iraq.""","Iraq is ""going toward a dictatorship"" under al-Maliki, his deputy says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The candidate who campaigned on ending American-fought wars has become a president who finds himself repeatedly deciding on, planning for and sometimes declining military incursions. After authorizing a troop surge in Afghanistan, air support in Libya, and limited military aid to rebels in Syria, President Barack Obama has now decided to send advisers to Iraq, where Sunni militants are on the move. The tension that often exists between the executive and legislative branches over foreign intervention, however, is largely absent for now. Obama diffused any criticism from Congress by notifying it earlier this week that he was dispatching 275 troops to Iraq to bolster security at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. He wrote in a letter to lawmakers that it was ""part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution."" After meeting with senior members of the House and Senate on Thursday, lawmakers reported that Obama insisted that he had the authority for any military action, based on authorization from Congress in 2011 and 2003. Obama then announced the limited action involving advisers and support for the Iraqi military, and that American combat troops would not be part of the equation. Obama: Military advisers will go to Iraq, but U.S. not returning to combat . No complaining . He also left the door open for ""targeted and precise military action"" later on, if the situation required. Congress has not complained about an overreach of presidential power. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said she believed Obama has the authority he needs for the actions he's announced. They could, however, invoke the War Powers Act -- also known as the War Powers Resolution -- if Obama decides on steps that might include limited drone or air strikes strikes, or any use of ground troops. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, who is pushing to approve a resolution on the criteria for authorizing military force to replace the one approved after 9/11, also believes Obama has the authority to carry out the measures he's committed to so far. ""But if the President is proposing a long-term commitment of military advisers or a more robust presence than just 300 assets on the ground, then I think he needs to come to the Congress for authorization,"" Murphy said. Obama also promised on Thursday to ""consult closely"" with Congress throughout the process. ""Consult"" is a broad term that based on previous yet similar scenarios likely means discussing with select members rather than seeking formal authorization. Obama's history . Discussing ""with relevant members"" is what Obama did while considering military action in response to the use of chemical weapons by the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last year. Many members of Congress were against such action, and it never came about as Syria ultimately agreed to relinquish its chemical stockpiles. Obama did not seek congressional consent when he authorized action by U.S. warplanes as part of a NATO air mission in Libya, nor when the United States expanded operations in Afghanistan. In both instances, members of Congress complained loudly, but he defended his decisions. In the case of Libya, the President said at the time that U.S. troops would not be on the ground and so the law didn't apply. In Afghanistan, Obama said congressional authorization to use force approved in 2001 sufficed. The good and the bad: President Obama's military options in Iraq . War Powers legislation . While the War Powers Act is an effort to give Congress more say in matters when U.S. troops are sent to war, it's been a point of contention. Congress passed the latest measure in 1973 in response to steps taken by the executive branch during Vietnam, overriding a veto at the time by President Richard Nixon. The law requires that the president seek consent from Congress before force is used or within 60 days of the start of hostilities, and that the president provide Congress with reports throughout the conflict. Presidents don't often follow it, saying it violates the chief executive's constitutional authority as commander-in-chief. ""Where you stand on this issue depends on where you sit,"" said Kal Raustiala, professor of law at UCLA, previously told CNN. That's why when Obama was a senator and candidate for president, he said the President can't authorize a military attack unless it involves ""stopping and actual or imminent threat to the nation."" But now he, as president, has followed the precedent set by those before him who bypassed Congress. Since the law's passage in 1973, the President used military force without congressional consent in Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989, Iraq in 1991, Haiti in 1994 and Kosovo in 1999. A congressionally approved force resolution to pursue al Qaeda after 9/11 was the underlying authorization to go into Afghanistan, and a separate one was approved in 2002 to invade Iraq.

"(CNN) -- Funeral and memorial services will take place at week's end for two young women killed when a train carrying coal derailed near Baltimore, burying them. Elizabeth Nass and Rose Mayr, both 19, died early Tuesday when the train derailed on the bridge on which they were sitting, spilling coal on top of them, police said. Visitation is scheduled for Thursday and a memorial Mass on Friday for Nass at Church of the Resurrection in Ellicott City, Maryland. For Mayr, two viewings are planned for Friday at Harry H. Witzke's Family Funeral Home and a funeral service at Bethany United Methodist Church on Saturday, also in Ellicott City. A makeshift memorial of ribbons and flowers sprung up along Main Street, not far from where the women perished, CNN affiliate WJLA-TV reported. The roadway is closed while crews clear the scene and authorities investigate. It is expected to reopen Friday. The National Transportation Safety Board said the crew aboard the train did not apply the emergency brakes just before the accident. Instead, the air brakes were automatically triggered, agency spokesman Jim Southworth said Wednesday, noting that a possible rupture in an air line may have caused the emergency braking. Southworth said the investigation was just in its beginning stages. He added the train, with two locomotives and 80 cars, had been traveling about 25 mph when it jumped the tracks. The first 21 cars behind the locomotives derailed. Maryland train derailment delays terrorism trial at Guantanamo . The derailed train also damaged fiber-optic lines and temporarily disrupted Internet service at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, delaying the trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others facing terrorism charges this week, a base spokesman said. The facility lost about 50% of its connectivity, which is serviced by satellite downlink locations in Maine and Maryland, according to Capt. Robert Durand. The service was restored withing 24 hours, a spokesman for Verizon, which maintains the line, said. Howard County Executive Ken Ulman said that once the initial investigation has been completed, authorities will assess how Mayr and Nass got access to the bridge. They were apparently sitting on the bridge ledge just after midnight with their backs to the train when it derailed, according to a written statement from Howard County police. The two posted photos to Twitter shortly before the crash. One showed feet dangling over a road, with the caption ""Levitating."" Another appeared to look down Main Street. Nass tweeted, ""Drinking on top of the Ellicott City sign with @ r0se_petals."" The name Ellicott City is painted on the railroad bridge. Rachel Green, who went to school with Mayr in the nursing program at the University of Delaware, said, despite the Twitter posts, her friend was not irresponsible. ""They were just living life a little bit on the edge, and some people can do that five billion times and they live to be 80 and they live to tell all the times they lived on the edge,"" Green told affiliate WMAR-TV. ""Some people do it once in their life, and they can't live to tell their tale."" Mayr was about to start her junior year. Nass attended James Madison in Virginia. ""They were both terrific kids,"" Mount Hebron High School Principal Scott Ruehl said. ""Both girls were really involved in the dance program. They were pleasant; they always said hi in the hallway."" Marmie Edwards, a spokeswoman for Operation Lifesaver, a nonprofit organization that promotes railroad safety, said the number of fatalities in 2012 involving people on tracks was up significantly. ""It's probably just as well to stay away, not just to be off the tracks, but stay away from the train so you know you're going to be safe,"" she said. ""Because it's hard to say, 'OK, here it's safe; there it's not.' So just stay away."" According to the Federal Railroad Administration, in the first five months of the year, 178 people were killed in accidents on or near tracks, not including at railroad crossings. iReport: Damaged rail car .

"(CNN) -- A bulldozer struck what authorities believe was a World War II-era bomb in a western German town Friday afternoon, causing a blast that killed the bulldozer driver, injured 13 other people and damaged homes, police said. The blast occurred at a rubble storage site in Euskirchen, Germany, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) southeast of Cologne, police spokesman Helmut Conrads said. Information on why police suspected a World War II bomb wasn't immediately available, though the unearthing of such ordnance in Germany -- where unexploded Allied bombs still are being discovered decades after the conflict -- wouldn't be unusual. Two people were critically injured in Friday's blast, and 11 others suffered minor injuries, Conrads said. The explosion happened at site that was storing construction rubble destined for recycling, according to Conrads. ""We can be lucky this hasn't happened earlier,"" he said. The blast damaged homes in a 400-meter radius around the explosion, Conrads said. The presence of unexploded World War II ordnance in Germany is common enough that companies hire private bomb disposal teams to check that sites are safe when construction is planned. Last April, authorities briefly evacuated hundreds of people from an area in central Berlin after a Russian-made aerial bomb weighing about 100 kilograms (220 pounds) was unearthed 2 meters from a train track. Bomb disposal experts safely disabled the device. In August 2012, a 250-kilogram (550-pound) bomb was discovered in central Munich. It had to be detonated where it lay because the fuse was unstable; the explosion damaged nearby buildings. In 2011, 45,000 residents were evacuated from the city of Koblenz, on the Rhine and Moselle rivers, as bomb squads dealt with two bombs and a military fog-producing device that were dropped by American and British warplanes in the last years of the war. One was a 1.8-metric ton British bomb that could have wiped out the city center, according to the local fire brigade. Three members of a bomb disposal squad were killed in 2010 when the device they were trying to defuse in the German town Gottingen went off. 2011: WWII bombs defused allowing 45,000 evacuated residents to return .

"(CNN) -- Residents of large swaths of central and Southern California and Arizona shivered Saturday as plummeting temperatures prompted freeze warnings. In Atlanta, meanwhile, shorts-wearing residents basked in the balmy weather as it and two other major Georgia cities set record highs for this date. The weird weekend weather had temperatures as much as 30 degrees below normal in parts of the West and 30 degrees above normal in the East, said CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. ""We definitely have a temperature dichotomy across the U.S.,"" the National Weather Service said. The Los Angeles metropolitan area keenly felt the chill, with an overnight low in Hollywood expected to dip down to 38 F. Lows near Stockton, in central California, were expected to be about 23 degrees. The cold front was slowly marching eastward, where highs in the District of Columbia will drop from 62 on Sunday to 43 on Tuesday. A band of moderate to heavy rainfall was expected from Louisiana north into Ohio, the National Weather Service said. Strong winds and a possible tornado damaged two churches in Livingston County on Saturday afternoon, according to Kentucky emergency management officials. No injuries were immediately reported. The situation was calmer in Georgia, where Atlanta's spring-like high of 76 topped the 1890 record by 1 degree. Columbus (77), and Macon (78), also broke records. The East Coast is enjoying a ridge of high pressure that has provided a dome of warm air, said Atlanta NWS forecaster Keith Stellman. But by Wednesday, the high in Atlanta will be in the 50s, and lows will reach the mid-30s. ""Basically we will be back to normal temperatures,"" Stellman told CNN. Parts of the West were enduring the coldest air of the season thus far. According to CNN affiliate KCAL, freeze warnings were expected to be in effect through 9 a.m. Sunday for most of Southern California, with a freeze watch posted for Sunday night through Monday morning. In Arizona, a freeze warning will remain in effect in Phoenix until Tuesday morning. The Phoenix Rescue Mission reached out to those who were spending the night outdoors by providing blankets and clothing items. ""As the cold weather takes effect on people and they're out there in the elements, we want to remind them that we bring a team of people who actually care about them,"" the organization's Clifford Danley told CNN affiliate KTVK. Arizona citrus growers scrambled to protect their trees. One grower deployed circulating water to produce heat and smudge pots. ""You work for 360 days and these five days can wipe you out,"" said John Babiarz of Greenfield Citrus Nursery in Mesa. KOLD, an appropriately named CNN affiliate in Tucson, said temperatures on landmark Mount Lemmon dropped into single digits early Saturday. Overnight freezing temperatures will continue through Tuesday. A family's effort to help warm up cold cats backfired Saturday morning, according to Tucson affiliate KGUN. Fire officials said homeowners set up a heat lamp and blankets on their back patio. Apparently, the lamp fell onto the blankets or the blankets were to close to the heat source, starting a fire that caused an estimated $15,000 in damage to the home.

"(CNN) -- The images coming from Venezuela over the past few weeks have been arresting: Troops shooting, protesters hurling rocks, people bleeding. Just like the tear gas that clouds the scenes in photos, a complete picture of the truth in the confrontations is also hazy. Allegations of censorship, self-censorship and photo manipulation have made it difficult for news consumers -- especially Venezuelans -- to form a complete picture of what is going on. A media blackout has stymied the flow of information during some of the most intense days of clashes between anti-government protesters and authorities. In addition, strict regulations have pressured media outlets to tread softly when it comes to covering the violence. There is more freedom on social media, but there are accusations that these channels of communication have been polluted by fake photos and misinformation. And the government allegedly blocked access to Twitter during protests last week. ""People don't know what is happening and they depend on the dangerous or beneficial social networks because on social media, you can get truthful information. But also you can find people who misinform for their own ends,"" said Carlos Acosta, a journalist for a Florida-based news startup that was created specifically to fill the gaps in coverage in Venezuela. CNN iReport, the network's user-generated platform, has received more than 2,700 submissions from Venezuela in the past week. Of those, more than 120 have been verified by producers and cleared for CNN. These are developments that mostly have not been making it on to Venezuelan newscasts. One vetted iReport video begins by showing a contrast: President Nicolas Maduro speaking on television about how things are under control, while outside a window, national guard troops are firing tear gas. As he filmed, Giorgio Russo said the troops ""aimed at me but since I live on the 14th floor I didn't think they could reach, but I was wrong."" A tear gas canister broke through a window and landed under a sofa, Russo said. His brother managed to throw the canister back out the window, but not before their 85-year-old father suffered from the gas. In the western state of Tachira, in the city of San Cristobal, Alejandro Camacho captured video of student protesters ""trying to be heard"" by blocking streets and burning debris that cast an orange glow on them. These reports provide under-reported vantage points, but what is the whole story? It is a challenge when unverified content is going viral and a government is blocking media. Media blackouts . The ongoing protests grabbed the world's attention on February 12, when two anti-government protesters and one government supporter were killed. The day before, according to Human Rights Watch, the state broadcasting authority warned that coverage of the violence could violate a controversial law that prohibits the broadcasting of material that ""foments anxiety"" or ""incites or promotes hatred and intolerance for ... political reasons."" As bullets flew and people died on the 12th, most outlets heeded the warning. The Press and Society Institute monitored 38 radio stations the day of the killings and found that only five reported on developments in the day's deadly violence and 30 transmitted ""light programming. The other three echoed the government's position. The media silence ""denied the citizenry the right to information of public interest and of relevancy for the safety of residents in the cities where the demonstrations unfolded,"" the institute said in a report. WATCH: Violence in Caracas on February 12 . Comedian Luis Chataing, who also hosts a radio and television program, was among the majority who were silent on the airwaves on the violent day. The next day, he apologized to his listeners and said he was ashamed of Venezuelan media. Chataing told CNN en Español that he understands the restrictions the media is working under, but ""this doesn't help at all for the panorama to become clearer and for peace to be achieved as quickly as possible."" How could it be, he asked, that while clashes were taking a turn toward violence, all one could find on television was a cooking show about how to fry eggs? ""I wanted to express myself as one more Venezuelan in my pain that the (national) media was not providing the coverage that I wanted about what is happening in Venezuela,"" Chataing said. ""Having to inform ourselves through foreign press is shameful."" Photo manipulation . Social media is playing a vital role in the current unrest as an unfiltered channel for sharing images of protests and alleged abuses. Government supporters are trying to cast doubt on the credibility of photos shared by the opposition by launching its own campaign to uncover what they say is manipulation of images. Websites and social media users who support the government are circulating a number of examples of images that the opposition claims to be from the Venezuela clashes, but are actually file photos from other events. A photo of a student in a headlock by a soldier in Chile in 2011, for example, has been shared by opposition members to misrepresent the current violence in Venezuela, government supporters say. Venezuelan actress Amanda Gutierrez apologized to her 228,000 Twitter followers after she shared a photo allegedly showing police forcing a protester to perform oral sex on them. The original image came from a U.S. porn site, a pro-government website said. Another tweeter, to show the size of the support for the anti-government movement, shared a photo of a long human chain stretching out along a highway in Tachira state. But the photo appears to have been published originally last year in a Spanish newspaper and actually depicts protesters in Spain. The examples of manipulated photos are but a drop in the fire hose of images being shared on social media, but sometimes that is all that's needed to sow seeds of doubt. The government's position . Maduro's government makes its own claims -- that the protesters are in cahoots with the United States, that there is coup in the works, that the opposition is behind the deaths -- but rarely offers evidence or elaborates. The accusations find space on state-owned media, and the government complains that other outlets are biased against it. In an interview with CNN en Español, Venezuela's ambassador to the Organization of American States, Roy Chaderton, accused international media, including CNN, of bias in its coverage. Reflecting on the protests, he said, ""We are expecting the democratic evolution of these events, of which there has been very little coverage of the government position."" The government had already initiated a dialogue with the opposition, including meetings with opposition mayors and governors. ""But that's not news,"" Chaderton said. ""What's news is a car lit on fire, or a death blamed on the government or the opposition in these clashes."" The cameras are focusing on police on the streets, and not on the protesters who throw rocks or Molotov cocktails, he said. Twitter troubles . It's not been just the content, but access to social media that has been a roadblock to gathering information. Those who have taken to social media accused the government of blocking access to Twitter last week. Hundreds of Twitter users in Venezuela reported difficulties using the service, and a Twitter representative confirmed that images posted on Twitter were being blocked in the country. The Venezuelan broadcasting regulator denied that the government interfered. Venezuela's minister of communications, Delcy Rodriguez, also used Twitter -- to bash Twitter users. ""Social media is being used by violent coup plotters to create anxiety in the public in a psychological operation of great scale,"" she said. ""Powerful media laboratories are being employed to advance a psychological war without precedent against Venezuela."" Telling fact from fiction . Telling the whole story in Venezuela is not a new challenge. The government's clampdown on private media has left little room for views outside of the official line. Venezuelan journalists in Florida created a new channel that streams online called ElVenezolanoTV. It was slated to go live next week, but the protests caused it to move up its debut. Many of the journalists on board are considered ""opposition journalists"" by the Venezuelan government, but they say their goal is to present unbiased journalism. The government has an invitation to come on their air anytime, its journalists say. CNN also goes through great lengths to verify the iReports that are submitted. Producers speak to the person who uploaded the iReport, check metadata and cross-verify whether the image is original, fact check any allegations, and add additional context and reporting as needed. In one extreme case, a violent video that depicts protesters and officials clashing took more than 10 hours to fact check and approve. The effort was worth it, said Juan Muñoz, director of social media for CNN en Español. ""It´s an amazing iReport. The best one I have ever seen on the platform."" CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Carlos Montero, Adriana Hauser, Gabriela Matute and Katie Hawkins-Gaar contributed to this report.","Getting an honest picture of the unrest in Venezuela has its challenges .

"(CNN) -- In the last few years, awareness about bullying has increased dramatically. Some adults may still think bullying is just a youthful rite of passage, but it seems worse than in previous generations for many parents, educators and kids. It doesn't stop at the schoolyard or even a child's front door. Access to the Internet and social media websites mean kids can be bullied and tormented around the clock, even in the supposed safety of their own homes. The cruelty that can come with the strike of a button on a keyboard can hurt just as much as any punch or push in a playground. We've produced a documentary called ""The Bully Effect"" which follows the stories of a number of people filmmaker Lee Hirsch introduced audiences to in his remarkable 2012 film ""Bully."" These are kids and parents who have taken their pain, their suffering, their grief and turned it into action. They are truly inspiring. Our unhealthy love of reality TV bullying . I first started reporting on the problem of bullying a few years ago when a rash of suicides of children propelled the issue into the national spotlight. Since then, I've interviewed far too many parents whose children took their own lives because they felt like it was the only way out of the pain. It's not just tragic, it's unacceptable. Through our reporting, we've repeatedly tried to understand the complex issues surrounding bullying. There are not just bullies and victims. Sometimes a child who is bullied may bully someone else. We've tried to understand how bullying can be a form of what researchers call ""social combat,"" and we've looked at what programs work to prevent it, and why some schools fail to adequately address the problem. Most bullying incidents are witnessed by bystanders: other students, teachers, and adults. All too often those bystanders fail to intervene, fail to stand up and say ""enough is enough."" As a teenager I saw other kids being bullied. Sometimes I tried to stop it, often times, I remained silent. It still pains me to this day. Share your story about child bullying with CNN iReport . Increasing empathy and understanding is one of the greatest weapons we have to reduce bullying. That's why I believe in the power of reporting.

"(CNN) -- While there has been much discussion about the heartburn the new EPA rule on carbon emissions is causing Democrats in this year's midterms -- especially those from energy producing states -- the person who should be most troubled about the President's decision is Hillary Clinton. The administration's new coal rule could singlehandedly give the Republican nominee in 2016 a path to victory in an Electoral College that has been getting more and more difficult for the GOP. States that have trended Democratic can flip back red. Hello Ohio, the GOP has certainly missed your 18 Electoral College votes. Pennsylvania (20 votes) and Michigan (16 votes) had all but turned blue, but with higher utility bills coming to voters before 2016, both are right back in play for the GOP. Win two of those three states and the Republican wins the White House. Virginia's 13 electoral votes just got a lot more winnable, too. There is a reason the President did not act so aggressively on his environmental agenda until after his re-election. It would have doomed his campaign. His political advisers responsible for his re-election would have never allowed it. The political folks are gone now and the President does not have to think about things in a political context anymore; he gets to think about himself and the history books. But what's a legacy issue for Obama may not be a good thing for Hillary Clinton. To achieve the President's goal of a 30% emissions reduction will cost money, a lot of money. Much of the money will come from working families paying higher utility bills in an already difficult economy. Jobs will also be lost as businesses grapple with higher energy costs. The EPA itself estimates electricity costs will increase up to 7% by 2020, critics say it will be far higher. The critics will be right on this one. In 2014, the debate for Senate candidates will be about the prospect of higher utility bills. In 2016, the debate will be about actual higher utility bills. It will be interesting to see the first presidential poll in Ohio after utility bills spike. If I'm a Clinton adviser, it is already giving me nightmares. When voter's utility bills go up, they get mad. Just ask the Labor Party in Australia. They got decimated last year for passing a carbon tax. Just five days before Election Day in 2010, Labor party Prime Minister Julia Gillard vowed at the National Press Club, ""There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead."" That promise was not kept and a carbon tax went into effect in 2012. As a result of the carbon tax, Australian utility bills went up over $500 per household a year. Public opinion turned on a dime. Gillard was removed from the 2013 ballot by her own party before a sure defeat and was replaced by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. It made no difference. Now, on behalf of his legacy and place in history, President Obama and his EPA are going to make things difficult for the left in America in 2014 and beyond. And all Hillary Clinton can do about the EPA rule that is creating an electoral minefield for her 2016 bid is applaud. Clinton cannot be critical of the EPA rule or she could risk alienating her base and losing a second nomination fight. The environmentalists are a powerful force in Democratic primary politics, especially on the money side. The 2016 presidential campaign just got a lot more interesting. Michigan and Pennsylvania, welcome back to presidential politics, you are now again swing states. The path to 270 electoral votes for the Republican nominee just got a lot easier.

"(CNN) -- The 2012 London Olympic Games fostered a generation of hope. I witnessed women participating for the very first time, representing every nation. Congratulations to 800 meter runner Sara Attar and judoka Wokdan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani. Shahrkhani represented Saudi Arabia in judo and was among a number of other pioneer women who were part of the very first Olympics in which every country sending a team to London included at least one female athlete.

Their participation and that of athletes from Libya, Iraq, Jordan, Oman, Yemen, Qatar and other nations exemplifies how far we've come, on a global level. The celebration of 40 years of title IX -- legislation that guaranteed equal opportunities in women's college athletics -- what a year to celebrate! The performances of USA women's basketball (five consecutive gold medals), USA women's soccer (bouncing back from the World Cup loss to capture the gold against Japan), Kerri Walsh-Jennings and Misty May-Treanor, after motherhood showed they are still the ""Queens of the Beach"" with an historic three-peat, and let's not forget double-gold for the Williams family in tennis and the stunning performance of Tianna Madison, Allyson Felix, Bianca Knight and Carmelita Jeter breaking a 27-year-old world record in the 4x100m relay, and Jamaican Frazier-Price winning back-to-back gold in the women's 100 meters and Ethiopian Tiunesh Dibaba making history in the women's 10,000 meters. Sanya Richards-Ross (400m), Felix (200m), Australia's Sally Pearson 100m hurdles, Brittany Reese (long jump) and Jenn Suhr (pole vault), as well as teenagers like Missy Franklin (swimming), Gabby Douglas (gymnastics), Claressa Shields (boxing), all claimed their very first individual gold medals. Jessica Ennis of Great Britain, the face of the games, lived up to the pressure and became an Olympic champion by winning the most demanding event (in my opinion) for a female athlete; the hepthalon. Opinion: Why we need Gabby . Dawn Harper, Jeter, Dee Dee Trotter, Brigetta Barrett, LaShinda Demus, Veronica Campbell, Lia Neal (second African American in swimming to bring home a medal) and the U.S. indoor volleyball team also all came away with medals. To each of those remarkable athletes, and all of the women (and men) from around the world who came to London and put forth their very best efforts I extend a heartfelt congratulations. It was an honor for me to watch you, providing a wonderful trip down memory lane. As exciting as these games were for women, it saddened me to know that women's softball wasn't a part of these Olympic Games and we still must not forget our female athletes come from grass roots programs and lack of funding is always an issue. We live in a world where sports have the potential to bridge the gap between racism, sexism and discrimination. The 2012 Olympic Games was a great start but hopefully what these games taught us is that if women are given an opportunity on an equal playing field the possibilities for women are endless.

"(CNN) -- When Yahoo's relatively new CEO Marissa Mayer decreed that workers would be required to show up at the office rather than work remotely, the immediate backlash from outsiders was mostly on the side of the angry Yahoo employees who were losing the comfort and convenience of telecommuting. Inside the company, reactions were mixed. It struck a deep chord, contrary as it was to the techno-utopian impulse that has helped define Silicon Valley: the idea that someday soon we'll all be working in coffee shops or at kitchen tables, with broadband connections replacing in-person interactions. Mayer may have been extreme in her demands for face time at the office, but it's the right call for a leader who is working to turn around one of the Internet's laggards. First, let's consider what's at stake for the company and what Mayer is hoping to accomplish. Yahoo is famous for having bungled its position as a one-time Internet leader. Mayer was brought on specifically to revitalize the benighted company after the departure of Jerry Yang; the firing of Carol Bartz, and the departures of another CEO who inflated his resume and an interim director. All the while, Yahoo has been a company in search of a direction. What does the end of telecommuting have to do with giving the company a sound footing? The reasons go well beyond the obvious issue of reining in slackers who have taken advantage of Yahoo's reportedly lax monitoring of work done from home. Talk Back: Is Yahoo wrong to end telecommuting? Jackie Reses, Yahoo's head of human relations, has it exactly right in the memo she wrote to employees about the policy: Personal interaction is still the most effective way of conveying a company's direction, and keeping tabs on what different parts of the organization are up to. And that's what Mayer has to do with all of Yahoo's 11,500 employees to succeed. What do in-person meetings accomplish that e-mail can't? Part of the answer lies in time use surveys of CEOs that go back nearly 40 years. Management scholar Henry Mintzberg was among the first to track how top managers spend their time in the early 1970s. Much to his surprise, he found that around 80% of their time was spent in face-to-face meetings; the subjects of his study had few stretches of more than 10 minutes at a time to themselves. More recent time use studies by researchers at Harvard, the London School of Economics and Columbia have found that little has changed. Despite the IT revolution, business leaders still spend 80% of their time in face-to-face meetings. The reason is that there's only so much that one can glean from a written report or a spreadsheet. To cut through the hidden agendas, and office politics, most of the time you need to look someone in the eye and ask them, ""Really? How exactly would that work?"" It is this probing and questioning that allows effective managers to gather the scraps of information needed to understand what's really going on. Similarly, all the way down the organizational chart, person-to-person interactions are crucial to ensure that an organization's change of direction isn't misrepresented or garbled in its retelling. The bland proclamations made in reports and e-mails are given clearer meaning through the way they're communicated in the ""high fidelity"" that only personal interaction will allow. In-person meetings can also help teams avoid misunderstandings: As one of our friends who runs a virtual workplace puts it, with e-mail exchanges alone, everyone starts to get a bit paranoid. Finally, the Yahoo memo notes that it's hard to innovate via e-mail exchanges or the occasional agenda-filled meeting. New ideas spring up through chance encounters in the cafeteria line and impromptu office meetings. It's an assertion that's backed up by academic research highlighting the importance of physical proximity in driving scientific progress. Work at home? Share productivity tips . Yet there are rarely benefits without cost. Lots of tasks are easily managed from a distance. A large number of the affected Yahoo employees are customer-service representatives who aren't going to be driving innovation at the company anyway. In one study of telecommuting at a Chinese online travel agency, customer-service reps were both happier and more productive when working from home -- probably Yahoo service reps aren't any different from their Chinese counterparts in this regard. And every Yahoo employee surely has some aspects of their jobs that could be done just as well at the kitchen table as in an office cubicle. But it's hard to create a norm of ""physically together"" if the office is always half-empty. And once it becomes that way, the half that have been showing up will be less and less inclined to bother. Finally, such a shocking and provocative directive will most certainly have the effect of imbuing the organization with the sense of urgency it needs to get the job done. Will Yahoo employees come around to appreciating the change? Not necessarily the ones that liked to sleep in or work on a startup on Yahoo's dime, but it may be welcomed by the ones already showing up. Will it be damaging to morale? Possibly, though it may help Yahoo employees to remember that, if they're successful, the change is likely to be temporary. But the job of the CEO isn't to maximize worker happiness. It's to make sure they get their jobs done. And in driving change at Yahoo, Mayer thinks they need to show up at the office. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Raymond Fisman.","Raymond Fisman: Marissa Mayer needs to revive Yahoo, and face time at the office is key .
Fisman: Granted, this goes against Utopian vision of everyone working from cafes .
Fisman: In-person work means innovations, avoids misunderstood directives .
He says more jobs will get done and it'll encourage those who work in a half-empty office ."
"(CNN) -- Leroy Fer's second half header and a late strike from Memphis Depay fired the Netherlands to a third consecutive World Cup win following a hard-fought 2-0 victory against Chile. The Dutch, which tops Group B with maximum points, had already qualified for the next stage along with its South American opponents. Fer's 77th minute effort gave Louis van Gaal's side the lead before Depay rounded off a late counter attack to seal the win. Chile's first defeat of the tournament condemned Jorge Sampaoli's side into second place. Both teams will find out their fate on Monday night with Brazil, Mexico and Croatia fighting it out to qualify from Group A. After a forgettable first half, it was the Dutch which found its rhythm with the impressive Arjen Robben causing Chile all sorts of problems. But it was the introduction of substitutes Fer and Depay which made the difference. Fer had only been on the pitch for two minutes when he sent a thumping header past Claudio Bravo in the Chile goal after meeting Darryl Janmaat's fine free kick. And Depay, who became his country's youngest ever goalscorer at a World Cup during last week's 3-2 win over Australia, netted his second after great work by Robben. ""It was a very good game to watch,"" Robben said in a television interview following the game. ""There was a lot of passion on the pitch, we defended really well, I am proud of the way the team defended. ""I think we did a great job and this is not where we want to stop. It is a fantastic result and a fantastic performance and we don't want it to end here. ""We need to change our mindset as we want to move forward."" The Dutch, which lost out to Spain in the final four years ago, will play its second round game in Fortaleza on Sunday June 29. Chile, which reached the last 16 in 1998 and 2010, will play its next game on Saturday 28th June in Belo Horizonte. ""I think that this was a match that we expected, with the Netherlands trying to use lots of people on the counter attack,"" Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli told reporters. ""We looked for victory, we wanted to win and we couldn't find a solution to a team that only defended and only aspired to long-range shots, not even counterattacks. ""This is a Chile that I am proud to be at the helm of, in spite of the fact that we didn't get a result. The courage of the group, they have their heads held high and they are getting ready for the round of 16."" Australia 0-3 Spain . In the group's other game, David Villa brought down the curtain on his international career by firing Spain to its first victory of the World Cup. The reigning champion, which was knocked out of the tournament after losing its opening two games against Netherlands and Chile, defeated Australia in Curitiba. Villa, making his 97th appearance for his country, scored his 59th goal just before halftime to ensure Spain avoided a humiliating whitewash. The 32-year-old was in tears after being taken off after 57 minutes of the contest and watched on from the bench as Fernando Torres added a second. Juan Mata fired home a third with eight minutes remaining to seal the win. Australia, which lost all three games in the tournament, finishes bottom of the group, three points behind Spain.","Netherlands claims 2-0 victory over Chile .

"(CNN) -- Severe storms pummeled Alabama and cut a path of destruction across several other southern states Wednesday, killing dozens of people, leveling buildings and trapping residents in their homes. Authorities said at least 42 people died in storms across the region. Alabama appeared to be the hardest hit Wednesday night, with at least 25 people killed in severe storms and tornadoes, emergency management director Art Faulkner told CNN. The National Guard dispatched hundreds of personnel to some of the state's hardest hit areas. ""This has been a very serious and deadly event that's affected our state, and it's not over yet,"" Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley told reporters Wednesday evening. In a statement released by the White House late Wednesday, President Barack Obama announced he had approved Bentley's request for emergency federal assistance including search and rescue support. ""While we may not know the extent of the damage for days, we will continue to monitor these severe storms across the country and stand ready to continue to help the people of Alabama and all citizens affected by these storms,"" Obama said. ""Michelle and I extend our deepest condolences to the families of those who lost their lives because of the tornadoes that have swept through Alabama and the southeastern United States,"" he said. At least one strong tornado swept through Tuscaloosa, Alabama, leaving dozens of roads impassable and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. Video from CNN affiliates there showed a massive whirling cloud darkening the sky as it approached. ""It literally obliterated blocks and blocks of the city,"" Mayor Walter Maddox said, describing Tuscaloosa's infrastructure as ""decimated."" An apparent tornado blew out windows, ripped off siding and damaged cars as it hit the DCH Regional Medical Center there, Command Center Coordinator Janet Teer said. Soon afterward, witnesses reported tornado touchdowns in Birmingham, Alabama. ""It looked like it was probably a mile wide,"" Birmingham Mayor William Bell said. The northwest corner of the city was particularly devastated, he said, with hundreds injured and many others missing. A ""particularly dangerous situation"" tornado watch from the National Weather Service remained in effect Wednesday night for parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia -- including metro Atlanta. Several meteorological conditions combined Wednesday to create a particularly dangerous mix, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. A storm system that brought severe weather to parts of the South Plains earlier this week was heading east, a cold front was moving across the Deep South and upper levels of the atmosphere were conducive for severe storms. ""It is tornado season, but an intensive event like this only will occur maybe once or twice a year,"" he said. ""It's very rare to have all these ingredients come together."" Earlier Wednesday a tornado was believed to have struck the northern Alabama community of Cullman, damaging a hospital, ripping the roof off the courthouse and pummeling a number of residences, authorities said. Mayor Max Townson told CNN it appeared a tornado touched down on the west side of Cullman and then cut through the heart of the city, which has about 15,000 residents. ""Downtown was hit pretty hard,"" said Freddie Day of the Cullman police department. He said a number of ambulances had been dispatched throughout the city. It was not immediately known how many people were injured. Reports of people trapped in homes or overturned vehicles along with reports of downed power lines were coming in from every state in the region, according to emergency management officials. At least 11 people were killed in storm-related incidents in Mississippi Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to the state Emergency Management Agency, which revised its death toll down from six earlier in the day. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who lost loved ones or property in this devastating storm,"" said Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who declared a state of emergency in 39 of the state's counties. The declaration allows the state to offer aid to the counties during recovery efforts. The state was also bracing for flooding along the Mississippi River. A local coroner reported three people were killed in Ringgold and eight were taken to the hospital after a twister swept through the town in the northwestern part of the state.  Some buildings were completely demolished. A fourth died in nearby Trenton, Georgia, according to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. Arkansas and Tennessee reported that at least one person had died in storms in each of those states. Barbara Martocci with the Tennessee Valley Authority said the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Alabama automatically shut down after losing off-site power.  Power has since been restored, however the plant has not been brought back online, the official said. In Cullman, the severe weather caused a natural gas line to rupture, though the extent of the damage was not immediately known, said Day of the Cullman police department. Officials at Cullman Regional Medical Center were assessing damage after declaring  a ""code d"" -- a disaster -- at the facility, switchboard operator Sharon Barnett told CNN. There were no immediate reports of storm-related injuries at the hospital. One witness said the damage at the hospital was confined to the roof. ""There's no actual building damage, just stuff that fell off the roof,"" said Summer Frost, who works at a Subway restaurant inside the hospital. In Chattanooga, Tennessee, iReporter Erika Dunn said a tree fell on her great-aunt's home. She said her great-aunt reported the storm was so bad she could see a white wall of water coming toward the house. She was headed for her basement and was closing the door of her screened porch when the tree fell. ""It got really strong, really fast,"" Dunn said. Hundreds of thousands of people across the region were without power, including 269,000 in Birmingham, said Michael Sznajderman, spokesman for Alabama Power. ""We're chipping away"" at restoring power, he said, but crews may be forced to halt work as a second line of storms approach. CNN's Anna Rhett Miller, John Branch, Stephanie Gallman, Maria White, Vivian Kuo, Sean Morris, Dave Alsup, John Murgatroyd, Ed Payne, Phil Gast, Tommy Andres and Scott Thompson contributed to this report.","NEW: Three confirmed dead in Ringgold, Georgia .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a preview of a major constitutional showdown at the Supreme Court over same-sex marriage, the Obama administration said on Friday that a federal law denying financial benefits to legally wed gay and lesbian couples is unconstitutional. The Justice Department filed the first of a series of briefs in a pair of cases dealing with the multilayered issue, outlining the executive branch's positions. The high court will hear oral arguments next month on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples. This case deals with Edith ""Edie"" Windsor, forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay. Because her decades-long partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage in legal terms, even though their home state of New York did. But now, led by President Barack Obama's recent political about-face, the administration opposes the law. ""Moral opposition to homosexuality, though it may reflect deeply held personal views, is not a legitimate policy objective that can justify unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people"" contained in the DOMA law, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in the Justice Department's legal brief. The separate case from California deals with Proposition 8, a 2008 voter-approved referendum banning same-sex marriage. This after the California high court had earlier concluded same-sex couples could legally wed. That case too will be heard in late March. Though not a party in the California case, government sources say the Justice Department was prepared next week to file an ""amicus"" or supporting brief asserting a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and that Proposition 8 should be struck down as a violation of constitutionally guaranteed ""equal protection"" of the laws. Those sources say Obama was expected to make the final call on whether to intervene in the state dispute. ""I have to make sure that I'm not interjecting myself too much in this process, particularly when we're not a party to the case,"" Obama said Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco. Of more immediate concern was the DOMA fight, where the administration is squarely involved. But a tricky gateway or ""jurisdictional"" question threatens to stall any final consideration of the law's constitutionality. That was the focus of much of the Friday legal papers. The DOMA law will be defended by House Republicans, after Obama concluded the law was unconstitutional. Traditionally, that role would fall to the solicitor general's office. But Obama, in an election-year stunner, said last May that he supported same-sex marriage. The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA in court. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law. Besides the constitutional issue, the justices had specifically ordered both sides to argue a supplemental question: whether congressional Republicans -- operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives -- have ""standing"" or legal authority to make the case. Lawyers representing the House GOP said Friday that they should be able to take the lead and defend the law, since both Windsor and the Obama administration are taking the same legal position. ""Without the House's participation,"" said attorney Paul Clement, representing House leaders, ""it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all. Both Ms. Windsor and the executive agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [tax] refund. And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested. Only the House's intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [federal court jurisdiction] demands."" But the Justice Department said it alone should present the government's case. ""House Republicans lack ""any basis for supplanting the executive branch's exclusive role in representing the United States' interests in this litigation, and has no interests of its own that would satisfy"" federal court scrutiny, said administration lawyers. Windsor's legal team also said the House leaders could defend DOMA, at least partially, suggesting the woman wants ultimate resolution on the constitutional questions as soon as possible. ""I was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life, and I was also very sick, then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes,"" the 83-year-old Windsor told CNN recently. ""And it was deeply upsetting."" The story of Edith and Thea . That fundamental unfairness, as Windsor and her supporters see it, is at the center of DOMA legal fight. In November, three states -- Maryland, Washington, and Maine -- approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already have done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment. As more states legalize same-sex marriage, one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an ""equal protection"" right of marriage to homosexuals. A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA. That law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans, and other benefits. Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law. But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California's Proposition 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. That makes it a somewhat unique legal case for review by the justices. The DOMA cases are U.S. v. Windsor (12-307) and Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives v. Windsor (12-785).","The Justice Department files first in a series of legal briefs involving two big cases .

"(CNN) -- If you walk past the Barford family garage in Northampton, England on a Sunday afternoon, there's every chance you'll see a 10-meter-long wing sticking out into the driveway, and a dad and his two kids building a peculiar transparent airplane. ""We've got pictures of it being built, where my son... he was probably seven or eight when he's holding the first part that we made,"" says David Barford, 44. ""And then he's 16 and taller than me when he's holding the last parts."" ""So all through their life, if they want to know where dad was, dad was probably in the garage, building his plane."" A peculiar obsession . Barford is part of a small group possessed by a peculiar obsession. The plane he's assembling at home has no engine -- none apart from the pilot's cycling power, driving an oversized propeller. Enthusiasts like Barford -- he mentions John McIntyre in nearby Cambridgeshire and Peer Franck in Germany, and there are a scattering of others across the globe -- dream of flying as the first aeronautical test pilots once did: human-powered. ""Pure,"" as Barford describes it. He recalls being a seven-year-old, himself, and trying to recreate the man-powered star of the Oscar winning documentary Flight of the Gossamer Condor -- American Dr. Paul B. MacCready's machine which took flight in the Mojave Desert in 1976. In model form, at least. The ungainly machine was the beginning of his fascination: . ""To look at it, it's not elegant. To look at it, it's not beautiful at all. It flies backwards, the elevator is at the front of the wing...,"" he describes. Paper airplane -- made real . At a glance, Barford's homemade creation is barely more substantial than the kitchen-cupboard replicas of his youth. Despite its 22-meter wingspan -- proportional to a small Boeing that you might travel on holiday in, he notes -- his BetterFly weighs little more than 40kg. That's about half Barford's bodyweight. Barford draws on the experience of his day job -- as an engineer on Mercedes-Benz's Formula One engines -- to cut milligrams off weight by drilling out screws and forging hollow carbon tubes for the plane's skeleton. Beyond that, though, everything is store bought. The handcrafted amateurishness of it all is part of the appeal. Barford was never interested in shiny new jets, mass produced from precision laser cut parts by teams of professionals -- ""That wasn't flying as I wanted to experience flying."" Barford's design, for all the fine attention to detail, is all about making it up yourself, he says. And he is not embarrassed to admit that some fundamental details -- like whereabouts the all important center of gravity is -- ""had just been wet finger guessed with a cup of tea in my hand."" Just Right . Preparing to attempt the first flight, Barford gave his plane a ""50-50"" chance of coming home in a black bin bag. Everything had to be designed ""on a knife edge"" -- being just robust enough to hold together, while remaining light enough to leave the ground. Toward the end of construction, he realized the main spar stretching across the back of the wing was coming in heavier than expected. He knew what he'd have to do: . ""It put me on the best diet I have ever had! So I lost 8 kilograms in weight to match the plane!"" He booked a week off work, hoping to return as anything other than the ""laughing stock"" he assumed he'd be if his decade long quest failed. Just days before the flight, the Barford family gazed out the window as buckets of rain fell. ""My wife's birthday is May 23rd, so I promised to avoid flying on her birthday. But as the weather happens to have it, the Monday and Tuesday were blowy and windy and wet, and the forecast on her birthday was beautiful. ""So we dropped a few hints...,"" he smiles. The original dream of flight . Standing on the runway, that evening, as night fell, he gave himself a moment to admire his creation -- ""It was light, it was elegant, it was complete. It was finished."" -- before takeoff. ""Pedaling and pedaling away, you can just...it is really beautiful."" ""All of a sudden you get to a certain speed and you just rise up. Really smoothly -- no dramatic effort involved."" ""You keep going, and it all goes quiet, and you are lifted up -- but you are lifted from your hips and your back so you are just cuddled up into the air,"" he enthuses. The first flight was around 50 meters -- ""not just a hop,"" he says. ""Proper flying."" ""It's quite odd to be in a plane that you are pedaling: you are flying, but you can look down and see people, and you can look into the distance and there are birds flying along beside you."" ""The day after our flight... I drove to work and saw a buzzard just hovering. And I thought: 'Yeah -- you and me, mate. I can join you.""","David Barford is part of a small group of amateurs obsessed with man-powered aircraft .

"(CNN) -- Zachary Reyna, a 12-year-old Florida boy stricken with a brain-eating parasite, has died, according to a post Saturday on a Facebook page that's been providing detailed updates from the boy's family. The post indicated that the LaBelle child died Saturday afternoon. ""The battle is over for Zac but he won the war,"" the post concluded. About an hour later, a new message said that a ventilator was being used so that the boy's organs could be donated, adding that family and friends can visit him at Miami Children's Hospital during visiting hours Sunday. ""Even though Zac has passed, he will still be saving many lives,"" this new post said. Doctors had given Zachary an experimental drug to treat the rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri, that he had. This same drug was used to treat 12-year-old Kali Hardig recently in Arkansas, after which she became only the third person in the last 50 years known to survive the deadly parasite. Zachary's family told CNN affiliate WBBH they believe that the boy -- who they described as an active seventh-grader -- was infected while kneeboarding with friends in a water-filled ditch by his house on August 3. After he was hospitalized, the boy underwent brain surgery, and doctors diagnosed him with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, according to WBBH. After news emerged regarding Zachary's diagnosis, the Florida Department of Health issued a warning to swimmers that high water temperatures and low water levels provide the perfect breeding ground for this rare amoeba. Between 2001 and 2010, there were only 32 reported cases of people getting Naegleria fowleri in the United States, according to the CDC. Most of the cases have been in the Southeast. Girl battling brain-eating amoeba moves out of ICU . Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC said. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali's case.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans are fashioning a scaled-down bill to address the southern border crisis that would provide less than $1 billion and include an immigration policy change that most Democrats strongly oppose. There is increasing concern from members that they cannot leave town next week for their August recess without showing they have a solution to the surge of migrant youth from Central America overwhelming immigration services. ""I'm not going home -- I don't have enough guns to protect myself,"" Texas GOP Rep. John Carter told CNN about his determination to get something passed in the House. Expressing his anxiety about the need to address the situation in his state, Carter said, ""It's that bad in Texas."" Poll: Border crisis impacts public opinion . But even if the House does pass a measure, a significant number of Senate Democrats are pushing for a larger spending bill without any policy change. So, it's unclear whether legislation would get to President Barack Obama's desk in time. Earlier this week, House GOP leaders discussed a $1.5 billion package -- more than $1 billion less than a plan introduced on Tuesday by Senate Democrats and significantly smaller than the $3.7 billion proposal the White House sent to Congress earlier this month. Obama meeting with Central American leaders . But with solid Democratic opposition, House Speaker John Boehner and his deputies struggled to get enough support from fellow Republicans to hit the 218-vote threshold needed for passage. A significant bloc of GOP members doesn't want to give Obama any more money or change a law they don't believe he'll enforce anyway. Texas Rep. Kay Granger said after a meeting with all House Republicans on Friday that the emerging plan will include some key recommendations from a border working group appointed by Boehner that she headed up. The package will also have a smaller price tag. The chief policy aim is to alter a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children coming to the United States from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Currently, they are permitted to stay in the country until they receive a hearing. That can take months or years. Those who maintain they face threats of sexual abuse or violence would stay in United States and receive a hearing within seven days. The Obama administration has indicated that it is open to making some tweaks to the law, but many congressional Democrats oppose changes and reject the GOP's move to attach that provision to the border money. Florida Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, a member of the GOP working group that traveled to Central American recently, argued that linking the policy with the money was critical. ""You have to deal with the problem. The perception by people in other countries that America will allow you to come here and make any claim you choose and stay. That is not true. We need to engage the President,"" be said. The House GOP bill also calls for sending National Guard troops to the border and allowing Border Patrol agents to enter federal lands. Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican, told CNN there was ""broad consensus"" to vote on the measure next week. White House: Congress shouldn't leave town without acting . One conservative GOP member, South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, questioned whether the situation was really the crisis that many say it is, but said he supported the pledge from leaders to offset the new spending by drawing funds from other programs. ""As long as it's paid for I have no difficulty with moving money within the government. You're going to have to find a way to care for the people who are here, that's the reality we face. You're going to have to find a way to pay for sending people home. That's just a reality we face,"" Mulvaney said. Acknowledging that the GOP bill could fail to attract enough Democrats and conservatives, Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger said, ""If they want to vote no, let them. Let them own their votes."" The No. 2 Democrat in the Senate drew a hard line on accepting any immigration policy changes as part of the border bill. ""The overwhelming majority of Democrats think it's a mistake,"" Sen. Dick Durbin told CNN on Thursday. Sen Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the 2008 law's original author and now the point person for the White House on finding a way to make changes, told CNN she does not think it can happen by the end of next week.

"(CNN) -- The police officer who fatally shot a 93-year-old woman at her home in Texas has been fired after a city council vote Saturday. Officer Stephen Stem was dismissed from the Hearne Police Department on Saturday after the city council voted 6-0 to take disciplinary action against him, said Jessica Vega, Hearne Police Department communications supervisor. Stem was advised by his attorney not to attend the council meeting, according to CNN affiliate KBTX. In the meantime, Texas Rangers continue the investigation into why Pearlie Golden, a longtime resident in this small town of about 4,600 people, was shot multiple times at her home Tuesday. A man believed to be a relative of Golden's made a 911 call asking for help from police, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said. ""What I understand is (Hearne police) were called out because a woman was brandishing a firearm,"" Siegert said. ""An officer asked her to put the handgun down, and when she would not, shots were fired."" Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times. Stem fired three times, and Golden was hit at least twice, he said. She was transported to a local hospital, where she died. The Hearne Police Department placed Stem on administrative leave pending the inquiry. ""We're very saddened by this. Everybody in the city government is deeply disappointed that this lady was killed,"" Russ said. ""Now, the investigation is out of our hands. It's under the Texas Rangers, which is where we want it to be."" According to police, the Texas Rangers have a revolver believed to have been in Golden's possession at the time of the shooting. Community members told CNN affiliate KBTX that Golden, known affectionately as ""Ms. Sully,"" was a sweet woman. ""Even if she did have a gun, she is in her 90s,"" Lawanda Cooke told KBTX. ""They could have shot in the air to scare her. Maybe she would have dropped it. I don't see her shooting anyone."" In a statement released to CNN affiliate KBTX on Friday, Stem's attorney Robert McCabe said he is ""fully confident that Officer Stem's actions were immediately necessary and legally justified"" and plans to meet with Stem next week to discuss his job termination. The case will eventually be presented to a grand jury, which is standard procedure when dealing with officer-involved incidents, Russ said. ""I would expect people to be upset about this, a young police officer shooting a 93-year-old lady,"" Russ said. ""I'm upset about it. Most of our citizens are upset, but at the same time I don't believe all the facts have come to the surface yet."" Parents doubt official account of how their son was shot by officer .

"London (CNN) -- Engineers have uncovered the haunting remains of a mummified cat bricked up inside the wall of a cottage near the site of one of Britain's most infamous witch trials. Workers made the startling discovery during routine maintenance on a reservoir in the shadow of Pendle Hill in Lancashire, England's ""witching country."" They called in archaeologists, who unearthed a cottage believed to date from the 17th century buried beneath a grassy mound. Inside, they found a sealed room where the cat had been walled up. The area is famous for the Pendle witch trials, which saw 10 women and two men accused of using witchcraft to murder people in the 1600s. It is thought the unfortunate feline may have been buried alive by the cottage's superstitious inhabitants, in an attempt to protect them from evil spirits. ""It's not often you come across a fairytale cottage complete with witch's cat,"" said Carl Sanders, project manager for water company United Utilities. ""The building is in remarkable condition. You can walk through it and get a real sense that you're peering into the past. ""Pendle Hill has a real aura about it -- it's hard not to be affected by the place. Even before we discovered the building, there were lots of jokes from the lads about broomsticks and black cats. The find has really stunned us all."" Simon Entwhistle, an expert on the Pendle witches, likened the find -- which he said could be the Malkin Tower, site of a notorious meeting of the ""coven"" on Good Friday, 1612 -- to ""discovering Tutankhamun's tomb."" ""We are just a few months away from the 400th anniversary of the Pendle witch trials, and here we have an incredibly rare find, right in the heart of witching country. ""Cats feature prominently in folklore about witches,"" said Entwhistle. ""Whoever consigned this cat to such a horrible fate was clearly seeking protection from evil spirits. It's an absolutely spellbinding discovery."" ""It's like discovering your own little Pompei,"" said Frank Giecco of NP Archaeology, who led the team which excavated the building. ""We rarely get the opportunity to work with something so well preserved. ""As soon as we started digging we found the tops of doors and knew we were onto something special. ""The building is a microcosm for the rise and fall of this area, from the time of the Pendle witches to the industrial age -- there are layers of local history right before your eyes."" Archaeologists also uncovered a host of other artifacts in and around the cottage -- including a 19th century kitchen range, tin bath, bedstead and items of crockery.","Mummified cat found sealed inside wall of cottage hidden beneath earth mound .

"(CNN) -- Police agencies across Australia put out alerts Monday declaring as fake text messages and emails sent to thousands of Australians that said they had two days to pay $5,000 or die. ""Do not respond,"" said Detective Superintendent Brian Hay of the Queensland Police Service. ""Delete it immediately and don't panic, because that's what they prey upon."" The messages started assaulting mobile phones and email accounts Sunday. Police did not provide an exact figure but said they were surprised by the scope of the scam. ""What is extraordinary in these circumstances is the extent of contact across the Australian landscape,"" Hay said. ""We've never seen this before. I've never seen this before."" While authorities are still investigating, past hoaxes have originated in west Africa, typically Nigeria, he said. The message reads: ""Sum1 paid me to kill you. Get spared, 48hrs to pay $5000. If you inform the police or anybody, death is promised."" It then directs the recipient to contact them at a Yahoo email account. Police say seniors and those not familiar with the Internet are most likely to get scammed. ""They rely upon your fear to not think logically, but to respond in the manner in which they want you to,"" Hay said. ""I would suspect that people have already fallen victim to this fraud."" The so-called hit-man scam has had two previous forays in Australia over the last two and a half years, according to Hay. ""This is not a random event. This is organized crime,"" Hay said, noting the complexities of pulling off a scam of this magnitude. ""They've done their research. They've acquired their contact lists. They've paid for the distribution of the text messages."" Hays warned that the criminals will be back again if their efforts prove profitable enough.","The message asks for $5,000 or promises death .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister continued his outspoken criticism of China's crackdown on ethnic Uyghurs on Saturday. A Uyghur student cries as Turks pray on Friday in Ankara, Turkey, for people who died in protests in Urumqi, China. In remarks published by the official Anatolian Agency, Recep Tayyip Erdogan denouncing what he called ""savagery"" and called on the Chinese government to ""give up efforts to assimilate"" the country's Uyghur minority. On Friday, Erdogan went a step further, announcing to journalists upon his return to Ankara from the Group of Eight summit in Italy that ""the incidents in China are a genocide. There's no point in interpreting this otherwise."" Many Turks view the Uyghurs of Central Asia as fellow Turkic, Muslim brothers. At least 184 people died in last weekend's violent protests in Urumqi, in China's far-west Xinjiang region, according to Chinese state-run media. The violent demonstrations also left more than 1,000 injured in the capital, according to government figures. Heavily armed troops remain on the streets of Urumqi and curfews are in effect. The violence is a result of ethnic tensions between the Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of China's Han majority. Hundreds of Han Chinese were on the streets of Urumqi last Tuesday, holding sticks and pipes and calling for severe punishment of the Uyghurs, who they say committed serious crimes. The Uyghurs say they have been victimized and many of those killed in the violence Sunday were Uyghurs. Uyghur religious leaders have condemned the violence, saying it is against the spirit of the Muslim faith and Uyghur tradition. Several hundred Turkish and Uyghur demonstrators gathered during the past week to protest outside the Chinese embassy in Ankara. In another comment widely reported in the Turkish press, Erdogan announced he would be willing to approve a visa for Rebiya Kadeer, an exiled Uyghur activist currently residing in the United States. Kadeer issued a response on Saturday, which was distributed to CNN from her publisher and publicist, Kenneth Kales. ""I am grateful to Prime Minister Erdogan for his comment that Turkey will grant me a visa. I look forward to traveling to Turkey as soon as possible. The Uyghur and the Turkish people share close cultural and linguistic roots. ""The Uyghurs and Turks consider themselves as the same people. Uyghurs cherish our common language, customs, and spirit of freedom. We embrace the opportunity to meet with our Turkish cousins."" However, Kadeer was ""not entitled to represent the Uyghur people,"" a former Xinjiang official said, according to China's state-run media. Ismail Amat, an ethnic Uyghur who headed China's Xinjiang regional government, was quoted by the Xinhua news agency as calling Kadeer ""scum.""","Turkey's PM calls on China to stop assimilation efforts of Uyghurs in Xinjiang .

"(CNN) -- The mayor of Nogales, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on charges he took bribes to protect contracts or obtain business contracts with the city, the state attorney general said. Octavio Garcia-Von Borstel, 29, of Nogales, was arrested at his office at city hall, according to the Arizona attorney general's office, which announced the arrest and an indictment on state charges. Search warrants were executed at the mayor's home, business and city hall office. The mayor is also accused of money laundering, conflict of interest, illegally conducting an enterprise and fraud. The mayor's father, Octavio Garcia Suarez, 59, of Nogales, also was indicted and arrested. He faces several charges that include fraud, theft and money laundering, the attorney general's statement indicated. ""Both the mayor and his father will be held accountable and prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" Attorney General Terry Goddard said. A spokeswoman for the city said Garcia-Von Borstel, who has been in office since April 2008, was taken into custody around 9:30 a.m. Santa Cruz County Justice Court Judge Mary Helen Maley set bond at $250,000, a clerk said later Tuesday. The mayor's next hearing was scheduled for October 4. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Southern Arizona Corruption Task Force assisted in the investigation in the border city. FBI spokesman Special Agent Manuel Johnson in Phoenix would not elaborate on the case. According to the statement, FBI agents began investigating Garcia-Von Borstel five months ago and determined that he was soliciting Nogales businesses to hire him as a business consultant as early as February 2009. At least one business admitted to the FBI that it was paying the mayor to use his official position to obtain business contracts and, specifically, to obtain new city of Nogales contracts, the attorney general stated. Further investigation determined the mayor also received money from at least one business in exchange for utilizing his official position to protect a contract the business owner had with the city and to assist the business owner in obtaining an additional city contract, added Goddard, who is running for governor. The indictment cites $4,000 and $2,000 payments, without providing details. The mayor's father, Garcia Suarez, was an agent for Western Union authorized to sell Western Union money orders from his money transmitter business, ACE Cash Express, in Nogales, officials said. The state alleges that Garcia Suarez fraudulently reported that Western Union money orders worth $3.2 million were sold, although there were no cash deposits to back them up. The money orders were then cashed by Garcia-Von Borstel and deposited into a bank account he controlled, the statement said. Of the $3.2 million, the father and son withdrew $565,000 for their personal use before the account was frozen, it said. A phone message and e-mail to the mayor were not immediately returned.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Gulf state health and fisheries officials and leaders from several federal agencies will collaborate to set safety levels for seafood coming out of the Gulf of Mexico, Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday. ""We want one single standard so you don't have to worry about where you fish, when you can fish,"" Biden said. ""Bottom line is, we want to get fishermen back out on the water as soon as possible after the oil has been removed."" The plan will be devised and carried out in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, he said. Representatives from NOAA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency met last week in New Orleans with state health officers and state fisheries directors from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas to fine-tune the plan for sampling state and federal waters and deciding when to reopen them. ""Together, they will implement a comprehensive, coordinated, multi-agency program to ensure that seafood from the Gulf of Mexico is safe to eat,"" NOAA and the FDA said in a joint news release. ""This is important not only for consumers who need to know their food is safe to eat, but also for fishermen who need to be able to sell their products with confidence."" ""No single agency could adequately ensure the safety of seafood coming from the Gulf following this tragedy, but in working together, we can be sure that tainted waters are closed as appropriate, contaminated seafood is not allowed to make it to market, and that closed waters can be reopened to fishing as soon as is safe,"" said Eric Schwaab, NOAA assistant administrator for fisheries, in the release. NOAA said it was applying the protocol in considering whether to reopen two areas off Louisiana and Florida. The release also quoted Michael Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods, saying, ""We understand the devastating effects this spill has had on the Gulf states and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with state and federal partners to ensure that these important protocols are implemented efficiently, effectively and in a way that makes sense for all involved, while maintaining the No. 1 priority we all share -- protecting the health of those in the Gulf Coast and across the country."" NOAA and FDA are also testing fish caught outside closed areas to see whether they contain petroleum compounds, the release said. ""So far, fish flesh tested from outside the closure areas have tested well below any level of concern for oil-based contamination,"" it said. Biden made his announcement after touring the operations center in New Orleans. ""I just came to say thanks,"" the vice president told staffers at the center. ""I appreciate it. You're probably missing out on vacation. My mother would say, 'God love you.'"" Biden later flew to Naval Air Station Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle, where he sought to reassure Gulf Coast residents of the government's long-term commitment to recovery efforts in the area. ""We ... intend to stick with this region until it is made whole so we can repair the economy and rebuild the ecosystem and restart a way of life from Louisiana to here,"" Biden said. He was scheduled to continue on to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, for dinner with Gen. David Petraeus and his wife at their home. Biden's visit came on the 71st day of the spill that President Barack Obama has called the nation's worst environmental disaster. His comments also came as officials prepared to close Pensacola Pass, the main entry from the Gulf of Mexico into Pensacola Bay, because of an approaching six-square-mile patch of ""dark red tar mats"" ranging in size from 6 feet to 10 feet across, according to Escambia County spokeswoman Sonya Daniel. The pass will reopen Wednesday with the outgoing tide, said Daniel, who added that the pass has been closed in the past to other oil incidents. Daniel also noted that tar mats are easier to corral while still in the water. BP said Tuesday it is on track to reach its August deadline of getting a relief well down to the area where the oil is leaking in the Gulf of Mexico. The relief well has reached a depth of 16,770 feet, but engineers plan to drill an additional 900 feet vertically before cutting in sideways, said Kent Wells, BP senior vice president of exploration and production. Meanwhile, efforts continue to increase the containment of leaking oil. The next step is to bring in a third rig called the Helix Producer at the well, which would increase the containment by 20,000 to 25,000 more barrels per day, Wells said. But the arrival, originally planned for Tuesday, was delayed until perhaps July 6 or 7 by rough seas, said Mark Proegler, a spokesman for BP. The work of two other vessels, the Discoverer Enterprise and the Q4000, was continuing without interruption, he said. The use of skimmers, which require calm seas to be effective, was suspended Monday and Tuesday, he said. But the use of dispersants continued, with a total to date of nearly 1.6 million gallons recovered, he said. BP spokesman Brian Ferguson said that surface burning of oil and the placing of additional booms also were suspended in the choppy 5- to 7-foot seas. Alex was approaching hurricane strength Tuesday evening and was located off the coast of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in the Bay of Campeche. At 5 p.m. ET, it was moving to the northwest at about 13 mph, the National Hurricane Center said, but was headed away from the area affected by the oil spill. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels (about 1.5 million gallons) and 60,000 barrels (about 2.5 million gallons) of oil are gushing into the gulf every day. But even with BP feverishly trying to contain it, more and more oil seems to wash up on the coasts of some Gulf states. Connie Moran, the mayor of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, said she was going to have to close a beach in her town Tuesday. ""What we're seeing actually is minimal tar balls anywhere from a penny to half-a-dollar size. They are tacky,"" she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Taliban leaders are holding Saudi-brokered talks with the Afghan government to end the country's bloody conflict -- and are severing their ties with al Qaeda, sources close to the historic discussions have told CNN. King Abdullah of Saudia Arabia hosted meetings between the Afghan government and the Taliban, a source says. The militia, which has been intensifying its attacks on the U.S.-led coalition that toppled it from power in 2001 for harboring Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, has been involved in four days of talks hosted by Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, says the source. The talks -- the first of their kind aimed at resolving the lengthy conflict in Afghanistan -- mark a significant move by the Saudi leadership to take a direct role in Afghanistan, hosting delegates who have until recently been their enemies. They also mark a sidestepping of key ""war on terror"" ally Pakistan, frequently accused of not doing enough to tackle militants sheltering on its territory, which has previously been a conduit for talks between the Saudis and Afghanistan. According to the source, fugitive Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar -- high on the U.S. military's most-wanted list -- was not present, but his representatives were keen to stress the reclusive cleric is no longer allied to al Qaeda. Details of the Taliban leader's split with al Qaeda have never been made public before, but the new claims confirm what another source with an intimate knowledge of the militia and Mullah Omar has told CNN in the past. The current round of talks, said to have been taken two years of intense behind-the-scenes negotiations to come to fruition, is anticipated to be the first step in a long process to secure a negotiated end to the conflict. But U.S.- and Europe-friendly Saudi Arabia's involvement has been propelled by a mounting death toll among coalition troops amid a worsening violence that has also claimed many civilian casualties. A Saudi source familiar with the talks confirmed that they happened and said the Saudis take seriously their role in facilitating discussions between parties to the conflict. A second round of talks is scheduled to take place in two months, the Saudi source said. The Afghan government believes the Taliban cannot be defeated militarily, and the Taliban believe that they can't win a war against the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan, the Saudi source said. The involvement of the Saudis is also seen as an expression of fear that Iran could take advantage of U.S. failings in Afghanistan, as it is seen to be doing in Iraq. Several Afghan sources familiar with Iranian activities in Afghanistan have said Iranian officials and diplomats who are investing in business and building education facilities are lobbying politicians in Kabul.  Learn more about King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia » . The Afghan sources wish to remain anonymous due to their political roles. Coalition commanders regularly accuse Iran of arming the Taliban, and Western diplomats privately suggest that Iran is working against U.S. interests in Afghanistan, making it harder to bring peace. Saudi sources say perceived Iranian expansionism is one of Saudi Arabia's biggest concerns.  Watch CNN's Nic Robertson report on the meeting » . The talks in Mecca took place between September 24 and 27 and involved 11 Taliban delegates, two Afghan government officials, a representative of former mujahadeen commander and U.S. foe Gulbadin Hekmatyar, and three others. King Abdullah broke fast during the Eid al-Fitr holiday with the 17-member Afghan delegation -- an act intended to show his commitment to ending the conflict. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting.  Learn more about Ramadan » . Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries that recognized the Taliban leadership during its rule over Afghanistan in the 1990s, but that relationship was severed over Mullah Omar's refusal to hand over bin Laden. During the talks, described as an ice breaker, all parties agreed that the only solution to Afghanistan's conflict is through dialogue, not fighting. Further talks are expected in Saudi Arabia involving this core group and others.","King Abdullah hosted talks in city of Mecca at end of September, source says .

"(CNN) -- It's snow joke -- but the weather has become the focus of the United States' attempts to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. Costa Rica has asked football's global governing body FIFA to replay their 2014 World Cup qualifying match against the U.S. after it was staged in a snowstorm. Friday's contest at Colorado's Dick's Sporting Goods Park finished 1-0 to Jurgen Klinsmann's U.S. team, with Clint Dempsey's first-half goal proving the difference between the two teams. But the contest was overshadowed by heavy snowfall, which the Costa Rican Football Federation claims affected the players' ""physical integrity"". ""We can confirm that FIFA has received a letter from the Costa Rica FA regarding last Friday's FIFA World Cup qualifier,"" read a statement sent to CNN by football's world governing body. ""FIFA will now analyze the content of the letter and next steps will be determined in due course."" The Costa Rican Federation is unhappy the lines and markings on the pitch were invisible at times during the game in Commerce City, while also claiming the movement of the ball was impeded by the snow. The match was briefly paused at the beginning of the second half, but officials eventually decided play should resume. Costa Rica has also called for the match officials to be punished for allowing the match to get underway. ""It was terrible,"" the Costa Rican Federation's president Eduardo Li told the Zona Tecnica football show. ""While the match was being played, at the same time, machines and people came onto the field to clean the lines. ""We fought -- we talked to the [match] commissioner, who totally rejected our complaint. These are embarrassing situations we should not accept."" Havoc . The win was the U.S.'s first of this qualifying campaign following a 2-1 defeat to Honduras last month. The victory put the U.S. second on three points behind Honduras in a group from which the top three countries will go to Brazil, while the fourth-placed team will play off against the Oceania group winners New Zealand. Costa Rica are bottom of the North, Central America and Caribbean group with just one point. Snow also wreaked havoc across Europe, with Northern Ireland's home match with Russia, initially scheduled for Friday, twice postponed due to bad weather. FIFA is yet to announce when the European qualification Group F fixture will take place.

Eventually, the two rivers become one, and the mighty Amazon continues its journey through northern Brazil. It is just one of the countless features that makes Manaus such a unique city. With the Amazon rainforest as its backyard, FIFA and city officials hope it will also be enough to draw in fans from around the world as one of Brazil's 12 host cities for the 2014 World Cup. The city of two million people rises from the rainforest, isolated from much of the rest of Brazil's population. Traffic jams clog the streets. Fishing boats dot the river. Ports swarm with activity during the day, and overnight. In the middle of it all, a stadium is being built from the ashes of one that stood before it. In this spot, the Arena da Amazonia is being constructed to welcome the world next summer. The renderings of what the completed stadium will look like can be seen all over the city, from the sides of city buses to billboards above the busy streets. But in reality, there is still much to be done. In June, it was a still a concrete shell, with no seats, no roof, no grass. To complicate matters, having the rainforest as a backdrop is both a blessing and a curse. Instead of having a full year to prepare, Manaus has just a few months remaining until the intense rainy season hits in December. If the stadium is not ready by then, construction will become that much more difficult. Miguel Capobiango Neto is the city liaison's officer to FIFA, overseeing World Cup preparations for the city, and that includes the Arena da Amazonia. In June, he estimated the stadium was about 65 percent complete, and on track to finish in December. Sustainability . The construction of the stadium is as unique as the city that's building it. To save time, parts of the stadium -- such as the roof, for example -- are being built in other locations like Portugal, Germany and southern Brazil. The pieces are then assembled in Manaus, creating another challenge. ""These logistics give us a big headache,"" Neto said. ""We need very good planning to have everything here at the right time."" Meant to look like a basket made by indigenous tribes in the rainforest, eco-friendly elements have gone into its construction, so ample rainwater will water the pitch, while sunlight and wind will be harnessed for power. ""When we thought about making this arena, we thought about sustainability,"" Neto said. ""Everybody here in the Amazon region worries about the environment, so we tried to follow that way of thinking...like saving the rain water, using sunlight, and using the wind."" When it is complete, the stadium will hold 44,000 people, and cost an estimated $550 million Brazilian reais, or about $225 million -- if it is completed on time, and on budget. During the recent Confederations Cup, protests erupted over whether the money being spent on the World Cup might be better invested elsewhere and in Manaus the big question remains -- what will happen when the World Cup is over? Manaus' local football teams don't draw in a big crowd. So the city has plans to use the stadium for other events, like concerts, conferences, and even UFC fights -- with jujitsu as perhaps the area's most popular sport. City organizers are focused on the bigger picture, knowing the World Cup can bring more than just a new stadium. They hope it will leave a lasting legacy of infrastructure improvements the city so desperately needs -- like more reliable electricity, internet, and transportation upgrades. Long after the final whistle blows next summer, and a champion is crowned, that will be the true legacy of Manaus as a World Cup host city.","Manaus, right next to Amazon, is one of host cities for the 2014 Brazil World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Tommy Chong, one-half of the marijuana-loving ""Cheech and Chong"" comedy duo, is battling prostate cancer, he announced Saturday on CNN. Having first noticed symptoms about eight years ago while incarcerated for selling drug paraphernalia, Chong said he was diagnosed ""about a month ago."" He revealed his condition in an interview about his support for decriminalizing marijuana use and sales. ""I've got prostate cancer, and I'm treating it with hemp oil, with cannabis,"" he told CNN's Don Lemon. ""So (legalizing marijuana) means a lot more to me than just being able to smoke a joint without being arrested."" Chong described the cancer ""as a slow stage one (that I've) had for a long time."" He said that he was drug free for about three years, during which time he began having prostate-related problems. ""So I know it had nothing to do with cannabis,"" he said. ""Cannabis is a cure."" He and his on-screen partner Cheech Marin recorded a series of hot-selling comedy albums in the early 1970s, before hitting the big screen in 1978 with ""Up in Smoke."" It was the first of several ""Cheech and Chong"" films chronicling the adventures and misadventures of the stoner pair. The two continue to tour as a comedic act, with shows scheduled for later this month and the fall, according to their official website. Besides the ""Cheech and Chong"" films, Chong has appeared in several TV series, such as ""That 70's Show."" He's authored several books including ""The I Chong: Meditations from the Joint"" about his ""family business"" specializing in handmade bongs, arrest and nine months in federal prison, according to his and Marin's website. Chong, 74, explained to CNN that he doesn't smoke marijuana, which he said he'd quit about a year ago ""for health reasons,"" to treat his prostate cancer.

"Jindo, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's prime minister announced his resignation Sunday morning, taking responsibility for the slow initial response to a ferry's sinking that has left nearly 200 dead with scores more still missing. Prime Minister Chung Hong-won outlined his decision, and apologized to victims' families, in remarks on national television. ""During the search process, the government took inadequate measures and disappointed the public,"" Chung said. ""I should take responsibility for everything as the prime minister, but the government can assume no more. So I will resign as prime minister."" With his announcement, Chung urged his countrymen to stand united, rather than divided. ""Please come together as one for the recovery efforts,"" he said. Chung becomes the highest-profile public figure yet to fall following the April 16 disaster and subsequent response, which elicited considerable sorrow and anger from the South Korean public. Eleven days later, searchers are still looking for passengers and crew aboard the Sewol ferry. They have retrieved 187 bodies so far, with another 115 still missing. The search Saturday was suspended due to bad weather that made diving through the murky waters especially dangerous. A day earlier, divers found the bodies of 48 girls -- wearing their life jackets -- pressed into a room too small for so many people. Divers believe that they will face the same scene again. There may be a second, similar room, where 50 more girls are believed to have been trapped when the ferry rolled over. South Korean coast guard diver Kim Dong-soo said he had tears in his eyes when he heard about the accident. ""Even now, I'm searching as if I'm looking for my own children -- and other coast guards feel the same way,"" he told CNN. ""I have two medical patches on me, have difficulty breathing and my head hurts. But it hurts the most in my heart, knowing those children are still in the cold water."" Those still diving face a search that is getting harder and slower. Now they will head down deep for cabins near the seabed. In the cramped spaces, divers have been battling a forest of floating objects and doors forced shut by tremendous water pressure. Currents tug at the breathing tubes that keep them alive as they look for the dead. There may be fewer bodies to retrieve, but divers have already searched the easily accessible places, said South Korean navy Capt. Kim Jin-hwang, commander of the rescue operation. ""But the navy will not stop until the last body is found,"" he said. Fisherman: Disaster haunts his sleep . Fisherman Kim Hyun-ho finds no peace when he lies down at night. The hundreds of dead or missing passengers from the Sewol ferry disaster haunt his sleep. Their screams ring in his head. He has vivid memories of his rush to save them in his modest fishing boat off South Korea's coast 10 days ago. Kim thinks he may have pulled 25 people from the frigid waters of the Yellow Sea, he said Saturday. But the man from a nearby tiny island of just 100 people feels no pride, only torment. ""It was hell. Agonizing. There were a lot of people and not enough boats, people in the water yelling for help. The ferry was sinking fast,"" he said. He watched people trapped inside go under with the vessel yards in front of him. Then he heard on television how many people were sealed up in the ship. The father of two grown children is heartbroken for the hundreds of parents who have lost theirs, those he could not save. He's trying to fish again, but he's a changed man, he says. Legal ramifications . As the effort inside the ship continues, South Korean authorities are pressing a criminal investigation into the sinking. It's resulted in the arrests of the ship's captain and 14 other members. Yang Joong-Jin, the senior prosecutor for the investigation task force in Mokpo, South Korea, said all the 15 crew members responsible for sailing and the engine room face charges of ""causing death by abandoning (ship), and violation of the country's marine law, the Rescue and Aid at Sea and in the River Act. Investigators also searched the company that owned the ferry and the home of the man whose family controls it, and conducted a wide-ranging probe into the country's marine industry. Prosecutors have said that authorities have yet to determine what caused the sinking. Leading theories include changes made to increase the ferry's passenger capacity, and shifting cargo. On Friday, investigators checked out the Sewol's sister ship, the Ohamana, and said they found 40 of its life rafts weren't working, emergency slides to help evacuate passengers were inoperable, and equipment to tie down cars and cargo either was nonexistent or didn't work very well. Like the Sewol, the Ohamana had been modified to add more passengers, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators are looking into whether those modifications could have contributed to the Sewol's fate. Kim Yong-rok, an opposition lawmaker who represents Jindo, an island near where the ship sank, told CNN that modifications to add 117 more passenger cabins to the ship raised the ferry's center of gravity. On Friday, the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries announced it would ask lawmakers to consider legislation prohibiting modifications to ships to increase passenger capacity. Young crew member hailed as heroine . In recent disasters, captains didn't hang around . Students remember vice principal who took own life . Murky waters cloud the horror facing rescue divers .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- In a rare interview, Fidel Castro gives new details about his health four years ago when emergency surgery forced him out of power, saying he didn't think he would make it and still has difficulty walking. ""I was at death's door,"" he told the director of the left-wing Mexican newspaper La Jornada in an article published Monday. ""I didn't aspire to live, much less anything else."" ""I asked myself many times if (doctors) were going to let me live in these conditions or let me die,"" he said. The 84-year-old did not, however, provide any details about what illnesses he suffered from. Cuban state TV read aloud a letter from Castro on July 31, 2006, announcing he was handing power to his younger brother Raul Castro. He disappeared from public view amid repeated rumors he had died. He later started writing essays for state media and appeared in occasional photos. Last month, Castro re-appeared in public to urge the United States to prevent what he sees as an imminent nuclear war with Iran. While he appears frequently on Cuban TV, he rarely grants interviews to the international media. Castro said at his lowest point his weight fell to 66 kilos (about 145 pounds) but that he was now weighing in at almost 86 kilos (about 190 pounds). ""I want to tell you that you are looking at someone who has come back from the dead,"" he said in the interview. ""This morning I succeeded in walking 600 steps alone, without a cane, without help."" According to the article, Castro ""devours"" books and reads up to 300 news articles a day. When asked why all this activity, he replied: ""I don't want to be absent in these days. The world is in its most interesting and dangerous phase of existence and I am committed to what is going to happen. I still have things to do."" Castro said he wants to form an anti-war movement to deter a nuclear standoff.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new report by the Government Accountability Office says behavior detection techniques failed to lead authorities to at least 16 alleged terrorists who traveled through U.S. airports. The Transportation Security Administration's program to use special officers to spot suspicious behavior began in 2003, but the GAO questions the scientific basis and effectiveness of the techniques. The unclassified version of the report released Thursday did not name the suspected terrorists who the GAO says were able to pass 23 times through airports where behavior detection officers work. But officials involved in crafting the report said the cases included that of Najibullah Zazi, a Denver shuttle driver who authorities said plotted to set off bombs in New York City's subway system. Zazi pleaded guilty to providing material support to al Qaeda. The officials said the TSA also missed David Headley, who pleaded guilty to scouting targets for the 2008 Mumbai, India, terror attacks and flew out of the U.S. to do his reconnaissance. Rep. John Mica, R-Florida, suggested a 17th case: that of Faisal Shazad, who allegedly plotted to blow up a car bomb in Times Square. Mica said it was a ""Marx Brothers production"" when Shahzad, being sought by authorities, tried to fly out of the United States two days after that failed attack and was apprehended when he was already on a plane. Mica, the top Republican on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, asked for the GAO report. Although Mica supports behavior detection, he said the TSA has not carried out its program effectively. ""It leads me to again call for reorganization of TSA,"" Mica said at a Capitol Hill news conference. ""TSA is an agency in total disarray."" Mica noted the agency has been without a permanent leader during the Obama administration and the president this week announced his third nomination for the post. Two previous candidates withdrew. The GAO report said between May 2004 and August 2008 detection techniques led to the arrests of more than 1,100 people but not because of suspected terrorism. Instead the people were found to have committed drug or other offenses. A TSA statement called its program ""a vital layer that enhances security at the nation's airports."" It also noted the 2008 arrest in Orlando, Florida, of a person carrying components for a pipe bomb. The GAO made a number of recommendations, including that TSA should have an independent panel of experts examine its scientific methods, and that TSA should do a cost-benefit analysis to see how effective behavior detection is compared with random screening and other methods. The GAO also said if there is airport video of any of the suspected or admitted terrorists, that would be a valuable tool for behavior detection officers to study. The TSA said it plans to implement a number of GAO's recommendations. TSA uses behavior detection as one of 20 layers of security protection. As of March about 3,000 of the specially trained officers were working in 161 U.S. airports. The administration's latest budget request calls for $232 million for the program.","GAO says ""behavior detection"" missed 16 alleged terrorists .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hindsight is 20/20, they say, but some people may need backwards-looking glasses in debating whether the State Department under Hillary Clinton erred two years ago by not designating Boko Haram a terrorist group. The question arose Thursday as part of the international focus on last month's abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the jihadist group in northeast Nigeria that threatens to sell them into slavery. A Daily Beast article raised the issue. It quoted an anonymous U.S. official who criticized the Clinton State Department for rejecting calls in 2012 by some in Congress, the Department of Justice and others to add Boko Haram to the terror list as a threat to U.S. interests and homeland security. At the time, State Department officials argued such a move could cause more harm than good by enhancing the group's standing and making U.S. and Western interests a target of Boko Haram attacks. After Clinton stepped down and was succeeded by John Kerry, the State Department designated the group as a terrorist organization in November 2013. With global outrage and frustration over Boko Haram mounting, here are some questions and answers on what happened and why: . How did this all begin? In 2009, the small and scattered Boko Haram -- an Islamic extremist group advocating Sharia law -- killed two police officers and a soldier in an attack on a police station in Borno state. The Nigerian military responded with a brutal and indiscriminate crackdown that killed 700 people, including Boko Haram leader Mohammed Yusuf in what a congressional committee report described as an extrajudicial execution. Such violence hardened already bitter divisions between the remote and mostly Muslim northern regions of Nigeria and the southern and more Christian southern areas. A year later, Boko Haram re-emerged with a more violent profile, according to the report by the House Homeland Security Committee. The group's attacks escalated and spread beyond its northeast stronghold, including the August 2011 suicide bombing at the United Nations headquarters in Abuja, the capital, that killed 23 people. ""A number of factors have been attributed to fueling Boko Haram's violence and fanaticism, including a feeling of alienation from the wealthier, Christian, oil-producing southern Nigeria; pervasive poverty; rampant government corruption; heavy-handed security measures, and the belief that relations with the West are a corrupting influence,"" said the House panel's report compiled in November 2011. ""These grievances have led to sympathy among the local Muslim population despite Boko Haram's violent tactics."" What was the response? The Nigerian government continued to respond with brutal military repression, while voices in Congress warned that Boko Haram was getting support from al Qaeda affiliates elsewhere in Africa that could make it a threat beyond Nigeria. In its report, the Homeland Security Committee called for Clinton to ""conduct an investigation into whether Boko Haram should be designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization"" under federal law. Such a move ""may be required to provide our intelligence and law enforcement communities the tools necessary to ensure Boko Haram does not attack U.S. interests and the U.S. homeland,"" the report said. A few months later, amid increasing violence by Boko Haram, the top Republicans on the panel wrote Clinton to urge its immediate terrorist designation. In a letter to the secretary, Reps. Peter King of New York and Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania cited support by the Department of Justice and military intelligence for such a step. State Department officials opposed the move, as did 24 academics with expertise in African affairs. What were the arguments? In their letter, King and Meehan said Boko Haram could be growing into an al Qaeda affiliate capable of attacking the United States. Other al Qaeda affiliates, such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb, had started as local or regional groups that became international threats, the legislators noted. Adding Boko Haram to the terror list would give U.S. intelligence, law enforcement and economic officials a wide range of tools against the group, according to King and Meehan. Opponents of the terrorist designation argued that Boko Haram posed no threat to the United States, while adding it to the terrorism list could make Washington and Western interests more of a target. A letter to Clinton by the 24 academics, including former U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell of the Council on Foreign Relations, said a terrorist designation would raise Boko Haram's international profile and possibly link the United States to abuses by Nigerian forces cracking down on the group. ""Secretary Clinton's response was entirely consistent with the position of the government of Nigeria,"" which hired a Washington lobbying firm to oppose the foreign terrorist organization designation for Boko Haran in 2012, said Carl LeVan, an American University professor and among the academics who signed the letter. What did Clinton's State Department do? In June 2012, the State Department added three Boko Haram members to a terrorist blacklist, including Abubakar Shekau, who took over the group's leadership after Yusuf's death. Meanwhile, the Obama administration offered various types of assistance to Nigeria, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday. ""Designations are just one tool we use to fight terrorism,"" Psaki said. ""There are a range of steps including under Secretary Clinton that Secretary Kerry has continued, stepping up counter-terrorism cooperation with not just the Nigerian government but other governments in Northern Africa."" In a conference call with journalists Wednesday, former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson explained the thinking on whether to designate Boko Haram two years ago. ""There was a concern that putting Boko Haram on the foreign terrorist list would in fact raise its profile, give it a greater publicity, give it greater credibility, help in its recruitment and also probably drive more assistance in its direction,"" Carson said. Such a designation provides greater access to a group's finances and more ability to limit its movements, ""but none of their finances are here in the United States and none of them are coming here,"" he noted. Whether coincidence or not, Boko Haram has again increased its attacks since the State Department under Kerry added it to the list of terrorist organizations last November. Despite a multimillion-dollar bounty on his head, Shekau has avoided capture and Boko Haram operates with virtual impunity in northeast Nigeria and some parts of the northwest, as well as its incursions as far south as Abuja, Campbell told the Wednesday conference call. A videotape made public recently showed a man believed to be Shekau threatening to sell the recently abducted schoolgirls into slavery. What's the fallout? The political right immediately embraced the Daily Beast story to enhance its attack line against Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run. With Clinton polling well so far against possible GOP challengers, Republicans seek to exploit any political vulnerability they can find. They seek to use the Boko Haram case as well as the September 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, to depict Clinton as complicit in what they argue is a weakened U.S. foreign policy under President Barack Obama. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Thursday that it was ""sad"" that Clinton ""refused calls to designate al Qaeda-linked Boko Haram as a terrorist organization."" The conservative America Rising political action committee alerted journalists to the Daily Beast story when it was published, then featured it atop its website. Such attacks mimicked GOP tactics during Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, when Republican nominee Mitt Romney criticized the administration's response to the Benghazi attack shortly after it occurred. On Boko Haram, the letter from King and Meehan to Clinton urging the group's terrorist designation came amid the campaign primaries in March 2012 as Republicans sought to weaken the President's perceived advantage over Romney on foreign policy -- mostly due to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Obama's order. Democrats focused their comments Thursday on calls for the government to help Nigeria rescue the kidnapped schoolgirls. Clinton supporters referred journalists to the 2012 letter from the 24 academics but otherwise avoided commenting on State Department steps then. To Carson, who served under Clinton at that time, the convoluted socio-economic dynamics of Nigeria require a more holistic and nuanced approach than the security focus of anti-terrorism efforts. ""This is a very complex situation,"" he said. ""We all know what has happened with the girls, what happened with the number of terrorist attacks that occurred, but this is being played out against a backdrop of domestic politics and lots of social and economic immiseration in the north."" CNN's Jamie Crawford, Dan Merica, Elise Labott and Evan Perez contributed to this report.","Republicans criticize Hillary Clinton's handling of Nigerian jihadist group .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The doctor convicted in Michael Jackson's death sees the jury's verdict in a wrongful death civil trial as ""justice."" ""I cried because, for once, the world was allowed to hear some of the facts at they pertain to this matter -- a lot of facts that have been suppressed, much of which I was denied and my attorneys could not present during my criminal trial,"" Dr. Conrad Murray said on NBC's ""Today"" on Thursday. He described himself as ""relieved."" A jury found Wednesday that concert promoter AEG Live was not liable in Jackson's death. The jury found that AEG Live had hired Conrad Murray, but that Murray was competent. ""The jury's decision completely vindicates AEG Live, confirming what we have known from the start -- that although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of AEG Live's making,"" AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam said. The jury rejected Putnam's contention that AEG Live did not hire Murray, but the conclusion that the doctor was not ""unfit or incompetent"" got the company off the hook for a potential billion dollar judgment. The decision ended a five-month trial, but likely began a years-long appeal process. It will not help Murray's appeal on his criminal conviction, however. And the jury foreman disputed suggestions by Murray's legal team that the verdict supports his case. The foreman added that he would not want Murray treating him. Jackson lawyer: 'We found the truth' ""AEG has denied for years, and continues to deny, that they hired Dr. Conrad Murray,"" Katherine Jackson's lawyers said in a statement released late Wednesday. ""The jury found unanimously that AEG hired Dr. Murray. AEG has repeated the mantra that this lawsuit was a shakedown. Such a statement is a slap in the face of the entire judicial system that allowed this case to get to a jury."" While the verdict means no money in damages for the Jacksons, the statement suggested they believe they gained something from the trial. ""We have said from the beginning that this case was a search for the truth,"" it said. ""We found the truth. AEG hired Dr. Conrad Murray, the man who is in jail for killing Michael Jackson."" Jackson lawyers, who were discussing the grounds for an appeal even before the verdict was read, indicated the legal fight is not over. ""All options regarding the balance of the jury verdict are being considered,"" their statement said. Katherine Jackson, 83, sat with nephew Trent Jackson and a lawyer for the reading of the verdict in a large Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday. She played a word game on her iPad while sitting on a hallway bench to pass the time before the reading. None of her sons, daughters or grandchildren attended court Wednesday. Jurors became Jackson fans . Testimony by 58 witnesses over 83 days included intimate revelations by those closest to the singer -- pulling back the curtain on Jackson's dreams, passions, pain and fears. It shed light into his intractable insomnia that led to Jackson's death from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol just days before the planned premiere of his comeback concert. Contrary to some expectations that the trial would damage Jackson's reputation with its focus on his drug abuse, jury foreman Gregg Barden said Thursday that what he saw and heard made him a bigger fan of the King of Pop. He bought some of Jackson's albums growing up, but it wasn't until serving as a juror in the wrongful death trial that he realized his talent, generosity and personality, Barden said. Barden -- a high school football coach -- said he came close to crying in court when Jackson lawyers played a video of Jackson's children as he sang ""Speechless,"" a song he wrote to describe his love for his children. ""This Is It"" show director Kenny Ortega also won new fans from the jury. Barden said jurors believed Ortega was ""absolutely truthful"" in his testimony about Jackson's deteriorated condition a week before he died, but his ""miraculous"" recovery at his last two rehearsals. ""He got emotional a couple of times and had to walk off the stand, we really felt bad for him, but he was also a man who put in so much work and so much effort and did everything he could, we felt, to try to help Michael,"" Barden said. Several jurors, including Barden, applauded at the end of Ortega's dramatic testimony. ""It was just the absolute honesty of what he was doing,"" Barden said. ""All of the sudden the jurors sitting there for all those months, we watched all these other guys get up there and we were asking 'Is that the truth or is that a lie?' Now all of a sudden we didn't have to do that. We could just relax and listen because everything he said was the truth. That's why he got applauded."" Fit and competent, but unethical? Barden suggested jurors were boxed in by the wording of the second question on their verdict form: ""Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?"" Jurors interpreted ""the work"" to be as a ""general practitioner"" who was expected to treat Jackson and his children for routine illnesses -- not to infuse him with profopol to put him to sleep every night, Barden said. ""Conrad Murray had a license, he graduated from an accredited college and we felt he was competent to do the job of being a general practitioner,"" Barden said. ""Now, that doesn't mean that we felt he was ethical, and maybe had the word ethical been in the question, it could have been a different outcome. But because it was for the job he was hired to do, that was what we had to focus on."" Jackson lawyers argued that one reason Murray was unfit was because he had a conflict of interest. His deep financial debt made him conflicted to the point that he took dangerous risks with his patient because he feared losing the $150,000 monthly salary that AEG Live agreed to pay him to treat Jackson, they argued. Jurors apparently did not see medical ethics as an essential element for a fit and competent physician. HLN's Nancy Grace asked Barden if he believed Murray was unethical. ""You betcha!"" he answered. ""Because he went way beyond what he was supposed to do."" Juror: AEG was 'in the dark' Interviews with Barden and another juror indicate that even if they had decided Murray was unfit and incompetent, the jury still might not have held AEG Live responsible for the doctor giving Jackson the dangerous nightly infusions of propofol that eventually killed him. ""There was not one shred of evidence presented over five months to back up the fact that AEG could have known that Dr. Murray was doing that,"" Barden said. Juror Kevin White agreed. ""If AEG had known what was going on behind closed doors, it probably would have made a world of difference, but they didn't,"" White said. AEG Live lawyers were apparently effective with their strategy of calling several of Jackson's former doctors to testify about how the singer developed close friendships with them. Jackson was talented at ""doctor shopping"" and keeping his various physicians in the dark about each other, they argued. ""Michael Jackson was pretty used to getting his own way,"" White said. ""He was a big star. He had all these doctors who wanted to be his doctor and he could pretty much get what he wanted. If anybody said 'No,' well, they were out of the mix and he'd find somebody else."" Murray treated Jackson in an upstairs bedroom at his mansion, where no one else could see, White said. ""How could AEG have done anything about it when they were kept in the dark?"" Murray's lawyer: 'This is huge' No one seemed more surprised in courtroom when the verdict was read than Murray's lawyers. Valerie Wass, who had sat in on much of the trial so she could give personal reports to her jailed client, let out an audible gasp when the court clerk read the jury's ""No"" to the question ""Was Dr. Conrad Murray unfit or incompetent to perform the work for which he was hired?"" Murray was ""very, very emotional"" when Wass visited him in jail to discuss the verdict Wednesday evening, Wass said. The civil trial verdict has no impact on Murray's criminal appeal, ""but in the court of public opinion, this is huge,"" Wass told CNN. Murray, who is appealing his involuntary manslaughter conviction, is scheduled to be released from jail this month after serving two years of a four-year sentence. His medical licenses were suspended after his conviction two years ago, but he could regain them, Wass said ""He has a lot of patients who really want him to come back and practice,"" she said. ""And we'll see."" On NBC, Murray said, ""I will restart my life and, God willing, I will be a model to show the world that despite adversity, and when bad things happen to good people, they can restart their life and succeed. The jury foreman bristled at the suggestion that Murray was vindicated by his verdict. ""Absolutely not,"" Barden said. ""I don't see it as a vindication of Dr. Murray, and no, I would not hire him as my doctor. It's not a vindication. Again, it's the way the question was worded."" Asked by NBC whether he felt vindicated, Murray said the verdict showed him that ""you have to wait on the Lord. You just have to know that he is there for you, and he is going to deliver his justice on his time.""

"(CNN) -- Driven by a hard-line faction of conservatives, Washington has done something terribly stupid: shutting down the national government. Most of America is aghast. But it is also just possible that doing something stupid will help us avoid doing something truly dangerous. Shutdowns are a lousy way to run a government. Just for starters, this one has cut off services to women and children in need, furloughed hundreds of thousands, further shaken the confidence of the public, sent a shudder through the financial world and created new storm clouds over the economy. And once again the world is wondering about our capacity for leadership. But all of this damage pales in comparison with the danger posed by a second, lurking threat: a default on our public finances. The United States has had 17 government shutdowns since 1977 and has generally recovered well. But we have never had a default. Experts, while not fully certain, are convinced that it could be hugely destructive -- even leading to a worldwide financial meltdown. Unless Congress and the White House get their act together, we could default in less than three weeks. But a shutdown could have a silver lining. It could be such an electric shock to the political system that it forces the politicians in Washington to settle their squabbles before the default deadline. What we know from past shutdowns is that not only citizens -- especially older ones dependent on Social Security and Medicare -- start raising hell, but so do business and financial leaders who see damage rippling across their economic interests. Politicians are increasingly seen as villains. Pressure tends to grow so unbearable that eventually Washington finds a solution. Most of the pressure this time will be directed toward Republicans who have misplayed their hand. A new poll by CNN/ORC shows that 46% of Americans blame the shutdown on Republicans, seeing them as spoiled children. Thirty six percent blame President Obama, and 13% point fingers at both. Seasoned GOP leaders across the country know that if the shutdown does serious damage, chances of Republicans picking up Senate seats in 2014 and the White House in 2016 could evaporate. Those leaders will push intensely for a way out. But Republicans are not the only ones who will come under pressure to find a settlement. So will Democrats, starting with President Obama. We expect our presidents to be leaders of all the people, not a single party or ideology. We want them to rise above the squabbling and keep us on track. The harsh rhetoric that the president has been directing at Republicans suggests that he is less interested in settlement than unconditional surrender. Moreover, as Republicans make their counterarguments, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they have some valid questions. Is Obamacare truly ready for prime time? Shouldn't the two parties work together on the tax code? When is Washington going to get serious about overhauling the entitlement programs so they will survive for coming generations? Yes, conservative hard-liners have chosen the wrong place to fight; arguments over Obamacare are no excuse to shut down the government. Yes, hard-liners like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are creating deeper partisan divides. But Democrats can ill afford to continue rejecting any talks or negotiations. Now that the shutdown has happened, Obama has a fresh opportunity -- indeed a fresh responsibility -- to seize the mantle of leadership and get us out of this mess. Instead of just blaming the Republicans, he should call in the leaders of both parties and in Lyndon Johnson fashion, keep 'em talking till they get a deal. With the shutdown underway, the president has new leverage to say, ""Look, we are here to negotiate a settlement so that we can reopen the government. We are not here to negotiate over a possible default; I have said all along that I won't do that. But those of you who have been listening closely know that I have also been saying that I am open to conversations about settling our policy differences so that we can keep the government running. ""Tax reform, entitlement reform and even some tweaking of the Affordable Care Act are on the table now. I have only two conditions: I will not accept a gutting of Obamacare -- we settled that at the ballot box in 2012 -- and any settlement here must include a pledge not to let the country go into default. So, let's get started."" Would it work? Who knows for sure? But one thing is clear: If enough Americans rise up now and pressure politicians in Washington to call off this circus, we could not only end this foolishness over a shutdown, but we could also avoid a truly dangerous default. And we could hold our heads up again. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of David Gergen.","David Gergen: Shutdown would hurt people in need, the U.S. economy and markets .
Gergen: We've had shutdowns, but never a default, which may lead to global meltdown .
Default could happen in three weeks, he says, so it would force parties to solve problems .
Gergen: Shutdown would give Obama chance to take charge and get us out of this mess ."
"(CNN)  -- Afghan civilians were killed in U.S. airstrikes during fighting this week in western Afghanistan, local officials and the Red Cross said. Villagers pray at a mass grave this week after an airstrike in  Afghanistan's Farah province. The reports come as concerns mount over noncombatant casualties in the war against the Taliban. But the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said the U.S. military suspects the incident started when Taliban militants entered the area and beheaded three civilians. And another senior U.S. military official said Taliban militants may have killed as many as 15 civilians with grenades and then paraded their shrapnel-riddled bodies through villages in western Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she ""deeply regrets"" the loss of civilian lives but pointed out ""we don't know all of the circumstances"" and promised an investigation. Afghan officials have said that a number of civilians died Tuesday during U.S. airstrikes on villages in Farah Province. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a news release that its ""impression was that dozens of people, including women and children, had been killed."" The ICRC workers were told that some of the dead had already been buried by the time they arrived on the scene. ""We are deeply concerned by these events,"" Reto Stocker, the ICRC's head of delegation in Kabul, Afghanistan, said in a statement. ""We know that those killed included an Afghan Red Crescent volunteer and 13 members of his family who had been sheltering from fighting in a house that was bombed in an airstrike."" But U.S. officials believe the Taliban deliberately engineered a ground attack against Afghan and U.S. forces, expecting the United States would call in airstrikes. They said the Taliban were then prepared to kill the civilians. A senior U.S. military official said there was ""very reliable intelligence"" that Taliban fighters rounded up three families, including women and children, and killed them with grenades. The official would not allow his name to be used because a preliminary investigation into the matter is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached. Their bodies, shrapnel wounds visible, were then put into the backs of trucks and driven through the area in an effort to convince villagers that the U.S. military operation had killed them. The official said he did not know who drove the trucks -- other Taliban or local Afghans forced into duty. ""No one is disputing people died, it's how they died,"" the official said. ""What we do have is strong evidence to support that a number of women and children were killed by the Taliban and their bodies were driven by locals as evidence of U.S. bombing,"" the official said. Some Afghan civilians may have been killed or wounded before the airstrikes during ground fighting between the Taliban and Afghanistan and U.S. forces, the official said. But the military's investigation found no evidence of large-scale civilian deaths resulting from the airstrikes themselves, despite the claims from Afghan officials and the Red Cross. U.S. military investigators found no evidence of human remains in any of the four bomb craters it examined, the official said. The news comes as Afghan President Hamid Karzai visits Washington this week. Karzai and his Pakistani counterpart, President Asif Ali Zardari, are talking with key congressional leaders and policymakers ahead of meetings with President Obama and Clinton. Speaking in Washington, Clinton  -- flanked by Karzai and Zardari -- said the United States and Afghanistan will jointly investigate the airstrike and its aftermath. She said Washington already has sent a team of investigators to the region. The ICRC team found dozens of dead bodies in two villages, spokeswoman Jessica Barry in Kabul, told CNN. The increase of international troops in Afghanistan has raised a concern that fighting will intensify and civilians will face greater risks of getting hurt, she said. ""It's all sides who need to respect the civilians,"" Barry said. ""And this is the message we pass to all the armed forces, to the international forces, to the Taliban, to the armed opposition.""

"(CNN) -- A temporary truce Saturday between Israel and Hamas provided a precious few hours for hundreds of people, who had fled the fighting, the opportunity to learn whether they had a home to return to in Gaza. Some would use the time to collect belongings from their homes and the bodies of loved ones who were killed in the weeks-old conflict. For others, there was nothing to do except pick through rubble and debris. During the 12-hour humanitarian cease-fire, a CNN crew traveled to two Gaza neighborhoods -- Shujaya and Beit Hanoun -- hit hard by the fighting. Here, in their own words, is what they saw: . From Salma Abdelaziz: Losing a home . An elderly woman struggles to scale a mound of rubble and twisted metal. ""Did you see my house? What happened to it?"" she asks a neighbor who crosses her path. ""It's all gone,"" he responds. ""There is nothing left"" The two appear small standing amid the massive mounds of debris in Gaza's Beit Hanoun district, where they quietly and calmly converse about the destruction of home after home in their neighborhood. ""Are you sure? What about my niece's house?"" the women asks. ""It's demolished. The whole area is demolished."" the man says. Around them, others assess the damage -- in whispered conversations. There is no wailing or screaming from anyone over what was lost. This is the third conflict in six years for the people of this tiny coastal strip. The people in the neighborhood are calm, almost methodical, in their approach to war and its consequences. From Ian Lee: Choosing what to save . A family of five stands next to their front door, the only piece of their home in Gaza's Shujaya neighborhood that remains intact. The building's cinder blocks have been split in half. Shrapnel has peppered the building's exterior. The damage is just too extensive and is unlikely to be repaired. But there is no time to mourn. The family is fighting against the cease-fire clock, with only a few hours to gather what belongings they can salvage from the rubble. ""We didn't expect this. Everything is destroyed,"" one family member told CNN. ""We are looking for whatever we can carry before heading back to a UN-run shelter."" Despite the extensive damage to their home, they say they feel lucky compared to their neighbor. Just a few feet away, a massive crater marks the spot where their neighbor's home once stood. There is nobody there to gather belongings left behind. Nothing is left. From Karl Penhaul: Proof of a life . Wooden doors were blown off their hinges. Through the gap, I could pick out Mohammed Al-Zaneen tip-toeing through the debris of his three-story home in Gaza's Beit Hanoun neighborhood. He gently plucked a framed photo from a wall. It was a picture of his grandfather Said Al-Zaneen, the patriarch of Al-Zaneen's sprawling family. The old man died long ago. But Al-Zaneen appears intent on rescuing his grandfather's memory. Then the rubble gave up another treasure, a green plastic folder. As Mohammed sifted through it, he discovered the family's birth certificates and school diplomas. For a people caught in the midst of a brutal war, Al-Zaneen, like so many other civilians in Gaza, is desperate to find any scrap of paper that proves he still exists. From Joe Sheffer: Through the lens . Peering through my lens, I see the vista of the Gaza neighborhood of Beit Hanoun: the anarchy, the rubbish, the empty shell casings and the lingering smoke. The scene is one of displaced families, and a strange sense of calm, as they collect whatever fragments of their lives they could salvage. Then, through the lens, there appears an almost timeless scene -- three women clutching their few possessions, walking through the smoke that pours from gutted buildings. They are followed down the rubble-strewn road by a man who is leading a horse. A foal apprehensively trails the procession, being lead to safety from the inferno. Through the seemingly never-ending rubble, across the power lines that bisect the road and the stench of rot, this small quiet procession of will marches before me. The image seems almost biblical, if it wasn't so clearly a vignette of modern warfare. From Abdelaziz: The rubbish of war . A young boy in a yellow shirt carries a plastic bag and walks indifferently through the ruins of Beit Hanoun neighborhood in a pair of dusty black flip-flops. His relatives walk alongside, carrying a few possessions bundled in bed sheets and balanced on their heads. He stops for a moment in front of me, stares me straight in the eyes, and -- without uttering a single word -- throws a handful of machine gun ammunition casings at my feet. My eyes follow him as he walks away, almost begging him to speak. But his message is clear to me: He has no room for the rubbish of this war.","Gaza residents returned to their neighborhoods during a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood will apply to become a political party, it announced Tuesday. The Brotherhood ""envisions the establishment of a democratic, civil state that draws on universal measures of freedom and justice, with central Islamic values serving all Egyptians regardless of colour, creed, political trend or religion,"" it said in the statement. Although officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt. It has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday. Although officially illegal, the Muslim Brotherhood is regarded as one of the most organized groups in Egypt. Experts estimate the group has the support of anywhere from 10% to 30% of the population. It has said it does not plan to run a candidate for president when elections are held to replace Hosni Mubarak, who resigned on Friday. The group has sparked great controversy in the United States, where some see it as a non-violent, Islamic social welfare organization supportive of a democratic process while others call it a radical extremist group hellbent on creating a theocracy in Egypt. President Barack Obama recently downplayed the prospect of the Muslim Brotherhood playing a major role in Egypt, saying it is just one faction in Egypt that doesn't have majority support. ""There are a whole bunch of secular folks in Egypt, there are a whole bunch of educators and civil society in Egypt that want to come to the fore as well,"" the president said in an interview with Fox News. ""And it's important for us not to say that our only two options are either the Muslim Brotherhood or a suppressed Egyptian people."" Others, however, distrust the Brotherhood's ultimate intentions. ""They are a powerful force at present, but my fear is that Islamist groups outside Egypt, seeing the opportunity in the current chaos, will flood them with support if they back an extremist view,"" said CNN national security contributor Frances Fragos Townsend, who was President George W. Bush's counterterrorism advisor. And former CIA Director Mike Hayden said the Muslim Brotherhood, as the best organized opposition group in Egypt, could ""enjoy a disproportionate power in shaping the new government. The question is: Will it become more radical?"" Still, a current U.S. official characterized the Muslim Brotherhood as being ""not as extreme as al Qaeda is."" ""It's an organization that supports a civil state which is based in large part on Islamic law,"" said the official. ""But they do tend to eschew violence and work within the political process."" The official cautioned about ambiguity when it comes to Egypt. ""There are lots of unknowns now with Egypt,"" said the official. ""You really can't make a call on anything, whether Mubarak is going or staying or how the Muslim Brotherhood figures into the political process. And in a recent article in the Daily Beast, former CIA analyst Bruce Riedel wrote that Americans should not fear the group. ""They should not be afraid of the Muslim Brotherhood. Living with it won't be easy, but it should not be seen as inevitably our enemy,"" said Riedel. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 to oppose British control of Egypt with Its goal the creation of an independent Islamic state. Although it allegedly engaged in assassination and other violence against the British and supported the coup that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power in 1952, the Brotherhood has been illegal since 1954, when it was convicted of attempting to assassinated Nasser, charges the group denied. Nasser ruthlessly suppressed the group, and his successors, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak, continued the repression. The Brotherhood subsequently renounced violence, is engaged in providing social services to the populace, opposes the peace treaty with Israel and supports democratic elections. On its English language website, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood calls for establishing an Islamic state in accordance with the provision of Islamic Sharia law. Ed Husain, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the Muslim Brotherhood ""ought to be a welcomed force within Egyptian politics"" if it accepts full rights for women and for religious minorities. But his colleague at the council, Isobel Coleman, said the group hasn't done that, pointing to statements by the Brotherhood that neither a woman nor a non-Muslim could ever lead Egypt. But Republican Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina worried that the government did not see the danger. ""I'm very concerned that they're using the peaceful protests in Egypt for a power grab and that we in the government doesn't seem -- we don't seem to grasp that threat in the way it concerns me,"" she said at a congressional hearing last week. ""The Brotherhood isn't a danger just because they're terrorists, but because they push an extremist ideology that causes others to commit acts of terrorism.""' The 83-year-old organization has never been placed on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations and officially renounced violence in the 1970s. The organization was a minor player in the demonstrations that toppled Mubarak. But the U.S. chief intelligence officer raised a stir when he referred to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood as a ""largely secular"" organization in response to a question from Myrick at the hearing. ""The term 'Muslim Brotherhood' is an umbrella term for a variety of movements, in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried Al Qaeda as a perversion of Islam,"" said James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. ""They have pursued social ends, a betterment of the political order in Egypt."" Clapper's office later clarified the director's comments. ""In Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood makes efforts to work through a political system that has been, under Mubarak's rule, one that is largely secular in its orientation -- (Clapper) is well aware that the Muslim Brotherhood is not a secular organization.""

"(CNN) -- A Canadian woman on trial for allegedly stalking Alec Baldwin described a romantic date with the actor that she says ended with sex and a promise of lifelong omelets. Genevieve Sabourin, 41, finally had her chance to testify Wednesday in her trial after hearing Baldwin deny under oath Tuesday that he was ever romantic or sexual with her. Sabourin's impatience earned her a contempt of court citation and 30-day jail term Wednesday morning as she repeatedly interrupted another witness, saying at times ""I want to testify."" Sabourin was warned by the judge repeatedly during the first day of testimony Tuesday about her outbursts as she listened to a teary Baldwin deny having had a romance with his alleged stalker. Sabourin, an aspiring actress, heckled, ""You're lying!"" Her outbursts in the New York City courtroom continued Tuesday as the doorman from Baldwin's apartment building testified about Sabourin's April 8, 2012, attempt to visit the actor there. The actor's wife, Hilaria Baldwin, who was then engaged to him, told the doorman that Sabourin was a stalker and that she would call police, he testified. Sabourin called Hilaria a prostitute and another derogatory term before leaving the building, the doorman said. Baldwin, wife Hiliaria introduce daughter Carmen . She says she's not a stalker, but an ex-girlfriend of the ""30 Rock"" television star. Sabourin began her testimony Wednesday afternoon, detailing what she said were long personal phone conversations with Baldwin. Then she talked about February 18, 2011. Baldwin picked her up at her hotel at 7:30 p.m. and the couple attended a Broadway play, she testified. Afterward, they shared an intimate dinner, eating off of each other's plate, she said. She drank chardonnay, while Baldwin had water. They took a cab back to her hotel, where Baldwin suggested one last glass of water, she testified. The next several hours were spent in her hotel room where they made love and he made a promise, she said. ""I make the best omelets in the world and I'd be happy to make you omelets every morning for the rest of your life,"" she said he said. Sabourin began crying at that point of her testimony, complaining how everyone finds their love, as companions, but that she now knows she made the wrong choice with Baldwin. Baldwin left her hotel room the next morning, but later texted an e-mail address for her to use, she testified. She used it to maintain a relationship with romantic e-mails in which she said she gave ""her heart and soul to him."" While they were apart, they engaged in phone sex, she testfied. Baldwin was very charming in the calls, she said. Some of the talk was about her moving to New York from Montreal to be closer to him, she said. But then Baldwin started seeing his future wife, she said. The incidents of alleged stalking were attempts at finding ""closure,"" she said. But Baldwin testified that she imagined the relationship, and she sent him numerous e-mails and voice mails along the way. CNN obtained copies of the e-mails. ""I am less than 10 minutes away from you tonight. Say 'I do' to me,"" one e-mail says. In another e-mail, she said she was ready to get married. ""I need to start my new life with my new name ... in my new country, help my newly husband, you!"" In another e-mail, she admits defeat. ""I may have lost all the battles to win your heart over in the past two years, but I've learn (sic) so much,"" it says. Wiping away tears, Baldwin said Sabourin's stalking has made him anxious and worried for his safety. She showed up unannounced at his New York home on the day he proposed to his now-wife, the actor said. Days later, she allegedly crashed an event the actor was hosting at New York City`s Lincoln Center. Baldwin has admitted they had dinner once in 2010, but said that was it. They met through a mutual friend, he said. Both Baldwin and Sabourin worked on the 2002 flop ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash."" Baldwin has also appeared in numerous other movies, including ""Along Came Polly."" His past is checkered with various conflicts including an infamous berating of his then young daughter Ireland in 2007 as a ""rude, thoughtless little pig,"" a run in with American Airlines over his playing Words with Friends on a flight, and various scuffles with paparazzi. Unlike the actor, who didn't say a word about the case to reporters, Sabourin is basking in the media spotlight. She grinned widely as she shared her side of the story with a group of reporters. ""I'm not gonna take a reduced plea for a crime I have not committed,"" she said. Sabourin has been arrested several times, including late last year for violating a court order by allegedly sending a series of tweets to Baldwin and his wife. She was released from jail after a judge rejected a prosecution request for bail. If found guilty on the stalking charge, she faces up to a year in prison.

"Majer, Libya (CNN) -- Deafening peals of gunfire heralded the arrival of the caskets. There were 28 in all. One of them was only about two feet long and held aloft by a single man. Some of the robed men carrying these crude coffins wept loudly. All of them repeated the same chant: ""There is no God but Allah, and a martyr is loved by Allah."" At one point, some of the mourners pointed to the sky. A single warplane roared high overhead, appearing white against the cloudless blue backdrop. Libyan government officials said the mass funeral witnessed by foreign journalists Tuesday in the village of Majer accounted for a fraction of the people killed by a series of deadly airstrikes late Monday night. ""Eighty-five Libyan civilians, including 33 children, 20 men, 32 women and we're still counting, were massacred last night in an intensive air raid by NATO on the town of Majer,"" declared the spokesman for Moammar Gadhafi's besieged government, Musa Ibrahim. It is impossible for CNN to confirm the extent of the casualties, and whether or not they were all civilian. Ibrahim addressed journalists from the rubble of one of five houses that he said had been bombed the previous night. Inside, a burned mattress was still smoking and the smell of explosive was in the air. As Ibrahim spoke, two plumes of smoke erupted in the distance. It wasn't clear whether the explosions came from airstrikes or artillery. Ibrahim accused NATO of bombing Majer to clear the way for rebels to advance on the embattled Gadhafi-controlled city of Zlitan, located just a few kilometers to the north. ""This is a crime beyond imagination,"" he concluded. For weeks, NATO warplanes have been bombing Zlitan on a daily basis. Meanwhile, rebels have been pressing toward Zlitan's eastern gates from the nearby opposition-held port of Misrata. In an e-mail to CNN, NATO confirmed that aircraft bombed targets south of Zlitan Monday night. But a spokesman for the military alliance denied targeting civilians. ""NATO had very clear intelligence demonstrating that former farm buildings were being used as a staging point for pro-Gadhafi forces to conduct attacks against the people of Libya,"" wrote a public affairs officer with NATO's Operation Unified Protector, on condition of anonymity. ""We do not have evidence of civilian casualties at this stage, although military casualties, including mercenaries, are very likely owing to the nature of the target."" Determined to prove there was no presence of military personnel, Libyan government officials escorted a busload of foreign journalists to the scene of the bombardment. There were three neighboring compounds containing five bombed-out houses. Mattresses, clothes and books littered the ground. When journalists arrived at a shattered two-story house, several men began digging for what they said were the bodies of two boys named Adil Moayed Gafes and Aynan Gafes, trapped in the rubble. No bodies were found during the journalists' visit. Another house was littered with medical textbooks written in English. A man, who joined the government entourage escorting journalists throughout the day, yelled angrily and waved two brightly colored schoolbooks as proof that children had been inside the destroyed house. Inside one notebook, a girl had written her name in Latin letters: Salwa Ageil Al Jaroud. Government officials said the first bomb dropped in the area around 11 p.m. Monday. They said a second airstrike slammed into the area moments later, as people were coming to rescue survivors. Despite the alleged massive loss of life in the target zone, journalists were not able to find a single trace of blood or flesh amid the ruins. Libyan state television, however, has been airing grisly night-time footage of rescuers digging through rubble with their bare hands and in some cases uncovering severed limbs. There was little doubt that 60-year-old Ali Mufta Hamed Gafes' family had just suffered terrible, heart-wrenching tragedy. Next to the ruins of his two-story house, another elderly man embraced him, weeping. Later, Gafes visited the intensive care unit at Zlitan's main hospital, and sobbed by the bedside of his wounded wife. Anna Kondrateva, a nurse from Ukraine, said Gafes' wife lost one of her legs in the bomb attack. ""I am 54 years old,"" said Olga Burmak, another Ukrainian nurse. ""I never knew what war was until NATO started bombing Zlitan several weeks ago."" Hospital workers said almost all the other wounded people had been transported to Tripoli for treatment. Instead, they brought journalists to a morgue that was overflowing with corpses. Many were badly mangled and burned. A man stood amid the bodies and pools of blood, showing journalists the grisly faces of the dead. Screaming at the top of his lungs, he denounced NATO. At one point, he lifted the dead body of a 2-year-old girl named Arwa to emphasize his point. Arwa's father, Atiya Abdul Salam, stood waiting outside. He said his mother and another daughter were both badly wounded in Monday night's attack. And he listed the names of eight other members of his extended family who had been killed when the bombs slammed into his house: An elderly woman named Salima, Ahmed, Abdullah, Riham, Ahzar, Hanan, Abdul Moheiman and another woman named Salima who was 25. NATO insists its mission in Libya is ""to protect civilians against attacks or threat of attack."" If 85 civilians had in fact been killed Monday night, this would mark the bloodiest case of civilian casualties caused by aerial bombardment since NATO began its bombing campaign nearly five months ago. At Zlitan hospital, some medical workers gave wildly divergent numbers for how many people had been killed in the attack. ""Forty people died,"" said a medical student in a white lab coat named Abdulkadr Ali Hawan outside the morgue. When a bystander corrected him, Hawan revised his number dramatically, announcing with confidence: ""85 dead."" Ali Mufta Hamed Gafes appeared oblivious to the fierce propaganda war being waged between the Gadhafi regime and NATO and its rebel allies. At the mass funeral on Tuesday, he faced the aftermath of the war of bombs and bullets. The gray-haired man stood crying amid the dust and heat and wild, angry gunfire next to the big pit where his 24-year-old daughter Hanan Ali Mufta was being buried. ""If you want to get rid of Gadhafi, why don't you just sent your special forces to kill him?"" asked a Libyan bystander, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals from government officials. ""Instead, you are making these ordinary people suffer.""","Libyan official says 85 civilians killed in NATO airstrike .

""Seems like the RDF (Reality Distortion Field) typically generated by an Apple event has extended beyond Cupertino,"" wrote Frank Shaw, Microsoft's vice president of communications. ""So let me try to clear some things up."" Shaw was referring to coverage of Apple's rollout of two new iPads -- the iPad Air and revamped iPad Mini -- and other announcements. Among them was news that the company will begin giving away its iWork suite of productivity apps for free. ""Now, since iWork has never gotten much traction, and was already priced like an afterthought, it's hardly that surprising or significant a move,"" Shaw said. ""So, when I see Apple drop the price of their struggling, lightweight productivity apps, I don't see a shot across our bow. I see an attempt to play catch up."" Apple did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Shaw is pressing one of Microsoft's remaining advantages over its rival. While Apple has dominated the mobile field and made strides in computer sales, Microsoft Office -- which includes tools like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Skype -- is still viewed as the far superior productivity product by most. The ""reality distortion field"" Shaw referenced is a catchphrase often used by Apple critics to describe the sometimes breathless coverage the company gets in the tech press and elsewhere for even minor announcements or upgrades to existing products. ""Perhaps attendees at Apple's event were required to work on iOS devices that don't allow them to have two windows open for side-by-side comparisons,"" he said in another dig. Shaw went on to compare Microsoft's tablets, the Surface and Surface 2, favorably to the iPad. He noted that the Surface tablets are less expensive than comparable iPad models, offer more storage and come with full versions of Office 2013 for free. His claims are accurate. But they don't change the fact that the Surface has struggled to make a splash in a tablet market that the iPad continues to dominate. Earlier this month, documents revealed Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer saw a bonus check docked because of lower than expected Surface sales. Meanwhile, at Tuesday's event, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that 170 million iPads have been sold since the device was introduced in 2010. He said studies show 81% of all tablet usage happens on an iPad, despite recent gains by Samsung and others making tablets running Google's Android operating system.","Microsoft VP: ""Reality distortion field"" surrounds Apple this week .

"Paris (CNN) -- Yasser Arafat's widow on Tuesday questioned the findings of French scientists that the Palestinian leader did not die from radioactive polonium poisoning but rather from natural causes. The conclusion, leaked to multiple French media agencies and Reuters, contradicts the findings of Swiss forensic scientists who concluded last month that samples taken from Arafat's exhumed body were consistent with polonium-210 exposure but did not definitely prove that he was poisoned. ""I'm convinced there is something wrong, and he did not die from a natural death,"" Suha Arafat said at a news conference in Paris. She said she is requesting that the Swiss findings be made available to French authorities investigating her husband's death. She said the medical experts in Switzerland and France came from different medical fields. ""I don't doubt them. But they are different skills. They are different types of medicines,"" she said. The French findings will do little to quell the rumors that Arafat was poisoned. Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital in November 2004 after he had a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. Palestinian officials said in the days before his death that Arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them. Two weeks after Arafat's death, his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death. Nasser al-Kidwa, who was the Palestinian observer to the United Nations, said toxicology tests showed ""no known poison,"" though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle's death. Polonium-210 made headlines in 2006, when it was used to kill Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. In a deathbed statement from a London hospital, Litvinenko blamed Russia's President Vladimir Putin, an accusation the Kremlin strongly denied. Palestinians who view Arafat as a symbol of resistance are also quite emotional about the suspicion he was poisoned. Arafat first led the Palestine Liberation Organization, which carried out attacks against Israeli targets, and then served as the leader of the quasi-governmental Palestinian Authority after parts of the West Bank and Gaza were returned to Palestinian control. He was considered one of the pioneers of what became known as ""television terrorism,"" high-profile attacks that targeted Israelis and made for big television stories. Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for their work on the Oslo accords in 1993. The Oslo agreement was perceived at the time as a breakthrough that could lead to an independent Palestinian state and a permanent peace with Israel. But in 2000, Arafat rejected an Israeli peace deal based on the Oslo deal. That led to a Palestinian uprising that lasted more than four years. Israel -- in retaliation for increased terror attacks on Israelis -- severely restricted Arafat's movements, confining him to his West Bank compound in Ramallah in December 2001. Sandrine Amiel reported from Paris, and Chelsea J. Carter wrote and reported from Atlanta.","""He did not die from a natural death,"" Suha Arafat said Tuesday .
She says the findings by French scientists contract those of Swiss scientists .
The French findings conclude Yasser Arafat was not poisoned with polonium-210 .

"(CNN) -- As Washington hurtles toward a government shutdown, the go-to move for the uninformed is to blame both sides equally. Just say, ""A pox on both their houses,"" and you can get through any neighborhood barbecue or TV talk show. But what if you really want to know what's happening? There are three metrics you should track if you want to know who will come out ahead in a government shutdown: . Which side is more united? One of President Clinton's laws of politics is: ""Democrats want to fall in love, Republicans just want to fall in line."" Which is what makes the GOP fratricide so interesting. Savaging your colleagues, undermining your leaders, backbiting and backstabbing -- these are usually Democratic specialties. But not now. Credit the strong leadership of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with keeping a remarkably diverse Democratic Congress together. When you can keep a strong conservative like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia on the same page with the powerfully progressive Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota, you are definitely winning. Meanwhile, the GOP, whose members range from conservative to ultraconservative, is at war with itself and its leaders. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas led the fight on the Senate floor to block consideration of the funding bill. But after a pointless 21-hour talkathon, the majority of his GOP colleagues rejected Cruz's strategy. Senate Republicans split badly and bitterly; 25 voted against Cruz while just 19 voted with him. In the House, it is chaos. The Neanderthals are fighting the Cro-Magnons and the Homo erectus tough guys are fighting the australopithecines. Which side is more mainstream? A majority of voters don't like the Affordable Care Act -- although that's a bit misleading, because a percentage of them dislike it because they think it doesn't go far enough. I like it -- in fact, I love it -- but that's not the point of this column. Obamacare clocks in at just 29% support in a recent CNBC poll. So you'd think that the Republicans' position of repealing the ACA would be more mainstream. But you'd be wrong. That same CNBC poll shows that Americans oppose defunding Obamacare, with only a little more than one-third of voters saying they want it defunded. They want to mend it, not end it. What's worse for the Republicans, when the question shifts to whether you support shutting down the government and/or defaulting on U.S. debt in order to kill Obamacare, the GOP position loses by a crushing 59 to 19 percentage points. When you're down to just 19% of your countrymen and -women supporting your crusade, it's time (as we say in Texas) to pee on the fire and call the dogs: The hunt's over. That is, no doubt, why the House Republicans have retreated to their new position: delaying Obamacare for a year rather than outright defunding it. But health care delayed is health care denied, and it's a bit of a reach to demand a one-year delay in the president's top domestic priority in exchange for funding the government for 10 weeks. Which side is more reasonable? It is hard to seem reasonable when you are pursuing a strategy that even conservative Republicans like Sen. Richard Burr called ""the dumbest idea I've ever heard of."" Keep in mind this is from a man who represents North Carolina, where the Republicans proposed a law barring federal courts from interpreting the Constitution, and allowing the North Carolina Legislature to declare a state religion. (Which might have passed had they chosen the right religion for the Tarheel State: college basketball.) And yet there is hope for the GOP here. Every time the president says ""I will not negotiate on the debt ceiling"" -- a phrase he utters even more often than ""Just pass me the ball, Joe, I'm open!"" -- he risks looking unreasonable. As a matter of substance, I strongly agree with his position. But as a matter of rhetoric and positioning, he would be better served to state his position this way: ""I will gladly listen to any idea to improve the Affordable Care Act, or reduce the deficit, or any other ideas my Republican friends might have. But first we have to avoid default. That means paying the bills that Congress has already incurred. Once we've done that we can negotiate on anything."" Same substantive position: Negotiations on policy come only after the nation avoids default. But this formulation emphasizes the president's willingness to be flexible on improving the ACA and other Obama priorities. Of course, nothing is certain in life. But if I were a betting man, I'd bet on President Obama and the Democrats in this fight. As long as Republicans appear more divided, more extreme and more unreasonable, they are going to lose. And then they will look weak as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala asks which party is more united, mainstream and reasonable .
Begala says that's the way to see who's winning shutdown, and Democrats win .
He says majority of American voters don't want to shut down the goverment over Obamacare .

"United Nations (CNN) -- We have all heard about the Arab Spring, the rapid change which swept through the streets of the Middle East and North Africa. In New York in March, there was a brief coincidental Security Council spring. 10 out of 15 nations approved a Security Council resolution endorsing a firm response to a crackdown in Libya. NATO bombing soon followed. I saw and felt a difference. U.N. diplomats and staff expressed confidence and hope that the international organization was finally going to make a difference by being unified and taking dramatic action to help citizens threatened by their own government. 'Horror story upon horror story in Syria' Reporters were almost gleeful, dreaming that the slumbering global gang in New York would now be ready to move on and take action in other trouble spots. Alas, reality eventually set in. People call it the Libya hangover effect now. Despite months of a similar violent crackdown in Syria, there has not been a peep from the U.N. Security Council. Russia and China are getting their diplomatic revenge for the way the Libya resolution quickly turned into NATO bombing. They feel the resolution was over-interpreted. The two countries have veto power when it comes to U.N. voting at the Security Council so a Syria resolution pushed by the UK and France has stalled. Brazil's foreign minister Antonio Patriota said concerns with the Libya resolution was ""influencing the way delegations look"" at other resolutions, like Syria. It's the way it is at the Council table. Whether its Myanmar or Zimbabwe, no matter the level of repression, several countries led by Russia and China feel it is not the U.N.'s role to get involved in each member country's dilemma. ""The failure of the U.N. Security Council to act is a tragedy,"" says Jamie Metzl of the Asia Society. He says China and Russia fear that if the Security Council feels empowered to address major human rights violations occurring around the world, eventually it could get around to Moscow and Beijing. Analysts feel Russia and China can hold out. Other diplomatic initiatives, usually on the Middle East, die on the vine at the U.N. as events change and distractions occur. So far resolution backers say they have the nine votes minimum required for a yes vote, but can't avoid the veto threat. Russia and China have Brics to throw in their defense too. BRIC countries Brazil and India join Russia and China in opposition. They fear a resolution would help to destabilize a key Middle East country. Resolution proponents hope to get at least 11 out of 15 countries to sign onto the resolution, then test the veto threat. But watching diplomats leave a discussion on the resolution last week said it all. The Europeans were glum, avoiding reporters' eyes, while the Russian U.N. ambassador was confident, smiling and remarking ""no news is good news."" Of course, even those who want a resolution have to concede they are fighting for a text which will not dent President Bashar al-Assad's regime. There is no threat of Libya-style military force or even sanctions. Some countries have imposed their own unilateral sanctions against Syria. A U.N. resolution though is the toughest international diplomatic law. ""We do think the Council has to act .. it's simply sending a message,"" said French U.N. Ambassador Gerard Araud. The resolution would demand an immediate end to the violence in Syria and condemn systematic human rights abuses. The proposed text calls on Syrian authorities to lift the siege of affected towns and provide reforms for political participation, inclusive dialogue and the exercising of political freedoms. ""The Security Council has failed to react to Syria which is both extraordinary and disappointing,"" said Carne Ross, a former UK diplomat at the U.N. He now recommends citizens go around the U.N. deadlock by using websites to highlight Syrian or other government repression, and encourage more boycotts of products from companies involved with ""problem"" nations.","The U.N. authorized action in Libya swiftly but Syria has been a different story .

"(CNN) -- These days, purveyors of luxury can go beyond owning, eating or imbibing their favorite brand; they can live it. No longer content with selling a mere fraction of the lifestyle experience, an increasing number of high-end luxury companies have decided to open hotels, where their clients can eat, sleep and breathe the brand around the clock. Nobu Hospitality is the most recent company to join the fray. It's the organization behind global Japanese restaurant chain Nobu, and it started taking reservations this past October for the first ever Nobu Hotel, set to open within Caesars Palace in Las Vegas come January 2013. Soon to follow are locations in Riyadh, London, Bahrain and the Caribbean. Food will naturally be a key focus; the Vegas hotel will host the company's largest restaurant, at 12,000 square feet. The Nobu menu will be available from room service 24/7, and the kitchen (open for breakfast and lunch) will offer more products, including green tea waffles and a Japanese take on bagels and lox. Mainly, though, the hotel is about increasing the company's reach. ""Anybody who walks into a Nobu restaurant, we want to convert for ourselves,"" says Trevor Horwell, chief executive at Nobu Hospitality. ""Once we open, we want it to go the other way around too."" Read related: Business or pleasure? Luxury hotels offer day-only rooms . Horwell says the plan to break into the hotel industry was born simply of the fact that in many of the other hotel chains that boast a Nobu, the restaurant is a major draw. ""We realized we were building other hotels' brands, when what we should be doing is building our own,"" he says. Hotels have become big business for luxury brands of late. Armani, Baccarat, Bulgari and Missoni have all made the transition to an industry that nominally, it would seem they know little about. ""Hotels are a great way to showcase the design identity of a brand, and to project a lifestyle that goes beyond products,"" notes Silvio Ursini, the executive vice president of Bulgari Hotels & Resorts. Bulgari Hotels mimics the exclusivity of its design brand by limiting its room count. It reminds guests of its history by showcasing a mix of contemporary and classic Italian architecture, and by using vintage Bulgari designs to inspire some of the textiles and furnishings. Guests receive a more direct reminder of the brand inside their rooms, which each carry a Bulgari catalog. Still, Ursini admits, ""hotels are a very different and complicated business."" It helps, of course, to be partnered to a larger hotel chain. Bulgari Hotels and Resorts is a joint venture between Bulgari and the luxury division of Marriott International. Bulgari opened its first hotel in Milan in 2004 and now also has branches in Tokyo, Bali and, as of last summer, London. Read related: Marriott mogul on 55 years of change . Similarly, Armani, which has literally taken the concept to new heights by opening its flagship hotel in Dubai's towering Burj Khalifa (the tallest building on earth), has partnered with Emirates-based Emaar Properties. ""When Mohamed Alabbar [chairman of Emaar Properties] introduced the idea to Giorgio Armani in 2005, it immediately attracted his interest, as it offered him a genuine challenge,"" recalls Jason Harding, the regional general manager at Armani Hotel Dubai. ""A hotel is an entity that goes beyond the confines of fashion. It's something that will endure over time."" Like its competitors, Armani touts that hotels give them a better base from which to truly sell a lifestyle. ""In our hotels we offer something that in its own way equates perfectly with the spirit of Armani's clothes,"" says Harding. ""It is an approach to life: comfort, functionality, and aesthetics, all in perfect harmony."" The hotel even goes so far as to assign each guest their very own ""lifestyle manager,"" a position that is best described as an Armani-clad personal concierge. Read related: 6 incredible luxury hotels in the Middle East . Opening a high-end luxury hotel chain during a worldwide recession may seem like risky business -- especially as rooms don't come cheap: rates at Nobu are upwards of $249 a night, Armani doubles start at $570, while the Bulgari London charges $700 for a double room. Occupancy rates, however, have been high, according to the hoteliers. Bulgari London says it has been fully booked most nights since opening, while Armani has quoted its levels as ""healthy."" It's a bit early to say for Nobu, which has only just started taking reservations, but so far, it is optimistic. Brand recognition, they all agree, is key in bringing in the bookings. ""Bulgari's name is evocative of uncompromising luxury,"" says Ursini. ""It is definitively shaping the customers' choice.""","An increasing number of high-end luxury companies are opening hotels .

"(CNN) -- It's a campaign that's raising a lot of eyebrows in Mexico. The campaign involves a 34-year-old philosophy professor named Natalia Juarez, who's running for the Mexican congress. When Juarez realized her bid for office was off to a slow start a few weeks ago, the leftist candidate quickly decided she was going to be transparent with voters in a way they didn't expect. Juarez decided to appear topless on a billboard surrounded by half-a-dozen supporters of her party, the PRD (Party of the Democratic Revolution). The billboard shows the seven women, including Juarez, naked from the waist up and covering sensitive areas with their right hands while they raise their left fists. The candidate says it's her way of giving voters in Mexico a wake-up call. ""Society is lethargic. We don't seem to be aware of our role. We need to get energized. We need to tell people, 'Hey, wake up because if you don't, sharks are going to eat you up. Wake up, you citizen and politician,"" Juarez said. A caption above the women on the billboard reads: ""I dare you to build a new project for a nation with no prejudices."" Another billboard shows the bare legs of four women with their pelvic areas covered with a semi-transparent yellow cloth. The caption on the cloth reads: ""It's better for one thousand of us to take a step forward than for one leader to take one thousand steps for us."" At a recent campaign stop in Guadalajara, Juarez shook hands with voters and high-fived one supporter. Juarez heads the philosophy department at the University of Guadalajara. She says she has received strong support from most of her female students, ""but some of my male students just look at me from a distance,"" she said. So far Juarez has posted the two billboards in Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city and also one of the most conservative. She has been the target of harsh criticism and dismissed as a novice trying to make in politics no matter at what cost. ""Conservative people are never going to vote for me, never!"" Juarez said. ""Even if I dressed as a nun and carried a rosary and said that my party was going to give away Bibles and rosaries, they wouldn't. Conservatives are never going to vote for me."" Juarez also says she has the full backing of her family, including her elderly mother, whom she describes as a small-town, conservative woman. And if people were shocked by her first round of campaigning, Juarez says, that is nothing compared with the second one she will unveil in the next few weeks, although she's not giving out details. In the meantime, she has been targeted on social media. ""Who needs brains when you have these?"" reads one comment on Twitter. Juarez says that won't deter her from advancing her political platform. The bottom line, Juarez says, is that she's a radical candidate with radical ideas for a better Mexico. ""When it comes to drugs and the violence generated by drug trafficking, we need to start thinking in a radical way. What do I mean by that? Well, we need to start a debate. Let's legalize (drugs), tax them and use the money for other things,"" Juarez said. Mexico will hold presidential and congressional elections on July 1. In addition to a president, Mexicans will also elect 128 senators, 500 representatives, six governors, 375 local legislators and 641 mayors. CNN en Espanol's Rey Rodriguez contributed to this report .","Philosophy professor Natalia Juarez is running for congress in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Amid all the talk of helicopter parents and Tiger Moms, let us now praise Stealth Dads. Not to be confused with the Absentee Father, who flamboyantly disappoints, the Stealth Dad exceeds expectations without drawing attention to himself. I am the son of a Stealth Dad, as are a number of my friends. Several have lost their Stealth Dads in recent years. For the rest of us, time is precious. The Stealth Dad is at the end of a good run. Social media has made stealth unfashionable, with every utterance now an exhibition. And private family milestones have been outsourced to consultants. When I read about the parent hiring a coach to teach a kid to ride a bike, I mourned for the Stealth Dad. In the end, the passing of a generation will finish the job. Demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe describe Americans born between 1925 and 1942 as the Silent Generation. This is the rich vein of Stealth Dad ore. Stuck between Greatest Generation heroes and look-at-us Boomers, the Silent Generation never produced a U.S. president. Instead, say Strauss and Howe, Silents became America's ""facilitators and technocracts."" Silents had ready access to college and jobs and avoided heavy war casualties. Silents experienced other frustrations, forever the ""gap"" in the Generation Gap that divided World War II leadership from 1960s revolutionaries. Strauss and Howe explain that, for Silents, ""their solutions -- fairness, openness, due process, expertise -- reflect a lack of surefootedness, but also a keen sense of how and why humans fall short of grand civic plans or ideal moral standards. Silent appeals for change have seldom arisen from power or fury, but rather through a self-conscious humanity and tender social conscience."" I like the notion of a tender social conscience. It fits my own Stealth Dad, who married the pretty girl at a Wake Forest College picnic, became a math teacher and then the principal who peacefully integrated the high school in the town of Garner, North Carolina. He served for years as an associate superintendent in Wake County, indispensable in the technocrat role. Once retired, he worked as the business manager for a church. Now, at 76, Wayne Bare keeps marshmallows in his pocket, for his granddaughter Leah. My close friends and I are also generational misfits, too young to be authentic Boomers and too old to line up neatly with Gen X. Stealth Dad attended some, not all, of our sporting events. When Stealth Dad was there, he never threw a tantrum. When he wasn't there, we behaved as if he was. In crisis, Stealth Dad lowers the volume. Stealth Dad doesn't speak up unless he can improve upon the silence. Stealth Dad is parsimonious with counsel. Having been spared a thousand aphorisms, we had no choice but to direct our attention to the specific Stealth Dad behaviors plainly predictive of a successful life. Stealth Dad puts fairness above nearly everything else. I walked to my elementary school. On the few rainy days when my Stealth Dad would drive me, he used our family car. Then he drove back home and set out for the office in a county-owned car provided by the school system. This vehicle was only to be used for work. While he follows rules, Stealth Dad challenges authority. Back in 1968, when many country clubs where still accessible only to whites, my Stealth Dad appointed an African-American man, James Farris, to be golf coach for our town's newly integrated high school. My Stealth Dad was in the audience last month when Farris was inducted into the Garner Athletics Hall of Fame. In the Baptist church we attended through my childhood, there came a time when one half of the congregation grew furious at the other half. If you have spent time in Baptist churches, this is not as consequential as it sounds. Yet in this case, the dispute could not be settled without a public airing of grievances. The hearing would take place during a business meeting that would follow the Sunday service. The only thing the feuding groups could agree on was that my Stealth Dad would facilitate, from the pulpit. There I sat in the church balcony, like Scout Finch looking down at the trial below, learning to turn off the fury and manifest self-conscious humanity. On good days, I can pull it off myself. Happy Father's Day to Stealth Dads everywhere.","John Bare: My father was part of a generation of Stealth Dads .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officer who told authorities he was shot while on patrol last month has admitted he shot himself intentionally, the city's police commissioner said Tuesday. Sgt. Robert Ralston, 46, confessed to police early Tuesday morning that he made up the story, possibly to a get attention or a transfer, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said in a news conference. Ralston reported that on April 5 he saw two African-American males arguing on a train track in West Philadelphia. He told investigators that when he stopped the two men for questioning one of them pulled out a gun and shot him in the left shoulder. His claim sparked a search for a phantom suspect. Ramsey noted that there were many inconsistencies throughout the month-long investigation. ""The evidence never did match up. We have forensic evidence at the scene that did not match with the story,"" he said. One example of inconsistent evidence was that the gunpowder residue found on Ralston's shirt matched the ammunition used by the police department, he said. The commissioner said that Ralston, who is white, told police his attackers were black because the district where the shooting took place is predominately black. ""It's troubling in a lot of ways,"" Ramsey said. ""It inflames racial tensions in our community, and that's certainly something we don't need."" Ralston, a 21-year veteran of the police force, will be made to pay the cost of the investigation that followed his report, and has been suspended with the intent to dismiss, Ramsey said. He will not, however, face criminal charges because police granted him immunity to obtain his confession.","Philadelphia Police Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Pete Seeger sang with such a gentle voice that it's easy to forget how his music drove a fierce, radical movement for change. ""Young people in the civil rights movement began to realize that music was like a weapon you could use, but it was a nonviolent weapon. So you didn't have to feel powerless. You had this weapon, and it was a beautiful song,"" said Candie Carawan in a phone interview from her Tennessee home. Her husband, Guy, is one of the musicians, along with Seeger and Frank Hamilton, credited with adapting the song ""We Shall Overcome"" from an earlier hymn. They were more vessels than songwriters. They became instruments through which the words of oppressed individuals got a hearing. Seeger, Carawan and others lifted up anonymous voices, and these voices changed the world. For 17 years, I've been working closely with nonprofit organizations that are advocating for causes. They deploy lots of PowerPoint shows. It's nearly unimaginable a nonprofit executive would put music front and center in an advocacy campaign. Yet that is what happened in the civil rights movement. And it worked. I called Guy Carawan a few years ago, when he was still granting interviews, to ask him whether the music came to be important through some kind of happy accident, or whether it was intentional. Turns out music was front and center by design. Some of the credit goes to Danish folk schools. That's where Myles Horton saw firsthand how to deploy culture in training individuals to take on social and political causes. A Tennessee native educated in New York and Chicago, Horton co-founded Highlander Folk School in 1932. As in the Danish schools he visited, music was central. His wife, Zilphia, classically trained in music, led Highlander's music program and helped create the anthems we associate with the civil rights movement. Highlander hosted and trained the Mount Rushmore names from the civil rights movement, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and James Bevel. They mixed with folk musicians such as Seeger and Carawan. And everyone mixed with men and women who would never become famous -- just folks fighting for the right to vote, to move about freely and to speak freely. The right to be recognized as human beings, in short. This pre-Internet caldron of connectivity -- civil rights leaders and musicians and ordinary men and women mixing together in common cause -- scared the dickens out of people who derived power from the status quo. Authorities could arrest people and beat people. They just couldn't stop the singing. Carawan taught ""We Shall Overcome"" to young people in 1960 at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at Shaw University. ""Ella Baker wanted me down there to teach that song,"" Carawan said. ""There is power in the words and the songs and the people."" Two weeks before, he had been at Highlander teaching ""We Shall Overcome"" to one of the first gatherings of the students who would lead sit-ins. At the same meeting, he taught students to sing ""I'm Gonna Sit at the Welcome Table"" and ""Keep Your Eyes on the Prize."" It all seems so harmless now, these beautiful songs. But singing those songs could result in a beating. Or time in jail. Music was gasoline on the civil rights fire, and Highlander was effectively a music distribution hub. So tiny little Monteagle, Tennessee, home to Highlander, became a threat to the most powerful people in the country. Georgia state officials sent a spy to Monteagle and ran a smear campaign against King. A congressional committee went after Seeger. The state of Tennessee shut down Highlander and seized the land. ""There's great nostalgia for these songs,"" Candie Carawan says. ""They have become part of American culture. But at the time, the songs were threatening. It helped people feel united."" Nothing is more threatening to power than seeing opponents organize. It's easier to hold off a bunch of unhappy individuals, each isolated and harmless. It's tougher to resist a bunch of unhappy individuals who unite and work together. Or as Arlo Guthrie describes in his anti-war song ""Alice's Restaurant,"" if one person sings alone, authorities will think he's crazy. If 50 people sing out together, they will see it's a movement. ""Pete understood how powerful music could be,"" Candie Carawan said this week, reflecting upon his death. ""He thought it could change the world. Not all of us would go that far, but he really believed that."" Seeger described his banjo as a machine that surrounds hate and forces it to surrender. He was right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","Legendary folk singer Pete Seeger died recently at the age of 94 .

"(CNN) -- Members of two Islamist militant groups destroyed tombs at a shrine to Muslim saints Tuesday, according to the mayor of Timbuktu, Mali, and other residents. ""The Islamists ordered the people to leave the area before they started smashing the tombs,"" Mayor Ousmane Halle said. ""I saw both members of Ansar Dine and MUJAO, another Islamic faction in charge of the city. They were heavily armed and people had no choice but to leave when they started destroying the shrines."" It was the second time in the past two weeks that Ansar Dine, a militant group that seeks to impose strict Sharia law, has attacked the site's 16 mausoleums, built from mud and wood in the 15th century. Opinion: Timbuktu tomb attack is an attack on our humanity . One of the town's residents said the militants surrounded the ancient Djingareyber mosque area at 7:30 a.m. ""They were shooting in the air to warn people of going near and entering the area,"" Allimam Oumar said. The militants think the shrines are idolatrous, he said. The tombs are part of a newly designated UNESCO World Heritage site. Mali was plunged into chaos by a military coup in March that ousted former President Amadou Toumani Toure. Since then, the Tuareg rebels and the Islamists have taken advantage of the uncertainty to attempt to seize control of the northern portion of the nation. Last week, the United Nations called for sanctions against Islamist fighters in northern Mali and warned it is considering a proposal by West Africa states to deploy troops in the troubled country.","Militants in troubled Mali attack religious shrines .

"London (CNN) -- Hugh Grant took aim at the British press Monday, calling the hacking of a murdered schoolgirl's voice mail ""cowardly and shocking."" The British actor also accused newspapers of using criminals as paparazzi and the Mail on Sunday of hacking into his voice mail. The ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" star was testifying before a government-backed inquiry into press ethics sparked by public outrage at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World newspaper. The best-selling Sunday tabloid was shut down in July after the revelation that it had hacked into the voice mail of the murdered schoolgirl, Milly Dowler. Dowler's mother, Sally, explained earlier Monday how the hacking had given her false hope that her missing daughter was still alive. She described her joy at finding voice mails had been deleted from her missing daughter's phone: ""She's checked her voice mail, Bob! She's alive!"" In fact, the messages had been deleted by a private investigator working for News of the World, Dowler's father, Bob, told the inquiry panel. Sally Dowler's face fell as she recalled finding out it was the hacker, not her daughter, who had been checking the voice mail. Grant said he thought he had also been a victim of phone hacking. He said he could not think of any other source for a Mail on Sunday story about his relationship with his then-girlfriend Jemima Khan being on the rocks because of his phone flirtation with a ""plummy-voiced Englishwoman."" That story was later found false and libelous in court. Grant's accusation widens the scope of the British newspaper phone-hacking scandal, which has focused mostly on Murdoch-owned titles so far. The Mail on Sunday is not a Murdoch newspaper. Grant also implied that the police were leaking stories about celebrities to the press, saying that when he called the police about his girlfriend being mugged, paparazzi showed up before the police. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of phone hacking by journalists in search of stories. The practice involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely. Most attention has focused on the now-defunct News of the World, once the flagship Sunday tabloid of Murdoch's News International British publishing company. Murdoch and his son James have been called to testify before parliament over the scandal, and their company agreed last month to pay 2 million pounds ($3.1 million) in compensation to the Dowler family. Rupert Murdoch personally donated 1 million pounds ($1.57 million) to charity as part of the deal, his company and the Dowlers announced last month. More than two dozen News International employees used the services of a convicted phone hacker, the inquiry panel heard last week. ""This fact alone suggests wide-ranging, illegal activity within the organization at the relevant time,"" Robert Jay, one of the lawyers serving as part of the Leveson Inquiry, said as the panel began hearing testimony. James Murdoch has always insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. But Jay said November 14 that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire's notebooks contained the names of at least 28 people who employed him on 2,266 occasions. Four individuals -- whom Jay did not name -- were responsible for almost all the Mulcaire commissions, Jay said. But the sheer number of names in Mulcaire's files means the one News of the World journalist jailed over phone hacking, Clive Goodman, ""was not a rogue reporter,"" Jay said. Mulcaire and Goodman went to prison in 2007 after admitting hacking into royal family staff messages. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","NEW: Grant calls the hacking of a murdered girl's phone ""cowardly and shocking""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tuba Sahaab looks nothing like a warrior. She is a slight girl of 11, living in a simple home in a suburb of Islamabad. But in Tuba's case, looks are deceiving. ""I want to give peace to my nation,"" Tuba Sahaab says, ""I will fight for it."" With her pen, Tuba is taking on the swords of the Taliban. She crafts poems telling of the pain and suffering of children just like her; girls banned from school, their books burned, as the hard-core Islamic militants spread their reign of terror across parts of Pakistan. A stanza of one of her poems reads: ""Tiny drops of tears, their faces like angels, Washed with blood, they sleep forever with anger."" Tuba is not afraid to express her views. Of the Taliban forcing young girls out of the classroom, she says: ""This is very shocking to hear that girls can't go to school, they are taking us back to the Stone Age."" Less than two hours from Tuba's home, the Taliban have control. The one-time holiday destination of the Swat Valley is now a no-go zone. Curfews are in place at all times. Militants kill with impunity. Human rights activists and people on the ground in Swat Valley speak of a place called ""slaughter square"" where the Taliban leave the bodies of their victims with notes saying ""do not remove for 24 hours."" No one touches the corpses out of fear of reprisals.  Watch Tuba recite her poetry » . Tuba Sahaab refuses to be silent. As young as she is, she is wise and brave beyond her years. The young school girl is reaching a bigger audience, regularly appearing in the media. On the day we spend with her, Tuba and her mother appear on a talk radio program. Back home, she tells me how she would give her life for her country. ""I want to give peace to my nation,"" she says, ""I will fight for it."" And Tuba has an inspiration: U.S. President Barack Obama. She prayed for his elections, she says. She sees in him the hope of peace in her own country. Tuba Sahaab has a dream to meet her hero. She can hardly contain her excitement. ""I want to go the White Palace and show him my poems, show him what is happening and ask him to come to Pakistan and control it because he is a super power."" Meeting and listening to Tuba Sahaab, it is easy to forget she is still a young girl. In her playground at school, Tuba dances and laughs with her friends. She loves writing her short stories (she has already published one book) and shows me a cartoon character she has created called ""Tomato Man."" Tuba's parents are proud of their daughter. They say they are not afraid even as she speaks out so publicly against the Taliban. Tuba is their only child but as her mother tells me, she is ""worth more than seven sons and seven daughters."" And Tuba has the dreams of any young child. She tells me she wants to be an astronaut and then one day lead her country. ""I will do anything, if my life goes I don't worry, I just want to do something."" ""I think you will get the chance,"" I say. ""Yes, if someone gives me the chance you will see what I can do."" Of that, I have no doubt.","With her pen, 11-year-old Pakistani Tuba Sahaab takes on the swords of the Taliban .

"(CNN) -- Police in northern France moved in Wednesday on makeshift migrant camps near the port of Calais, prompting a standoff with the defiant residents -- many of whom have fled conflicts in Syria, Sudan and Eritrea. By late afternoon, a CNN producer observed that the migrants' tents had all been destroyed. One activist told CNN police were responsible. About a dozen police officers remained, along with 50 to 60 migrants who didn't know where to go. A local prefect reportedly told the migrants they can stay at the camp until Thursday. But Thursday is Ascension Day, a public holiday, so it's not clear if the migrants will be cleared out before Friday. Hundreds of migrants had gathered in the ramshackle camps, some seeking to claim asylum in France and others hoping to find a way to reach British soil. Mattheu Adt of international humanitarian organization Medecins du Monde, told CNN from one of the camps that police had asked the migrants to move to an undisclosed location, but that the migrants were refusing. Authorities also asked the migrants to shower and decontaminate their clothes, amid concern over an outbreak of the contagious skin condition, scabies, he said. Migrants refused to do that, Adt said, because of concerns their tattered tents would be gone when they returned. ""They fear they will be arrested at the showers,"" said CÃ©cile Bossy, an activist with Medecins du Monde. She said migrants were given scabies medication Tuesday night but didn't understand what it was for. Adt said the makeshift camp where he is located housed about 600 people, roughly half of them Syrian, and between 200 and 300 Eritrean and Sudanese. A spokesman for the charity Secours Catholique in Calais confirmed that police had arrived at about 6:30 a.m. local time at a camp and asked the migrants there to board buses to go to ""decontamination"" areas. Many of the migrants refused, he said. Earlier, police destroyed another camp -- which housed about 300 people -- with bulldozers, he said. The migrants have been involved in discussions with authorities but don't know where to go, he said. Official: Dismantling under way . An official in Calais told CNN that authorities planned to dismantle the migrants' makeshift camps by the end of Thursday. Roughly 550 migrants lived in those camps, said Georges Bos, the associate chief of staff of the Pas-de-Calais prefecture -- the local branch of the French government. ""By tonight there will be no possibility left to go to these camps,"" he said. Bos said authorities had offered to take the migrants by bus to places where they could shower, adding that dismantling the camps was necessary to prevent further spread of scabies. He said that the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region had told migrants their immigration status would not be checked and that no arrests would be made. It's not the first time French authorities have sought to move on the migrants who congregate in the area around Calais, many hoping to smuggle themselves into Britain inside freight trucks going across the English Channel. A camp in Sangatte was dismantled in 2002 and another known as the Jungle was broken up in 2009. But after each clearance effort, new makeshift camps spring up. 'Deafening silence' Medecins du Monde is one of a number of humanitarian and rights groups that signed an open letter to French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Tuesday voicing concern over the plight of the migrants. ""The situation in Calais is worsening in a deafening silence,"" it said. ""About 700 foreigners, for the most part of Syrian, Afghan and Eritrean origin, fleeing conflicts, violence and persecution, are installed in the town."" About 550 of those migrants are living in makeshift camps, the letter said, having claimed asylum in France or waiting to attempt the crossing to Britain. ""They live in catastrophic sanitary conditions which have encouraged the development of a scabies epidemic."" The groups were ""stunned"" last week to learn that authorities planned to clear the camps and tackle the scabies outbreak on Wednesday, the letter said -- without coming up with any alternative place of shelter for the large majority of people concerned. ""We can anticipate the effects of this expulsion ... inappropriate medical care, people wandering on the streets of Calais, daily police checks, violence, despair and the taking of growing risks to attempt a passage to the United Kingdom, which, since the start of the year, have already caused the deaths of several exiles,"" it said. The groups urge the French government to come up with a plan to tackle the sanitary situation in the camps while living up to its responsibility to protect the migrants on its soil. The letter was also sent to the French interior minister and the minister for health and social affairs. Would-be immigrants storm Spanish enclave on Moroccan coast .

"(CNN) -- The people of Sweden are coming to terms with the first suicide bombing on their soil, an attack which stunned the nation and in the words of the country's foreign minister could have been ""catastrophic."" Authorities say that only the premature detonation of Taimour Abdulwahab's device likely prevented many others from being killed. ""Fifty, 60, 70 people could have been killed -- this was not amateur hour,"" Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College, told CNN. The incident did not surprise counter-terrorism experts. ""For some time Swedish officials have been worried about a growing threat, both from overseas terrorists and from home-grown extremists within the country,"" says Michael Taarnby, a Danish terrorism expert, who has extensively researched Islamist militants in Scandinavia. At the heart of Sweden's unwanted newfound status: cartoons. Three years ago, Lars Vilks published an image of the Prophet Mohammed in a Swedish newspaper. Sweden became an object of jihadist hate just as Denmark did in 2005 after the publication in a newspaper there of caricatures of the Prophet. In March 2010 authorities in Ireland and the United States broke up a plot to murder Vilks. One of those allegedly involved was Colleen LaRose, a Pennsylvania woman who identified herself online as Jihad Jane. LaRose has pled not guilty to providing material support to terrorists. In July 'Inspire' magazine, an online magazine from al Qaeda's Yemeni arm, put Vilks at the top of an assassination list. And a few weeks ago Al Shabaab, al Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia, released a video in which a Swedish member exhorted Swedish militants to kill Vilks. These threats follow an audiotape back in 2007 from Umar al Baghdadi, then a senior figure in al Qaeda in Iraq, who promised ""a reward of $100,000 for anybody who kills this Infidel criminal. This reward will be raised to $150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb."" Baghdadi also called for attacks against Swedish businesses, including Volvo. There's an ironic twist in the mention of Volvo. Back in the 1970s Osama bin Laden went on vacation to Sweden because an older brother was trying to buy Volvo trucks for the bin Laden family construction company. During downtime, the brothers liked nothing better than to speed through the Swedish countryside in the family Rolls Royce. And for a long while, Sweden got a pass from international jihadists. In an October 2004 videotape al Qaeda's leader disputed President George W. Bush's accusation that al Qaeda hated freedom by retorting: ""Let him tell us why we did not strike Sweden, for example."" Not any more. Swedish authorities say emails sent by Abdulwahab just before the attempted attack cited Sweden's tolerance of the Vilks cartoon as one of the reasons he was targeting the country. He also said the attack was due to the continued presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan. Sweden, though not a member of NATO, currently has around 500 troops in Afghanistan assisting the NATO mission. Investigators are still untangling 28 year old Abdulwahab's path to radicalism. His family left Iraq in the early 1990s and settled in Sweden. In 2001, at the age of 19, he visited England to study and settled in Luton - a town in southern England identified in a leaked UK intelligence report two years ago as having one of the main concentrations of Islamic extremists in the country. For many young Muslims in Europe the last decade has been unsettling, with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan leading to a perception that their religion is under attack. Abdulwahab seems to have subscribed to this view, according to religious leaders at an Islamic Centre in Luton. They said he was unwelcome because of his extreme views. The Swedish authorities will now be taking a fresh look at radical Islamists in the country. In October Sweden raised its terrorist threat level to ""elevated"" based on security services' finding that there had been ""a shift in activities among certain groups in Sweden, judged to be targeted at Sweden."" Among Sweden's estimated 300,000 Muslims, the vast majority have no time for Al Qaeda's extremist message. But a radical fringe has emerged, especially amongst younger immigrants, and the children of immigrants. According to Scandinavian counter-terrorism expert Taarnby, the radical extremist fringe is more fragmented in Sweden than in some other European countries such as Britain where a nationwide network of extremists has emerged. But clusters of militants are increasingly on the radar of Sweden's counter-terrorism services. Swedish counter-terrorism sources tell CNN more than 100 are being monitored. Their attention has focused on an extremist fringe within Sweden's 25,000 Somalis, which has been relatively isolated from the rest of society, and is a cause of major concern. A growing number of Swedish citizens of Somali descent have gone to Somalia to join Shabaab. Just last week two Swedish citizens of Somali descent were sentenced for ""planning terrorist crimes"" in Somalia. According to Taarnby, more than 20 Swedish citizens are believed by Swedish security services to be fighting with Al Shabaab in Somalia. Some have become prominent - like Fouad Shongole, who preached an extremist message in a Stockholm mosque in the early 1990s and once fought in Afghanistan. Swedes have also traveled to other Jihadist fronts in recent years, including Iraq. A report by Sweden's Intelligence agency due out Wednesday is expected to highlight the domestic threat posed by Swedes who have received terrorist training, according to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. Several Swedish militants have also made the trip to al Qaeda's safe haven in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, according to counter-terrorism officials. In August 2009 four Swedes were arrested by Pakistani security services as they tried to enter the tribal agency of North Waziristan. ""Travel to Pakistan is becoming a big concern for Swedish counter-terrorism services,"" Swedish terrorism expert Ranstorp told CNN. In another link to Pakistan, Swedish counter-terrorism sources tell CNN that a Swedish militant -- still being monitored by security services in the country -- played a key role in a terrorist network linked to David Headley, an American Jihadist, plotting an attack against a Danish newspaper last year. Headley, who says he working with Ilyas Kashmiri, a Pakistani al Qaeda operative, has pleaded guilty to the plot. Now Sweden's counter-terrorism agencies have another case to investigate. Did Abdulwahab have any help or co-conspirators in Sweden? Where did he obtain the explosives he used in the attack? ""We more or less consider it as a given that he had outside help in some way, at least before he reached the point of execution,"" a Swedish police spokesman said Monday. The question is: who, where and when.","Cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed are at the heart of Sweden being targeted by Islamists .

"(CNN) -- From the day he challenged the great Seve Ballesteros to a chipping contest at the age of four, Matteo Manassero has been a precocious golf talent. The Italian, who last month became the youngest player to make the halfway cut at the Masters in Augusta, has launched his professional career 17 days after his 17th birthday. Manassero, who was also the leading amateur at last year's British Open and topped the non-paid players' world rankings for 18 weeks, made a solid start on Thursday. He carded a two-under-par 70 in the opening round of his home Italian Open which left him three shots off the lead. He outshone his playing partner, European Ryder Cup captain and seven-time Order of Merit winner Colin Montgomerie, who could only manage 76 on a day marred by a two-hour rain delay. ""He was very impressive, to do that as a 17-year-old today,"" the 46-year-old Montgomerie told the European Tour Web site. ""He has a good future ahead of him and I wish him all the best."" Manassero was also pleased with his efforts. ""It was a good round, I played steady for 18 holes. I really liked how I played today. I was a little nervous, like always in big tournaments, but fortunately I'm getting used to it,"" he said. ""I don't want to rewind any part of my game. I didn't putt that well but I didn't have many chances, so I like the way I played and hopefully it will stay like this."" Manassero is used to the big stage. He made his British Open at Turnberry last year, teeing off with American golf legend Tom Watson and Spanish star Sergio Garcia. Watson ended up losing an emotional playoff to Stewart Cink, while Manassero tied for 13th -- and Garcia finished back in 38th. ""I was nervous, it was a big crowd clapping me,"" Manassero told CNN before the Italian Open, breaking into a smile. His successes at Turnberry and then Augusta, where he at at 16 years and 11 months and 22 days he was almost two years younger than Bobby Cole's previous record, have given him a taste of things to come. ""I was on the first page of the biggest newspaper in Italy,"" Manassero said. ""I'm still the same, but life is different. ""Pro-life is what I want. I'm really looking forward to it. Fitness and practicing, normal training, I don't want to do different stuff. I've always done those and I'll keep like this."" Manassero, who is from the province of Verona in northern Italy, recalled the time when he met Spanish legend Ballesteros, a five-time major winner. ""I challenged him on the putting green of my home club. He was chipping and they introduced him to me and then we started started chipping a little, and I holed a chip. That was a great moment,"" he said. His caddy is Alberto Binaghi, a former European Tour player and now the Italian team coach. Binaghi has overseen a resurgence in Italian golf that has taken Edoardo and Francesco Molinari into the world's top-50, with the brothers winning the 2009 World Cup teams event. ""Ten years ago it was probably a rich sport and was difficult to play and it was expensive, but now the situation has changed and there are more young people wanting to play golf,"" Francesco Molinari, ranked 41st, told CNN of the sport in his home country. Four players shared the clubhouse lead at the Royal Park course in Turin, with Englishmen Graeme Storm and Robert Rock carding 67 along with Australia's Marcus Fraser and Scotland's Paul Lawrie. There were still 18 players yet to complete their opening rounds when the day's play came to a halt.","Matteo Manassero launches professional golf career with two-under-par 70 at Italian Open .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Daytime soap ""All My Children"" may have finally reached the end of its run, according to an actress on the show. The iconic drama, which moved from television to the Internet after ABC canceled it, will not return for a second online season, Debbi Morgan tweeted this week. Morgan, who played Dr. Angie Hubbard, revealed the news when a fan asked her via Twitter if rumors of the show's demise were true. ""So sorry to say, Kristin...but yes it is,"" Morgan responded. Prospect Park Productions, the company that contracted with Disney-owned ABC to keep ""All My Children"" and ""One Life to Live"" alive online, did not immediately respond to CNN calls for confirmation or comment. The future of both soaps became uncertain earlier this year when Prospect Park sued ABC, accusing it of violating the deal by killing off some characters in the final episodes of ""One Life to Live."" Production was put on hold after the first season of 43 episodes was finished this year, but Morgan was telling fans as recently as last month that it would resume. ""Many R asking when AMC is coming back. Wish I could give a definitive date. All I can give U is what we're given. The Show ""Is"" coming back!"" she tweeted on October 27. Her optimism, however, dissolved in recent days. She apologized through her Twitter account for ""all the positive proclamations I gave 2 all of U that we'd definitely coming back... Bcuz those were the earnest proclamations we'd been given! I'm so very sorry 2c U disappointed yet again & believe me we feel the same!!!"" The demise of TV soaps came as daytime programming moved to talk shows. Prospect Park's executives expressed optimism that they could save the format by moving it online. ""Technology changes the way the public can and will view television shows,"" Richard Frank, a former Disney studio president, said when the deal was announced. ""Now that there are so many devices available in addition to television sets, viewers are taking advantage of watching shows wherever they are and on any number of devices."" The two soaps became available on Hulu and Apple iTunes this year. But unless Morgan got bad information about her acting gig, ""All My Children"" has concluded after 43 years.

"(CNN) -- The World Cup has provided a festival of football and color in Brazil, and its intoxicating nature has had an effect far away from the shores of the Copacabana. The action and fervor sparked by one of the biggest sporting events in the world has prompted Northern Ireland's two-time major champion Rory McIlroy to turn his mind to another -- the Olympics. And as he stepped up his preparations ahead of the Irish Open in Cork, he decided to announce he'll be representing Ireland at the Rio Olympics of 2016. McIlroy had previously stated his intention to compete under the Great Britain and Northern Ireland banner when golf returns to the Games after 112 years. But confirming his change of heart at a press conference ahead of the Irish Open this week, he said Brazil's hosting of the World Cup had provoked his declaration. ""I've been thinking about it a lot,"" he told reporters at the Fota Island Resort. ""I feel like it's the right decision for me. There's no point in delaying it and letting it linger any longer. ""I don't know whether it's been because the World Cup has been in Brazil and I've been thinking a couple of years down the line. ""I have also thought about all the times that I played as an amateur for Ireland and as a boy and everything so for me it's the right decision to play for Ireland, so I'm going to play for Ireland in 2016. ""If you look at the (Irish) rugby players, you look at cricketers or hockey players ... they view Ireland as one, the same as we do in golf. ""So I don't think there's any point to change that or any point to go against that just because it's a different event or it's the Olympics. ""I was always very proud to put on the Irish uniform and play as an amateur and as a boy, and I would be very proud to do it again."" McIlroy, from Holywood in County Down, played amateur golf on an all-island basis before he turned professional and is eligible to represent Great Britain and Northern Ireland as well as the Republic of Ireland. The U.S. Open and U.S. PGA Championship winner received funding from the Golfing Union of Ireland before turning professional in 2007. And he has represented Ireland twice in golf's World Cup event, both times playing alongside compatriot Graeme McDowell -- the 2010 U.S. Open champion. When asked if an Olympic gold medal would rank as highly as a major championship he replied: ""Winning an Olympic medal is still is not as big as a major championship but it's up there. ""The majors in our sport are the biggest and best prizes in the game. But as hopefully golf grows in the Olympics and becomes say bigger in four or five Games down the line then it might become bigger."" Aside from the 2016 Olympics, McIlroy's more immediate concern was getting his clubs back after they were lost in transit by United during his flight to Ireland. The world No. 6 tweeted on Tuesday: ""Hey @united landed in Dublin yesterday morning from Newark and still no golf clubs... Sort of need them this week... Can someone help!?"" His plea sparked the airline into action and it promised McIlroy's clubs would be delivered to the tournament venue on Wednesday. They were as good as their word and McIlroy posted a photo on Twitter saying: ""Re-@united with my clubs!"" McIlroy is in good form after his recent victory at the European Tour's flagship event -- the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth -- and a top 25 finish at the U.S. Open last weekend. He has been paired with three-time major champion Padraig Harrington, from Ireland, for his first two rounds in Cork.","Rory McIlroy announces intention to compete for Ireland at Rio Olympics of 2016 .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Alan Gross has reached his breaking point while serving a 15-year sentence in a Cuban prison, his wife told CNN. ""He's not going to make it. He's going to do something drastic. I believe him when he tells me that,"" Judy Gross said Wednesday. Gross, 65, was arrested in 2009 for bringing banned satellite communications equipment to the island. A State Department subcontractor, Gross had traveled to Cuba as part of a U.S. government-financed project to help Cubans skirt their government's tight control of the Internet. Gross said he wasn't aware that he had violated the island's laws. But a Cuban court in 2011 convicted Gross of being involved in a plot to destabilize the country's single-party communist government. Judy Gross said that since the arrest she has visited her husband six times. The latest visit Tuesday showed his health was failing rapidly and that he was losing hope of ever returning to the United States, she said. ""This one has been very different. His condition is the worst I have seen. He's flat, depressed, hopeless and in chronic pain,"" she said. According to Gross' attorney, Scott Gilbert, he has lost more than 100 pounds in prison and suffers from arthritis and depression. ""Both governments need to know that Alan plans to end his life in an effort to end this agony,"" Gilbert said in a statement. In April, Gross went on a hunger strike to protest the lack of progress between the United States and Cuba over his case. Gross finally heeded his mother Evelyn's request to end the protest. This month, Evelyn Gross died from cancer. ""They were so close,"" Judy Gross said. ""[Before Gross' arrest] they literally talked twice a day."" Cuban officials denied Gross' request for a furlough to travel to the United States to attend his mother's funeral. Gross said if allowed to travel he would have returned to his cell in a military hospital in Cuba. Cuban officials have said they wish to meet with U.S. government negotiators to discuss freeing Gross for three Cuban intelligence agents serving lengthy prison sentences in the United States. Rene Gonzalez, one of two Cuban intelligence agents who have completed their sentences and returned to Cuba, said he sympathized with Judy Gross' ordeal. ""I would tell her that I regret her husband's situation,"" he said. ""And when she sees Alan Gross to tell him that the next time he comes to Cuba he should come as a friend and not bring military and communications equipment. Come as a friend."" Gonzalez is one of the ""Cuban Five,"" men prosecuted for their roles as sleeper agents reporting on the Cuban exile community to the government of Fidel Castro. U.S. officials say they won't trade Gross for spies they accuse of playing a role in the 1996 shootdown that killed four people associated with the group Brothers to the Rescue. The Miami-based group of Cuban exiles flew hundreds of missions to spot Cuban rafters attempting to flee their island nations. Cuban fighter jets shot down two planes belonging to the groups. U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access and have said his imprisonment is one of the major obstacles to improved relations with Cuba. Despite the stalemate, Judy Gross she was encouraged by the swap in May that freed US. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from captivity in Afghanistan in exchange for five Taliban imprisoned at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo. ""I am sure it was a complicated arrangement,"" Judy Gross said. ""My thought is if they can do that, if they can follow through with something that complicated, surely they can figure out something they can do to get Alan home.""","Alan Gross' wife, Judy, visits husband in Cuba a week after his mother's death .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- When Severiano Ballesteros became a professional golf player in 1974 at the age 16, he began transforming the game in Europe with his masterful creativity and imagination. On Saturday, at the age of 54, he succumbed to complications related to a brain tumor, according to his official website. A message on the site Saturday said, in part, ""Today, at 2:10 a.m. Spanish time, Seve Ballesteros passed away peacefully surrounded by his family at his home in Pedrena. ""The Ballesteros family is very grateful for all the support and gestures of love that have been received since Seve was diagnosed with a brain tumor on 5th October 2008 at Madrid Hospital la Paz."" Fellow players have been quick to pay tribute. English golfer Lee Westwood, the current world No. 1, tweeted that it was a ""sad day"" and described Ballesteros as an inspiration, genius, role model, hero and friend. ""Seve made European golf what it is today,"" Westwood continued. ""RIP Seve."" Italian golfer Francesco Molinari tweeted: ""What a terrible news to hear first thing in the morning. Seve was a superhero for all young golfers, played shots only he could see. RIP."" Ballesteros first made his name as a 19-year-old in 1976 when he finished second at the British Open -- one of golf's four major tournaments. Three years later, he captured the win, making him the youngest winner of that century and the first non-British European to do so since 1907. The Spaniard headed to America the following year where he achieved what no European player had: he won the Masters at Augusta. That victory was seen as breaking down the barriers for his fellow professionals from across the Atlantic who were seen at the time as inferior rivals. ""It was hard to get an invitation, it was hard to get into the majors, especially the U.S. Open,"" Ballesteros told CNN in 2006. ""They didn't like to see someone coming from a small country like Spain and go over there and take their money. As I hear several times in the locker room, 'Here comes the Spaniard to take our money.'"" During his 33-year career, he won a total of five major championships, six titles on the U.S. PGA tour and 56 on the European tour. Adored by fans around the world, Ballesteros was also highly respected by his fellow golfers, who described him as a maverick. ""You never knew when Seve was down -- he's always been a battler on the golf course,"" said British professional golfer Lee Westwood. ""When he thought he was out of a hole, he's been able to get it up and down and just grind away."" He led the newly formed European team to its first Ryder Cup victory in 1985 and its continued period of success after that. Key to the team's success was the partnership between Ballesteros and his friend Jose Maria Olazabel. They went on to become the most successful pairing in the event's history. Olazabel told CNN that he ""learned a lot"" from his fellow Spaniard. ""It was wonderful to watch him play,"" the European Tour player said in a 2006 interview. ""Even though he might not be hitting the ball well he never gave up. He fought until the end. Great matches we won matches that looked lost. So everything was positive."" He led his team to victory in Valderrama, Spain, in 1997 -- the first year that the teams event was hosted by Europe outside of Britain and Ireland. Despite battling chronic back pain that hampered his form in the 1990s, he was named Spanish Sportsman of the Century and European Player of the Century in 2000. It was Ballesteros' passion and fighting spirit that saw him reach the summit of golf's world rankings and escape seemingly impossible positions on the golf course. When he announced his retirement in July 2007 at the age of 50, he said it was ""the most difficult decision of my life."" ""I have a number of good years left and I'd rather spend time now with my three children and my companies and friends,"" he said at the time. ""Golf has given me so much over the years that it's really hard to give back even 25 percent of how much I got. It gave me the pleasure of competing and feeling the glory of winning."" A three-time British Open champion and two-time Masters champion, Ballesteros was often credited for transforming European golf. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor after losing consciousness at Madrid Airport on October 5, 2008. In late 2008, he reportedly was recovering from the tumor and was released from a hospital after several operations. At the time, he called the situation the ""hardest challenge of my life."" He posted a message on his personal website to thank the doctors at Madrid's Universitario La Paz hospital for the treatment. ""Thanks to them I will be able to play the mulligan of my life, which I expect to enjoy at my best,"" Ballesteros said at the time.

"(CNN) -- The man who paved the way for Seve Ballesteros to become one of the greatest golfers in history, Ramon Sota, has died at the age of 74. Sota was not just the uncle and mentor of Ballesteros but a pioneer of the Spanish game during the 1960s and 1970s. Born on April 23, 1938, in Pedrena, Sota was one of the first Spanish golfers to compete on the tour alongside the Miguel brothers, Angel and Sebastian. At the age of just 18, Sota won the first of his four Spanish championships before going on to win several other tournaments. Sota triumphed at the Open de France in 1965, the Dutch Open in 1966 and 1971, the Open de Portugal in 1963, 1969 and 1970, the Italian Open in 1971 and the Spanish Open in 1963. He also won the Brazilian Open in 1965, while finishing sixth at the Masters at Augusta in the same year, which was the best result by a European player at the time. After retiring in 1972, Sota helped coach Ballesteros to land five major victories during an illustrious career. Ballesteros, who died at the age of 54 in May 2011, was the first European to win the U.S. Masters when he picked up the first of his two Green Jackets in 1980. He also won three British Open titles under the guidance of Sota. Javier Ballesteros takes first steps to emulating legendary dad Seve . Tributes poured in for Sota on Twitter with Spanish golfer Pablo Larrazabal leading the way. Larrazabal tweeted: ""Ramon Sota won the French Open in 1965, 43 years before I did... Good memories from those afternoons seating at the putting green in PedreÃ±a listening many of those historys... Ramon Sota, thanks for all."" There was also a tribute from the Royal Spanish Golf Federation on their official website. ""The members of the Royal Spanish Golf Federation would like to express their deepest condolences to family and friends,"" the federation said in a statement. Sota's son Jose Antonio says his father's philosophy was ""work, fight, recovery"" and ""he had a competitive spirit and knew how to recover from a bad day"".","Ramon Sota has passed away at the age of 74 .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan announced a 10-day cease-fire on Sunday in Pakistan's Swat Valley, a volatile region in North West Frontier Province that is largely controlled by the Taliban. The Taliban says it has agreed a 10-day cease-fire with Pakistani forces in the Swat Valley. The Taliban are holding talks with the North West Frontier Province's government in the town of Timagera in the province's Lower Dir district, he said. Taliban leader Sufi Mohammad is heading negotiations for the militants. There was no immediate confirmation of the cease-fire from the Pakistani government. Swat Valley was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination until it was overrun by militants led by radical cleric Maulana Fazlullah. The valley boasted the country's only ski resort and was once a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts. It is believed to be the deepest advance by militants into Pakistan's settled areas -- meaning areas outside its tribal region along the border with Afghanistan. The negotiations are the latest attempt by Pakistan's civilian government -- which took power last year -- to achieve peace through diplomacy in areas where Taliban and al Qaeda leaders are believed to have free rein. Swat has been overrun by forces loyal to Maulana Fazlullah's banned hardline Islamic group, Tehreek Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM) which has allied itself with Taliban fighters. TNSM was once led by Sufi Mohammed, Fazlullah's father-in-law who is leading the latest negotiations. Sufi Mohammed was released from jail last year by Pakistani authorities after he agreed to cooperate with the government. He had been jailed in 2002 after recruiting thousands of fighters to battle U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Fazlullah took over TNSM during Sufi Mohammed's jail stint and vowed to continue his fight to impose fundamentalist Islamic law in the region. Last May, Pakistan's government announced it reached a peace deal with militants in Swat Valley. Analysts as well as critics within the establishment have described those talks as a failure that gave the Taliban time to regroup and gain more ground. The Taliban have recently targeted local politicians, including the head of the Awami National Party -- which represents the region -- who was forced to flee to Islamabad. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders, blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. Pakistan's military operation in the region is unpopular among Pakistanis, but efforts to deal diplomatically with militants have not worked in the past. Pakistan's previous military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, reached a cease-fire deal with militants in South Waziristan in 2006 which was widely blamed for giving al Qaeda and Taliban a stronger foothold in the region. CNN's Zein Basravi contributed to this report.","Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan announces a 10-day cease-fire in Swat Valley .

"(CNN) -- The family of a Georgia student suspended for the rest of the school year for hugging a teacher has filed an appeal with the school board, the teen's mother told CNN on Wednesday night. Sam McNair, a 17-year-old high school senior in Duluth, Georgia, was suspended December 3 for sexual harassment. Surveillance video captured the hug in question, showing Sam placing his arms around the teacher and giving her a hug. The teacher then pushes him away. McNair told ""Piers Morgan Live"" that he had hugged that teacher at Duluth High School before. ""Four or five times,"" he said. ""I hug all my teachers. It's to show appreciation for what they do for me."" He denied that the teacher had told him before to not hug her again. He also said that his lips and cheeks definitely didn't touched the teacher's neck, as is alleged in a discipline report obtained by CNN affiliate WGCL. In a statement earlier this week, Sloan Roach, a spokesperson for the Gwinnett County Public Schools, told CNN, ""Hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary history -- including long-term suspensions that result in alternative school placement -- when determining consequences."" ""If a parent has concerns about the outcome of a panel, he or she is entitled to appeal the decision to the Gwinnett County Board of Education,"" Roach added. Since this is a discipline issue, the law prohibits the district from sharing details about the student's situation or the student's past discipline history, said the spokeswoman. McNair acknowledged he had also been suspended for lengthy periods in the seventh and ninth grades, but said the first incident was from a BB gun that another student placed in his bag, and the second stemmed from medicine a teammate gave him for an injury. He had a bad reaction and it caused a ""big school disruption,"" he said. April McNair, Sam's mother, said she was never notified that her son's behavior this year was a problem. ""Sam is a lovable kid,"" she said, adding that he treated everyone that way. She said an appeal was sent Wednesday to the school board. She remains concerned this will negatively impact her son's future. ""This is his senior year,"" April McNair said. ""You've stripped that of him."" Sam McNair said he is more cautious about he now greets people and if they seem hesitant he passes on the hug. ""I make sure I present myself as a gentleman,"" he said.","Mother says an appeal filed Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- On the surface, Montana Senator Max Baucus's proposal to reform the corporate tax code seems politically insane. The powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has proposed tightening up the tax treatment of corporate profits overseas. The Senator, along with legislators in both parties, wants to use this proposal as the basis for broader loophole-closing reforms that also tackle the individual tax code. Given how difficult it has been to pass any piece of legislation in recent years, it seems impossible that Congress will muster the energy or courage to challenge powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo and to reform the tax code. While loophole-closing tax reform might be good policy, it is hard to see how it can be good politics. ""This is a big rock to push up the hill,"" warned Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden. But in fact there is reason to believe that tax reform might have a chance to pass. The proposal comes at a good time. Congress is stuck in the mud. As an institution, Congress needs a big victory. Polls show that the approval ratings of Congress have reached all-time lows, now having fallen to an abysmal nine percent. Although members of Congress tend to focus on their own electoral future, the public image of Congress has reached such a low point that the leaders of both parties are seriously concerned. When public disapproval of the institution is so strong, it creates the environment for a possible ""throw the bums"" out atmosphere in which all parties are at risk for an anti-incumbent election. Nothing can boost the image of Congress as an institution like a reform that benefits the public interest over private interests. Although achieving tax reform is extraordinarily difficult, Democrats and Republicans could walk away from a deal looking as if they were finally willing to take on the status quo in Washington and to defy the powerful interest groups who lurk on K Street. This might be enough to bolster public attitudes about the House and Senate going into the next couple of election cycles. If Congress gores enough oxen, with both parties equally implicated in the reform, members could insulate themselves from the falloutâ€”preventing one party from using this as an issue against the other--and strengthen their standing with the electorate as a result. Both parties also stand to benefit from tax reform because it remains one of the best ways to raise revenue without raising taxes. One of the reasons that tax reform has always attracted the interest of fiscal conservatives is that cleaning up the tax code of its loopholes quickly raises more revenue. Most fiscal conservatives understand that serious deficit reduction is only possible through a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts. Although the United States has maintained a progressive tax code since 1913, few upper income individuals or corporations pay the actual higher rates since loopholes diminish their obligations. Occasionally, such as in 1969 and 1986, Congress has closed loopholes as a way to raise more money to curb the deficit. Unlike 1986, this time the legislation would not be revenue neutral. The amount of money raised by closing loopholes would be more than the money saved by taxpayers enjoying lower rates, and that money could be used to help shrink the deficit. That could enable the grand bargain over deficit reduction that Democrats and Republicans have been unsuccessfully pursuing for years. As occurred when Ronald Reagan was president in 1986, tax reform was an issue that both parties had an incentive to support. For unpopular Republicans, tax reform can offer evidence that the party is committed to fiscal responsibility and demonstrate that they are capable of governance. Passage of the legislation would offer a contrast to the image that the party gained when it used the debt ceiling to try to force President Obama's hand on spending cuts. For Democrats, tax reform can shift the national agenda away from the problems with the roll out of the Affordable Care Act and toward a legislative accomplishment. Finally, tax reforms can be one of the first tests of the post-filibuster reform Congress. The Senate voted to prevent filibusters on executive and judicial nominations. They did so through a majority vote, establishing for the first time that a majority was sufficient to change the rules. Many experts predict that this precedent might scare senators from using the filibuster as much as in recent years, fearing that the tool might be eliminated altogether. It is thus possible that tax reform would now only require 51, rather than 60, votes in the Senate. President Obama could desperately use a victory like tax reform. As the chances for passing immigration reform diminish, and the possibilities of achieving progress on climate change are nil, tax reform might be one of the few areas where progress is possible. Ronald Reagan scored a big victory in 1986, one that remains a noted part of his record and legacy. Unfortunately, over time new loopholes were created and there is a need for another around of reform. The president should seize the moment, to make sure that his second term is not solely defined by the bitter partisan battles over the budget and health care. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Sen. Max Baucus' proposed to reform taxes isn't as crazy as it sounds .

"Brussels, Belgium (FT.com) -- Brussels competition officials have formally cleared the global tie-up between British Airways, American Airlines and Spain's Iberia as well as giving a green light to the merger between BA and Iberia, saying it would not significantly impede competition in Europe. The moves were welcome by Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways. The global alliance still needs a final green light from the US authorities, but Mr Walsh said that the EU approval was an ""important and vital step forward"". ""The high number of new services on London to US routes since the open skies agreement demonstrates that Heathrow is open. Between us, we have agreed to make available Heathrow slot pairs for our competitors to use on services to the US. This is a pragmatic decision, so that we can get the joint business up and running as soon as possible. The slot commitments provide a further guarantee that there will be no possible loss of competition as a result of our joint business"", he said. The move comes after more than a year of analysis. The European Commission first announced that it was looking at the alliance in April last year, along with the rival Star Alliance, which includes United Airlines, Continental Airlines and Lufthansa. At the time, the commission said that the level of co-operation envisaged between BA, American and Iberia appeared to be more extensive than among the alliance members generally -- and stretched to joint management of schedules, capacity and pricing on transatlantic routes, as well as revenue-sharing on these routes. Officials were anxious to find out whether the co-operation would generate offsetting consumer benefits. But in February, officials in Brussels started consulting on concessions the three carriers offered to address potential anti-competitive implications of the deal, and in March put these out for public comment -- a move that signalled likely eventual approval for the deal. Under the concessions offered by the airlines, seven daily slot pairs will be made available to other carriers. These will comprise three on the London-New York route, two on London-Boston and one on each of London-Miami and London-Dallas. This will allow one or more competitors to operate a total of 49 return flights between London and the four US destinations a week. On the London-New York pair, the carriers will also provide the competing carrier with slots at New York's JFK airport. In addition, the three airlines will provide access to their frequent-flyer programmes on the relevant routes; allow the combining of fares, so that competitors can carry passengers one way on their own planes and back on the alliance's flights; and conclude special pro-rate agreements, making it easier for a passenger to connect from the alliance's short-haul European flights to a competitor's transatlantic flight. The commitments, which are legally binding, will run for 10 years.","European Commission competition officials clear British Airways, Iberian merger .

"(CNN) -- Veronica Campbell-Brown has been cleared to return to competition by officials in her native Jamaica despite the three-time Olympic sprint gold medalist having tested positive for a banned substance earlier this year. However, one of Jamaica's most decorated athletes must now wait to see if the IAAF, track and field's world governing body, agrees with the recommendation made by the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA). If it does, it would provide welcome relief for Jamaica's sprinting community -- Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July. Garth Gayle, general secretary of the JAAA, confirmed to CNN Thursday that it recommended Campbell-Brown receive a warning following her positive test for a banned diuretic in May. She was provisionally suspended. Gayle didn't reveal further details but the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported that the JAAA's disciplinary panel ruled the 31-year-old didn't use the substance to enhance performance. The IAAF's doping review board is expected to make a decision in the case in two or three weeks, an IAAF spokesman told CNN. Campbell-Brown, Powell -- the former world-record holder in the 100 meters -- and Simpson all missed August's world championships in Moscow, where fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt once again dominated the men's sprint events. Bolt, consistently under the spotlight, has never tested positive. ""I don't believe the majority of athletes enter the sport to cheat,"" said Gayle. While not necessarily performance enhancing, diuretics can be used as a masking agent for steroids.","Veronica Campbell-Brown is cleared to return to competition by officials in her native Jamaica .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Given its long history of warfare, the United Kingdom is not squeamish about fatalities in time of war and yet a debate has been ignited by the deaths of 15 British soldiers in Afghanistan over the last few weeks. The question now is whether this profound soul-searching results in a more efficient policy towards the war-torn country. Soldiers from the Welsh Guards carry the coffin of Maj Sean Birchall, killed on patrol in Afghanistan in June. The West became involved in fighting in Afghanistan principally because the Taliban government allowed a non-state actor to carry out acts of terrorism unhindered from within its borders. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and the Taliban's subsequent refusal to extradite members of al Qaeda, the United States allied itself to the Northern Alliance and moved to bring down the Taliban. Following this, the UK and other NATO member states stepped forward to help rebuild the country under a United Nations mandate. While critics of the war have claimed that al Qaeda and the Taliban are separate entities, the links between the two organizations were quite strong; both share a strict interpretation of Islam and a deep antipathy for the West and modernism more generally. And this affinity has not been played out in the ideological sphere alone: before 9/11, an elite al Qaeda formation called the 055 Brigade fought alongside the Taliban in northern Afghanistan and provided training and strategic support. This military co-operation is likely to continue today. The level of interconnection is best exemplified by the fact that Osama Bin Laden's son was married to Mullah Omar's daughter in the sort of political match which is meant to forge a blood kinship between the two. The main difference between the two seems to be in the scope of their objectives: while the Taliban is content with imposing its religious beliefs system on Afghanistan, al Qaeda has a global agenda of building a new Caliphate. Gordon Brown's statement in 2007 that two-thirds of all terrorist attacks originate in the region reveals not only the severity of the threat but also the fact that many of these plots are hatched over the border in Pakistan. And yet sending British troops across the border is not an option. The Pakistani military has been engaged in a low-level war in the border regions with elements of the Taliban since 2001, when they streamed into the country, chased by U.S. and Northern Alliance forces. These elements have successfully taken over the region by emphasizing their Pashtun kinship, the predominant ethnic group in the area, and by killing or intimidating pro-Pakistani government tribal elders. They have been able to negotiate one false cease-fire after another with the Pakistani security forces, while at the same time regrouping and repairing their losses. Despite the grave threat at its doorstep, Islamabad is unable to invite foreign troops across its border as that would be to admit that it cannot protect itself and would induce severe public censure from its own population. The military campaign in Helmand has a chance to succeed, but will require luck, energy and increased co-ordination of efforts by International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) forces. The shift from chasing insurgents to protecting the population offers the potential to gain the allegiance of the local population, but results are unlikely to show themselves for at least six months. If the military part of the campaign is to succeed, there must be positive results in diplomacy, development and security sector reform. The first will be necessary to bring regional actors like Iran, Pakistan, and India to the table, and to buy over local Taliban commanders and their fighters. In development terms, northern Afghanistan is already showing some results, but there is much more to be done in the south where the fighting is the most severe. One key area of development work that can be improved is the removal of the Western cultural bias from the efforts. Taliban fighters and local resistors are known to be galvanized by development efforts that stress Western values, such as gender and human rights. Development efforts should instead focus on cultural-neutral projects such as building a civil service, developing agriculture, building lanes of communication like bridges, roads, and train lines. Local and national markets should be developed, for nothing breeds peace like prosperity. We should not be imposing our vision of how society should be, but rather building an Afghan state that can survive and thrive in the cultural context in which it sits. Furthermore, development efforts should be reformed with government agencies taking more of the brunt of the work than private contractors. One of the biggest military obstacles is fighting an insurgency with insufficient forces and equipment. While U.S. President Barack Obama's surge is intended to correct this, the numbers of troops in Afghanistan are very low compared to those in Iraq. A further obstacle is putting an Afghan face to the fighting. Afghanistan is essentially engaged in a civil war, and while the West must assist and support the current government, it must also build that same government's capacity to defend itself. Indeed, in a country where foreign troops have been a liability, the sooner the Afghan government in Kabul is able to do this, the more credibility it will have in the eyes of its own people. While the specter of defeat always looms in public debate, victory remains within grasp. Certainly, throwing in the towel would have grave consequences for both the region and for the West more generally. The first result would be the rejuvenation and galvanization of al Qaeda and other similar fundamentalist groups around the world. While victory is possible, it must be carefully defined. Already, signs of success are evident in other parts of the country that detract from the gloomy view that we regularly receive from our newspapers and television. According to a UK Department for International Development report released in April, the number of Afghan children in school has increased from one million in 2002 to six million in 2008. Healthcare is now available to more than 82 per cent of the population, and 40,000 more children will live beyond their first birthday than in 2002. A sudden withdrawal by the West would send the wrong message to both friends and enemies alike in the region and would result in the probable collapse of the infant Kabul government. Furthermore, given that UK losses (to take one example) have been lower than those experienced in the Northern Ireland and the Falklands campaigns, withdrawal would question the UK ability to stomach losses defending itself and its allies. It would appear to be a long uphill struggle, but the alternatives indicate that this struggle is a necessary one.

"(CNN) -- The owners of Mississippi's only abortion clinic are headed back to federal court in another attempt to stop a new state law which could close its doors -- effectively banning abortion in the state. The Jackson Women's Health Organization filed for a preliminary injunction Wednesday to delay enforcement of the new law. Clinic officials say House Bill 1390, which was signed into law in April, imposes unnecessary guidelines and requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The clinic's doctors have been unable to gain those privileges. ""We've done everything we can to comply with this law and have been shut down at every juncture,"" said Diane Derzis, the clinic's president and owner. Opinion: Mississippi's end run around abortion . ""Hopefully we'll get a federal judge to see that the state of Mississippi has effectively banned abortion in the state and we hope the judge declares it unconstitutional,"" she told CNN. In July, a federal judge in Jackson, Mississippi, temporarily blocked the law from going into effect to allow the clinic time to comply with it, and stopped the state from imposing civil and criminal penalties against the organization. If the federal court does not grant a preliminary injunction while the clinic fights the constitutionality of the law, it could close down as early as February. ""Anti-choice politicians were very clear that they had one thing in mind when they passed this law: to shut down Mississippi's only abortion clinic,"" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""It isn't a surprise to anyone that the physicians at the Jackson Women's Health Organization haven't been able to obtain admitting privileges at any local hospital."" But the law's sponsor, state Rep. Sam Mims, told CNN the measure's purpose was not to eliminate abortion. ""We're protecting the health of women by giving them professional care,"" he said. ""I believe life begins at conception and I think a lot of Mississippians do as well. If this legislation causes less abortion, then that's a good thing,"" Mims added. The clinic says it has not been able to secure hospital privileges at any of the 12 hospitals in the area. In a denial letter filed as part of the court record, one of the facilities -- Crossgates River Oaks Hospital in nearby Brandon -- wrote that the nature of the clinic's medical practice ""is inconsistent with this hospital's policies and practices as concerns abortion and, in particular, elective abortions... The nature of your proposed medical practice would lead to both an internal and external disruption of the hospital's function and business within this community."" One legal expert says this fight is wrapped in the cloak of conservative religion in one of the most conservative, religious states in the nation. ""A lot of facilities and hospitals, no doubt, don't want to... be labeled as the one facility that's hospitable to providing abortions,"" said Prof. W. Martin Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University.","The Jackson Women's Health Organization is the only abortion clinic in Mississippi .
The clinic's doctors have been unable to get admitting privileges at local hospitals .
One state lawmaker says the aim of the law is to protect women's health ."
"(CNN) -- The credible but as yet unconfirmed reports that three men directed by al Qaeda have plans for an attack on the United States to coincide with the 10th anniversary of September 11 reminds us of the persistence of the threat from Islamist terrorists. Yet our research indicates that al Qaeda and those motivated by its ideology are not the only sources of terrorism that the country faces and that terrorists across the ideological spectrum from those motivated by Osama bin Laden's ideology to neo-Nazis have managed to kill only 30 people in the United States since the attacks on Washington and New York a decade ago. While each of those deaths is, or course, a tragedy, it is orders of magnitude smaller than the 15,000 Americans who are murdered every year. Our study also found that Islamist terrorism has been no more deadly in the United States than other forms of domestic terrorism since September 11. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, one of the fears of ordinary citizens and terrorism experts alike was that a new wave of terrorists would strike, some of them armed with chemical, biological, radiological or even nuclear materials. Ten years later, we have yet to see an Islamist terrorist incident involving such weapons in the United States, and no Islamist militant in this country has made a documented attempt to even acquire such devices. Yet this is not the case for other terrorists. Indeed, the record of the past decade suggests that if a chemical, biological or radiological attack were to take place in the United States, it is more likely that it would come not from a Islamist terrorist but from a right-wing extremist or anarchist. In partnership with Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Public Policy, the New America Foundation has conducted a survey of terrorism incidents and cases in the United States since September 11 motivated by political ideologies other than the violent Islamism advocated by bin Laden. Those ideologies span the spectrum from neo-Nazism and militant Christian fundamentalism to anarchism and violent environmentalism. In the 114 cases we examined, we found five instances of the successful or attempted development or purchase of biological, chemical or radiological weapons by violent extremists motivated by ideologies that have no relation to al Qaeda: . William Krar, a right-wing militia activist, together with his common-law wife, Judith Bruey, had stored enough chemicals to produce a quantity of hydrogen cyanide gas that could kill thousands, along with more than 100 weapons, nearly 100,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 100 pounds of explosives. They were arrested in 2003. Krar was eventually sentenced to more than 11 years in prison, while Bruey received nearly five years. Anarchist and self-proclaimed ""Dr. Chaos"" Joseph Konopka was stockpiling dangerous chemicals, including sodium cyanide, when he was arrested by Chicago police in 2002. He is currently serving a 13-year sentence. Microbiologist Bruce Ivins, an FBI investigation concluded, sent waves of panic throughout the country and killed five people when he sent letters filled with anthrax to politicians and journalists during fall 2001. Ivins committed suicide in 2008. (Some reports have cast doubt on Ivins' responsibility for the attacks, but the FBI remains firm in its conclusion that Ivins was responsible, based on the scientific and other evidence.) White supremacist Demetrius van Crocker was arrested in 2004 after trying to purchase sarin nerve gas and C-4 explosive from an undercover government agent. His efforts to obtain the weapons earned him a 30-year prison sentence. Another white supremacist, James Cummings, managed to acquire a supply of radiological materials from scientific research companies and may have been planning to build a ""dirty"" radiological bomb when his wife killed him after years of domestic abuse in 2008. To be clear, the 114 cases of right-wing and left-wing terrorism we examined probably do not represent a complete survey of non-Islamist terrorist cases in the United States since September 11. While some of this case information is available from the FBI, as well as organizations that track right-wing radicalism such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, keeping track of these incidents is far more difficult than tracking incidents of Islamist terrorism. That is because unlike Islamist terror cases, which are nearly all tried under anti-terrorism laws or statutes dealing with ""material support"" to terrorist groups, other domestic terrorism cases are often tried under an array of other statutes, from weapons and explosives violations, property destruction and arson to ""seditious conspiracy"" in the case of the anti-government Hutaree militia in Michigan. Research on the subject is also hampered by the fact that many of these cases received only limited media attention, unlike the now 188 cases of Islamist terrorism that the New America Foundation and Syracuse's Maxwell School have found in the United States since September 11. We sought to impose as clear a standard as we could for politically motivated violence across a broad spectrum of cases, ranging from environmental terrorism to white supremacist terrorism. We were careful to exclude cases in which insanity or mental deficiency may have had a significant impact, such as that of Jared Lee Loughner, who is accused of killing six people and seriously wounding Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona in January. We also excluded cases of violence that appear not to have been premeditated, such as when Jerry Kane and his son Joseph, both steeped in anti-government ideology and armed with an assault rifle, killed two Arkansas police during a traffic stop in 2010 before they were shot dead themselves in an ensuing car chase. On the other hand, we did include cases in which there was no defined plot but the individual involved had both extreme political views and had bought or constructed high-explosives and other offensive weapons. Officials said that was the case with Jeffrey Harbin, a neo-Nazi and border vigilante who was arrested this year in Arizona with a dozen powerful homemade grenades. As in Islamist terrorism cases in the United States, right- and left-wing terrorists were not all young hotheads but instead had an average age of 36. But unlike the Islamist terrorism cases, which involved only 4% females, in other cases of domestic terrorism women were involved in 15 percent of the cases. The right- and left-wing terrorists in our dataset are almost entirely native-born American citizens, and nearly all appear to be Caucasian. But the political motivations behind their acts were diverse in ways that the participants themselves were not. Thirty-seven percent of cases involved anti-government extremism; 23% were motivated by environmental or pro-animal rights extremism; 17% involved white supremacist ideas or bias against particular ethnic groups; and 11% of cases were animated by religious bias or were acts committed on the basis of religious beliefs, including attacks against abortion doctors and providers. At least fourteen people have been killed in right- and left-wing terrorism-related incidents over the past decade, while acts inspired by Islamist militant ideas killed 17 people (13 of them at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009). The number of non-Islamist incidents that caused fatalities (eight) was also twice that of the Islamist cases (four). And while in the Islamist terrorism cases firearms and explosives figured into around a third of the cases, more than half the cases of non-Islamist terrorism involved firearms or explosives. Right- and left-wing terrorist incidents involved a broad array of targets; a third focused on government buildings or institutions; and 9% targeted police. Five percent of cases involved acts committed against abortion doctors or women's health clinics, and 11% targeted religious institutions: churches, mosques and synagogues. Another 16% of plots and attacks, many of them carried out by environmental extremists, targeted businesses or corporations. There was also a slightly greater number of government informants and undercover agents in the right- and left-wing terrorism cases, relative to the Islamist terrorism cases. More than half of the right- and left-wing terrorism cases involved an informant or cooperating witness, and nearly 40% of those cases also involved an undercover government agent. By contrast, in our survey of Islamist terrorism cases, a third involved an informant, while 11% involved a government agent (six cases involved both a government agent and an informant). And in 18% of right- and left-wing terrorism cases -- compared with 22% in Islamist terrorism cases -- authorities were tipped off or assisted by family members or people within the same social or religious communities as the arrested individual. The data indicate that federal and local authorities are just as aggressive in their use of informants and undercover agents with right- and left-wing terrorists as they are with Muslims extremists. And Muslims and non-Muslims alike are just as likely to cooperate with authorities when they see extremist acts going on, contrary to well-publicized claims from the head of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Peter King, that Muslim community involvement in disrupting terrorism plots is uncommonly low. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Recent terror alert renews concern about al Qaeda, authors say .

"(CNN) -- When Mexican Airways Flight 704 crashed into the mountains near Monterrey on June 4, 1969, it claimed the lives of 79 people including a national hero and one of the greatest players to wield a tennis racket. He had carried the hopes of his country for a decade until his life was tragically cut short, just days after leading Mexico to an epic victory over all-conquering Australia in a Davis Cup tie, the crowning achievement of a remarkable career. He was a grand slam winner, a former world number one and one of the most innovative doubles players in the sport's history. Rafael Osuna Herrera was, quite possibly, the greatest tennis player you never knew, a compelling and inspirational figure, but more than 40 years since his death he has been largely forgotten. Perhaps this is because Osuna was at his peak during the 1960s, before the blanket television coverage of grand slams and major competitions such as the Davis Cup. Clips of him in action are mostly in grainy black and white, but even to the non-expert eye his style of play and breathtaking speed on the court stood out. His modern namesake Rafael Nadal batters opponents into submission with grueling baseline rallies, but Osuna used his lightning-fast reactions to shorten points, rushing to the net behind his service to pull off unlikely volleyed winners. ""He was the quickest of his era,"" recalled legendary tennis broadcaster Bud Collins, who commentated on many of the Mexican star's biggest matches, including his 1963 U.S. Open final win over Frank Froehling on the grass of Forest Hills. Osuna's nephew Rafael Belmar said his uncle had developed his quickness about court from his early days as a junior table tennis player, when forced to run around the table to reach the drop shots of canny older opponents. Belmar also recalled a chance conversation with karate legend Chuck Norris, who he met while studying in the United States. Norris was telling a story about the only two men he knew who could catch a fly with two fingers. One was the martial arts and film legend Bruce Lee, the other was Belmar's uncle Rafael. ""I was amazed,"" Belmar told CNN. ""But in a way not surprised, he could intercept an opponent's drop shot before it bounced!"" Osuna, who came from a middle-class Mexican family, studied at University of South California (USC), going there as a raw freshman and developing his game under the tutelage of coach George Toley. ""Everything he did on court was bad fundamentally, in part because he was such a natural and could get away with it,"" Toley wrote in a book about his experiences at USC. ""We had to tear his game apart, but he could move like a GOD!"" Osuna's first notable success came at Wimbledon in 1960 when he won the doubles with his USC roommate Dennis Ralston, the first unseeded pair to achieve the feat. It was the catalyst for an outstanding doubles career, which saw him claim further grand slam titles at the U.S. Open in 1962 and Wimbledon in 1964 with his compatriot and Davis Cup partner Antonio Palafox. Their doubles combination helped Mexico to the Davis Cup final in 1962, but they were beaten by one of the greatest Australian line-ups of all-time, spearheaded by Rod Laver. Collins believes that had Osuna maintained his college partnership with Ralston, his success might have been even greater in grand slams, but it was with Palafox that the pair experimented with a new formation that is commonly used today. When serving, the other player would straddle the center line, keeping hunched down low to avoid being hit, before springing up to intercept their opponent's return. It's called the ""I-formation"" but Collins said Osuna and Palafox were the first to use it. Such unconventional tactics were Osuna's hallmark and played a major part in his only grand slam singles success in 1963. Froehling was renowned for his big serve-and-volley game. Osuna confounded him by standing way back behind the baseline and then floating back lobbed returns. An easy 7-5 6-4 6-2 victory followed and a place is tennis history as the first and only grand slam champion from Mexico. It earned Osuna the International Tennis Federation's world No. 1 ranking at the end of 1963, the same year he graduated from USC with a degree in business administration. In the pre-Open era, a professional circuit ran in opposition to the regular tennis calendar, with players like Laver joining the paid ranks after accumulating grand slam titles. Osuna, however, spurned the opportunity and took a job with the tobacco giant Phillip Morris, while still playing full time. ""He was offered $120,000 in 1962 by Jack Kramer (who ran the pro tour) but turned it down,"" claimed Belmar. ""My uncle had houses in Beverly Hills, in Mexico City and the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, so money was clearly never an issue."" Keeping his amateur status meant Osuna could continue to play at Wimbledon, where with Palafox he won his final grand slam doubles crown and became the first and only Mexican to grace the cover of the official tournament program in 1964. Osuna reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open the following year, and when the Olympic Games came to Mexico in 1968 he won the exhibition tournament in both singles and doubles. Tennis did not become an official medal sport until the 1988 Games in Seoul but the Osuna family still hold dear the gold medals he was awarded. Approaching the end of his career at the top, Osuna continued to play Davis Cup and on the clay in Mexico City summoned up one last giant effort as 17-time winners Australia visited for a zonal final. Osuna won all three points for Mexico in a 3-2 victory, including a crucial singles win over Australian No. 1 Bill Bowery, again deploying unusual tactics in the fourth set to prevent his opponent from volleying before breaking his service for the final time. No-one can know if Mexico might have progressed further -- the team lost in the next round to Brazil after Osuna had lost his life in one of his country's worse airline disasters. Since his death, Osuna has been honored, with a statue erected and a tennis stadium in Mexico named after him. The ultimate accolade came in 1979 when he was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame, but in recent years, with Mexicans struggling to make an impression on the courts of the world, his place in the national consciousness has waned. ""Maybe Mexico is not so good at celebrating our heroes, he has become an obscure figure from the past,"" Belmar said. Belmar tried to follow in his uncle's footsteps, playing collegiate tennis, while others such as top 10-ranked Raul Ramirez were also inspired by his achievements. Spanish player Manuel Santana, the 1966 men's Wimbledon champion, perhaps best sums it up: ""The man surpasses his achievements.""","Rafael Osuna is Mexico's greatest ever tennis player .

"(CNN) -- After dodging sharks and jellyfish during her swim from Cuba to Florida, Diana Nyad is now dealing with a different challenge: tough questions from her fellow marathon swimmers about the legitimacy of her achievement. In the days since Nyad walked out of the water last week at Key West after swimming 110 miles, a stream of questions has come at her. Could her speed have nearly doubled at one point? Did any of her team members touch her or support her? How could she have gone for hours without food or water? The questions are significant because the answers could determine whether Nyad is officially affirmed as the first person to have completed the Cuba-Florida swim unassisted and without a shark cage.

She said she never held onto a boat or another person ""for any kind of flotation or support.""

That's how and when her speed nearly doubled, he said. Diana Nyad's jellyfish-proof face mask . 'No handlers' Asked about reports she had gone for hours without food or water, Nyad said she never went more than 90 minutes. Getting into the suit that protected her against potentially deadly box jellyfish required duct taping her booties and gloves. That meant she was touched, she said, but never supported. There were ""no handlers grabbing my ankles,"" Nyad said. ""I was on my own steam entirely, but I was touched. I agree with it."" If the group of her swimming peers determines that the suit and the touching mean her swim was assisted, that could nullify her record claim. One marathon swimmer who was on the call was unimpressed. ""She acknowledged that her crew touched her when she was putting on the jellyfish suit,"" said Evan Morrison, a co-founder of Marathon Swimmers Forum. ""And I know she feels that was necessary, but I personally feel that puts in the category of an assisted swim."" Now, Nyad has to wait to see if the group of her peers agrees with Morrison, or with her.

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Li Na fell at the first hurdle of the French Open Tuesday as she was defeated by the unseeded Kristina Mladenovic of France 7-5, 3-6, 6-1. The world No. 2's early exit follows that of men's Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka, who lost Monday to Spanish outsider Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. For Mladenovic, the victory marked just the fifth match she has won this year. The 21-year-old won the girls title in Paris in 2009 but has struggled to replicate this success in the seniors and is currently ranked 103 in the world. ""After the draw I wasn't very happy, but I made sure I prepared as well as I could and was ready to play my best tennis,"" Mladenovic said in her post-match interview on Suzanne Lenglen. ""When I got on court, I thought, 'I'm at home, be positive.' ""I tried to get my forehand into play and attack her forehand whenever I could and it worked well. I'm really glad I could produce such good tennis in front of all these supporters."" Li, a French Open winner in 2011, committed 37 unforced errors compared to her opponent's 25 and surrendered meekly in the final set. Her defeat marks the first time a ladies Australian Open winner has lost in the first round of the French since Lindsey Davenport in the year 2000. Unsurprisingly, Li cut a dejected figure in her post-match press conference, telling reporters: ""Nobody says if you're number two in the world you have to win all the matches. I mean, this is tennis. ""I think it doesn't matter who plays today against me, I always lose because I don't think I put pressure on her. I think today I gave away the match. I think today is not about tennis, so many things are wrong."" Elsewhere on Tuesday, Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki was eliminated 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the opening round by Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer. The 13th seed, whose engagement to golfer Rory McIlroy was broken off last week, has only once advanced past round three in Paris -- in 2010. Fourth seed Simona Halep, from Romania, cruised past Russian opponent Alisa Kleybanova 6-0, 6-2 in just 55 minutes and will now face Britain's Heather Watson who overcame Barbora Zahlavova Strycova, from the Czech Republic. Serbian No. 6 seed Jelena Jankovic and compatriot Ana Ivanovic -- the 2008 winner -- both secured second round berths, as did 21-year-old American Sloane Stephens. In the men's draw, fourth seed David Ferrer, from Spain, made light work of his opening encounter, dispatching Dutchman Igor Sijsling 6-4, 6-3, 6-1. Andy Murray, the reigning Wimbledon champion, took four sets to see off the challenge of Andrey Golubev from Kazakhstan, 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Murray has been trying to rediscover his best form after back surgery last year and he told the tournament's official website: ""I've been moving fairly well the last couple of weeks. ""It was windy, especially at the start. You want to dictate as many points as you can but when it's breezy, it's tricky to stick to your tactics. I didn't go for my shots too much. I just tried to be patient."" Murray has been without a coach since parting with Ivan Lendl earlier this year, but he joked that he is finding it hard to appoint a successor. ""Have I found a coach? Hopefully soon. I'm trying but not many people want to work with me so it's not that easy,"" he added. Gregor Dimitrov, the No. 11 seed from Bulgaria, was dumped out by Croatian veteran Ivan Karlovic, who won his first match at the French Open since 2007. There were also wins for France's No. 12 seed Richard Gasquet over Bernard Tomic, of Australia, and his compatriot Gael Monfils. See also: Wawrinka sent packing in Paris .

"(CNN) -- A big Bertha could have really clubbed Puerto Rico, but fortunately for the denizens of that U.S. territory, Tropical Storm Bertha never gained much clout. The tropical storm dumped plenty of rain and forged through the Caribbean island with gale-force winds Saturday afternoon, but according to the National Hurricane Center, Bertha barely qualified as a tropical cyclone, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, as dry air and vertical shear tore the storm apart. Despite the lack of an impressive resume, Bertha made things miserable for at least tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans. Nearly 40,000 people, mostly in the mountainous center of Puerto Rico, lost electricity, and another 3,000 were left without fresh water, Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla said at a news conference. Padilla also said 220 ""refugees,"" from several different countries, including the United States, ended up in shelters in Arroyo, Cayey and Ponce. The storm was heading over the eastern Dominican Republic, which was subject to a tropical storm warning, according the National Hurricane Center's 8 p.m. advisory. The Miami-based center noted that Bertha was centered about 60 miles east-northeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and 200 miles southeast of Grand Turk Island. As of 8 p.m. tropical storm warnings also remained in effect for the southeastern Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Bertha could end up dumping 1 to 3 inches of rain ""with isolated amounts up to 5 inches"" throughout the Caribbean by the time it's passed through. The Hurricane Center suggests three possible scenarios for Bertha. The official forecast is that ""Bertha survives its current lack of structure, land interaction, and dry air entrainment long enough to reach a more favorable environment in about 36 hours. At that point, it would likely intensify until the onset of extratropical transition in 96-120 hours,"" and become a hurricane far out in the Atlantic Ocean. The second scenario calls for Bertha to degenerate over Hispaniola, though it could regenerate later. And the third scenario would involve a low pressure system developing over the northwestern Bahamas absorbing Bertha in the next 48 hours or so. The biggest threat to the United States would be rip currents up and down the East Coast as large waves come ashore. Share your photos, videos and stories with CNN iReport .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Alexander Reyes' boyhood dream of a military career ended when he was hit by an improvised explosive device during a patrol two years ago in Baghdad. ""Laying in that hospital bed ... sometimes I felt I'd rather [have] died,"" Reyes said. ""My life came to a complete halt."" Reyes sustained severe blast injuries that led to his medical discharge; he's on 100 percent medical disability. Like many soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, Reyes, now 24, found the transition to civilian life difficult. But he and a handful of other injured veterans are getting help from what may seem an unlikely source: a custom home builder in Houston, Texas. Dan Wallrath recently presented Reyes and his wife with an unexpected gift: a home built especially for them, mortgage-free. ""Thank you. That's all I can say,"" Elizabeth Reyes said, sobbing and clutching her stunned husband's arm as Wallrath surprised them with the house. For Wallrath, giving wounded veterans a place to call home is his way of saying thanks. Since 2005, his organization has built four houses. Five more are under construction, and he's expanding his idea into a national campaign called Operation Finally Home. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . Wallrath spent 30 years making upscale clients' dream houses a reality. But he found a new mission in 2005 when he met with Steve Schulz about a very different type of project. Schulz's 20-year old son, a U.S. Marine, had been gravely injured in Iraq. Schulz desperately needed to remodel his house to accommodate his son's wheelchair. ""I had no idea how I was going to pay for it,"" Schulz said. ""I just knew that I had to get it done."" Wallrath went to advise Schulz on remodeling his house as a favor to a friend. It was a meeting that changed Wallrath's life. He remembers Schulz showing him photos of his son Steven. ""He was a big, strapping Marine,"" Wallrath said. But the pictures he saw of Steven taken after his injury told a different story. ""He was ... half his size. It was so sad,"" he said. ""It dawned on me that people are facing this all over the U.S."" Wallrath mobilized an army of carpenters, plumbers and suppliers who took on the remodeling job for free. They widened doorways, built a ramp to the back door and made the bathroom handicapped-accessible. ""Anything that needed to be done, Dan said, 'We'll take care of it,' "" Schulz recalled. ""It was just a huge, huge relief."" When the work on Schulz's home was complete, Wallrath realized he was just getting started. ""It really broke my heart to think [about] these young men and women,"" he said. He decided the best way he could help wounded veterans was by doing what he knew best: building them homes. ""It was like someone hit me upside the head with a 2x4. ... I just felt like this is what God wants me to do."" He took his idea to his local trade group, the Bay Area Builders Association, and convinced members to start a home-building program for wounded veterans. With donations from suppliers and contractors, Wallrath said, the group can build a $300,000 house for $25,000 to $50,000. Each house is fully furnished and customized to meet the needs of each family and is mortgage-free. The group also covers the taxes and insurance for two years. Wounded veterans or their spouses often have to find a new career or go back to school, making it hard to make ends meet, Wallrath said. ""If you can alleviate a financial burden off these young kids where they can concentrate on rebuilding their lives, you can really make a difference,"" he said. Lt. Erasmo Valles is one such story. As a Marine, he was injured by an IED in Iraq in 2004 and ultimately had one of his legs amputated. Returning to civilian life was hard, and his family rapidly burned through its savings. ""We'd saved money for rainy days, but ... it was raining,"" Valles said. Receiving a home from Wallrath in November 2008 turned their fortunes around. Valles, 34, is now studying for his doctorate in public safety; his wife earned her master's degree and is now a special education teacher. ""It saved us,"" he said. ""We're moving on and moving forward. ... For someone to think about me and my family ... to build a home -- wow. That's a hero."" Wallrath is determined to help as many families as he can. He's trying to enlist builders' associations across the country to join his crusade, with the goal of building 100 homes. His program got tremendous interest at an industry event in January, and it soon hopes to break ground on a house near Chicago, the first outside of Texas. Considering the industry was hard-hit by the recession, Wallrath says he's been heartened by the response. Now retired, Wallrath dedicates about half of his time to this effort without pay. He says it's the least he can do to repay some of the more than 30,000 troops who've been wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq. ""These kids ... they're doing it for me and you,"" he said. ""So we're the ones that need to step up and do something."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- In an empty, dusty house, a boy stumbled upon a classic horror movie scenario this week: A mummified corpse hanging by the neck from a belt. And officials say it had been there for five years. Until the boy made his way inside the ramshackle house in Dayton, Ohio, on Sunday, neighbors didn't think anyone lived there, said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County Coroner's Office. They thought the house was abandoned, and it looked that way. The front door was papered with citations for the overgrown yard, and no one came and went from the address. The home was unfurnished. Inside, however, was the body of Edward Brunton, who hanged himself with a belt in a closet in 2009, according to Betz. Betz puts Brunton in his late 40s at the time of his suicide. The closet shielded his body from rapid decomposition, animals and insects, resulting in the mummy-like condition the boy found it in. ""Because of the location where he was found, it was relatively protected, sunlight-protected, temperature-protected and low humidity,"" coroner Kent Harshbarger told CNN affiliate WDTN. Brunton had little time to forge friendships with neighbors; he had purchased the home just months prior to his death. He also was estranged from his family and friends, thus no one ever reported him missing, Betz said. The boy's mother, Michelle McGrath, went into the house to investigate. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until she entered the room that housed the closet. ""When I crossed the threshold of the room, is when I smelled it,"" she said. She called the police. Authorities found identification documents on Brunton's body. His estranged brother, who still recognized him, confirmed it was him. Michigan woman's auto-payments hid her death for over 5 years .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama headed to the Jersey Shore this week to tout the recovery effort from Superstorm Sandy, congressional Republicans sought to keep the nation's focus on Washington. On the same day Obama played ""Touchdown Fever"" with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on the Point Pleasant boardwalk and urged Americans to come spend money in the devastated region, House GOP committee leaders ensured that a series of controversies dominating the start of the president's second term remained in the headlines. Obama quoted from the Tom Waits song ""Jersey Girl"" popularized by local hero Bruce Springsteen, while GOP officials announced subpoenas of State Department records involving last year's deadly Benghazi terrorist attack, questioned if Attorney General Eric Holder lied to Congress about cracking down on journalists and announced another congressional hearing on IRS targeting of conservative groups. And on Friday, Obama stood in the Rose Garden to push Congress to extend student loan rates that are set to double on July 1 if the White House and Republicans can't strike a deal. It's all part of a high-stakes showdown over political messaging, with the White House trying to shift the focus from the controversies that Republicans seek to emphasize in their efforts to retain their House majority and perhaps win control of the Senate in next year's congressional elections. ""Voters react against what they perceive to be excess and overkill,"" said Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who noted that recent polls show the public believes one of the current controversies -- the IRS targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- amounted to government overreach. ""Any political party that overreaches usually gets slapped back by the public,"" she added, referring to losses suffered by parties in power in mid-term elections in 1994, 2006 and 2010. The GOP narrative depicts a government gone wild, with party leaders and strategists accusing the Obama administration of routinely abusing its powers. To bolster their argument, they lump the three controversies together in an effort to create a sweeping example of leaders avoiding accountability and responsibility. ""Benghazi. The IRS. AP phone records. The failures for which Barack Obama will be remembered are not just those of one man or one administration,"" Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor, recently wrote in an opinion piece. ""They are the failures of an old idea -- that big, old, dumb, top-down, factory style government can manage the complexities of modern times."" Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee, complained of ""an arrogant abuse of power"" by the president. ""Now in his second term, now that he's implementing his agenda, we are seeing big government in practice,"" the House Budget Committee chairman said Wednesday on Fox. Asked if the controversies would bring Republican victories in next year's congressional elections to take control of the Senate while retaining their majority in the House, Ryan said it was ""just way too premature to make a comment like that."" White House emphasizes business as usual . For his part, Obama seemed to acknowledge his political troubles at a fundraiser on Wednesday night in Chicago, telling supporters that ""sometimes we take a bad turn, sometimes we make mistakes."" At the same time, the president complained of ""obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism"" by political foes who appeared interested ""only in scoring political points or placating a base, as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the American people."" ""We've got to figure out a way to work around that,"" he continued, declaring that the solution would be for Democrats to regain majority control in the House next year. Obama's schedule this week demonstrated how the White House took a ""business as usual"" approach that emphasized low-risk issues for the president, such as Tuesday's visit to New Jersey for a bipartisan review of recovery efforts with Christie, a leading Republican. The joint appearance benefited both men by portraying them as reasonable leaders able to work with political foes on major issues such as responding to a crisis like last year's storm. Other events on the president's agenda included two Chicago fundraisers and remarks at an Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Celebration at the White House, all following last week's major speech on security issues including U.S. drone policy and closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that houses terror suspects. Despite the White House efforts to shift the focus from the Washington controversies, Wednesday's briefing with reporters by chief spokesman Jay Carney showed the difficulty. While the first questions were about other matters -- a reported drone strike, the Syrian civil war and cyber-security issues with China -- CNN's Jim Acosta then asked about GOP accusations that Holder may have lied to Congress about the secret subpoenas and search warrants obtained by the Justice Department in recent years for information from journalists involved in reporting classified information. Reporters from NBC, CBS and Fox quickly followed up on the same topic, forcing Carney to defend Holder and reiterate Obama's confidence in him. On Thursday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One from Chicago that Obama would later attend his annual hurricane season briefing. He then faced more questions about Holder, with Earnest expressing Obama's confidence that the controversies would not affect the attorney general's ability to do his job. GOP singles out Holder . Republicans have taken particular aim at Holder, an old nemesis from his days in the Clinton administration who has been a political lightning rod in the Obama administration. He was cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans last year in a dispute over documents related to the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun-walking operation. Holder rejected the vote boycotted by most House Democrats as political theater. Critics now seek to link him to two cases stemming from Justice Department investigations of classified leaks -- one involving secret subpoenas last year of phone records of Associated Press journalists, and the other about subpoenas and search warrants obtained in secret three years ago for phone records, e-mails and security badge details of Fox correspondent James Rosen. Some Republicans attempt to group the classified leaks cases with the other controversies -- IRS targeting of conservative groups and erroneous talking points from the administration four days after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, last September that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. ""I think it is time for Mr. Holder to step aside,"" Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis of Florida told Fox News on Wednesday. ""We need a new attorney general, especially with all of these matters that are now going to need investigation from the IRS to the DOJ treatment of reporters. I just don't think he is in a position where he can do that in a way that the American people expect."" Obama and Democrats joined Republicans in condemning the IRS targeting, which is under investigation by congressional committees as well as Holder's Department of Justice. The classified leaks investigations also raised concern among Democrats including Obama, who ordered Holder to conduct a review of how the government investigates such cases. However, Democratic strategist Stephanie Cutter, a CNN political contributor, described Republican calls for Holder to resign as overkill, noting that GOP legislators had demanded an investigation into classified leaks in the first place. ""I think that if the president took action every time a House Republican criticized a member of his Cabinet, we'd have a pretty empty government,"" Cutter said when asked if Holder was proving a liability to Obama. ""... For average Americans, they're not really paying attention to this and they're wondering, you know, why shouldn't the Department of Justice investigate, you know, intelligence leaks about some of our most pressing national security issues?"" Public responds to IRS . A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday appeared to back up some of Cutter's assertion. According to the survey, 44% of registered voters responded that the IRS probe of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status was the most important of the controversies facing the Obama administration, while 24% said the handling of the Benghazi attack was the biggest concern. Only 15% called the Justice Department's seizure of journalists' phone records as the most important. By contrast, 73% of respondents said the economy was a higher priority than the three controversies, according to the survey. However, it also showed that more than three-quarters of respondents wanted a special prosecutor -- rather than Holder -- to investigate the IRS targeting. To liberal political analyst Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Republicans have attacked Holder as part of a broader strategy to tarnish the administration. ""Typing Holder as the font of secrecy, manipulation and wrongdoing in the Obama administration will be played and replayed in the run-up to the 2014 elections,"" Hutchinson wrote Thursday on his website. ""The aim will be to paint Holder as an incompetent, conniving political hack who supposedly typifies the poor and untrustworthy judgment of Obama in picking his political appointees."" Conway, the GOP pollster, argued that the controversies all started with problematic acts by the administration. ""It's an advantage to the party out of power if the party in power is seen to be obfuscating or hiding the truth,"" she said, noting that ""these are not investigations that began in (Republican House Speaker) John Boehner's office."" Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University constitutional lawyer, noted that most recent presidents faced accusations if not outright evidence of scandal in their second terms. In the Obama administration, Turley said, Holder serves the role of ""sin-eater,"" or ""people that would take your sins away for a price."" ""Holder is the ultimate sin-eater in the beltway,"" Turley argued on CNN. ""He protects the president and he has an important use in that sense.""

Pashton said hundreds of people in the district demonstrated against the alliance Thursday and chanted, ""Death to the United States"" and ""Death to NATO.""

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities say they're not certain when a new search area for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be announced, clarifying earlier statements suggesting it would be made public Wednesday. Martin Dolan, the commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, or ATSB, said Tuesday that the analysis of the relevant data will be completed this week, but that ""before we release, we have to talk with the Malaysians who are responsible for the overall investigation."" The ATSB, the agency leading the underwater search for the plane, had said Sunday that the new search area would be announced Wednesday. ""We are waiting for the Malaysians to get back to us on that,"" Dolan said Tuesday. ""I suspect we will know when within the next 24 hours."" More than three months after Flight 370 disappeared over Southeast Asia, searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or the 239 people aboard, making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history. Dolan said he expects that the new analysis of the data from satellites, radar and other sources will shift the search area farther south in the Indian Ocean. But he said the team of experts that has been poring over the available information isn't relying on the Malaysian military's primary radar data as a measure of changes in altitude during the passenger jet's mysterious flight on March 8. Reports that emerged in the early stages of the investigation had suggested the plane may have made dramatic changes in altitude after it turned sharply off its scheduled path from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. CNN safety analyst David Soucie says information about altitude changes is important because it directly affects the calculation of the new search area. If the plane did not rise and fall sharply, ""it changes the amount of time and the distance that the aircraft could have flown,"" he said. If the plane did not make sharp changes in altitude, it would have flown farther and moved farther south than the original search area. Authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course. Outside group tells governments where to search for Flight 370 .

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old girl, described by her family as ""a bright light full of hopes and dreams,"" died inside her Connecticut high school on Friday after being slashed in her neck, chest and face, authorities said. The alleged assailant, a 16-year-old male classmate, was removed by staff members at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut, that town's police said. He's being held at a local medical facility and a murder charge is pending, officials said. He'll be arraigned on this charge next Monday in a juvenile court in New Haven, though police note that courts will decide later if he will be tried as an adult. The incident began around 7 a.m. in a stairwell at the school, and was witnessed in part by at least one school staff member. The victim -- Maren Sanchez, a junior -- suffered ""multiple lacerations"" and investigators ""recovered a knife at the crime scene,"" police said. The Connecticut Chief Medical Examiner's Office has yet to officially determine a cause of death. School staff members and emergency technicians attempted ""life-saving measures,"" according to Milford Police Chief Keith Mello, but Sanchez was pronounced dead at Bridgeport Hospital at 7:43 a.m. Addressing reporters on Friday, the police chief didn't provide a motive but said investigators are looking into rumors a boy was angry because Sanchez had declined to go to the prom with him. The prom, scheduled for Friday night, has been postponed. All students were sent home, and Milford Public Schools Superintendent Elizabeth Feser said counseling services will be available to them throughout the weekend. The slain girl's cousin, Edward Kovac, read a statement from her family lamenting what they called an ""unprovoked attack"" that ended the life of a young woman who had ""her future at her fingertips."" ""Maren should be celebrating at her prom this evening, with her friends and classmates,"" the family said, via Kovac. ""Instead, we are mourning her death, and we are trying as a community to understand this senseless loss of life."" The family statement recalled other cases of school violence, saying ""we can never forget the lessons ... from this"" and other incidents. One of those incidents happened about 22 miles away, in December 2012 in Newtown, when a lone gunman shot his mother to death, then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 people, including 20 children, before taking his own life. ""We need to ensure that more young children are protected from violent attacks at school,"" the family said. READ MORE: Teaching teens to be active bystanders .

"(CNN) -- About 300 Arizona homes and businesses were evacuated as a 4,830-acre wildfire raged near Slide Rock State Park outside the retirement and tourist destination of Sedona, authorities said Thursday. In all, a two- to three-mile area that included a forest service lookout tower was emptied of people, from Slide Rock State Park to the Sterling Springs Hatchery, said the online Incident Information System, or InciWeb. About 840 personnel, including 15 hotshot crews and three air tankers, have been battling the blaze, which was 0% contained late afternoon Thursday. ""As the day warms, firefighters expect increased fire behavior, with the most active portion of the fire toward the northwest to Harding Point. Heavy smoke is likely again in the greater Flagstaff area,"" authorities said. The fire originated Tuesday in an area near Slide Rock State Park, four miles north of Sedona, authorities said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, authorities said, adding that it was probably started by a person. In all, about 3,200 residents in Coconino County were given pre-evacuation notices. Frank Garrison owns 20 rental cabins in the area. ""It's my home, my property, my livelihood,"" he told CNN affiliate KTVK on Wednesday. ""Everything."" He had packed his pickup and was in a line of cars of people leaving the area. The Butterfly Garden Inn said it was able to get all staff members and guests out. ""We are praying for the safety of our beautiful inn and for the brave firefighters working tirelessly to save it,"" the inn said on its Facebook page. ""Please help us pray for a miracle."" Connor Packard stood atop his mother-in-law's roof, spraying water from a garden hose. ""Just spraying down the roof and the yard just in case any embers float down,"" he told KTVK. ""There's already a bunch of ash floating down."" The Slide Fire, as it has been named, is burning an area called Oak Creek Canyon. The hilly terrain and 30-mph wind gusts Wednesday made it difficult for firefighters. The area is popular in the summer with tourists looking to escape the heat. Fodor's Travel named it one of the top 10 state parks in the United States. The state park is a 43-acre historic apple farm, according to the Slide Rock website. No one has been injured because of the fire, the forest service said. By Wednesday, its smoke had drifted into Utah, 150 miles away.

"CHENNAI, India (CNN) -- At 68, Christian Fabre, CEO of Fashions International, might be expected to be thinking about retiring. Christian Fabre, or Swami Pranavananda Brahmendra Avadutha, or just Swamiji for short . But Fabre, or Swami Pranavananda Brahmendra Avadutha as he is also called, is a practicing Hindu monk as well as a businessman, and retirement doesn't really enter his thoughts. ""I'm having too much fun,"" he says with a chuckle. Hardly a gnomic mysticist, Fabre comes across as a jolly old soul, and greets me wearing saffron robes, sandals and sporting the most stylish pair of rimless glasses ever worn by a monk of any denomination. As we chat in his light, open office on a sunny morning in Chennai, his BlackBerry beeps with new e-mails. Tools of the trade, or at least business, are allowed then? ""How can a man who is supposed to be meditating in a cave do this, you may say. But there is no dichotomy between this and my spiritual beliefs,"" he says. A MacBook on his desk and a picture of his guru on the wall, plus the company's 25 percent growth last year, Fabre life seems to be in balance. However, he admits that reaching the place he's in today, both spiritually and physically, ""was no pleasure cruise."" Instead of a backpack and a pocket full of marijuana, he arrived in Chennai in 1971 with a job in the textile-buying business, a wife and a young son. Three years later the job had gone, so too his wife, taking their son with her. Rather than return to France, he stayed, having been seduced by the richness of Indian culture, but struggled to find more work. He met his current business partner in Fashions International, A. Jayapalana, when embarking on an ill-fated and short-lived venture with a fashion designer. However his rag-trade to rags to saffron robes existence only developed when he was introduced to the guru of his yoga teacher. ""He'd suffered from leprosy, but radiated happiness and energy. It dried my tears; I had no right to cry over myself. I also wanted to know his secret, and after meeting regularly for six months, he told me I was right to become a swami."" As a child, Fabre had wanted to become a priest, something his communist railway-worker father completely rejected. ""Who knows how he would take it, but I'm sure if I was telling him about my spirituality, he would agree. Communism and Hinduism go well together in some Indian states, although I'm sure Karl Marx would wonder what it's doing here,"" he says. Depending on how much work he has to do, every month Fabre spends around a week at his ashram, where he has some disciples. It's an eight-hour drive from Chennai and two miles from the nearest village, where he has more time and space -- and less clothing -- in which to further his spiritual practices. His personal life is more ascetic than his BlackBerry-bleeping office existence. He does however have satellite TV at home and the Internet at his hermitage, plus a personal driver, but one thing he always carries with him is a spiritual self-awareness. ""Everything is the ultimate. It is a very leveling spirituality, is it not?"" he says, the French accent slipping into an Indian lilt. ""I can be a businessman and a swami without losing that awareness. It's within and it's without. It's the ultimate and the universal and beyond the universal. It makes you understand a lot in a split second, and you can see things from many angles.""  Watch financial advice from Fabre » . Business karma . One thing he clearly understands is the fashion business. As an outsourcing supply company, Fabre's company is indirectly responsible for employing around 80,000 people in 200 factories around Tamil Nadu, and his clients include labels such as Kenzo, Lee Cooper and Oxbow. Fabre himself is given a modest monthly salary of around $400 (kept in a safe, bank accounts aren't allowed), most of which goes on food, bill and petrol. His spirituality and belief in karma informs the way he lives as well as his business ethics, but don't affect his business decisions. There would be no problem with dismissing a staff member if the need arose, he tells me. However being a swami, he can't sign contracts either with his staff or Fashions International's clients, which he says has only caused a problem once. Much of that he owes to the open-minded people who work in fashion. ""They tell me I am well integrated,"" he says with a laugh. ""They also feel that you are an honest person, although I don't agree with that reasoning. You could be a monk and a bad one."" If there's no contradiction between being a Hindu monk and running a successful company, there's a certain irony about Fashions International's new venture: their own line of clothing named after their CEO, whose wardrobe consists of four yellow pieces of cloth and is more taken to being naked. Not quite the emperor's new clothes, Fabre business acumen tells him they're getting in on selling their own range of clothing at the right time. ""Going into the domestic market is a wise choice. If the American market, or circus, I might call it, goes wrong, we'll have something to fall back on. Also we are taking the brand to South Africa, which is also booming."" Openness and change . Walking around his office, he appears more like a favorite teacher than a boss with his staff of young designers and sales and marketing employees, but he admits that he's not always easy to work with. ""My guru said: 'Never prevent anyone from coming and seeing you.' But sometimes its strenuous when someone is boring, but then you keep it short and they leave feeling positive,"" he says with a smile. As his personal assistant of 13 years, Pinky Lahiri knows as much about the swami formerly known as Christian Fabre as well as any. ""He is strict and he has his principles,"" she says, while Fabre takes a break for lunch. ""He used to get angry quite easily, he's much calmer now than when I first met him. It could be his age,"" she jokes, ""but it's probably his spirituality."" Switching from caffeine and a 60-cigarette-a-day habit to a strict vegetarian diet no doubt helped reduce stress levels. He's been to parties with designers and fashionistas including Jean-Paul Gaultier -- ""a lot of fun"" -- and is regularly feted by the French chamber of commerce, but that's not the reason he's spent so much of his life in the fashion industry. As well as the jobs he's helped to create, he sees fashion as something that gives people the chance to express themselves, present an image and change it if they want. More significant transformations though are harder to come by. Gandhi's famous quote: ""For things to change, first I must change"" appears on signs on desks throughout his office. ""People don't like to change. They're ensconced in their traditions, their habits, my god! You have to have tradition in society, but some are no longer valid. You have to be able to balance that correctly. ""It's not a question of faith; it's not an intellectual thing, either. It comes from the intellect and the heart, and usually this distance is not far away, but for some it takes a long time,"" he says. A businessman, a swami, and now a brand, Fabre is clearly enjoying himself and prepared for any more changes. ""I'm having a hell of a good time, but it would very boring if everyone was like me.""","Frenchman Christian Fabre is CEO of fashion company and also a Hindu monk .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Tuesday the creation of a new trade enforcement unit that will be tasked with investigating unfair trade practices in countries, he said, ""like China."" It was one of a handful of comments on international issues the president made during his annual State of the Union address, which mostly focused on domestic matters and the economy. President Obama challenges Congress on sticky issues . ""It's not right when another country lets our movies, music and software be pirated. It's not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they're heavily subsidized,"" Obama said. ""I will not stand by when our competitors don't play by the rules."" ""Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -- America will always win,"" he added. There was no immediate response to the president's comments from China, which is celebrating the New Year this week. For years, U.S. officials have been pressuring China to allow its renminbi -- or yuan -- to appreciate more rapidly. From 2008 and 2010, China had pegged the yuan to the dollar, keeping its value artificially low and Chinese exports comparatively cheap. Meanwhile, China has called on the United States to loosen export regulations. China has the world's second largest economy after the United States. Here are some of the other international issues the president touched on during his address: . Immigration reform . Obama did not break new ground when he said lawmakers should work on a comprehensive plan and support a path to citizenship for some young people brought to the United States as children. ""If election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let's at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away,"" he said. Obama was likely describing the DREAM Act, a Democratic measure pushed by the president that provides a pathway to legal residency for children of illegal immigrants who attend college or serve in the military. Iran . The Middle Eastern nation is ""more isolated than ever,"" Obama said, vowing to keep the heat on over Tehran's suspected nuclear ambitions. Iran says its nuclear program is not military, but the United States and many of its allies suspect Iran intends to produce a bomb. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has expressed similar concerns. ""Let there be no doubt: America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal,"" the president said during his address. ""A peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations."" Afghanistan . Obama said the U.S.-led war there is winding down and that the transition to local control will continue. Next year, U.S. troops will begin shifting away from combat to a training and advising role. The goal is to let Afghan security forces increasingly take the lead as the U.S. looks to withdraw most of its troops by the end of 2014. ""This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America,"" the president said.","The president announces the creation of a new trade enforcement unit .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Chicken nuggets. Sandwiches. Pizza. Baseball games. Play-Doh. These are some of the basics of childhood that could prove deadly to my 4-year-old son, Teddy. Teddy took his first sip of milk in 2005, triggering a strong allergic reaction as seen in this family photo. Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis, a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing. He has to steer clear of milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts -- even places like baseball stadiums where peanut exposure can't be avoided. We found out about Teddy's allergies partially through trial and error and then through allergy testing when he was 18 months old, and we didn't want any more missteps. Now our job is to try to prevent contact with those foods until he either outgrows them or he becomes old enough to police himself.  Watch what we go through to protect Teddy » . Our vigilance starts before food even enters the house. When we are in the grocery store, we have to read every label to see if the food contains something harmful.  See tips about living with food allergies » . We'll get all the way through one of these and be thinking, ""hurray!"" and then see ""caramel coloring"" and have to put it back. There's still enough wiggle room in food labeling, apparently, to not have to list what's in that -- often milk -- or what's in ""natural flavoring."" Devil in the details . And just because a food item was OK last week doesn't mean the recipe hasn't changed. And just because the package looks right doesn't mean you've picked up the right package. I was in a hurry when I picked up rice cheese in December, so I didn't carefully read the label. Teddy saw the cheese when I was unloading the groceries and asked for a slice -- and then another. Although the cheese looked like our regular vegan cheese without milk, it was an almost identical package that contained milk protein. Teddy ended up in a hospital emergency room with hives all over his arms, legs, tummy and back. His nose was running and he was drooly. He got a shot of epinephrine before he could develop breathing problems. It's a harsh reminder that we can never let down our guard. Once we get food into the house, we try to label it. We have stickers, or we use markers to warn away from giving a particular product to Teddy. Labels aren't enough for baby sitters. We set out a bin of ""Teddy safe"" snacks. School: Lots of cupcakes, no Play-Doh . School is tough, too. The macaroni necklaces my 8-year-old daughter Catie once made for me in pre-K were charming. Who would think that something so simple could make another kid very sick? There's no Play-Doh. It can have wheat in it. Same for papier-mache. Teddy's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products. But it can be exhausting. Every month, it seems, there is another ""holiday"" at school. And all seem to be connected to food celebrations. Every time other parents send food in, we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe. I try to always be the ""cupcake mom,"" because I can make cupcakes without milk, eggs or wheat that still taste good. (Even the teachers fight to get them.) When someone else brings cakes, I try to find out in advance so I can make a Teddy-safe alternative. If there is no warning, the school has a bin of Teddy-safe snacks. Challenges in the kitchen . I try to cook mostly Teddy-safe food at home. The first reaction many people have to hearing of Teddy's allergies is a dumbfounded, ""What does he eat?"" There are actually many foods that are OK for him: meats, vegetables, fruits and most grains. We just don't often get the chance to use convenience foods. I have alternatives for meatloaf and tacos that work OK. But sometimes I just want to make pasta for the family. I know that I could just make rice pasta for everyone. But, frankly, it's about three times the price and doesn't taste as good. So I have to be careful. I can't use the same spoon to stir both. And even when I'm draining the pasta, I have to remember that if I don't drain the rice pasta first, I have to use two colanders. So I try to keep that straight. This is why it's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant. It's very easy for a contaminated utensil to be used in the kitchen without us knowing. And that would be after getting the restaurant staff to show us labels from all food items. This month, we will be meeting with some staff members at Teddy's new elementary school, where he'll be entering kindergarten in August. When we start a new school or new situation, it's always an anxious time. We're going to talk with the school nurse and cafeteria manager about strategies to keep Teddy safe. Teddy will need a classroom as free from danger as possible, and that can be an issue. As soon as we talk about not having peanut products in his classroom, some people think we don't want their kids to have peanut butter sandwiches for lunch. No, we just want peanut products eaten only in the cafeteria. In the lunchroom, Teddy can be watched so that if peanut butter touches him or milk is spilled on him, he will be decontaminated as quickly as possible. (If milk touches Teddy, he gets hives -- he doesn't even have to ingest it. This is a lot different from ""lactose intolerance,"" which some people confuse with a milk allergy. Lactose intolerance produces gastric distress for someone. A milk allergy can be life-threatening.) We'll probably post signs the way we've done at his day cares and preschool, showing him in reaction to an allergen and listing what action to take. Fears of budget cuts . We're hoping that the school nurse doesn't fall victim to budget cuts, because that is our emotional safety net right now. We're comforted by the thought of someone with anaphylaxis experience being close to Teddy. It's all part of the constant vigilance, doing our best to keep him safe. If we'd been handed a list of Teddy's allergies when he was freshly born at the hospital, I think we'd have been overwhelmed. But we found out a bit at a time, and we've been dealing with it now for more than three years. Despite some bumps, Teddy's been able to survive our stumbles and thrive.","Teddy, age 4, has food allergies that, left untreated, can cut off his breathing .

"(CNN) -- Commercial development of the Arctic's natural resources has so far been near to impossible, but transportation throughout the inhospitable region may soon be revolutionized. U.S.-based airship company Aeros and Icelandic airline Icelandair Cargo, say they have signed an agreement with hopes of establishing a partnership to develop new air freight service across the Arctic region. Together they are hoping to deliver standard cargo containers via Iceland to regions with little infrastructure, such as Siberia, Alaska, Greenland and northern Canada. ""It's a project representing the future of solving the problems of today,"" Aeros' CEO Igor Pasternak told CNN. ""The distribution in the Arctic Circle as it is right now is inefficient and not logical."" Managing Director with Icelandair Cargo, Gunnar Sigurfinnsson, said in a press release that he believes Aeros will help transform Arctic transportation forever. ""We are pleased to begin a partnership with Aeroscraft and jointly explore the expanding market opportunities in Greenland, Iceland, and surrounding Northern territories,"" Sigurfinnsson stated. The future of airships . Aeros is developing a new cargo airship, the Aeroscraft -- a hybrid dirigible combining elements of regular ""lighter-than-air"" (LTA) craft and traditional fixed-wing planes. As opposed to existing airship designs, this vehicle can control its own buoyancy and is therefore capable of true vertical take-off and landing without requiring external ballast exchange. This eliminates the need for a runway, airfields and ground crew, which helps sidestep infrastructure development costs. The company, based in California, had test flights with the Aersocraft in September and are now building full-sized prototypes. The aim is to have the first vehicle flying by 2016, and the initial fleet of 24 vehicles up and running by 2020. The rigid-hulled dirigible measures 169 meters in length, and has a payload of 66 tonnes (with plans for a 250 tonne version), a cruising speed of up to 120 knots, and a range of 3,100 nautical miles. One of the Aeroscraft's biggest advantages is that it offers significant fuel savings since it runs on regular diesel, rather than expensive aviation fuel which can be tough to get hold of in more inaccessible regions. The primary focus will be logistical, moving cargo, troops and disaster relief supplies into remote and inhospitable terrain. But the company says that there may also be other uses for the technology in the future, like ""floating hotels"" to ""sky yachts for millionaires."" Global game-changers . Pasternak says he hopes the relationship with Icelandair Cargo will benefit both partners. ""They are a very innovative airline. Someday they will be our partner; they know the area, and we will be able to do some unique deliveries,"" the Kazakhstan-born engineer says. ""It can be everything from delivering the oil rigs to Greenland to bringing milk from England to a Canadian Arctic post."" Not only could Icelandair Cargo and Aeroscraft be global game-changers of how air freight services are operated -- the partnership could potentially transform Iceland into an important business and aviation hub. ""You can imagine that if Iceland becomes the base for the Arctic distribution system, you are creating a new industry in Iceland, which means new jobs and business opportunities,"" said Pasternak. ""It would be a high-tech industry. The Aeroscraft has a green footprint and could provide a normal lifestyle to those living in remote areas. We could be creating a whole new understanding of what the Arctic is.""","Aeros and Icelandair Cargo are to team up to develop new air freight service across the Arctic .

"(CNN) -- New York City resident Joel Rakower bit off more than he could chew when he smuggled nearly 40,000 piranhas into the United States. Rakower pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn to smuggling the deadly piranhas from 2011 to 2012, according to a U.S. Department of Justice statement. The federal Lacey Act combats trafficking in ""illegal"" wildlife, fish and plants. In a plea agreement, Rakower admitted that his company purchased piranhas from a Hong Kong tropical fish supplier and imported them to the city, according to the statement. Rakower instructed the foreign supplier to falsely label the exotic fish on packing lists as silver tetras, a common and unaggressive aquarium fish, because New York City prohibited the possession of piranhas, the statement said. Rakower smuggled 39,548 piranhas over the course of 2011 and 2012, swimming up costs of approximately $37,376, according to the statement. Piranhas, freshwater fish originating in South American rivers, are described as extremely aggressive and territorial. As a result, 25 states have either banned or regulated piranhas, making them illegal to own or sell. Rakower was ""driven by greed and without regard for the health and safety of people or the environment,"" said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, who helped investigate the case. Rakower agreed to pay more than $70,000 in fines and restitution, and his company will serve a two-year period of probation. Rakower will be sentenced on April 24.

"(CNN) -- An online campaign to get One Direction to visit a Colorado teen critically wounded at school has led to a video message from the British boy band. Claire Davis, 17, is in a coma in a Littleton, Colorado, hospital six days after another senior at Arapahoe High School shot her and then took his own life. Friends, who said Davis is a big One Direction fan, began a Twitter campaign to get the group's attention using the hashtag #Get1DtoClaire. The group recorded a 13-second video message and sent it directly to Claire's family, a source close to One Direction told CNN Thursday. While it was not intended to be shared online, her boyfriend apparently uploaded it to YouTube, the source said. The video shows singer Liam Payne delivering the message as the other four members stand by. ""Hi, Claire. We've heard you were a big fan and we just wanted to show you some love,"" Payne said. ""What's happened to you is absolutely terrible, something we can't bear thinking about, so we just wanted to share some love with you. All our prayers are with you and your family. Hope you get well soon. Lots of love."" Louis Tomlinson then blew a kiss toward the camera. The group couldn't be with Claire, but wanted to do something for her, the source said.

"Monterrey, Mexico (CNN) -- Even as Mexico's top transportation official said the plane carrying Jenni Rivera spiraled to the ground in a tailspin that may have surpassed 600 mph, some of the singer's family members were holding out hope on Wednesday. The plane was flying at 28,000 feet when it began to plummet, Gerardo Ruiz, Mexico's transportation secretary, told reporters. It crashed in a mountainous area 9,000 feet above sea level, he said. Determining what caused Sunday's crash could take up to a year, officials said. Authorities were still working Wednesday to identify remains found at the crash site in a remote area of northern Mexico. Rivera and six others were thought to be on board the plane, which lost contact with air traffic controllers soon after takeoff. In California, the Mexican-American singer's mother said her grandchildren still think Rivera is alive. ""They continue thinking that their mother is OK, that God could perform a miracle,"" said Rosa Saavedra, noting she was trying to stay strong to support them. Pedro Rivera Jr., one of the singer's brothers, said the family was waiting to read a document detailing her wishes that she had left with a sister about a month ago. ""She cannot read it yet, she can't say anything to us yet, until we are 100% sure that Jenni is no longer with us,"" he said. Known to fans as ""La Diva de la Banda"" or The Diva of Banda Music, Rivera was well-established as a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. For fans, the nickname captured her powerful voice and the personal strength many admired. In recent years, she had been working to crack the English-language U.S. market and was reportedly on the verge of a crossover with a sitcom inspired by the success of ""I Love Jenni,"" a Spanish-language reality TV show on Telemundo's mun2 network. Rivera sold 15 million records, according to Billboard, and recently won two Billboard Music Awards, including favorite Mexican music female artist. In October, People en EspaÃ±ol added her to its list of the 25 most powerful women. She performed at a concert in Monterrey on Saturday night before boarding the Learjet, which took off early Sunday and lost contact with air traffic controllers about 60 miles into the trip.

"(CNN) -- W. Mark Felt, who leaked information to reporters under the moniker, ""Deep Throat,"" about the Watergate break-in, died Thursday at the age of 95, sources told CNN. W. Mark Felt, known as ""Deep Throat,"" divulged information to reporters about the Watergate break-in. Rob Jones, Felt's grandson, said his grandfather died at his home in Santa Rosa, California. According to published reports, Felt died of congestive heart failure. Felt admitted in a 2005 Vanity Fair article he was the Washington Post's source for many of its 400 stories on the Watergate affair during the early 1970s. The Watergate break-in eventually led to the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon. ""I'm proud of everything that Deep Throat did,"" Felt, 92, told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in 2006, his first public interview on the subject. Felt's entanglement with history occurred in 1972 after the bungled break-in at the Democratic National Party offices in the Watergate hotel. Felt, an associate director at the FBI, said he was unhappy with the way the administration meddled with the investigation into the break-in, which led him to divulge information to the newspaper.  Watch how Felt played a pivotal role in presidential history » . Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, then-rookie reporters with the Washington Post, did stories about the break-in and subsequent cover-up. Both men credited Felt for helping them, but Bernstein said Felt was a tough interview. ""He didn't leak. He had to really be squeezed,"" Bernstein said in a 2006 interview. ""He confirmed mostly what we had gotten elsewhere. He didn't want to volunteer a lot of information, yet his role was essential in giving us a solidity and a knowledge that what we were reporting was right.""  Watch Bernstein praise Felt's courage » . When King asked Felt whether he felt he had done anything wrong in going outside approved channels to get information out, Felt was unequivocal.

According to Feldman, Haim told him about an incident on the set of the 1986 film ""Lucas"": . ""Haim started to confide in me, about some intensely personal stuff, very quickly ... Within hours of our first meeting, we found ourselves talking about Lucas, the film he made in the summer of 1985, the role I had wanted for myself. At some point during the filming, he explained, an adult male convinced him that its was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the 'guys do.' So, they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers, during a lunch break for the cast and crew, and Haim, innocent and ambitious as he was, allowed himself to be sodomized.""

While Feldman never acted on his friend's suggestion, he did encounter more sexual abuse later on from the adults around him, including an older male Feldman had hired as his assistant who he calls ""Ron Crimson"" in the book.

"(CNN) -- Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the sister of President John F. Kennedy and a champion of the disabled who founded the Special Olympics, died Tuesday, the Special Olympics said. She was 88. Eunice Kennedy Shriver speaks at a dinner in honor of the Special Olympics in July 2006. Born on July 10, 1921, in Brookline, Massachusetts, Shriver was the fifth of nine children to Joseph P. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. She emerged from the long shadow of siblings John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy as the founder of the Special Olympics, which started as a summer day camp in her backyard in 1962. Today, 3.1 million people with mental disabilities participate in 228 programs in 170 nations, according to the Special Olympics. ""She was the light of our lives, a mother, wife, grandmother, sister and aunt who taught us by example and with passion what it means to live a faith-driven life of love and service to others,"" the Shriver family said Tuesday in a statement. ""For each of us, she often seemed to stop time itself -- to run another Special Olympics Games, to visit us in our homes, to attend to her own mother, her sisters and brothers, and to sail, tell stories, and laugh and serve her friends."" No final decision has been made on funeral arrangements, a source close to the family said. Shriver's husband, R. Sargent Shriver, and her five children and their spouses and all of her 19 grandchildren were with her when she died, the Special Olympics said in a statement.  Watch a look at Eunice Kennedy Shriver's life » . ""We are tremendously grateful for the extreme outpouring of support and prayer from the public as we honor our beloved founder,"" Brady Lum, Special Olympics president and chief operating officer, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Today we celebrate the life of a woman who had the vision to create our movement. It is an enormous loss, but I know we can rest assured that her legacy will live on through her family, friends, and the millions of people around the world who she touched and transformed."" Even before launching the Special Olympics in 1968, Shriver had established a reputation as an advocate for the disenfranchised and a trailblazer for the rights of the disabled through a variety of roles in the private and public sector. She also persuaded the Kennedy family to go public with one of its most guarded secrets. In September 1962, Shriver wrote an article about her mentally disabled sister, Rosemary, which was published in The Saturday Evening Post. At an event honoring her in 2007, Shriver spoke of her life: ""Most people believe I spent my whole life really interested in only one thing and that one thing is working to make the world a better place for people with intellectual disabilities. ""As important as it has been, it is not the whole story of my life. My life is about being lucky as a child to be raised by parents who loved me and made me believe in possibilities. It is also about being lucky to have had these extraordinary children. ... It is also about being especially lucky to have a wonderful husband.""  Watch Shriver reflect on her life » . At the same event, Edward Kennedy paid tribute to his sister, saying she had inherited the best qualities from his parents, including compassion. ""She had that sense no one should be left out or left behind. She picked this up, obviously, at a very early age. All of us could see that special relationship that Eunice had with Rosemary."" After receiving a degree in sociology from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, Shriver worked for the U.S. State Department in the Special War Problems Division from 1943 to 1945, helping former prisoners of war readjust to civilian life. From 1947 to 1948, she worked for $1 at the Department of Justice as executive secretary for the National Conference on Prevention and Control of Juvenile Delinquency.  See highlights of Shriver's public and private life » . In the early 1950s, she was a social worker at a federal prison for women in West Virginia and in juvenile court in Chicago, Illinois. She married Sargent Shriver Jr., a World War II veteran who was building his career as a lawyer and public servant, in 1953. The couple's five children include California's first lady, Maria Shriver. Sargent Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s, including Head Start and the Peace Corps. He also worked with his wife on the Special Olympics. He ran President Johnson's War on Poverty and was U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970. He was Democrat George McGovern's running mate in the 1972 presidential election. In 1957, Eunice Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, which was established in 1946 to honor the family's eldest son -- who was killed in World War II -- to research the causes of disabilities and to improve the treatment of disabled people.  Watch Shriver receive a special honor » . Her work with the foundation paved the way for a number of initiatives furthering the cause of disability advocacy. In 1962 she helped establish the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a government agency that conducts research on topics related to the health of children, adults and families that was named after Shriver in 2008. Disturbed by the treatment of disabled people in institutions across the country in the 1950s and 1960s, Shriver began inviting disabled children to a summer day camp, called Camp Shriver, on her farm in Maryland. Her vision expanded over the years, and in July 1968 the first International Special Olympics Games were held in Chicago. She also assisted in the establishment of a network of university-affiliated facilities and intellectual disabilities research centers at major medical schools across the United States, including centers for the study of medical ethics at Harvard and Georgetown universities in 1971. In 1981, Shriver began the Community of Caring program to reduce disabilities among babies of teenagers. That led to the establishment of Community of Caring programs in 1,200 public and private schools from 1990 to 2006. Along the way, Shriver earned worldwide accolades and awards, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame's Founder's Award and nine honorary degrees. In 1995, the U.S. Mint issued a commemorative coin with her portrait. The Mint says that made her the first living woman to be depicted on an American coin. In 2009, a painting of Shriver with several Special Olympians was added to the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery.  See images from Shriver's life » . Her health began to fail in recent years, landing her in the hospital in 2005 after a minor stroke and hip fracture. She was hospitalized again in 2007 for an undisclosed ailment. In addition to her husband and daughter, Shriver is survived by her sons Robert Sargent Shriver III, Timothy Perry Shriver, Mark Kennedy Shriver and Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver.","NEW: ""She often seemed to stop time itself,"" family says in statement .

"Yaounde, Cameroon (CNN) -- Michele Mbala Mvogo, a 17-year-old high school student, left home to go to school one morning, and she never came back. On Friday, police found Michele's corpse with four other bodies dumped outside a kindergarten school. Fighting back tears, Deborah Ngoh Tonye described what was left of her sister's gruesome corpse. Someone had removed Michele's genitals, tongue, eyes, hair, and breasts. Michele's bizarre murder is believed to be part of a wave of killings linked to occult rituals that has triggered panic in Yaounde, the capital city of more than 2 million people in the West African nation of Cameroon. In the past two weeks police have found 18 bodies dumped along the streets. Authorities said all of the bodies had been mutilated. Officials have not said if the female victims among the 18 bodies had been raped. State security officials said Tuesday the bodies have been identified. The victims, who are between the ages of 15 and 26, are mostly Yaounde high school students, police said. They said a number of suspects have been arrested in the case, but so far no one has been charged. State intelligence officials have launched an investigation to track down the killers, said Communications Minister Tchiroma Bakari. In some regions of the country, traditional healers claim eyes, genitals, tongues and other organs have mystical powers. Some occultists believe such organs hold the keys to gaining wealth and other good fortune. Until the 1970s, ritual killings were a common cultural practice in Cameroon, before education became more widespread. Signs of its gradual resurgence beginning last year have shaken much of the city. The fear is most noticeable as evenings approach. Many families lock themselves indoors beginning in the late hours of the day, while young men band together in vigilante groups, roaming the streets looking for killers. Police have shut down dozens of bars that are suspected as hangouts for criminals. Security officials warn pedestrians, especially girls, to walk in groups. Fears about occult groups and human organs gained strength in late 2012 when Health Minister Andre Mama Fouda fired a laboratory technician and four mortuary attendants. They admitted to trading organs harvested from dead bodies stored in the mortuary of the state regional hospital in Douala, Cameroon's largest city. In Yaounde's public hospitals, dozens of relatives have complained to administrators about mutilated corpses, said the minister of public health. Taking organs for such uses represents a ""gross violation of human rights,"" said Cameroon human rights advocate Rosine Djoumessi Masonwa. Local authorities must work ""to end the mutilation of human bodies through strong laws and widespread education programs."" As she grieves for her sister, Tonye, like so many others, is frightened and worried that more isn't being done. ""There is laxity in the forces in ensuring security in the capital,"" she said.","Police find 18 mutilated bodies from suspected ritual killings in the past 2 weeks .
