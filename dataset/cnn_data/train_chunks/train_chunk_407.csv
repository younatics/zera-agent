"The reward for the safe return of a missing New York City teen with autism, Avonte Oquendo, has been raised to $70,000, thanks to an anonymous donation through Autism Speaks, according to a spokesman for the organization. The $50,000 donation came in Friday morning and was specifically earmarked to aid the search effort for Oquendo, said C.J. Volpe, director of media relations for Autism Speaks, a national organization devoted to autism research and advocacy. The reward was previously $20,000. Mayerson & Associates, a Manhattan law firm that represents individuals with autism, and the Manhattan's Children Center, a nonprofit private autism school, had each pledged $5,000. Later, Oquendo's mother's employer, Health First, and The Perecman Firm, the law firm now representing the Oquendo family, pledged an additional $5,000 each, according to David Perecman, the family's attorney. ""We work to keep our children safe every day, and we hope this raises awareness to getting him found,"" said Abby Weiss, chief administrator of the Manhattan's Children Center. Gary Mayerson, the founder of the law firm bearing his name, said the status of the search and investigation may lead to the reward money being increased. ""We cannot begin to imagine what Avonte's family is going through,"" the firm said in a written statement. ""Time is of the essence."" Surveillance video shows 14-year-old Oquendo, of Queens, running out the door of Center Boulevard School in Long Island City at 12:38 p.m. on October 4. Police say he is unable to communicate verbally. New York Police Department spokeswoman Annette Markowski told CNN that there have been no new developments in the case and the investigation continues. The Oquendo family filed a ""notice of claim"" Wednesday, said Perecman, marking the first step of a civil lawsuit against the city of New York. He declined to give further information regarding the claim. Perecman also told CNN that he is taking steps to investigate how Oquendo was able to escape school grounds unsupervised. ""Right now, we have submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the city and the various agencies involved, in order to obtain the information for us to know what occurred,"" Perecman said. However, the family remains resolute in their search for their missing son. ""I'm just doing my job as their lawyer, but the focus is on finding Avonte. That is the family's focus,"" Perecman said. Earlier this week, Oquendo's mother called the situation ""heartbreaking."" ""I just need to find my son because he needs his family, he cannot fend for himself out there,"" Vanessa Fontaine told CNN affiliate WABC. ""This is just the hardest thing to have your child disappear, and you cannot bring him home with you,"" she said. According to the surveillance video provided by the NYPD, no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14-year-old when he ran out. ""He is supposed to have one-to-one supervision at all times,"" Fontaine said through tears. ""He has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old."" The New York City Department of Education issued a statement saying it is working closely with the police on the investigation. The school is not commenting. Police say Oquendo was last seen wearing a gray-striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers. He is 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Missing posters are being handed out and the surrounding areas are under investigation, WABC reported. ""He doesn't know that, you know, 'I can get hurt in the street, someone can grab me and take me.' He doesn't know that,"" Fontaine said Monday. ""He doesn't know fear."" Autism Speaks employees and volunteers will be joining the search effort Friday, Volpe wrote in an e-mail. ""We're all just praying for his safe return and we want to do everything we can to support the family.  People in our community are rallying together and doing what we can to ensure that he comes home,"" Volpe said. A vigil for Oquendo is expected to be held Friday night in a park across the street from his school. Anyone with information about Oquendo is asked to contact the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS. The public can also submit tips at Crime Stoppers website, nypdcrimestoppers.com or text to 274637(CRIMES), then enter TIP577.","Avonte Oquendo, 14, has been missing since he ran out of his school a week ago .

"Afghan President Hamid Karzai received a petition Sunday with nearly 5,000 names endorsing a plea for the immediate release of a rape victim who has been jailed because of her attack and is being forced to marry her rapist. Kim Motley, a lawyer for 21-year-old Gulnaz, said the palace received the petition, which gathered 4,751 names in just over 48 hours, on Sunday afternoon. The petition comes with an official plea for clemency addressed to the president, who has the power to immediately pardon Gulnaz, currently in jail for adultery because her attacker was married at the time of the attack. Gulnaz was sentenced to 12 years after the attack as her rapist was married though that term was recently reduced to three years. Gulnaz's plight gained international attention when the European Union blocked the broadcast of a documentary made about her ordeal saying that it would further jeopardize her safety. Gulnaz was raped two years ago by her cousin's husband but did not immediately report the attack, fearing reprisals from elements of Afghanistan's conservative society. Yet she conceived a child from the rape, and went to police after showing signs of pregnancy. She is now raising the daughter in jail and has agreed to marry her attacker in order to be released and legitimize her daughter. She also fears attack from her rapist's relatives, something he denies is a risk. A spokesman for the attorney general, Rahmatullah Naziri, told CNN last week that her sentence had been reduced to three years, leaving about a year to serve. He explained that while the original sentence for adultery was reduced, she had failed to report her rape quickly enough and would have to serve further time in jail for that offense. The U.S. State Department, while not explicitly calling for Gulnaz's release, said in a statement Thursday: ""Gulnaz's situation is one no woman should have to face.  Our heartfelt condolences go out to Gulnaz and her young daughter. We expect Afghan prosecutors to properly apply the law while also upholding Gulnaz's rights.""","The petition is sent to Afghan President Hamid Karzai .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama pledged Tuesday night to cure Americans from what he called ""the crushing cost of health care,"" saying the country could not afford to put health-care reform on hold. President Obama tells Congress Tuesday night: ""I have no illusions this will be an easy process."" ""This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes,"" Obama said in his speech to a joint session of Congress. Obama pointed to the increasing number of uninsured and rapidly rising health-care premiums, which he said was one reason small business closed their doors and corporations moved overseas. Obama's prescription for health-care reform included making ""the largest investment ever"" in preventive care, rooting out Medicare fraud and investing in electronic health records and new technology in an effort to reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy and save lives. ""I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process,"" the president said, adding that he was scheduling a gathering next week of ""businesses and workers, doctors and health-care providers, Democrats and Republicans."" ""The cost of health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough. So let there be no doubt, health-care reform cannot wait, it must not wait and it will not wait another year,"" Obama said to a standing ovation. The president also said Americans would see a cure for cancer ""in our time."" Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, died of ovarian and uterine cancer at 52. Obama made health-care reform a central theme of his presidential campaign and promised not only to achieve universal health care in his first term, but also to cut the average family's health care health-care costs by $2,500. In his speech Tuesday, he placed health-care reform alongside education and energy reforms as central pillars of his recovery plan. An estimated 45.7 million Americans are uninsured, and for those with coverage, and health-care costs have been rising four times faster than wages, Obama said. The average cost of family health-care coverage more than doubled from 1999 to 2008, from $1,543 to $3,354, according to a report by the Institute on Medicine released Tuesday. During his speech, Obama touted changes in the health-care system already passed in his month-old administration as part of The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Watch the president address health care » . ""Already, we have done more to advance the cause of health-care reform in the last 30 days than we have in the last decade,"" he said. ""When it was days old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full-time."" Signed into law on February 17, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act also includes $87 billion to bolster state Medicaid programs and offers a 65 percent subsidy for nine months to help the unemployed pay for their COBRA coverage. COBRA allows the unemployed to pick up the payments and continue the health insurance coverage they had with their former employer. The subsidy would help an estimated seven million Americans, according to a congressional estimate. The president's health-care message was applauded by Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national organization for health care consumers. ""President Obama is absolutely correct that the nation's economy and the federal budget deficit cannot be fixed without meaningful health-care reform,"" Pollack said in a statement.","President Obama on health-care reform: ""It will not wait another year""

"Russia has announced plans to build new nuclear reactors in Iran -- a move with international repercussions as a deadline looms. The country will construct up to eight new reactors for the ""peaceful use of atomic energy"" in Iran, Russian state news agency Ria-Novosti reported Tuesday. The announcement came less than two weeks before Iran's negotiations with Western powers over its nuclear activities are set to expire. It also came a day after a fresh warning from Israel that the regime can't be trusted, and a fresh promise from Washington that Iran won't become a nuclear-armed state. Russia said its agreement with Iran includes a plan for the spent nuclear fuel to be ""returned to Russia for reprocessing and storage."" Both Iran and Russia are under sanctions by the West. The announcement suggests Moscow is demonstrating that it has no plans to slow down its nuclear cooperation. Iran leader: 'Annihilate' Israel . On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benhamin Netanyahu spoke out against new statements from Iran's Supreme Leader calling for Israel to be ""annihilated."" ""There is no moderation in Iran. It is unrepentant, unreformed, it calls for Israel's eradication, it promotes international terrorism,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. ""This terrorist regime in Iran must not be allowed to become a nuclear threshold power,"" the Prime Minister said. ""And I call on the P5+1 countries -- don't rush into a deal that would let Iran rush to the bomb."" P5+1 refers to the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France -- the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- and Germany. Iran insists it only wants nuclear energy. And Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, while calling for the elimination of Israel, said he opposes ""a massacre of the Jewish people in this region."" It says the ""proper way of eliminating Israel"" is for ""all the original people of Palestine including Muslims, Christians and Jews wherever they are, whether inside Palestine, in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else, take part in a public and organized referendum."" The ""Jewish immigrants who have been persuaded into emigration to Palestine do not have the right to take part,"" he said. It's unclear who Khamenei thinks the ""original people of Palestine"" are, given that the region's history dates back thousands of years and includes countless waves of immigration and exile. U.S.: Iran won't get a nuclear bomb . U.S. President Barack Obama recently sent a letter to Khamenei about cooperating in the fight against ISIS, the terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. Revelations about the letter have raised questions over whether Obama's stance on Iran is softening. U.S. officials insist Washington is not coordinating military actions with Tehran -- and that there is no softening in its position on the country's nuclear program. ""We will not let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, period,"" U.S. Vice President Joe Biden vowed Monday. The deadline for the current round of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 is November 24. Obama has left it unclear whether a deal will be struck by then. Opinion: On Iran, is Obama a sad negotiator?","Russia will build up to 8 new reactors in Iran for ""atomic energy,"" state media says .

"The Carolina Panthers' Cam Newton does not appear to be at fault in a Charlotte, North Carolina, wreck, according to a police report released a few hours before the star quarterback was discharged from a hospital Wednesday. The driver of the car that flipped Newton's truck told police he didn't see the truck before colliding with its driver's-side rear wheel, according to the report. Two witnesses, one who was traveling behind Newton's Dodge truck and one who was behind the Buick sedan that struck Newton, told police that the other driver -- identified as a Fort Mill, South Carolina, 46-year-old -- pulled out in front of Newton as he was on his way to the Panthers' facility. ""(Newton) advised that he tried to maneuver to avoid the collision but (was) unsuccessful. As a result of the collision, (his vehicle) rolled over,"" the report said. The speed limit was 35 mph on the street where Newton was traveling, and Newton was driving the speed limit when he was hit, according to the report. Newton suffered two horizontal fractures in his back in the wreck, the Panthers said in a statement Tuesday. He will be sidelined for Sunday's game after spending parts of Tuesday and Wednesday in the hospital. The quarterback was released from the hospital Wednesday, team spokesman Charlie Dayton told CNN. ""Cam Newton has soreness but is in good spirits. He's excited to be discharged and begin recuperating with family,"" the team tweeted. On Wednesday night Newton posted a picture of his truck on Facebook and wrote a message to his fans, thanking God for watching over him and telling his supporters to forgive grudges and tell others how much you care for them. He said he is replaying the accident in his mind ""every time I close my eyes."" ""I do not know where to begin because by the look of that picture soMEone is supposed to be dead or severely injured worse than what I am right now!"" he wrote. ""While I am resting up the thought that keeps flashing in my mind is that GOD IS GOOD and someone has there protective hands on my life shielding me from any danger that may come my way!"" He added: "" Thank you to the people who have been keeping me in there prayers and well wishes for a speedy recovery!"" The injury was to Newton's transverse process, a small bone that extends from each vertebra in the back. There were no other internal injuries, the team said. ""It's not the kind of injury that affects the spine or the nerves so it's a matter of when the pain settles down enough so he can play,"" said Dr. Kenneth Mautner, a sports medicine specialist at Emory University in Atlanta. He is not involved in Newton's case. The injury is treated similarly to a rib injury. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo had the same injury earlier this season, he said. Romo missed one game. Mautner said doctors will advise rest and recuperation and likely recommend Newton not practice for two days or longer. It can take one to three weeks for a patient to deal with the pain from the fractures, Mautner said. Newton shot to fame in 2010, leading the Auburn Tigers to an undefeated national championship season. He went on to win the Heisman Trophy, given to the best player in college football, and was drafted No. 1 by the Panthers in 2011, making him the first player to accomplish all three feats in the same year. After signing a four-year, $22 million deal with the Panthers in 2011, the Atlanta native showed his prowess as both a passer and a rusher, racking up more than 4,000 yards throwing and more than 700 yards running, snaring Rookie of the Year honors. This year, with both Newton and his team beset by injuries, he has put up less impressive numbers, and the Panthers are 4-8-1 going into this weekend's games. He arguably had his best game of the season Sunday against the division rival New Orleans Saints, throwing three touchdown passes and rushing for another. For that effort, he was named his conference's offensive player of the week. Despite their dismal record, the Panthers are still in the playoff hunt because of the weak competition in the NFC South. They are set to play another division rival, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, on Sunday. Backup quarterback Derek Anderson told reporters Wednesday he'd be starting against the Bucs, but it wouldn't affect how he prepared for Sunday. He's ready for the challenge, he said, and he looks forward to Newton's return. ""Obviously, he's our leader, and last week, the way he played -- I thought he played awesome,"" he said. ""If he could be out there, he'd be out there."" Coach Ron Rivera said Newton wanted to play, but he wasn't sure when Newton would return. ""As we go forward, we'll see how he is next week,"" Rivera said. ""We do not want to expose him in any fashion to any further harm.""","Newton thanks fans for support, says God was protecting him from serious injury during crash .

"Lindsey Vonn's knee troubles apparently are too much to overcome in time for Sochi. Vonn, the reigning Olympic and World Cup downhill skiing champ, will not compete in next month's Winter Olympics, according to a post Tuesday on her official Facebook page. ""I am devastated to announce that I will not be able to compete in Sochi,"" Vonn's post read. The news comes 11 months after she hurt her right knee knee at the world championships. The four-time World Cup overall champion underwent reconstructive surgery but aggravated the problem in a crash during training in November. ""I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL (anterior cruciate ligament), but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level. ""I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February."" Vonn counts the ski resort in the Rocky mountains of Colorado as her home and spent Thanksgiving Day training in Vail. She went on to make a successful return to racing before Christmas but last month the writing was on the wall when she had to pull out of a World Cup event in Val d'Isere, France. The American skier, who is dating golfer Tiger Woods, may have resigned herself to watching the Winter Olympics from the sidelines but the Minnesota athlete is still looking for a silver lining. ""On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold,"" she added. ""Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially Team USA!"" Bill Marolt, president of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, supported Vonn's decision and said in a statement: ""In looking ahead, I have every ounce of confidence that Lindsey will be in the starting gate next World Cup season ready to compete. ""She knows the hard work it takes to get to the top and still has significant goals to achieve in what has been an incredible career. ""While Lindsey won't be in Sochi, we have a strong team that is well prepared to challenge. Now is the time for those athletes to step up towards our best in the world vision.""

"Look up at our nearest neighbor, the moon, and you'll see stark evidence of the dangerous neighborhood we live in. The Man in the Moon was sculpted by large-scale events, including many meteor and asteroid impacts. In 1994, the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 dove into Jupiter. The result was awesome. The impact caused a brilliant flash, visible in Earth telescopes, and left an ugly dark scar on Jupiter's cold, gaseous surface. With the recent fly-by of a 1,000-foot-wide asteroid labeled 99942 Apophis, one of a class of space rocks referred to as ""near-Earth objects"" or ""Earth-grazers,"" scientists have revised their worst estimates of its chances of striking Earth. Current thinking is: We're safe. For the next couple of decades. But this does not mean the danger is over. Far from it. Named after the evil Egyptian serpent god Apophis, lord of chaos and darkness -- and recently dubbed the ""doomsday asteroid"" -- it flies past Earth every seven years. This year, its 1,000-foot bulk approached to within 9 million miles. In 2029, it will swoop in close enough to put some of our orbiting satellites in peril -- 20,000 miles. In that year, no doubt Apophis will arouse even more attention, because it will be visible in the daytime sky. In 2036, it will probably pass by at a reassuring 14 million miles. Yet there's always a possibility we don't have these measurements exactly right. Something could happen at any point in Apophis' orbit to modify its course, just a smidgen. A tiny collision with another object, way out beyond Mars? What could change between now and 2029, or during any orbit thereafter? Apophis masses at more than 20 million tons. If it hit Earth, the impact would unleash a blast the equivalent of over a billion tons of TNT. That's not an extinction event, but it could easily cause billions of deaths and months, if not years, of climate disruption. The potential risk is huge. And Apophis is far from alone. Life in our solar system has always been dangerous. As kids we learn about the Barringer Crater in Arizona, a relatively recent formation -- 50,000 years old -- caused by a rock weighing several times more an aircraft carrier. That impact released the equivalent of 20 megatons of TNT and left a crater 4,000 feet wide. Both Mars and Earth were long ago hit by planet-sized objects, one spinning off our Moon, the other shaping two distinctly different hemispheres on Mars. To this day, a steady rain of meteors falls on Earth -- some of them left-over pebbles and dust from worn-out comets, others from the ""asteroid belt,"" still others from big strikes on the Moon and Mars. Since oceans cover two-thirds of the Earth's surface, it's more likely debris will hit water than land. Scientists believe it was the blast of a 6-mile-wide asteroid off the coast of Mexico some 64 million years ago that changed Earth's weather for years and hastened the departure of the dinosaurs. Ocean hits are worse than land hits, not just because of immense tidal waves, but because of the vast quantities of super-heated water vapor and dust that spread from the impact to shroud the entire Earth. In March 1966, J.E. Enever published his ground-breaking article, ""Giant Meteor Impact,"" in the periodical Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact. Enever surveyed the available material on meteor and asteroid strikes, then published his own calculations and analysis of what such strikes could do, and have done, to the Earth, with cinematically vivid prose and equally terrifying physics. He was the first to put it all together and publish in a respected and widely available forum. Although geology was still reluctant to admit to any form of ""catastrophism,"" eschewing biblical explanations, many read and pondered ... seriously. In the decades since Enever's article, writers, scientists, and engineers have proposed various ways to avert such disasters. Some have suggested we strap rocket motors to a threatening rock and nudge it away. A steady pulse of projectile ""paintballs"" could also do the trick. Others have suggested we use nuclear weapons to ""kick"" an asteroid from its orbit, or even to shatter it into smaller debris -- a rather dim idea that misleads us into believing a single bullet is worse than the blast from a shotgun. Our atmosphere provides little protection against meteors larger than a truck. Moreover, many asteroids are chunky masses of rock and dust loosely held together by very little gravity, like loosely packed peanut clusters. Attempting to attach a rocket to one of these might merely dislodge a few ""peanuts,"" leaving the rest to do the dirty work. Wrap one of these peanut clusters in a giant steel net, then drag it off its deadly course? Intriguing, but for now -- like deploying tractor beams from the starship Enterprise -- it's just so much super-science.","Greg Bear: Asteroid Apophis flew by this month and was much larger than expected .

"(CNN) -- German billionaire Adolf Merckle, one of the richest men in the world, committed suicide Monday after his business empire got into trouble in the wake of the international financial crisis, Merckle's family said Tuesday in a statement. Merckle, 74, was hit by a train in the southwestern town of Ulm, police said. His family said the economic crisis had ""broken"" Merckle. He was number 94 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people. He had fallen from number 44 on the Forbes 2007 rich list as his fortune declined from $12.8 billion to $9.2 billion in 2008. Merckle's business empire included interests as diverse as cement-maker HeidelbergCement and generic drug-maker Ratiopharm. But he lost hundreds of millions of dollars, including company capital, betting against Volkswagen stock last year. The state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg rejected his petition for financial assistance, and he entered bailout talks with several German banks. ""The financial troubles of his companies, induced by the international financial crisis and the uncertainty and powerlessness to act independently which the financial problems brought about, broke the passionate family business man, and he took his own life,"" his family wrote in the news release. An employee of Germany's railroad company found the body on the tracks at about 7 p.m. Monday and notified authorities. Merckle's family had already reported him missing earlier in the day after he walked out of the house and did not return. Authorities are currently conducting DNA tests to confirm his identity. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Germany and Alysen Miller in London, England, contributed to this report.","Adolf Merckle was No. 94 on Forbes list of world's richest people .

"It's been a long old road to recovery for U.S. skiing star Lindsey Vonn. The Olympic gold medal winner and four time overall World Cup champion has been sidelined for much of the last two years after undergoing separate bouts of surgery on a recurring knee injury. A promising returning to action in late 2013 was cut short by a fall in training which meant she missed out on defending her downhill crown at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Now, after knuckling down in the gym and overcoming that bitter disappointment, the 30-year-old Vonn is finally set to return to competitive action. And opening up to CNN, she revealed her secret weapon as she fought to get back to the top of the slopes -- her boyfriend and golf star, Tiger Woods. ""Tiger and I both went through rehab with our injuries at a similar time, so we were both in the gym together and pushing each other and motivating each other, both frustrated,"" Vonn said. ""I think we both helped each other a lot through that time, and I drew a lot of inspiration from him and I think he does the same with me. ""We continue to push each other and it's a really positive relationship in that way."" Woods' own injury problems began after a promising start to 2014. The 14-time major champion regained the World No 1. spot in March but was unable to recapture the form that took him there after undergoing back surgery shortly afterwards. A poor summer meant Woods dropped out of contention for a place in the U.S.'s ill-fated Ryder Cup team. Given his high profile and status within the golfing community, much of the media attention in the run up to the Ryder Cup focused on Woods' absence. Being a star that transcends her own sport in a similar manner, Vonn can empathize as to the added pressure that the unflinching glare of the spotlight can bring. ""For us, we're just two athletes trying to do the best we can in our sports,"" she said. ""There's other stuff that goes along with it for both of us, there's media and stuff like that."" Vonn recently criticized a satirical article published in the Golf Digest magazine that poked fun at Woods. She said she was proud of her boyfriend for taking a stand in criticizing the piece and described much of the reaction surrounding his response as ""completely ridiculous"" in quotes carried by USA Today. Vonn is more laid back discussing media relations today. Although not directly referring to that incident in particular, she said the attention is ""all part of sports and part of being a successful athlete. We both understand that and take it in our stride."" A chipper Vonn even revealed the celebrity pair are intensively competitive with one another. Responding to a question on whether her golf is better than Tiger's skiing, Vonn said that was perhaps too difficult to say. ""It's tricky -- I have a hole in one. But he's a pretty good skier."" ""We're highly competitive. We're competing at every single thing that we can. And unfortunately he holds the record in ping-pong. ""I have only one victory to I don't know how many hundreds he has."" ""He's pretty much better than me at everything, except skiing, so unfortunately he's the winner of the two of us.""","Lindsey Vonn reveals boyfriend Tiger Woods has helped her through injury rehab .

"""Chronicle"" sacked ""The Woman in Black"" at the box office on Super Bowl weekend, but both modestly-budgeted films exceeded industry expectations and brought in strong grosses for their respective studios. Fox's $15 million found footage film ""Chronicle,"" a thriller directed by newcomer Josh Trank about a trio of teenage boys who acquire super powers, soared into first place with $22 million in its first three days. That gave the film a potent $7,568 per theater average -- the best in the Top 20. Awareness for ""Chronicle"" appeared disconcertingly low a few weeks ago, but thanks to an aggressive TV marketing push, a viral video advertisement (""Flying People in New York City""), and, perhaps most notably, the film's zeitgeist-y found footage appeal, the adventure managed to bring young people to the theater in droves. The surprise hit received an average ""B"" CinemaScore grade, with generations divided on the found footage factor: Audiences under 18 gave the movie a ""B+"", while audiences above 50 issued it a ""D+"". Thankfully for Fox, older moviegoers don't make up ""Chronicle's"" target demographic. Despite the average grade, with  reviews so much stronger than most films aimed at teens, and an encouraging 18 percent bump on Saturday (which suggests positive word-of-mouth), ""Chronicle"" might not plummet at the box office the way ""F"" graded ""The Devil Inside"" did a few weeks ago. There's no telling how high ""Chronicle"" will end up flying at the box office just yet, but with its impressive debut frame, the film is already a big hit. While the execs at Fox are clinking their champagne glasses together, the suits over at CBS Films are likely getting ready to throw an all-out party after the the second-place debut of ""The Woman in Black,"" which earned $21 million this weekend and became the young studio's first real hit. The supernatural spookfest, which CBS acquired for just $3 million from British financier Hammer Film Productions, succeeded in capturing young viewers (especially young women) on opening weekend, and Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe, proved his drawing power outside of the Potter franchise -- something the Twilight stars have yet to do. ""The Woman in Black"" earned a lackluster ""B-"" CinemaScore grade, but, like ""Chronicle,"" the film has already proved itself a major success. In third, Liam Neeson's snowy survival entry ""The Grey"" dipped 52 percent to $9.5 million, giving it a ten-day total of $34.8 million. Don't be deceived by the brisk decline. Because of the Super Bowl, which will keep over 100 million Americans in their living rooms and out of theaters, studios are estimating drops in the 70 percent-range on Sunday, which causes most titles to have larger-than-usual weekend drops. ""The Grey"" is doing well. ""Big Miracle,"" Universal's family-friendly option starring Drew Barrymore as a woman attempting to save three whales locked inside Alaskan ice, swam away with a rather chilly $8.5 million in its first three days. The film, made for just under $40 million, couldn't capture the same size audience as fellow aquatic mammal offering, ""Dolphin Tale,"" which started with $19.2 million on its way to a $72.3 million total last September. With an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade and strong playability among families, ""Big Miracle"" may hold well in the weeks to come. As it stands now, though, this whale tale looks dead in the water. ""Underworld Awakening"" rounded out the Top 5, dipping 55 percent to $5.6 million. The $70 million 3D vampire action film has amassed $54.4 million after three weekends, making it the second-highest grossing film of 2012. What's ahead of it? Kate Beckinsale's other action vehicle, ""Contraband,"" which has earned $61.2 million. Not a bad way to the start year! A few milestones were achieved by Oscar contenders this weekend, too. ""The Descendants'"" $4.6 million frame helped it scoot right past $65 million in its 12th week. Best Picture favorite ""The Artist"" dropped 22 percent to $2.6 million in its 11th week, breaking the $20 million plateau in the process. ""Hugo"" fell by only 8 percent (the smallest drop in the Top 20) in its 11th week to $2.3 million, lifting its total out of the $50 million-range up to $62 million. (It's rumored to have cost over twice that amount.) And ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" came this close to a key milestone, but for now, it will have to settle for a $99.9 million total. 1.

"A Nepalese man who stands no taller than a newborn has been declared the world's shortest man in history. Chandra Bahadur Dangi, who says he's 72, earned the title with a height of 54.6 centimeters (21.5 inches), Guinness World Records announced Sunday. Guinness editor-in-chief Craig Glenday traveled to the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, where he oversaw the official measurements of Chandra at medical clinic. The Guinness World Record guidelines required three measurements of Chandra's height taken over 24 hours, which included his length standing and lying flat. Chandra is more than an inch shorter than the current holder of the ""shortest man living"" title, Filipino Jurney Balawing, who is 59.9 centimeters, or just under 2 feet.  Balawing was awarded the title in June when he turned 18. Guiness has also awarded Chandra the title of ""shortest man ever.""  The previous record holder was Gul Mohammed of India, who measured 57 centimeters.  He died at age 40 in 1997. In contrast, Sultan Kosen from Turkey, who was awarded the 'tallest living man' in February 2011, is 2.5 meters, or 8-foot-3. According to Guinness, Chandra lives in Rhimkholi, an isolated mountain village some 400 kilometers west of Kathmandu. A forest contractor who was cutting timber in Rhimkholi brought Chandra's height to the attention of local media, Guinness said on its website. Chandra has five brothers and two sisters, according to Guinness.  He is a weaver by trade, but also cares for his family and helps look after the village's buffaloes and cows. ""I'm very happy that I'm being recognized by Guinness World Records and that my name will be written in book,"" Chandra said after he was awarded the two Guinness certificates.  ""It's a big thing for my family, my village and my country.  I am very happy."" According to Guinness, Chandra claims weigh 14.5 kilogram, or 32 pounds. Despite his age, he claims to have never taken any kind of medication or to have ever been examined by a doctor, according to Guinness. ""I'm continually amazed that this record keeps getting broken,"" Glenday said. ""Just when you think it's impossible for the record to get any smaller, Mr. Chandra comes along and astonishes us all by being the shortest person ever measured. What I find equally remarkable is his age -- if he really is 72, he is by far the oldest person to be awarded the shortest-man record in Guinness World Record's 57-year history."" According to Guinness, Chandra said he will use the experience to make his country ""proud.""  Chandra and his family plan to start a charity that will support him and his village. The world's shortest living woman is currently 18-year-old Jyoti Amge from India at 62.8 centimeters, or just a little over 2 feet.","Chandra Bahadur Dangi is no taller than a typical infant .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A man identified as an Iraqi journalist threw shoes at -- but missed -- President Bush during a news conference Sunday evening in Baghdad, where Bush was making a farewell visit. President Bush, left, ducks a thrown shoe as Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki tries to protect him Sunday. Bush ducked, and the shoes, flung one at a time, sailed past his head during the news conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in his palace in the heavily fortified Green Zone. The shoe-thrower -- identified as Muntadhar al-Zaidi, an Iraqi journalist with Egypt-based al-Baghdadia television network -- could be heard yelling in Arabic: ""This is a farewell ... you dog!"" While pinned on the ground by security personnel, he screamed: ""You killed the Iraqis!"" Al-Zaidi was dragged away. While al-Zaidi was still screaming in another room, Bush said: ""That was a size 10 shoe he threw at me, you may want to know.""  Watch Bush duck the shoes » . Hurling shoes at someone, or sitting so that the bottom of a shoe faces another person, is considered an insult among Muslims. Al-Baghdadia issued a statement Sunday demanding al-Zaidi's release. Al-Zaidi remained in custody Monday while the Iraqi judiciary decides whether he will face charges of assaulting al-Maliki, a government official said. The official said al-Zaidi is being tested for alcohol and drugs to determine if he was fully conscious during the incident. Al-Zaidi drew international attention in November 2007 when he was kidnapped while on his way to work in central Baghdad. He was released three days later. Bush had been lauding the conclusion of a security pact with Iraq as journalists looked on. ""So what if the guy threw his shoe at me?"" Bush told a reporter in response to a question about the incident. ""Let me talk about the guy throwing his shoe. It's one way to gain attention. It's like going to a political rally and having people yell at you. It's like driving down the street and having people not gesturing with all five fingers. ... ""These journalists here were very apologetic. They ... said this doesn't represent the Iraqi people, but that's what happens in free societies where people try to draw attention to themselves."" Bush then directed his comments to the security pact, which he and al-Maliki were preparing to sign, hailing it as ""a major achievement"" but cautioning that ""there is more work to be done."" ""All this basically says is we made good progress, and we will continue to work together to achieve peace,"" Bush said. Bush's trip was to celebrate the conclusion of the security pact, called the Strategic Framework Agreement and the Status of Forces Agreement, the White House said. The pact will replace a U.N. mandate for the U.S. presence in Iraq that expires at the end of this year. The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. The date for all U.S. troops to leave Iraq is December 31, 2011. Bush called the passage of the pact ""a way forward to help the Iraqi people realize the blessings of a free society."" Bush said the work ""hasn't been easy, but it has been necessary for American security, Iraqi hope and world peace."" Bush landed at Baghdad International Airport on Sunday and traveled by helicopter to meet with President Jalal Talabani and his two vice presidents at Talabani's palace outside the Green Zone. It marked the first time he has been outside the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad without being on a military base. The visit was Bush's fourth since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Afterward, Talabani praised his U.S. counterpart as a ""great friend for the Iraqi people"" and the man ""who helped us to liberate our country and to reach this day, which we have democracy, human rights, and prosperity gradually in our country."" Talabani said he and Bush, who is slated to leave office next month, had spoken ""very frankly and friendly"" and expressed the hope that the two would remain friends even ""back in Texas."" For his part, Bush said he had come to admire Talabani and his vice presidents ""for their courage and for their determination to succeed."" As the U.S. and Iraqi national anthems played and Iraqi troops looked on, he and the Iraqi president walked along a red carpet.  Watch President Bush and Iraq's president walk the red carpet » . Bush left Iraq on Sunday night and arrived Monday morning in Afghanistan, where he will met with President Hamid Karzai and speak with U.S. troops. In remarks to reporters, National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley, who traveled with Bush, described the situation in Iraq as ""in a transition."" ""For the first time in Iraq's history and really the first time in the region, you have Sunni, Shia and Kurds working together in a democratic framework to chart a way forward for their country,"" he said. On Monday, new violence in Iraq showed that work remains to be done. A suicide car bomb attack killed at least three people and wounded 31 others west of Baghdad on Monday, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. The noontime bombing targeted civilians on a road between Khan Dhari and Abu Ghraib, according to the official. Also, the U.S. military said three militants were killed and 13 others were detained in operations targeting al Qaeda in Iraq on Sunday and Monday. The incidents took place in Baiji, Tall Sumayyir, Tikrit, near the towns of Abu Ghraib, Mahmoudiya and Kirkuk. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Octavia Nasr contributed to this report.","Shoe-thrower identified as journalist with al-Baghdadia television network .

"It looks like Google Glass was just the beginning. Google now appears to be aiming a few inches lower, working on a temporary electronic tattoo that would stick to the user's throat. Google-owned Motorola Mobility has filed for a patent, published last week, for a system ""that comprises an electronic skin tattoo capable of being applied to a throat region of a body."" The patent says the tattoo would communicate with smartphones, gaming devices, tablets and wearable tech like Google Glass via a Bluetooth-style connection and would include a microphone and power source. The idea is that wearers could communicate with their devices via voice commands without having to wear an earpiece or the the Glass headset. And how's this for future tech? It could even be used as a lie detector. ""Optionally, the electronic skin tattoo can further include a galvanic skin response detector to detect skin resistance of a user,"" the 10-page document reads. ""It is contemplated that a user that may be nervous or engaging in speaking falsehoods may exhibit different galvanic skin response than a more confident, truth telling individual."" ""Galvanic"" is a reference to the way some surfaces, even skin, conduct electricity. Google explains mystery barge . In images attached to the filing, the tattoo appears to be between a postage stamp and a Band-Aid in size. The filing says that in addition to sticking via an adhesive to the throat, the tattoo could go on a collar or a band around the user's neck. Other possible uses include making both incoming and outgoing audio clearer. That could mean anything from making smartphone conversations clearer in a crowded room to being able to listen to music without earphones. And we can't quite figure out the use case for this one, but: ""the electronic tattoo can also be applied to an animal as well."" Digital tattoos and mind-reading headphones . With Google Glass, the company has moved to be at the forefront of the rapidly emerging trend in wearable tech. Glass is a wearable computer with a smartphone-like display that lets users text, browse the Web, take photos and run other apps, all hands free. The latest version rolling out to field testers includes an ear bud, in response to complaints from some that the first version's bone-conduction sound system didn't work well. It's not hard to envision the throat tattoo as an eventual answer to that complaint. Other wearable tech either on the market or the horizon includes smartwatches from Samsung and Sony, with Google, Apple and Microsoft expected to join the fray soon. A Motorola spokesman said the company has no comment about the patent filing at this time.

"Japanese officials have distanced themselves from comments made by a prominent nationalist politician that suggested women forced to become prostitutes to entertain Japanese troops during World War II were ""necessary."" Toru Hashimoto, who serves as the Mayor of Osaka, told reporters at his weekly press conference Monday that ""anyone would understand"" the role of ""comfort women"" when soldiers were risking their lives and you wanted to give them ""a rest."" Though he acknowledged the issue was a ""tragic result of war,"" Hashimoto, who is co-leader of the nationalist Japan Restoration Party, insisted the use of prostitutes by soldiers was not unique to Japan. Bizarrely, Hashimoto also revealed that he told a U.S. military commander during a trip to a base on the island of Okinawa that the adult entertainment business in Japan should be ""utilized more"" by U.S. personnel. ""I told him there are places that operate within the boundaries of the law which can be used for releasing sexual frustration, so they [the U.S. military] should fully utilize it or the marines won't be able to control their aggressive sexual desires."" He said the officer refused to discuss the suggestion. Reaction at home . Hashimoto's comments also found little support among political colleagues at home. ""A series of remarks by Japanese politicians related to our interpretation of [wartime] history have been misunderstood,"" Education Minister Hakubun Shimomura told reporters at his weekly press conference Tuesday. ""In that sense Mr. Hashimoto's remarks came at a bad time. [But] I wonder if there is any positive meaning to intentionally make such remarks at this particular moment? As for the remarks about adult entertainment, I could not believe that it came from a man representing a political party."" Fellow minister Tomomi Inada asked: ""I wonder is this something the representative of a political party should say? I myself think the comfort women [issue] infringed the human rights of the women."" Chief Cabinet Spokesman Yoshihide Suga did not respond directly to Hashimoto's comments but instead told reporters ""the stance of the Japanese government on the comfort women issue is, as it has been stated repeatedly in the past, that they suffered unspeakably painful experiences and we keenly feel the pain when we think about them."" Sex slaves . Many of the 200,000 women whom historians estimate were forced to become sex slaves for Japan's former Imperial Army were from the Philippines, China and the Korean peninsula -- all occupied territories at the time. While many have now died, a group of Korean survivors has spent years protesting outside the Japanese embassy in Seoul. They demand greater recognition of their suffering, as well as individual compensation. Tokyo maintains its legal liability for wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral treaty signed in 1965 with South Korea. For its part, the Seoul government expressed ""deep disappointment"" over Hashimoto's comments. ""There is worldwide recognition... that the issue of comfort women amounts to a wartime rape committed by Japan during its past imperial period in a serious breach of human rights,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told Agence France-Presse Tuesday. ""Our government again urges Japan's prominent officials to show regret for atrocities committed during Japan's imperial period and to correct their anachronistic way of thinking and comments."" In 1993, the Japanese government released a statement acknowledging the ""immeasurable pain and suffering"" endured by thousands of women forced to have sex during World War II. It even vowed to include the comfort women issue in new junior high school textbooks for the first time. But Japan's wartime past continues to loom over its relations with key Asian neighbors such as South Korea and China, which are currently strained by territorial disputes in the region.","Toru Hashimoto: ""Anyone would understand"" the role of ""comfort women""

"Women detained at an immigrant holding facility in southern Texas allege workers there have sexually abused them, including by removing them from their cells at night for sex as well as fondling them in front of others, lawyers wrote in a letter to federal officials this week. Some guards or other workers at the Karnes County Residential Center also asked sexual favors of female detainees in exchange for money or promises of assistance -- including help with their immigration cases or shelter if they are released -- the lawyers allege in the letter. The allegations were detailed in a Tuesday letter from several immigrant advocacy groups to officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, which had hired one of America's for-profit prison operators to run the facility. ""We call for an immediate investigation into these serious allegations of sexual abuse and the immediate protection of all women and children forced to reside in the facility,"" the letter, sent by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) on behalf of all the advocacy groups, reads. Company denies claims, says center is 'family-friendly' Geo Group Inc., the company that runs the facility, told CNN it strongly refutes the allegations. ""The Karnes County Residential Center provides a safe, clean, and family-friendly environment for mothers and children awaiting required processing by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency,"" the Geo Group's vice president of corporate relations, Pablo Paez, said. ""The center provides high quality care, and our company strongly denies any allegations to the contrary."" ICE told CNN it couldn't discuss specifics about this case. But it said it ""has a zero-tolerance policy for all forms of sexual abuse or assault and our facilities are maintained in accordance with applicable laws and policies."" ""Accusations of alleged unlawful conduct are investigated thoroughly and if substantiated, appropriate action is taken,"" the agency said in a written statement. The center is one of many in the country that hold undocumented immigrants -- many apprehended as they crossed into the United States -- as they await hearings on whether they will be deported. ICE detained 440,557 people across the nation in fiscal 2013. The Karnes County facility can hold up to 532 detainees, and transitioned this summer from a center that housed adults to one that holds adults and children. The sexual abuse is alleged to have happened since August, the lawyers' letter says. Wall Street bets on prison growth from border crisis . ""Numerous"" women made the allegations to lawyers representing them, and at least three center employees committed the abuse, the letter said. The letter came five days after one of the advocacy groups made other allegations about the center's treatment of women and children. In a September 25 letter, the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law asked federal immigration officials to investigate numerous complaints from detainees, including that children didn't have access to a variety of nutritious snacks between meals, that messages from attorneys weren't getting to their clients in a timely manner, and that -- although they had access to a nurse -- no doctor was on staff to handle significant medical issues such as respiratory infections and chronic illnesses. Geo Group said it refutes those allegations, as well, and that ICE personnel are at the site to ensure compliance with the agency's family residential standards. Immigrants or refugees? A difference with political consequences . 'Removing female detainees from their cells' for sex . MALDEF's letter from Tuesday accuses facility workers of ""removing female detainees from their cells late in the evening and during early morning hours for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts in various parts of the facility."" Also, workers called detainees ""their 'novias,' or 'girlfriends,' "" and requested ""sexual favors from female detainees in exchange for money, promises of assistance with their pending immigration cases, and shelter when and if the women are released,"" the advocates alleged. Workers also kissed, fondled and groped detainees in front of other detainees, including children, the advocates alleged. The women reported the allegations to center personnel, but ""to date, no action has been taken to stop or prevent this abuse,"" the letter reads. The advocates further argue that the center ""provides an environment that facilitates the abuse,"" in part by having a guard roster that is predominantly male, and by allowing the guards 24-hour access to the detainees' rooms. The letter warns the alleged harassment and ""unsafe environment"" likely violates several federal laws and regulations, and asks for a response detailing what ICE and the center will do to address the matter.","Facility staff removed female detainees from their rooms for sex at night, lawyers allege .

"Earthquake experts worldwide expressed shock at the manslaughter convictions of six Italian scientists who failed to predict the deadly L'Aquila quake, warning that the decision could severely harm future research. Two scientists resigned their posts with the government's disaster preparedness agency Tuesday after a court in L'Aquila sentenced six scientists and a government official to six years in prison. The court ruled Monday that the scientists failed to accurately communicate the risk of the 2009 quake, which killed more than 300 people. Luciano Maiani, the physicist who led the National Commission for the Prediction and Prevention of Major Risks, resigned in protest of the verdict Tuesday afternoon, Italy's Civil Protection Agency announced. ""The situation created by the sentencing yesterday on the facts from L'Aquila is incompatible with a clear and effective performance of the functions of the commission and its role as a consulting bodies for the state,"" Maiani said in a statement released by the agency. In addition, Mauro Dolce quit as director of the office that monitors volcano and earthquake threats, the agency said. Dolce will be given another post, it said. Seismologists were aghast at the court's decision, noting that earthquakes remain impossible to forecast with any kind of accuracy. ""To predict a large quake on the basis of a relatively commonplace sequence of small earthquakes and to advise the local population to flee"" would constitute ""both bad science and bad public policy,"" said David Oglesby, an associate professor in the Earth sciences faculty of the University of California, Riverside. ""If scientists can be held personally and legally responsible for situations where predictions don't pan out, then it will be very hard to find scientists to stick their necks out in the future,"" Oglesby said in a statement. Prosecutors argued that the scientists gave ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers"" facing L'Aquila at a meeting a week before the magnitude-6.3 quake. The experts determined that it was ""unlikely"" but not impossible that a major quake would take place, despite concern among the city's residents over recent seismic activity. The court agreed, finding the six scientists from the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology and a member of the Civil Protection Agency guilty and ordering Italian authorities to pay 7.8 million euros ($10 million) in damages. ""It's chilling that people can be jailed for giving a scientific opinion in the line of their work,"" Roger Musson, the head of seismic hazard and archives at the British Geological Survey, wrote in a comment published on the organization's Twitter feed. Comments from one of the defendants -- Enzo Boschi, former president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology -- suggested that the scientists were shell-shocked by their conviction. ""I'm dejected, despairing. I still don't understand what I'm accused of,"" Boschi said after the ruling, according to ANSA, Italy's official news agency. Boschi and the six others convicted Monday will remain free during the appeal process. The Italian geophysics institute expressed ""regret and concern"" about the verdict in a statement Monday. It said the ruling ""threatens to undermine one of the cornerstones of scientific research: that of freedom of investigation, of open and transparent discussion and sharing of results."" Some experts have argued that the issue was a failure of communications, not calculations. Domenico Giardini, who held Boschi's old job at the institute for several months, said last year that the trial was about ""the number of weak points in the communication chain."" ""We all have to work on new, and more clear, protocols, on the transfer of information,"" said Giardini, who now conducts research in Switzerland. Survivors of the 2009 quake, some of whom who lost relatives or property in the disaster, have voiced anger at the officials who downplayed the risks despite the worries expressed by residents. ""I can understand the grief of people who lost loved ones and the frustration that people feel when terrible events happen, especially ones outside their control,"" Oglesby said. ""Convicting honest scientists of manslaughter does nothing to help this situation and may well put a chill on exactly the kind of science that could save lives in the future."" The ruling may well change the way experts disclose their opinions, according to David Spiegelhalter, a professor specializing in the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University in Britain. ""L'Aquila trial shows public scientists need to take media communication very seriously,"" he wrote on his Twitter account. ""And get indemnity.""","Italian scientists quit government posts over L'Aquila convictions .

"Washington (CNN)Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told an audience at the University of Chicago on Thursday that he has been ""seriously considering"" a running for president, and suggested his decision on whether he'll jump in to the race will come this spring. ""Right now, my primary responsibility is to move my family back to Baltimore, which I will do in another week,"" said O'Malley, whose term ends this month. ""So I'm going to be taking some time over the next couple of months to get my family situated."" He added, ""I've been very encouraged as I travel around the country by a number of people who repeat again and again and again their desire for getting things done again as a country and also for new leadership to get those things done."" If the phrase ""seriously considering"" sounds familiar, that's because it is. O'Malley has been ""seriously considering"" running for president since early 2014. He told the LA Times after a speech in Iowa in July 2014 that he was ""seriously considering"" a bid. He told Fusion in August 2104 that he was ""seriously considering a run in 2016"" and he told CNN in February 2014 that he was preparing the ""ground work necessary to offer a better direction for our country."" The two-term governor from Maryland has long been ""considering"" a run for president, but his polling numbers have not responded to his planning. In a December 2014 CNN/ORC International poll, O'Malley garnered only 1% support, putting him 65% behind frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Voters rejected O'Malley's Maryland Democratic Party at the ballot box in 2014 when the governor's handpicked successor, Anthony Brown, lost the governor's race to Republican Larry Hogan. ""I can tell you my feelings were hurt,"" O'Malley said about the loss. ""We had done a lot of really good things in Maryland and in the end you did not hear much about it during the campaign."" He added, though, ""I was not on the ballot.""","He told an audience in Chicago on Thursday that he was 'seriously considering' a presidential bid .

"Suicide continues to plague the American military, with an estimated 18 war veterans in the United States ending their lives each day. One of the last resorts for veterans struggling with the return to civilian life is a suicide-prevention hot line based in upstate New York. The humble offices of the Veterans Crisis Line in Canandaigua, New York, are like any other office space:  desks, computers, telephones.  But as you walk past each cubicle, you begin to hear extraordinarily disturbing conversations. ""I have a .45 pointed at my head,"" one caller says. ""Can you put that knife away for a bit while we talk? Can you do that for me? Can you hold off just for a little bit?"" a hot line worker asks. ""What sort of weapons do you have?"" another calmly responds. The men and women who answer the Veterans Crisis Line phones are on the front lines of an all-out war on suicide.   Each speaks to the caller with a very clear purpose:  keep the person on the phone long enough to get help. ""The first thing I say to a caller when they do have the object that they plan on killing themselves with them on their person, whether it's a loaded gun on their lap or the rope already strung, I always say to them, 'Can you agree to not shoot yourself, take your pills, get up on the ladder while we're on the phone?' "" explained Maureen McHenry, a crisis line responder. The responders are part investigator, part therapist and part best friend. ""We never ever give up on a rescue.  Whenever a vet needs help, we will do whatever it takes to find him if he can't tell us where he is.  Whatever it takes to get them help,"" said Rob Griffo, a health tech at the Veterans Crisis Line. In 2011, the U.S. Army recorded 246 cases of confirmed or potential suicides among active-duty and reserve soldiers, according to statistics released in November. That number appears to be below the 2010 level of 305 for the full 12 months but above the second-highest year: 2009, which had 242 suicides. The U.S. Marines have recorded 28 confirmed suicides and 163 attempted suicides this year through October. Current numbers were not available for the U.S. Navy, Air Force and National Guard. Those three branches reported suicides among service members in 2010 to be 39, 100 and 112, respectively. The numbers illustrate a small segment of the continuing emotional and physical toll of 10 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq and how it defies a host of efforts by the government to detect and solve the problem of suicide. The Veterans Administration launched the Veterans Crisis Line in 2007, and close to 20,000 veterans have been rescued, officials say. ""We've taken over half a million calls, and 30,000 chats have come into the system,"" said Janet Kemp, the national director of the Veterans Crisis Line. In addition to calling the hot line at 1-800-273-8255, veterans who are thinking about taking their own lives can chat with a responder at www.veteranscrisisline.net. Veterans can also reach out for help by sending a text to 838255. And it's not just about the veterans.  Active-duty soldiers also call in. ""We have had several thousand active-duty people who have called, but we suspect many more, because it's anonymous.  We think that there are many more active-duty people who call and use our services,"" Kemp said. Families and friends can call in to the hot line as well.  Kemp says she encourages those who know a veteran who may be struggling with depression to reach out to the crisis line. She says some of the warning signs that someone is contemplating suicide include ""talking about death more often, starting to give away their possessions, saying things (like 'I) probably won't be around by Christmas. I won't need to know that next year.' "" ""If you hear those and know that they're depressed or trouble with work or families, certainly give us a call,"" Kemp said. While the responders handle the incoming calls to the hot line, health techs alert police departments and ambulances across the country to get help to veterans trying to take their own lives. During a recent visit to the Veterans Crisis Line office,  one veteran told responder Valerie Beaman that he planned to kill himself with a large knife to end what he called pain issues. ""When she talked to him further, he said that had taken all of his medication,"" said Melissa Morellaro, a crisis line health tech. Beaman spent 45 minutes on the phone with the caller, trying to figure out exactly where the man was and then getting help to his front door.  At one point, the veteran was so confused that he didn't know his address, presumably because of all the pills he had taken. ""Where's your wife now?  She's at work? Can I send somebody to help you? OK,  I think that's what I'm going to do.  I think you want help.  You called the hot line.  And that's the best thing,""  Beaman told the veteran. When police arrived, there was problem. ""I could hear the struggle, but I don't think they knew I was there.  They did say he's safe, and the officers were safe,"" Beaman said. The responders are flying blind most of the time.  They ultimately have no idea what is happening on the other end of the phone.  The anxiety is excruciating. A short time later, a Korean War veteran called the hot line, saying he was ready to end his life. ""So you said as soon as we get off the phone, you're going to take some pills?  Is that all you plan on doing?"" McHenry asked. The veteran told McHenry his wife died this year. ""He had been married for 20 years. ... He called simply to give me a message to give to his family about funeral arrangements and that he wanted to be buried with a photograph of her,"" McHenry said. She began to ask simple questions to deduce a location.  In just a few minutes, she knew his race, his age, what he was wearing and that he was at a pay phone on the Staten Island Ferry dock. In less than 15 minutes, police arrived to help. At least one life was saved that night.","The Veterans Crisis Line was launched in 2007 .

"(CNN)Poker players like to read another player's tell. That's the thing an opponent does that gives away the quality of cards he is holding. Well, you can't read Cepheus, and you can't beat it. You wanna take on the card king? Have at it. You may win a few hands, but in the end, you better know when to walk away. Cepheus has already played millions of hands of heads-up limit Texas hold 'em, a poker game between two players involving two held cards and three shared. That would take a lifetime or two for you or me, but Cepheus is a computer program, set up by researchers at the University of Alberta. Michael Bowling's team taught Cepheus by having it play itself, and the program learned from its mistakes, according to the team's website. ""With each hand it improved its play, refining itself closer and closer to the perfect solution,"" the website says. All it took was 4,000 computers doing the math on 6 billion hands every second for several months. And voila, game solved. ""We define a game to be essentially solved if a lifetime of play is unable to statistically differentiate it from being solved at 95% confidence,"" Bowling said in a news release announcing the findings, which were published in the journal Science. ""Imagine someone playing 200 hands of poker an hour for 12 hours a day without missing a day for 70 years. Furthermore imagine them employing the worst-case, maximally exploitative opponent strategy, and never making a mistake."" In other words, Cepheus, over the long run, will always win, at least against humans. The researchers say it's a breakthrough in artificial intelligence and game theory, which can  have applications in other areas. Programmers potentially could use it in computer systems for airport security checkpoints or Coast Guard patrols. ""With real-life decision-making settings almost always involving uncertainty and missing information, algorithmic advances, such as those needed to solve poker, are needed to drive future applications,"" the news release said. CNN's Chandler Friedman and Matthew Mochow contributed to this report.","Cepheus has already played millions of hands of hold 'em poker .

"(CNN)In a rare reference to the sexual assault allegations against him, Bill Cosby told a woman attending his comedy show that, ""you have to be careful about drinking around me."" The comment came during an otherwise lighthearted moment in his standup show Thursday night in London, Ontario, as a woman near the front row got up to go get a drink and Cosby asked her where she was going. The remark is likely to anger his accusers who have demanded he respond to the allegations of sexual abuse against him. Minutes after that incident a heckler was ejected from the performance by police after yelling 'Bill Cosby you're a rapist'. During the incident Cosby did not confront the man and encouraged the audience to remain calm and patient. He resumed his comedy show within a few minutes. In a statement released through his public relations firm Cosby says, ""One outburst but over 2600 loyal, patient and courageous fans enjoyed the most wonderful medicine that exist for human-kind. Laughter. I thank you, the theatre staff (Budweiser Gardens), the event organizers and the London, ON Community for your continued honor and support. I'm Far From Finished."" More than a hundred protesters gathered outside the performance, some shouting ""shame"" and ""Bill Cosby is a rapist."" 2 more women join defamation lawsuit against Cosby . Protesters sound off . Milena LeDuc was one of the protesters, braving frigid temperatures and asking ticket holders to abandon the show. ""Why would you want to pay to see a rapist?"" she said. ""These are very serious allegations, and I think he's not taking them seriously and in this day and age these need to be taken seriously,"" added protestor Dan Hilton, who said he was once a Cosby fan and considers him a comedy pioneer. Inside the venue, which was about half full, large pictures of Cosby with Nelson Mandela framed the stage. He was warmly greeted and received his second standing ovation in as many nights. Bruce Maslen called the performance awesome and said the protestors and hecklers didn't spoil a thing. ""I don't believe he's been charged with anything and at least in this country you're innocent until proven guilty,"" said Maslen. ""Alternative event"" held . No charges have been filed against Cosby, and his attorneys have vehemently denied the allegations of sexual assault against him made by several women. Thursday night's performance was the second of three scheduled Canadian performances for Cosby. About a dozen protestors showed up outside of Wednesday night's show in Kitchener, Ontario, but there were no disruptions during the performance. Hundreds turned out for a so-called ""alternative event"" to support and raise money for victims of sexual assault. Sue Gillespie was one of those who attended the ""Voices Carry""event on Wednesday night.  She says the controversy over the allegations against Cosby is an opportunity for communities to help sexual assault victims. ""I think it's a good opportunity for the community to do something positive. They felt a need to respond and this was a good way to do it. This was a peaceful alternative,"" said Gillespie, who runs a community-based mental health charity and advocates for victims of sexual abuse. Phylicia Rashad says she was misquoted .","Bill Cosby makes drinking comment to woman during his London, Ontario, show .

"Valdosta, Georgia (CNN)In a rare order Thursday, all seven judges in Georgia's Southern Judicial Circuit have recused themselves from the lawsuit filed by the parents of Kendrick Johnson against the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office and a second action, filed by CNN against Lowndes County Schools. The recusals come less than a week before the two-year anniversary of the discovery of Johnson's body in the center of a rolled gym mat in the old gym at Lowndes High School on January 11, 2013. Johnson's parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, said they never believed investigators' conclusion that their 17-year-old son died while struggling to reach for a shoe at the center of the mat.  They believe their son was murdered. Months after an autopsy conducted by the state medical examiner supported the local investigators' conclusion, Johnson's parents hired a pathologist, who said he found evidence of unexplained, nonaccidental blunt force trauma to Johnson's neck. In June 2013, attorneys representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson sued the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office to get access to the department's full investigative file and a copy of school surveillance video recorded around the time Johnson disappeared.  According to the lawsuit, the department's refusal to release the file was a violation of Georgia's Open Records Law. Chief Judge Harry Jay Altman II ordered the department to release the files and video several days after CNN joined the suit in October 2013. In November 2014, CNN filed a lawsuit against Lowndes County Schools to get access to clones of hard drives containing the original recordings of surveillance video given to sheriff's investigators.  The lawsuit also claims the recordings are public record and the school's refusal to release them constitutes a violation of the state's Open Records Law. The dispute has not yet been resolved. ""Given the fact that officials with whom the judges in the circuit deal with everyday are involved, it is not fair to the parties for any judge in this circuit to rule on contested matters of importance to the parties and the community,"" Altman wrote in a letter addressed to attorneys representing all parties. Only five of the seven judges in Georgia's Southern Judicial Circuit hear cases regularly.  Two senior judges hear cases only after special assignment. ""His decision cuts to the very heart of this matter, especially for this family.  That is: Can they get fair and impartial people to look at what happened to this child and render a fair decision so they can have peace at night?"" said Johnson's attorney, Benjamin Crump. Altman had mediated requests for records in the case for more than 18 months before Thursday's recusal. ""While I had hoped that at least the preliminary matters would be dealt with through informal mediation, I do not see that happening,"" Altman wrote. ""The normal process for case assignment after judicial recusal will result in another judge being assigned to the case following which a hearing will be scheduled to decide the matters now before the Court,"" the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office's attorney Jim Elliott told CNN in a written statement. An attorney representing Lowndes County Schools did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. ""Georgia is a big state.  I think Atlanta is one of the major cities in America and I'm sure there are a lot of judges for them to choose from, not only in Atlanta but throughout the state of Georgia.  The hope is that you will find a judge who is as fair and impartial,"" Crump said. CNN's Johnita Due and Devon M. Sayers contributed to this report.","Parents, CNN have filed suits over investigation in Lowndes County, Georgia .

"Washington (CNN)When Democratic senators arrived for their policy lunch this week, several came off the elevators in the Capitol and turned instinctively towards the Mansfield Room, a large and elegant meeting space just off the Senate floor. It was only after walking in on a roomful of lunching Republican senators that the Democrats, to their chagrin, realized that when they lost the majority, they also lost many of the perks of power -- including use of the spacious room that's hosted Democratic caucuses for the last eight years. ""I'm going to the wrong caucus,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said with an embarrassed smile as he turned to find the LBJ Room, an equally ornate but tighter room where the smaller 46-member Democratic caucus will now meet. ""Oh, I forgot we were in this room,"" grumbled Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, as he walked into LBJ. The room assignment is just one example of how life will be different for Democrats after a long eight years in the majority -- so long, in fact, that most current Democratic senators have never served in the minority. Gone are coveted committee chairmanships and the enormous influence over legislation, oversight hearings and investigations that go with them.  Gone too are committee slots for Democrats, as Republicans beef up GOP control of the committees that will vote to cuts taxes, slash spending, ditch government regulations, and approve other measures that many Democrats oppose. The long weekends Democrats regularly scheduled by taking most Fridays off are also a thing of the past.  To boost the Senate's woeful productivity, GOP leaders are vowing to work five days a week. OPINION: McConnell: How Congress, President Obama can get things done . For Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who during the last Congress served as president pro tempore of the Senate (the most senior senator from the majority party), the change means he's no longer third in line to the presidency as called for in the Constitution.  That change also means he loses the U.S. Capitol Police detail that was assigned drive him and be with him at all times -- arguably a tough perk to give up.   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, now has that privilege. ""It's tough.  I guarantee it's tough,"" said Sen. John McCain, with a wry smile when asked how the Democrats will cope getting used to the minority.  McCain, who has seen the control of the chamber change several times over his three decades in the Senate, said the hardest part may be that ""you're used to setting the agenda"" and ""you're used to reporting out your own legislation."" Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, who last year chaired the influential Budget Committee, agreed that ""not setting the agenda"" will be the most frustrating part of not being in the majority. ""But I've been in the minority before and it's a great opportunity to outline and fight for the things you care about."" Democrats recognize they will draw much of their power and relevance over the next two years because there is a Democrat is in the White House who can veto GOP legislation and they can vote to uphold those vetoes. ""Ultimately, when we veer towards the most partisan issues, the White House becomes a major player,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat.  ""And the President's veto pen becomes a major element and 34 Democratic senators become decisive,"" he said, referring to the number of Democrats needed to prevent Republicans from overriding a presidential veto. One thing that doesn't change with the switch is the location of McConnell's suite of offices and the suite occupied by the now Minority Leader Harry Reid. Both suites are very large and have gorgeous views down the Mall to the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial.  Years ago, the parties decided they wouldn't go through the labor and expense of moving the leaders' offices whenever the majority changed. McConnell may regret that now.  While Reid's office is sequestered in a back hallway, largely off limits to the press, McConnell's office sits in a more public area in the center of the building. That means whenever he leaves his office he will run into the gauntlet of reporters who pester him regularly.  While McConnell was in the minority, he was disciplined and tight-lipped, rarely giving a usable quote.  But the pressure on him to answer questions is sure to increase now that he's running the Senate and reporters will be hanging on his every word.","Most Senate Democrats have never been in the minority .
New status in Senate will require adjustment for many Democrats ."
"(CNN)Fifty-one minutes is all the time Katie Kropas had to prepare for what most expectant mothers spend nine months planning for: motherhood. ""I found out at 10:15 and I had her at 11:06,"" Kropas told CNN affiliate WBZ. The Massachusetts woman said she woke up Tuesday morning with lower back pain so severe, she was rushed to a hospital in Weymouth, south of Boston. ""They told me that I had a full-term baby, ready to come now,"" she said. Less than a hour later, Kropas gave birth to her 10 pound, 2 ounce daughter Ellie. Kropas said the obvious pregnancy symptoms just weren't there. Her mom Karen Kropas agreed, telling WBZ, ""I couldn't believe it. I couldn't get my head around it, and I live with her. As a female, there were no signs."" Cryptic pregnancies, as they are called, aren't completely unheard of. Cable network TLC even created a show about them, ""I Didn't Know I was Pregnant."" But exactly how common they are depends on who you ask. According to one Serbian study, an estimated one out of every 7,225 pregnancies is unknown to the mother until the moment of delivery. Dr. Kim Dever is the chair of obstetrics and gynecology at South Shore Hospital, where Kropas gave birth.  She said of the approximate 3,500 annual births at her hospital, ""we probably see this a few times a year."" Dever said it often happens if the woman is overweight or has irregular periods.  If the mother-to-be wasn't planning to get pregnant, she might confuse baby movement as gas, Dever said. ""I thought I had put on some Christmas-season weight, but I never thought I was pregnant.  Never,"" Kropas told WBZ. Without any time to prepare, Kropas said she expects the first few weeks with her daughter will be challenging, but worth it. ""I love her,"" she said.","New mother found out she was pregnant 51 minutes before giving birth .

"The on-pitch collapse of an English Premier League soccer player at the weekend raises questions about how such highly-trained athletes can be struck down in such a manner. Professional sports players are generally in prime physical condition, especially with today's advanced physiological, nutritional and medical knowledge. However, Fabrice Muamba is the latest in a growing list of athletes around the world who have suffered heart problems -- seemingly out of nowhere. So why does it happen, and can it be prevented? ""What is important to realize is that playing sport vigorously can unmask an undiagnosed, underlying condition,"" says Dr. Hilary Jones, a medical expert from England. ""So when we see someone have a subarachnoid haemorrhage, a sudden stroke on the field of play, we're shocked by it. If someone has a cardiac arrest, we're very shocked by it. These events aren't common, especially amongst athletes, but they aren't rare either."" Jones says, in the UK, 12 young people under the age of 35 die each week from undiagnosed cardiac conditions -- but only one in 45,000 sportsmen will suffer such a death. But aren't there tests that can stop this happening? Yes, but they differ from country to country, says U.S.-based cardiologist Dr. Chandan Devireddy. ""Testing is very controversial in the medical community as far as what type of testing, when to screen, how to screen,"" says Devireddy, who works at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The Premier League, for example, says all players aged 16-18 at its member clubs ""must go through a cardiological examination/screening"" and then have follow-ups ""as early in their careers as possible and again if the annual medical screen shows any results that warrant a further examination."" That should have covered the 23-year-old Muamba, who came to England from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1999 at the age of 11 and began his career at top-flight club Arsenal before joining Bolton in 2008 from Birmingham. ""They have described a cardiovascular exam, but that's not really described in detail -- does that mean physical exam plus an EKG (electrocardiogram)?"" asks Devireddy. ""This varies from country to country depending on what the recommendations are. The U.S. is not actually advocating EKGs, but that's very controversial internationally. There are some bodies that have had very close monitoring of this on a population basis, such as Italy where they said EKGs make a huge difference in detecting this in a population."" So what is wrong with Muamba? The exact diagnosis has yet to be released, but experts seem to agree it is most likely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy -- a condition where the heart muscle thickens, causing a stoppage of blood flow. ""It is one of the most common genetic cardiac conditions in the human population,"" says Devireddy. ""A lot of times these types of conditions can be passed on from generation to generation. Whether Mr. Muamba knew his family history from this standpoint, we don't know."" Jones says this condition is slightly more common in black athletes than white ones. ""There is also the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia, where the rhythm of the heart is broken and a cardiac arrest occurs,"" he says. ""A third reason could be the congenital abnormality of the structure of the coronary arteries, again, which he would be born with -- and which might not have been diagnosed."" Does heart testing guarantee that these conditions will be discovered? ""With EKG screening, sometimes this isn't caught,"" Devireddy says. ""With the hypertrophic cardio myopathy we're discussing, about 70% of the time the first incidence of that being diagnosed is with a sudden cardiac death episode."" Jones says that sports players should have both EKGs (which interpret electrical activity) and ECHO cardiagrams -- which use ultrasound techniques to create images of the heart. ""There was a screening program that was very effective in Italy, for example, where all their young professional sports people were being screened,"" he says. ""They were detecting quite large numbers of abnormality and indeed they were able to reduce their mortality rate by 90%. ""There are people here in this country and elsewhere in Europe and the rest of the world looking at more effective screening procedures to try to diagnose those conditions which are previously undiagnosed."" Will Muamba, who is in critical condition in intensive care, be able to survive? ""The fact that care providers were there and got to him immediately -- the word was that defibrillators were available, which is crucial at sporting events and arenas -- I think that if he makes it that will be a crucial aspect in his recovery,"" says Devireddy. Muamba collapsed just before halftime in a match at Tottenham, and medics rushed onto the pitch to try to revive him. His heart did not start working again until he reached the hospital. ""The critical thing with someone who has had a cardiac arrest is to try to establish circulation as soon as possible, so the quicker that happens, the better,"" Jones says. ""And clearly, in the case where there is no heartbeat re-established, normally, for two hours, the outlook is not good. It's all about getting enough oxygen to the brain, getting oxygen to the kidneys. And the longer that break in circulation happens, the worse the outlook. ""But he's in hospital, he's in intensive care, he's been there for two days and there have been no further reports. So whilst he has been given every chance of life, I'm afraid the outlook is not good."" Could the same thing happen to me? ""It's completely counter-intuitive to look at a 23-year-old, very fit, highly talented sportsman like Fabrice Muamba having a cardiac arrest on the pitch with no prior warning, and it makes everyone think, 'Could this happen to me?' "" explains Jones. ""He would have had some underlying condition. He was fit in every other respect, and sport does make us fit, but it doesn't rule out any underlying subtle conditions which are difficult to diagnose without screening tests. Anybody playing a sport at a high level should be screened."" Devireddy agrees that sports stars should be able to cope with the physical rigors of their profession. ""For athletes at this level, these gentlemen train to compete day in, day out,"" he says. ""Of course, if they're pushing themselves beyond the human limits in terms of how well hydrated they are and how their electrolyte balances are, you can predispose even the most competitive athlete to abnormal heart rhythms and straining the heart muscle, but from experience in previous history and previous cases, this likely has some underlying cause to it.""","Soccer player's tragic collapse sparks debate about heart problems in sporting arena .

"(CNN)Pink-painted elephants, bathing suit beauties and -- Richard Nixon? It's the sort of combination you can find only in Hollywood. All three were present at the opening of the Beverly Hilton Hotel in 1955. Since then this Beverly Hills landmark has hosted Hollywood's and Washington's elite -- and its drama. ""No grand hotel is a grand hotel without a touch of sleaze,"" quips Stephen Galloway of The Hollywood Reporter. ""And the Hilton has delivered."" From former Sen. John Edwards, who was discovered there with his mistress, to Heidi Fleiss, the so-called Hollywood madam whose alleged prostitutes were caught in an undercover sting at the hotel, many public figures have stories that haunt the Hilton's halls. But there's a shiny side to the hotel as well. The Beverly Hilton boasts more than 100 red carpet events each year, including the People Magazine Awards, the Daytime Emmy Awards, the Oscar nominees luncheon and the Golden Globes. ""For a tourist coming in, it's the buzz of that red carpet,"" said hotel manager Michael Robertson. ""You don't get to see that anywhere else."" Of course, the drama and glitter are often connected. It was before music mogul Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party in 2012 that Whitney Houston was found dead in her room at the Hilton. ""In today's world, when a lot of people think of the Beverly Hilton, they think of Whitney Houston,"" Galloway said. ""It has become a defining thing for (the hotel)."" Management stays away from discussing the hotel's Hollywood travails. But like it or not, the Beverly Hilton Hotel has hosted high drama for decades. ""John F. Kennedy was rumored to have had liaisons there,"" Galloway notes. ""Who knows how many were true and how many were false?"" (There's more evidence Kennedy conducted normal presidential business there. In fact, a photo of Kennedy at the Hilton is hanging on the hotel wall. The President frequently arrived by helicopter, which a hotel spokesperson says landed on the roof of the hotel's parking garage.) Fellow politician Richard Nixon also delivered his famed ""last press conference"" at the hotel, after losing the race for California governor in 1962. With his political future in doubt, he told the press ""you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore."" Nixon went on to become president, but ""this turning point in (his) life -- and it could have been the end of his political career -- happened at the Hilton,"" Galloway says. The Beverly Hilton hasn't always been a hip spot in Hollywood. When Nixon, then vice president, helped open the Beverly Hilton, he declared it ""magical."" But the luster and intrigue of the hotel had begun to wane by the time Merv Griffin bought the property in 1987. The former producer and talk show host poured money, and himself, into the hotel. With his Hollywood influence, the facade once again shined. ""He made a big impact on the hotel with the entertainment world,"" said Robertson. ""He had his table by the pool; he was out there every day and you never knew who was going to come have lunch with him."" Today at the same pool, just days before the 72nd annual Golden Globes, tourists wander around, hoping for a glimpse of a star. On this day it's not meant to be; only stagehands buzz around, readying the International Ballroom for the awards telecast. But no one seems to mind because they're staying at the Beverly Hilton. And when there are no actors around, the hotel itself -- and all its history -- easily plays the starring role. ""Hollywood is a world most people don't live in,"" Robertson notes. ""If only for a moment, this is their chance to experience it.""","Beverly Hilton Hotel hosts the Golden Globes every year .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Here is a look at some of the strongest potential contenders to replace California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who announced this week that she will not run for re-election in 2016. Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have held the state's two Senate seats for more than two decades, setting up a potentially wild scramble for Boxer's seat. California's Republican Party has been decimated in recent years -- with no obvious GOP candidate emerging. But the state's top-two primary system could well lead to a Democrat vs. Democrat runoff in November of 2016. KAMALA HARRIS . Kamala Harris, a former San Francisco District Attorney, replaced then-Attorney Gen. Jerry Brown in 2010, filling a job that is one of the best stepping stones to higher office in this state. In that post, she continued her longtime focus on reducing recidivism and truancy, and won accolades for vigorously pursuing banks accused of foreclosing properties on homeowners without following procedures. At the same time, critics have said she has been too cautious in taking positions on controversial issues like the legalization of marijuana. The daughter of a Jamaican-American father and an Indian-American mother, Harris has gained national notice and enjoyed a strong friendship with President Barack Obama, who could help her raise money for a bid.  At a 2013 fundraiser, Obama called her ""brilliant,"" ""dedicated"" and ""tough"" before joking that she was ""by far the best-looking attorney general in the country."" (He later apologized, and she expressed her strong support for him through a spokesman). Barbara Boxer's retirement sets off wild scramble . During her six years as San Francisco's district attorney, Harris faced criticism because of her opposition to capital punishment. She infuriated many police officers when she refused to pursue the death penalty in 2004 for the suspect who gunned down Officer Isaac Espinoza with an AK-47. But when she ran for attorney general, she said she would enforce the state's law. She followed through last year when she announced that she would challenge a federal judge's decision declaring California's death penalty unconstitutional. GAVIN NEWSOM . Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is best known for touching off a national firestorm in 2004 by issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples as mayor of San Francisco. Denying gay men and women that right, he told CNN in 2004, was ""wrong and inconsistent with the values this country holds dear.""  He added that he was willing to end his political career over the issue. Instead, the decision helped him develop a strong fundraising base among advocates of LGBT rights in California. Newsom is now serving his second term as lieutenant governor -- an office with limited powers that has made it more difficult for him to directly influence policy. But as a member of the UC Board of Regents, he has tried to block tuition hikes and develop proposals to improve higher education -- endearing him to the younger generation of Californians. He has also outlined his agenda to reinvigorate the state's manufacturing base and enhance the work force, as well as ideas to reduce homelessness, which he tackled as San Francisco's mayor. When he left that office in 2010, Newsom claimed he had reduced the level of homelessness in San Francisco by 40% over his tenure, by moving many of them into supportive housing. Newsom proposed an interagency council on the homeless to Gov. Jerry Brown after taking his No. 2 post, but got nowhere. Pelosi on Boxer retirement: 'What?' Newsom and Brown have had a notably frosty relationship over the years. When Newsom briefly ran for governor in 2009, he told Democratic delegates at a state convention that he represented the party's future and compared a vote for Brown (who had not yet announced) to a ""stroll down memory lane.""  With Brown in the wings, Newsom struggled to raise money and withdrew from the race. ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA . Villaraigosa's long career in the public eye has included stints as a union organizer, speaker of the California Assembly and most recently mayor of Los Angeles between 2005 and 2013. His deep roots within Southern California's Latino community boosted his margins in each of his campaigns, and would give him a notable edge in a statewide race. He was a controversial figure as a mayor -- often criticized for having big ambitions and limited follow through. But he presided over a drop in violent crime and major initiatives to make the city more energy-efficient. Most notably, he doggedly pursued funding to improve Los Angeles' woefully incomplete public transit system. He championed a 2008 voter initiative for a half-cent sales tax increase over 30 years that accelerated funding for expanding rail networks around Los Angeles County, as well as LA's long-awaited ""Subway to the Sea."" (For now, that line won't actually make it all the way to the ocean, but construction recently began on the extension that will run to Westwood by 2035). Ironically, the battles that Villaraigosa took on during his time as mayor might endear him to some independent voters in California, but have complicated his relationship with labor groups (whose financial support and manpower cannot be underestimated in an expensive statewide race). Though Villaraigosa was once an organizer for the United Teachers of Los Angeles, he engaged in a bitter battle with the teachers' union as he tried unsuccessfully to assert control over the troubled L.A. Unified School District.  His relationship with city employee unions also suffered during the city's financial crisis after the recession when he tangled with city workers over raises, layoffs and what he viewed as much-needed pension reforms. TOM STEYER . Tom Steyer, the billionaire investor who spent more than $74 million -- much of it his own money -- during the 2014 midterms to try to make climate change a key issue, is one of the few potential contenders who could fund his own bid for Boxer's Senate seat. Forbes has estimated the net worth of the former hedge fund manager at $1.6 billion. He and his wife, Kat, have pledged to give away the bulk of their fortune to philanthropic and public interest causes. Steyer's enormous investment in the midterms through his Nextgen Climate Action Committee had little demonstrable success in what turned out to be a Republican wave in November. But the Democratic activist has dismissed the notion that Republican gains last year would discourage him from future political endeavors. He told the Los Angeles Times after the election that he felt ""great"" about what his organization had been able to do. ""We set out to put climate on the ballot in a bunch of states, to build an organization and to build a relationship with a bunch of voters,"" Steyer said. He has said he is committed to advancing his agenda over several election cycles. While Steyer may be weighing a run for Boxer's seat, he is also intrigued by the possibility of running for governor when Brown leaves office in 2018.","Several key Democrats could enter race with a strong fundraising advantage .

"Washington (CNN) -- It might be one of the most intense rivalries in sports. It's not the Yankees and the Red Sox, or the Cowboys and the Redskins, but the FBI and the Secret Service. Their hockey teams clashed on the ice Saturday night in their annual match. The two teams, made up of agents from the different organizations, have been playing against each other for more than 10 years. They raise money for different charitable causes for either FBI or Secret Service agents. This year, organizers asked for a $5 donation from attendants, with the money raised going to Keith Rile, a Secret Service agent diagnosed with cancer. ""The FBI is a family; the Secret Service is a family. We work together every day of the year, and one day we come together to have this friendly rivalry,"" FBI director Robert Mueller told CNN. ""We're all here to support him and support his family"" Mueller, who played hockey during his college years at Princeton University, faced off against special agent James Meehan of the Secret Service in a ceremonial puck drop before the game. The Secret Service scored twice and took an early lead, to loud cheers from the stands which were packed with friends and families of the players, as well as other employees of the two agencies. The FBI tied the game soon afterward, but they were constantly on the defensive. The match came down to the last minute of the first overtime period. With 58 seconds left on the clock, the Secret Service scored the tie-breaking goal that ended the game. The final score was 7-6. ""It's never an easy win,"" said Todd Nassoiy, one of the special agents playing for the Secret Service team. The Secret Service also won last year, but only after a tense shootout. The FBI won the year before that in overtime. The match was played at the Kettler Capitals Iceplex in Arlington, Virginia, and organizers said all 2,500 tickets were sold.","FBI, Secret Service face off in annual hockey game .

"A few years ago Vinicio Riva boarded a public bus in the northern Italian town of Vicenza. He went toward the nearest vacant seat but before he could sit down the man in the adjacent seat snapped, ""Go away! Don't sit next to me."" ""I wanted to answer back, but I controlled myself,"" recalled Vinicio, now 53 years old. ""I felt my blood pressure rise."" He stayed on the bus, standing. ""There were lots of people on the bus, and they heard it all, but no one said a word."" Vinicio has long been accustomed to the unkindness of strangers. He suffers from a non-infectious genetic disease, neurofibromatosis type 1. It has left him completely covered from head to toe with growths, swellings and itchy sores. His mother suffered from the same illness before she died, and his sister has a milder version of it. His aunt, Caterina Lotto, says his undershirt is often completely soaked in blood that seeps from the sores. In early November Vinicio traveled with his aunt and dozens of others from northern Italy to Vatican City, where they attended a morning public audience held by Pope Francis. Vinicio, who has difficulty staying on his feet for long, was in a wheelchair. ""We didn't think we would be so close to the Pope, but the Swiss Guard kept ushering us forward until we were in a corner in the front row,"" recalled Lotto, a woman in her late sixties with a quick smile and an infectious laugh. ""When he came close to us,"" she said, ""I thought he would give me his hand. Instead he went straight to Vinicio and embraced him tightly. I thought he wouldn't give him back to me he held him so tightly. We didn't speak. We said nothing but he looked at me as if he was digging deep inside, a beautiful look that I would never have expected."" Vinicio, accustomed to stares of shock and fear, was initially confused by the pontiff's lack of hesitation. ""He didn't have any fear of my illness,"" he said. ""He embraced me without speaking ... I quivered. I felt a great warmth."" In moments of drama, odd details often remain vivid. ""I looked down at his shoes,"" Vinicio's aunt recalled. ""They were like this,"" she said, holding her hands apart and laughing. ""I thought yes, this is someone who really walks."" The entire encounter lasted little over a minute, and soon Vinicio and his aunt were back on the bus, Vinicio in a state of combined shock and joy. ""He was almost not himself,"" Lotto said. ""He was shaking."" ""I felt I was returning home ten years younger, as if a load had been lifted,"" Vinicio said. But life returned to normal soon enough. He went back to his job at a home for the elderly, collecting and throwing out the trash, running odd jobs. He works there on weekdays and in slower moments enjoys chatting with the residents who don't seem to notice his condition. His preferred topic of conversation is the ups and downs of Juventus, his favorite football team. When I ventured to discuss football with him, suggesting he should consider the merits of other teams, like Rome or Lazio, he was dismissive, shaking his head and wagging his fingers in contempt. Diego Munari, the director of the home, said Vinicio's energy and humor help keep the residents' spirits up. He said, ""Everyday he meets a lot of people here who like him, who chat and joke with him."" When Vinicio finishes work, he rides his bicycle back to the flat he shares with his sister Morena. Aunt Caterina says he can be lazy when it comes to preparing meals, and often prefers to make a sandwich to avoid having to wash the dishes. CNN Rome producers Hada Messia and Livia Borghese had been trying for weeks to speak with Vinicio, ever since the photos of his embrace with Pope Francis were first made public. Initially his family was hesitant, but the encounter with Francis emboldened him. A change came over him, he said. ""I feel stronger and happier. I feel I can move ahead because the Lord is protecting me."" ""Now that people have seen him they will be less detached,"" said his aunt, who also hopes the Pope's embrace and the media furor it whipped up will raise awareness about neurofibromatosis. She is worried that cuts in cash-strapped Italy's health and social services could impact her nephew. Vinicio savors his moment with Pope Francis, but says he still has unfinished business. ""I hope he calls me so we can have a face-to-face meeting him and I. I have many things to tell him,"" Vinicio said. One of the hallmarks of Francis' papacy has been to call people, out of the blue. ""What do you want to tell him?"" I asked. ""That's a bit private,"" he said, shaking his head apologetically. ""It's between him and I."" Read more: Pope's embrace of man touches world .

"Miami (CNN)Despite calling the case ""incredible"" and the newly discovered evidence ""very intriguing,"" a judge Friday ruled against overturning the conviction of a onetime wealthy businessman who's been sitting in prison for 27 years for the killing of two people inside a downtown Miami hotel. Krishna ""Kris"" Maharaj, 75, was not in court when Judge William Thomas said, ""This court fully weighed the materiality, relevance and inconsistencies of the newly discovered evidence, and concludes that such evidence falls dramatically short of establishing that the murders were committed by anyone other than Mr. Maharaj."" The convicted killer's family sat in the front row of the courtroom, and held each other as the judge uttered those words. Just a couple of rows behind them, the wife and mother of the victims, Derrick and Duane Moo Young, shed tears of happiness. Maharaj's attorneys have 30 days to appeal the decision. They did not say whether they would do so. From luxury living to prison bars . It was October 1986, when police arrested Maharaj -- an international food importer and newspaper owner -- in the shooting deaths of his business partners, Derrick Moo Young and his 23-year-old son. At the time, the British citizen was living the good life in South Florida. He had owned luxury cars and horses that raced against thoroughbreds held by Queen Elizabeth II. That all came crumbling down. Despite having an alibi, Maharaj was charged with murdering the Moo Youngs because they allegedly had cheated him out of more than $400,000. He was found guilty and sentenced to death -- a penalty that was later reduced to life in prison. Then, in April 2014, Judge Thomas, of Florida's 11th Judicial Circuit Court, granted Maharaj a chance that could open the door to freedom. A hearing was held in November to determine whether new evidence from Maharaj's lawyers ""undermines confidence in the verdict,"" according to court documents. Defense attorneys also had to establish that the new ""evidence would probably produce an acquittal or less severe sentence on retrial."" A cartel connection? Maharaj's lawyers said evidence suggested the murders were committed by former members of Pablo Escobar's infamous Colombian drug cartel. In the late 1970s and early '80s, Escobar cashed in on the exploding popularity of cocaine in the United States, said reporter Mark Bowden, author of ""Killing Pablo."" Maharaj: I was framed for murders ordered by Escobar . Leader of the Medellin Cartel, Escobar was responsible at one point for almost 80% of Colombia's cocaine exports, making him the seventh richest man in the world, Bowden told CNN. Escobar was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993. According to a motion filed last year by Maharaj's attorneys, a ""Colombian drug cartel member confirmed that the Moo Young murders were committed at the behest of Pablo Escobar."" ""The Moo Youngs were laundering money for the Colombian cartels,"" the defense motion said. ""This is what precipitated their murders."" An ex-cartel member confirmed that ""Maharaj was not involved in the murders of the Moo Youngs, and that they had to be eliminated because they had lost Colombian drug money,"" according to the defense motion. ""We've got several Colombian cartel people to say, 'We did the murders,'"" Maharaj defense attorney Clive Stafford Smith told CNN on the phone last June. The defense team also alleged Florida prosecutors covered up evidence in the 1987 trial that could have proved Maharaj's innocence. The prosecution's case . Although prosecutors said they stood by the decades-old case, in a June email to CNN, a state attorney spokesman wrote, ""Now that we are re-engaged in litigation on this matter, it would be inappropriate for us to be commenting at this time."" But, in their own motion, prosecutors wrote, ""The only thing that is obvious to anyone who really looks at these fantastical allegations by the defendant is that they are empty and have no substance."" ""None of [the potential witnesses named in the defense motion] have any first hand knowledge, provide no admissible testimony or evidence and only attempt to further the nonsensical and wholly speculative theories of the defense,"" the prosecution document said. The evidence against Maharaj was significant. Police found his fingerprints in the guest room at Miami's Dupont Plaza Hotel where the shootings occurred. Maharaj said he was there for a meeting, but departed before the Moo Youngs were killed. Nineteen fingerprints found at the crime scene have never been identified, according to the defense motion. Maharaj: Then and now . Maharaj told CNN's ""Death Row Stories"" that he left the hotel and drove 25 miles to Fort Lauderdale to have lunch with one of his newspaper employees. The employee signed an affidavit as an alibi witness. The restaurant manager, Ron Kisch, told ""Death Row Stories,"" he remembered seeing Maharaj having lunch that day. ""It doesn't seem like there's any way possible that he could have killed people at 12 o'clock and then been in for lunch sometime between 12 and 2,"" Kisch said. Five other witnesses came forward saying Maharaj was with them on the day of the murders, ""Death Row Stories"" reported. Today, Maharaj sits in a medium-security correctional facility outside Miami. He had been in poor health, according to his lawyer, although he seems to have improved. CNN's Javier De Diego reported from Miami.","Judge in Florida rules against new murder trial .

"(CNN)When packing for a vacation on Kepler 16-b, it's good to remember the sunscreen. It does, after all, have two suns. OK, so a long weekend visiting a planet 1,200 trillion miles away, may not be a realistic prospect just yet, but that hasn't stopped scientists at NASA from dreaming. To mark the exciting discovery of a slew of potentially distant habitable worlds by its Kepler space observatory, the U.S. space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology has created a series of posters advertising imaginary vacations to some of them. Rendered in the retro style of classic travel billboards of the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the posters depict these distant worlds as pleasurable destinations. The image for Kepler 16-b -- previously compared to the fictional ""Star Wars"" planet of Tatooine because of its dual suns -- shows a space-suited figure basking in the light from the twin orbs overhead. ""Relax on Kepler 16-b,"" the poster says. ""The land of two suns ... Where your shadow always has company."" Although the planet is depicted as a rocky, terrestrial world, NASA says it could also be a gas giant like Saturn with freezing temperatures that would make it hostile to known lifeforms. A second poster shows an astronaut free-falling to experience the powerful gravity over HD 40307g, a ""Super Earth"" 44 light years -- or 264 trillion miles -- away. The third depicts Kepler-186f (even further away at 500 light years) with a scene of red trees held back by a white picket fence. The planet has been previously described as ""Earth's cousin"" because it's similar in size to our own world. Because it orbits a cooler, redder sun there's speculation that if plants did grow here, they'd be a different color to our own vegetation. Where the grass is redder . ""Kepler-186f, where the grass is always redder on the other side,"" the poster's slogan reads. The posters, available to download for free via JPL's website, are the work of the space agency's visual strategists Joby Harris, David Delgado and Dan Goods, who were inspired by the new discoveries being made by Kepler. ""I  was thinking ... we may be not alone,"" Delgado tells CNN. ""We're entering a new part of our humanity and one of the natural things that came to mind is what would it be like to visit them ... and wouldn't it be fun to make vacation posters. ""It felt like a natural fit."" Harris, the lead artist, was inspired by the enduring appeal of vintage art deco-style posters. ""I remember sitting in meetings with the scientists thinking 'oh my goodness, science fiction is now becoming science non-fiction',"" he says. ""People gravitate toward those old posters. They hang them on their walls even today and you want to go there. They're a celebration of place. ""So we thought we'd produce some of our own and come up with funny tag lines that would get people dreaming about what it would be like to go there."" The three posters were released just as NASA announced Kepler's latest discoveries, bringing its planetary tally to more than 1,000 alien worlds since its launch in 2009. According to Delgado, three more posters are in the works, but progress is slow because the theories about what these newly found planets look like can change from day to day. Still, as he points out, the NASA team might not be the only artists at work. ""Maybe on one of these other planets, they're making posters about visiting here.""","NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has produced vintage-style posters advertising trips to new planets .

"(CNN)One evening last month, a teenage suicide bomber blew himself up on the steps of the auditorium of the French cultural center in Kabul. The target was a crowd of Afghans and expatriates gathered to watch a play titled ""Heartbeat: Silence after the Explosion."" The show was written as a condemnation of suicide bombings. ""Pieces of flesh were plastered on the wall. There were children and women crying for help,"" said one civil society activist who spoke with Reuters just after the suicide attack. A Taliban spokesman claimed the group was responsible for the attack, and said the play was targeted because it was being performed ""to insult Islamic values and spread propaganda about our jihad operations, especially on suicide attacks."" Sadly, for too long it has been relatively easy for citizens of the United States and Europe to indulge in the ""otherization"" of this particular brand of extremist horror.  Yes, such attacks are awful and deserved condemnation, but they were, until the tragic events of this week in Paris, other people's hells. They generally occurred in far-flung places and were committed against faraway people: schoolgoers in Peshawar and theatergoers in Kabul. Nearly two years ago, for example, Anne Smedinghoff, a 25-year-old foreign service officer serving in Afghanistan, went to deliver books to an Afghan school, but was killed by a suicide bomber on the way. In the aftermath of her death, Secretary of State John Kerry said: ""The folks who want to kill people, and that's all they want to do, are scared of knowledge. And they want to shut the doors and they don't want people to make their choices about the future. For them, it's 'You do things my way and if you don't, we'll throw acid in your face. We'll put a bullet in your face,' to a young girl trying to learn. So this is a huge challenge for us. It is a confrontation with modernity, with possibilities."" But while the media covered the tragedy, Smedinghoff's death remained a story that happened ""over there."" Indeed, for the past several years -- at least since attacks on Madrid and London -- Westerners have been able to go about their day-to-day business, with little thought to what was taking place thousands of miles away, for this was someone else's horror. This has been despite the alarming rate at which the death toll has been growing, with Afghans being forced to get accustomed to having their lives punctured by senseless attacks, including the heartbreaking slayings of an Afghan journalist, his wife and two daughters gathered around a dinner table for a holiday celebration as a family. As the United Nations in Afghanistan noted recently, more civilian deaths and injuries occurred during 2014 than in any year since it began such reports in 2009. Of particularly gruesome note was a November suicide attack targeting a crowd huddled to watch a volleyball game that killed more than 50 people, including 21 children. Israel's Institute for National Security Studies released a report counting 592 suicide attacks in 2014, which it said was a 94% increase over the previous year, resulting in the deaths of approximately 4,400 people. The United Nations put the number of civilians killed in Iraq last year at a staggering 12,282, more than double the number killed in 2013 . True, as these numbers have soared, Americans have found themselves increasingly concerned. An August Pew Research poll, for example, found 65% agreeing ""the world is more dangerous than it was several years ago,"" while just 7% said the world has gotten safer. Yet at the same time, more than half said the United States ""does not have a responsibility to do something about the violence in Iraq."" Yet the reality is that extremists wreaking bloody havoc in Iraq or Yemen or Afghanistan or Pakistan will not be kept at bay forever. Nor, as an Afghan activist who ran schools for girls during the Taliban era once told me, will an Afghanistan left to itself remain its own problem indefinitely. America, understandably, wants to bring to a close 13 years of conflict. And it may want to believe that the tide of war is really receding. But as the events still unfolding in Paris this week have demonstrated -- and as was underscored by 2013's Boston bombing -- extremists are ready to bring their violence to our own shores. Europe and America are not immune to the threat. If ""Je suis Charlie,"" a slogan adopted in solidarity with the magazine Charlie Hebdo that was attacked in France, is to mean anything, it should be about the choice to stand up in defense of those who believe in a free press, safe schools for boys and girls, and theaters free from suicide attack. And that means standing up for people wherever they are in the world.","Gayle Lemmon: West has too often ignored extremism overseas .
Europe and America are not immune to threat, she says ."
"(CNN)The unspeakable terror that began with the Charlie Hebdo massacre in France again invaded the lives of ordinary citizens on Friday with separate violent standoffs that thrust a jittery nation into a new crisis. The twin episodes -- one outside the French capital involving the suspects who shot and killed 12 people Wednesday at the offices of the satirical magazine, the other at a kosher grocery store -- ended simultaneously with staccato bursts of gunfire and blasts of what appeared to be stun grenades by small armies of law enforcement officers. ""France is living through a trial, when we see the worst massacre of this kind in the last 50 years,"" President Francois Hollande said in and address to the nation Friday. One of the most terrifying weeks in modern French history culminated with the shooting deaths of the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo slaughter -- brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi -- and scenes of still-stunned hostages being led to freedom by heavily-armed security forces from the kosher supermarket, after the man who police say took hostages there was killed. ""It's like a war,"" a man who identified himself only as Teddy said as the episodes unfolded. ""I don't know how I will explain this to my 5-year-old son."" This father lives across the street from a school in the village of Dammartin-en-Goele, where security forces launched an assault on a graphics/printing business where the Kouachi brothers had holed themselves up. Country riveted by hostage drama . For hours Friday, there was no teaching in the classrooms in the small town northeast of Paris. Dozens of schools were on lockdown. Teachers and their pupils hid in fear. Mothers approached officers seeking assurances that their children were safe. Some students were later allowed to leave. Police officers accompanied them, holding their hands as they guided the children away. The littlest ones were lifted onto an awaiting bus that would deliver them to the safety of nearby sports facilities. The two suspects told police by phone that they wanted to die as martyrs, Yves Albarello, a member of Parliament, said on French channel iTele. Shortly before 5 p.m., helicopters swooped down on the building where the Kouachi brothers holed themselves up. Explosions and gunfire echoed through the industrial area. Smoke rose from the building. At the grocery store in Paris, four people were killed when police stormed the business near Porte de Vincennes, Hollande said. Earlier, a salesman, who identified himself only as Didier, told France Info radio that he had shaken hands with one of the gunmen about 8:30 a.m. Friday as they arrived at the printing business. Didier at first thought the man, who was dressed in black and heavily armed, was a police officer, he told the public radio station. As he left, the armed man told Didier, ""Go, we don't kill civilians."" ""It wasn't normal,"" Didier said of his encounter. ""I did not know what was going on."" Relief, but hunt continues for another suspect . Fear of the unknown has gripped France. The dread Friday reached an eastern Paris kosher grocery store where a man suspected of a killing a police officer a day earlier took a number of hostages, including children. The hostage-taking suspect, Amedy Coulibaly, was a close associate of Cherif Kouachi, a Western intelligence source told CNN. Coulibaly demanded freedom for the Kouachi brothers. About the time security forces killed the Kouachi brothers, other officers, guns blazing, moved in on the kosher market. Police shouted ""get down!"" and ""we've got him,"" according to video from CNN affiliate BFMTV. Some hostages were killed, according to French radio reports. A man who presumably was a hostage got out with an infant, as did others. Among those who may have escaped the building was a female accomplice of the grocery store hostage-taker and suspect in Thursday's fatal police shooting. On Friday night, the words ""Paris est Charlie,"" French for ""Paris is Charlie"" were triumphantly projected on the iconic Arc de Triomphe. A new manhunt was launched, meanwhile, for the only surviving suspect from the two hostage situations, police union spokesman Pascal Disant said. That suspect, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26, was allegedly an accomplice of Coulibaly in the standoff at the kosher market. In a televised address to the nation later, Hollande warned: ""France is not done with threats that are targeting (the country).""","Week of terror ends with Charlie Hebdo attackers killed .

"In a telephone call Monday between Russia's Defense Minister General Sergei Shoigu and the U.S. Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel, Shoigu described the activity of U.S. and NATO troops near Russia's border as ""unprecedented."" According to the official Russian version of the call, his American counterpart assured him the alliance did not have ""provocative or expansionist"" intentions -- and that Russia should know this. But it hardly seems to matter how often NATO makes these assurances. The Kremlin will never trust them. Fear of the Western military alliance's steady march east is deep-rooted. It strikes at the very heart of Russia's national sense of security, a relic of Cold War enmity which has seeped down to post-Soviet generations. Ilya Saraev is a 15-year-old pupil at the First Moscow cadet school in Moscow. He thinks long and hard when I ask him about NATO. ""I think NATO might be a friend to Russia but there's one point I don't understand: Why it needs to approach the border with Russia more and more,"" he says. Cadet school is an education in patriotism, like something from a bygone era. Besides the regular classes, there are lessons in ballroom dancing. Teenage cadets proudly leading local beauties through the waltz while outside their classmates rehearse the goosestep. After the takeover of Crimea, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of behaving in a 19th century fashion in the 21st century. In some ways it's an epithet that seems to ring true here. The children are immaculately mannered and thoughtful. They write to their fellow cadets in Crimea. They say they feel sad there's this tension between brother nations -- Russia and Ukraine. ""People still don't realize that war means despair and grief,"" says 16-year-old Vlad Voinakov. ""They can't find a compromise because people's interests become involved and that's where the problem lies."" Russia and NATO have never been able to find much of a compromise. Russia's repeated stance is that after German reunification, promises were made that NATO would never expand eastward -- and were promptly broken. NATO says this is simply not true. ""No such pledge was made, and no evidence to back up Russia's claims has ever been produced,"" the alliance wrote in an April fact sheet entitled ""Russia's accusations -- setting the record straight."" NATO says it has tried hard to make Russia a ""privileged partner."" It has worked together with Russia on a range of issues from counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics to submarine rescue and emergency planning. NATO says that fundamentally Russia's anti-NATO rhetoric is an attempt to ""divert attention away from its actions"" in Ukraine. Now all cooperation is off the table. ""From the Russian side, that NATO-Russian cooperation was just a camouflage,"" says Vladimir Batyuk of Russian think tank, the Institute of USA and Canada Studies. ""After the Cold War Russia tried several times to become a member and the Americans always said, 'it's not going to happen.'"" He quotes Lord Ismay, NATO's first Secretary General, on the object of NATO's existence: ""To keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down."" Russian President Vladimir Putin declared at his annual direct call with the Russian people that part of his reasoning for annexing Crimea was to protect Sevastopol, home of Russia's Black Sea fleet, from ever falling into NATO's hands. ""If we don't do anything, Ukraine will be drawn into NATO sometime in the future.  We'll be told: ""This doesn't concern you,"" and NATO ships will dock in Sevastopol, the city of Russia's naval glory,"" he said. Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseniy Yetsenyuk has said Ukrainian accession to NATO is not a priority. The nation is currently in such a state of disarray that NATO membership seems unimaginable. But a membership action plan was discussed for both Ukraine and Georgia at the Bucharest Summit in 2008. It was put on hold. But Putin does not forget. ""Ever since (former Ukraine President Viktor) Yanukovych fled his country and a pro-Western government took power in his country, of course this is something [Putin] couldn't stop thinking about,"" says Masha Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""So for him, to prevent Ukraine from becoming part of the western orbit if not of NATO, was something he absolutely cannot afford."" This is why the rotation of 600 U.S. troops, small as it is, through the Baltic states and Poland for joint-training exercises is such an affront for Russia. This is why it is perhaps not strictly fair to accuse Russia of just engaging in propaganda when it declares its mistrust of NATO. Batyuk says he feels that the general public's attitude to the alliance has worsened since the end of the Cold War. Then, people were able to dismiss the Kremlin's line towards NATO as Soviet propaganda, he says. Now it's different. ""A store of unsuccessful mishaps in relations between Russia and the West after the end of the Cold War has contributed to a rise in suspicions on the Russian side to Western policy in general and NATO in particular."" That's one of the reasons Putin's popularity has soared since the annexation of Crimea. There is a feeling among the general public that, at last, Russia is standing up for its rights in the post-Soviet space where it has sat maligned for decades. Much as the Kremlin likes to nurture that narrative, it is also easy to see why it resonates with the Russian public.","In cadet school, Russian pupils have questions for NATO .
They ask: why do you need to be on our border .

"(CNN) -- Dr. George Tiller, whose Kansas women's clinic frequently took center stage in the U.S. debate over abortion, was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita church Sunday morning, police said. Dr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians that performed late-term abortions. Wichita police said a 51-year-old man from the Kansas City, Kansas, area was in custody in connection with the slaying of Tiller, who was one of the few U.S. physicians who still performed late-term abortions. The killing, which came about 16 years after Tiller survived a shooting outside his Wichita clinic, took place shortly after 10 a.m. Sunday at Reformation Lutheran Church. Officers found the 67-year-old dead in the foyer, police said. Witnesses provided a description of the car and a license number of the killer's getaway vehicle, Wichita police spokesman Gordon Bassham said. Police stopped a blue Ford Taurus matching the description about three hours later in Gardner, about 30 miles southwest of Kansas City, and took the driver into custody. No charges had been filed Sunday evening and no motive for the killing was immediately known, but Wichita police Detective Tom Stoltz told reporters: ""We think we have the right person arrested."" ""We will investigate this suspect to the Nth degree -- his history, his family, his associates -- and we are just in the beginning stages of that,"" Stoltz said.  See what people are saying about Dr. Tiller's murder » . Tiller's slaying drew condemnation from supporters, from some of those who tried to shut down his practice and from President Obama, who just two weeks ago urged Americans to seek ""common ground"" on the issue of abortion. ""However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence,"" Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. The shooting prompted U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to direct federal marshals to ""offer protection to other appropriate people and facilities around the nation,"" according to a statement from the Department of Justice. Tiller had been practicing medicine for nearly 40 years, said Peter Brownlie, president of the Kansas City-based regional Planned Parenthood office. His patients were ""almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy,"" and where a woman's health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued, Brownlie said. He and his staff had been picketed for years, with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood, Brownlie said. His clinic suffered serious damage from a bomb in the mid-1990s, and he was shot through both arms in 1993 by an anti-abortion activist who is currently serving time in federal prison. ""He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis,"" Brownlie said. ""As recently as early this month the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so.""  Watch Tiller describe the philosophy of his clinic in 1999 » . Tiller had armed security at his clinic and a ""pretty rigorous"" security procedure at home, Brownlie said. But he ""made an effort to live his life as normally as possible knowing he could be a target at any time,"" he said. In a statement issued through Tiller's lawyers, his family -- a wife, four children and 10 grandchildren -- said their loss ""is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America."" ""George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence,"" his family said in a written statement. ""We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere."" In March, Tiller was acquitted of 19 counts of performing procedures unlawfully at his clinic. In 2008, a probe initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges. Leading anti-abortion groups condemned Sunday's shooting, emphasizing they wanted to shut down Tiller's practice by legal means. Operation Rescue, which has led numerous demonstrations at Tiller's clinic, called the shooting as a ""cowardly act."" And the National Right to Life Committee, the largest U.S. anti-abortion group, said it ""unequivocally condemns any such acts of violence regardless of motivation."" ""The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life,"" it said. ""The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal."" But Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who is no longer affiliated with the group, called Tiller ""a mass murderer."" ""We grieve for him that he did not have time to properly prepare his soul to face God,"" Terry said in a written statement. ""I am more concerned that the Obama administration will use Tiller's killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions. Abortion is still murder, and we still must call abortion by its proper name."" The National Organization for Women, which supports abortion rights, called Tiller's killing an act of ""domestic terrorism."" And NARAL Pro-Choice America said Tiller had worked for years under ""intense harassment tinged with persistent threats of violence."" If Tiller was killed because of his work, he would be the fourth U.S. physician killed over abortion since 1993. See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 » . In 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in his Amherst, New York, home. Anti-abortion activist James Kopp was later arrested in France and is serving life in prison. In 1994, Dr. John Bayard Britton and one of his volunteer escorts were shot and killed outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. Paul Hill, a former minister, was convicted of the killings and executed in 2003. And in 1993, another doctor, David Gunn, was shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic. His killer, Michael Griffin, is serving a life sentence. In addition, a nurse at a Birmingham, Alabama, clinic was maimed and an off-duty police officer was killed in a 1998 bombing by Eric Rudolph, who included abortion among his list of anti-government grievances. Rudolph admitted to that attack and three other bombings -- including the 1996 attack on the Olympic games in Atlanta, Georgia -- and is currently serving life in prison.

"(CNN)The flu season is at the midway point, and it's shaping up to be a difficult one, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At a press conference Friday in Atlanta, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the season has been particularly bad for people 65 and older. Frieden also said that five more children have died since the CDC last reported figures, bringing the number of pediatric deaths up to 26 since the flu season began in the fall. The deaths, however, are believed to be higher due to delays in reporting. Adult deaths are not tracked, but the CDC said that the elderly and people with underlying health conditions are vulnerable to this strain of the flu. Frieden advises doctors to treat people who are sick with the flu with anti-viral medications.  Anti-viral medications are dramatically under prescribed and could prevent thousands of hospitalizations and may even save people from death, he said. But pediatrician Lisa Thebner cautions that ""not everyone needs antivirals."" She said, ""They are mostly recommended for those who are most at risk for complications,"" meaning the very young or old. Frieden said some doctors don't think the medications work, but if given early, they help ease some of the symptoms of the flu. The CDC had predicted the season would be a bad one after most of the samples taken from people with the flu tested positive for the H3N2 strain.  That strain of virus is ""nastier,"" according to Frieden, and generally makes people sicker and results in more hospitalizations and deaths. The CDC reports that most states are seeing widespread cases of flu. In states where the flu season started earlier, it may be slowing down, but there are still weeks of flu left. The flu season usually lasts into the spring. With that in mind, Frieden suggests to go get a flu shot if you haven't been vaccinated. The flu shot this year is not a perfect match for the virus that mutated, but it is the best protection available for people and can lessen the severity of the illness.","Flu season has been hard on elderly and those with underlying medical conditions .

"(CNN)Responding to the massacre at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, President Barack Obama and other public figures such as John Kerry, author Salman Rushdie -- even the far-right nationalist French politician Marine Le Pen -- have defended the right to freedom of expression as a core democratic value. Huge demonstrations in solidarity with the victims are occurring throughout France and in many European capitals. The slogan ""Je suis Charlie Hebdo"" is circulating widely in social media. Twitter is inundated with tweets about the political power of satire. Pictures of demonstrators holding pens in the air abound. Freedom of expression is undeniably worth defending but is too narrow a frame for this event. With this horrific event, Le Pen may well have become the front-runner in France's 2017 presidential elections. These killings will reverberate throughout the shaky European Union, where nationalist parties of all stripes are warning of the dangers of too much immigration. The political mood in Europe has been growing dark. Volatility is becoming more and more constant. In December, the Swedish government went into a crisis triggered by the right nationalist Sweden Democrats, which are vehemently opposed to more immigration and whose leader recently proclaimed that Jews, Kurds and Sami were not Swedish unless they assimilated. A last-minute compromise among the major parties saved the day in Sweden, but the Sweden Democrats -- whose electoral share went from 6% in 2010 to 13% in 2014 -- are not leaving the scene. In Greece, where the openly neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn has been in the parliament since 2012, the pro-Europe government came apart and the Prime Minister has called snap elections for January 25. In Germany, a group called Pegida staged large demonstrations in Dresden against the ""Islamification of Europe."" Prime Minister Angela Merkel in her New Year's address told the group to stop its demonstrations, but Pegida staged another one in Dresden anyway. And now France. Le Pen's goal since she became head of the National Front in 2011 has been to make it a mainstream party.  In 2014, it moved from one electoral breakthrough to another. In March it won mayoral races in four French municipalities, including the traditionally socialist city of Hénin-Beaumont. In May, it came in first place in the European parliamentary elections -- which saw an uptick in the fortunes of right nationalist parties throughout Europe. Le Pen has consistently polled well as a contender in the 2017 French presidential elections. Even before the Charlie Hebdo attack, it was more than likely that she would make it to the second round in 2017. In an October public opinion poll, she outpolled French President François Hollande by 15 percentage points.  Her closest rival was former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and she outpolled even him. The international media often present her as a single-issue candidate around xenophobia and immigration, but Le Pen's and the Front's positions have expanded considerably. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the former head of the party, began a strong push against further European integration and French involvement in the Economic and Monetary Union.  Unemployment outpaces immigration as the leading problem in public opinion polls. But politicians take opportunities where they see them, and voters tend to remember dramatic events as well as everyday grievances. Nothing could be more dramatic than the public killings of 12 persons in the center of Paris. They may well become a tipping point -- Europe's 21st-century version of a Sarajevo moment. Europe has been convulsing for the last few years. The sovereign debt crisis, the high youth unemployment rates, the failure to come up with a just and reasonable refugee policy -- all these issues may crystalize around of the event in Paris whether they are directly related or not. The nationalist right has been gaining strength all over Europe on just these issues. The Charlie Hebdo massacre will not only help Marine Le Pen but will be a boon to nationalist parties throughout Europe. From north to south, ordinary European citizens are already voting for parties that they had shunned in the past. If this trend continues, there will be no guns of August -- just the silent assault of one nationalist electoral success after another.","Mabel Berezin: Paris attack will boost far-right's calls for brakes on immigration .

"(CNN)Hundreds of potential jurors were introduced to accused killer Aaron Hernandez during the first phase of jury selection on Friday. ""Good morning"" or ""good afternoon,"" he said during three scheduled sessions that lasted all day, after which jurors filled out a questionnaire kept off-limits to the public. Hernandez, former New England Patriot tight end, is indicted in the June 17, 2013, death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd, who was shot seven times, prosecutors say, in an industrial park around 3:30 in the morning. Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have pleaded not guilty to the slaying. Wallace and Ortiz will be tried separately. Wearing a dark suit and plaid tie in the morning and switching to a pink tie in the afternoon, Hernandez kept a serious expression as he appeared to be constantly scanning the faces of men and women from whom 18 jurors, including six alternates, will be chosen. The pool includes more than 1,100 people from Bristol County, Massachusetts. Judge Susan Garsh outlined the importance of a jury and said she believes it's a privilege to serve. With his defense team at his side, a clerk read the three charges to the jury pool. They are murder, unlawful possession of a .45 caliber gun and unlawful possession of .22 ammunition. Prosecutors said they have not been able to find the weapon used. It is believed to be a .45 caliber handgun. ""An indictment is just a piece of paper,"" Garsh told the jury pool. ""It's not evidence of anything."" She told the pool Hernandez is presumed innocent and that prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Outside court, defense attorneys declined to answer questions as they carted in supplies, including bottled water, paper towels and a mini-refrigerator. Acting District Attorney Thomas Quinn made a prepared statement to reporters. ""We look forward to a jury being selected that is fair and impartial to both sides. The court has gone to great lengths to ensure that this takes place,"" Quinn said.  ""We look forward to the start of the trial."" It's unclear how long it will take to seat a jury. Individual questioning of potential jurors is not expected to begin until January 16. On Friday, an official order granting immunity was issued for Jennifer Mercado, a relative of Hernandez. She also is a cousin of Tanya Singleton who spent time at Singleton's home, where a dusty silver SUV was discovered by police in Singleton's garage after Hernandez's arrest. The SUV, investigators say, is believed to be connected to a 2012 double slaying in Boston. Hernandez also has been charged in that case and has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors are also seeking immunity for Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his child, Shayanna Jenkins. The immunity request remains under seal. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to a grand jury. Authorities have suggested Jenkins may have disposed of the suspected weapon used in the killing, allegedly following instructions from Hernandez. The day after opening statements, jurors will be taken by bus to see the inside of Hernandez's home, at the request of the defense. The panel will also be shown the killing scene, about a mile from the home, and cellphone towers that allegedly captured a ping from Hernandez's phone in an industrial park the night of Odin Lloyd's death in that location.","Ex football player Hernandez is charged with murder .
Jury selection has begun; the pool includes more than 1,100 people ."
"(CNN)Former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez used to make crowds cheer as a rising NFL star on the gridiron. Now, both fans and foes will again be focused on Hernandez as he steps into the courtroom to go on trial on murder and weapons charges. Jury selection begins Friday, as attorneys begin to whittle down a pool of more than 1,100 potential jurors to the small group that will decide whether Hernandez is guilty of murdering semipro football player Odin Lloyd. That pool is about 10 times larger than usual, largely because of concerns over finding an impartial jury. Attorneys will select 18 jurors, including six alternates. Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty. His friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also been charged with murder in Lloyd's death. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Aaron Hernandez's downward spiral . So far, the state's evidence against Hernandez, partially laid out in pretrial hearings, appears to be largely circumstantial. A magistrate previously described it as ""very strong."" But it could be stronger. In the months leading up to jury selection, Hernandez's defense attorneys, who insist Hernandez will be exonerated, have been trying to chip away at the prosecution's case. Hernandez's legal team, led by Jamie Sultan, Michael Fee, and Charles Rankin, has won some important rulings. Lloyd's texts to his sister: For example, the jury won't hear about text messages between the victim, Odin Lloyd, and his younger sister, sent just minutes before Lloyd's death. The judge has blocked them. At about 3:20 a.m. on June 17, 2013, prosecutors say, Lloyd was in a car driven by Hernandez with Wallace and Ortiz. At 3:07 a.m., according to prosecutors, Lloyd texted his sister Shaquilla Thibou a question: ""U saw who I'm with(?)"" Her phone was off, which delayed her response. At 3:22 a.m., Lloyd texted, ""Nfl."" A minute later, at 3:23 a.m. he sent his last text, ""just so u know."" Minutes later, witnesses heard shots fired at an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home, they told prosecutors. But Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant Lloyd feared for his life, legally called ""a dying declaration."" The defense has argued the messages are innocuous, suggesting Lloyd could have been bragging about being with Hernandez. Some legal experts are surprised those texts were ruled inadmissible. ""They appear relevant,"" said University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann. ""They signal what the victim was thinking before he was killed and they arguably refer to the defendant as well,"" he added. If they had been admitted, McCann said, the defense and prosecution could have debated the meaning and let the jurors weigh the arguments . Hernandez's texts to Lloyd: Jurors will, however, be able to see texts between Hernandez and Lloyd from earlier that night when the football player invited Lloyd to hang out. Who's who in the case against Hernandez . The weapon: It's never been found. That could be a problem for jurors. In court papers, prosecutors have suggested the gun may have been thrown away by Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. She's on the prosecution witness list but has denied any knowledge of the weapon, believed to be a .45-caliber handgun, according to documents. She has been accused of lying to a grand jury and has pleaded not guilty to the perjury charge. The surveillance video: Prosecutors will be able to show Hernandez on his home surveillance video system walking toward his basement door holding what prosecutors say appears to be a gun. The authorities say the video was recorded shortly after he returned home the night in question, minutes after witnesses reported hearing gunshots in the industrial park. Investigators say a vehicle that appears to match the description of a car rented by Hernandez is seen on security cameras driving through the industrial park, allegedly with Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz, and Lloyd inside. But it's unclear who fired the fatal shots. At this point, prosecutors have not publicly presented their theory. Was it Hernandez, Wallace or Ortiz, or some combination? Prosecutors have said they plan to argue Lloyd's murder was a ""joint venture."" Under Massachusetts state law, prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger. Under joint venture, says McMann, ""anyone who actively participates in the murder can be held guilty for murder."" The law will be explained to jurors, but will the state present enough evidence to prove it? As late as November, with the trial around the corner, the state was still looking for more proof. In a surprising move, investigators got a warrant to search Hernandez's home again, more than a year after their last entry. In court papers, detectives said they were looking for three pairs of sneakers photographed in a closet during their original 2013 search. They said the sneakers appear to match shoe prints found at the scene where Lloyd was fatally shot.  But detectives left empty-handed. The shoes were not there. One of the unanswered questions: Why weren't the shoes seized during the original search? Other accusations: Prosecutors also won't be able to bring up other accusations against Hernandez.   For example, if former Hernandez friend Alexander Bradley testifies, he won't be able to mention he's suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the right eye a few months before Lloyd's death. The shooting is inadmissible, Garsh ruled. Nor will the jury be able to hear that Hernandez has been indicted for shooting to death two men in Boston after leaving a nightclub in 2012. He's pleaded not guilty in that case, too, and the trial is pending. Garsh ruled that the Bradley shooting in Florida and the Boston double slaying are far too prejudicial and that Lloyd's case must stand on its own. Will a show and tell help? Prosecutors have permission from the judge to take jurors to see Hernandez's home, as well as the shooting site. They will also be shown the location of some cell phone towers. Prosecutors suggest cell tower ""pings"" could connect Hernandez to the scene of Lloyd's death. Inside Hernandez's home, jurors will see the layout and its multicamera video security system. Garsh ruled that a trophy case and Patriots jersey inside the home will remain in view. The prosecution had requested the memorabilia be covered up or removed so jurors couldn't be swayed by Hernandez's celebrity. But first, a jury must be chosen. How hard will it be to find 18 people, including alternates, who can put aside whatever opinions they might have and view the evidence with open minds? With Hernandez and his family watching, as well as the family and friends of victim Odin Lloyd, we're about to find out.

"New York (CNN)Radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was convicted of supporting al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists, was sentenced to life in prison Friday by a federal judge in New York. A federal jury in Manhattan convicted al-Masri in May of aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen, sending a young recruit to jihadists in Afghanistan, violating U.S. sanctions against the Taliban, and attempting to establish an al Qaeda-style training camp on the West Coast of the United States. ""Abu Hamza's blood-soaked journey from cleric to convict, from Imam to inmate, is now complete,"" Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement after sentencing. ""After years of fighting extradition, Abu Hamza finally faced justice, as all those who engage in terrorism against innocent civilians must, here in the U.S., and all around the globe, as the terrible events in Paris remind us."" On Friday, the cleric had a scruffy beard and wore a blue prison jumpsuit. He entered the courtroom with his arms exposed and without a prosthetic, which he put on occasionally to write. The high-profile London mosque leader gained notoriety for the metal hook he is sometimes depicted wearing in place of one of his missing hands, but he wore only an occasional writing prosthesis in the Manhattan courtroom during his monthlong trial. Contrary to stories that he lost the limbs in battle, al-Masri testified, his maiming was the result of an engineering accident. In imposing the life term, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest told al-Masri: ""I don't believe the world would be safe with you in 10 years, 15 years or longer."" Al-Masri, 56, was found guilty of participating in a hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that resulted in four deaths, a conspiracy to establish a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, and sending a follower to train and fight with al Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2000. The cleric was extradited from the United Kingdom, where he had been convicted of inciting racial hatred and soliciting murder with his fiery sermons. A highlight of the trial came when al-Masri took the stand in his own defense and accused federal prosecutors of using ""pay-as-you-go witnesses"" and a ""cut-and-paste"" approach to his inflammatory comments, including statements about his admiration for late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Lawyers for al-Masri asked the judge to send him to a medical facility instead of prison but Forrest said that decision will be made by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. CNN's Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.","Radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted of supporting al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists .

"On the eve of peace talks, photos of alleged mass torture in Syria gruesomely illustrate the difficult task before United Nations-led negotiators to end the country's civil war. On Tuesday, a day after the photos were revealed by CNN, a prominent Syrian opposition group charged the pictures demonstrate ""industrial killing"" by President Bashar al-Assad's regime. The Syrian Coalition also urged world leaders Tuesday ""to exert all possible pressure on the regime to step aside and allow Syrians to realize their desire for a free country."" U.S. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said the photos underscore how negotiators need to establish a political transition and ""get the Assad regime out of power."" ""These most recent images, I think presented by your network first, are extremely disturbing,"" Harf said. ""They are horrible to look at, and they illustrate apparent actions that would be serious international crimes."" A preliminary session for the peace talks, dubbed Geneva II, will begin Wednesday in Montreux, Switzerland, and the formal international talks will commence Friday in Geneva between the Syrian government and opposition delegations. Even as U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon arrived Tuesday in Switzerland, controversy roiled over how the U.N. rescinded an invitation to Iran to join the talks, with Russian officials saying it was a mistake but ""not a catastrophe."" Iran, accused of supporting the al-Assad regime, announced Monday it would not attend the conference because it objected to preconditions seeking a transitional government. The Syrian Coalition, however, said Iran's attendance would have been ""a deal-breaker."" ""Continued Russian and Iranian support for the regime is the main obstacle to finding a solution to the violence in Syria,"" the coalition said in its Tuesday statement. Meanwhile, in Geneva, delegations to the conference continued arriving Tuesday as media outlets awaited their reaction to photographs purporting to show ""systematic torture and killing"" of detainees by the al-Assad regime. Could photos be a game changer? That assertion is being made by a team of internationally recognized war crimes prosecutors and forensic experts, who analyzed thousands of digital photos taken and provided by a Syrian defector codenamed ""Caesar,"" who, along with his family, is now living outside Syria in an undisclosed location. The experts' report was partly sponsored by the government of Qatar, which funded the British law firm Carter-Ruck to write it. Qatar and Saudi Arabia provide most of the outside support for Syria's rebel forces. The experts advancing the report are David Crane, the first chief prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone; Sir Desmond de Silva, the former chief prosecutor of the same special court; and Professor Sir Geoffrey Nice, former lead prosecutor against former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. They shared their findings in a joint exclusive this week with CNN's ""Amanpour"" and The Guardian newspaper. The experts contend their analysis -- based on thousands of photographs of the dead bodies of alleged detainees killed in Syrian government custody -- would stand up in an international criminal tribunal. In the photos, lifeless bodies show signs of starvation, brutal beatings, strangulation and other forms of torture and killing, according to the report. 4 things to know about Syria . In one group of images of 150 individuals examined in detail by the experts, 62% of the bodies showed emaciation -- severely low body weight with a hollow appearance indicating starvation. The majority of all of the victims were men most likely between ages 20 and 40. Stomachs, faces and even legs are concave -- sunken, rather than convex. On some torsos, bruising and bleeding is so severe that the victims' skin is a mosaic of black, red, purple and pink. Oblong and parallel wounds, a mix of bruises and torn skin, line one man's chest and torso, covering every inch of the victim's body from neck to pelvis. The forensics team identified the neck bruising as consistent with strangulation with a rope, piece of rubber, or other such object, as opposed to the marks that would be left by a hanging. De Silva likened the images to those of Holocaust survivors. The emaciated bodies were the product of starvation as a method of torture, ""reminiscent of the pictures of those (who) were found still alive in the Nazi death camps after World War II,"" de Silva said in a CNN interview. The report asserts the killing was orchestrated by Syria's highest levels of government. Haunting images of Syria's abandoned homes . A complex numbering system was used to catalog the corpses, with only the relevant Syrian intelligence service knowing the identities of the corpses. It was an effort, the report says, to keep track of which security service was responsible for the death, and then later to provide false documentation that the person had died in a hospital. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the photographs, documents and testimony referenced in the report and is relying on the conclusions of the team behind it, which includes international criminal prosecutors, a forensic pathologist, an anthropologist and an expert in digital imaging. The report draws its evidence from the testimony of a defector dubbed ""Caesar"" and almost 27,000 photographs he provided; in all 55,000 such images were taken out of the country. Caesar worked as photographer in the military police, and once the war broke out, his work consisted entirely of documenting ""killed detainees,"" the report said. He claimed to have photographed as many as 50 bodies a day. At one point he took the unusual step of photographing a group of bodies to show that it ""looked like a slaughterhouse,"" according to the report. Refugees starving to death in Syrian camp . The fact that all the bodies were photographed, the report's authors say, strongly suggests that ""the killings were systematic, ordered, and directed from above."" It is also possible that far from being a systematic plan to document human rights abuses, photographing the bodies was the unexamined continuation of a long-time practice. Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court. The only way the court could prosecute someone from Syria would be through a referral from the United Nations Security Council. But because of Russia's support for the al-Assad regime, and because it has veto power on the council, such a referral seems unlikely, at least for now. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against al-Assad began in March 2011, the United Nations says. A communique by last year's Geneva I conference calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war. Al-Assad has called for this week's conference to include a focus on ""fighting terrorism"" in Syria. Throughout the civil war, Syria has blamed violence on ""terrorists."" In a meeting with Syria's delegates to the talks, al-Assad directed them to preserve their nation's sovereignty by ""preventing and rejecting any foreign interference no matter its form and context,"" Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported Monday. Al-Assad also said no political solution could be reached without the agreement of the Syrian people and ""first and foremost the complete cessation of terrorism"" and its support by other countries, the news agency said.

"(CNN)Said and Cherif Kouachi, who are the leading suspects in Wednesday's attack on the magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, grew up in a world of poor job prospects, life in the French equivalent of the projects and prison time that is not untypical for the French ""underclass,"" which is disproportionately Muslim. On Friday, the two brothers were killed in a shootout with police, achieving their goal of a supposedly heroic ""martyrdom."" Before they died, one of the brothers spoke on the phone to a journalist from the French news network BFM saying, ""We are just telling you that we are the defenders of Prophet Mohammed. I was sent, me, Cherif Kouachi, by al Qaeda in Yemen. I went there and Sheikh Anwar Al-Awlaki financed my trip... before he was killed."" Anwar al-Awlaki was a Yemeni American cleric born in New Mexico who spent much of his life in his native United States, but he left in 2002 when he became the subject of intense FBI scrutiny. He traveled first to the United Kingdom and then to Yemen, where he joined al Qaeda, eventually rising to become the head of its operations to target the West. Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. Cherif Kouachi, the younger of the brothers had dreams of being a successful rapper that fizzled and later worked in  a series of menial jobs, including as a pizza delivery guy. He fell under the spell of a militant cleric in the 19th arrondissement, a gritty immigrant-dominated suburb of northeastern Paris that has little in common with the glamorous French capital city that is known to tourists. He was arrested by French authorities in 2005 when he was about to leave to fight in Iraq. He planned to travel to Iraq via Syria. This appears to be quite significant as the pipeline of Western ""foreign fighters"" traveling to Syria and then to Iraq during this time period was dominated by ""al Qaeda in Iraq,"" which was a precursor both of the Nusra Front, which is al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, and also of ISIS, which broke away from al Qaeda early last year. He was sentenced to three years in prison in 2008 for recruiting fighters to join in the Iraq War alongside the notorious leader of the al Qaeda affiliate there, Abu Musab al Zarqawi, but didn't serve any time after the conviction; the judge ruled that his pretrial detention had been enough. Nonetheless, Cherif's time in prison awaiting trial seems to have not only solidified his radicalization, but also connected him to people who were important in French militant circles  While in pretrial detention, Cherif met Djamel Beghal, who was in prison for his role in an attempted attack against the U.S. Embassy in Paris in 2001. Cherif and Beghal became friends and in 2010, when Beghal was released, he and Cherif allegedly planned the jail break of another radical Islamist who was serving a life sentence for his involvement in the bombing of the Musee d'Orsay train station in Paris in October 1995 that wounded 29 people. But prosecutors couldn't prove the conspiracy, and Cherif was released. Cherif Kouachi: 'I was ready to go and die in battle' While there is no particular economic profile of terrorists -- some are from privileged backgrounds and others are not -- it's interesting to note some of the similarities between the Kouachi brothers and the Tsarnaev brothers, who are alleged to have carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. The Tsarnaev brothers grew up in a working-class household in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The elder brother Tamerlan had dreams of becoming a world-class boxer but was unemployed when he carried out the Boston attacks. He had traveled to Dagestan in Russia in 2011 in an attempt to meet up with militants there. He also felt alienated from American society, telling an interviewer, ""I don't have a single American friend."" The Tsarnaevs were influenced by the jihadist propaganda of Awlaki. The Tsarnaevs, however, are not typical of American Muslims. For Muslims in the United States the ""American Dream"" has, on average, worked fairly well. They are as educated as most Americans and have similar incomes. This is often not the case for the Muslims of France, who make up the largest Muslim population of any country in the West. Consider that around 12% of the French population is Muslim, but as much as an astonishing 70% of its prison population is Muslim. According to a researcher at Stanford University, Muslim immigrants in France are two-and-a-half times less likely to be called for a job interview than a similar Christian candidate and Muslim incomes are around 15% below their Christian counterparts. Many Muslims, such as the Kouchai brothers, live in grim banlieue --suburbs of large French cities—that are not dissimilar to projects in the United States where there is little in the way of opportunity; they live divorced from mainstream French society. According to the Renseignements Généraux, a police agency that monitors militants in France, half of the neighborhoods with a high Muslim population are isolated from French social and political life. The French term for these neighborhoods is ""sensitive urban zones,"" where unemployment averages 45%. In short for French Muslims, there is no ""French Dream,"" nor, of course, any ""EU Dream."" It's also small wonder then that France has supplied more foreign fighters to the war in Syria -- around 700 -- than any other Western nation, including, possibly, one of the Kouachi brothers. After a series of bombings in France in 1995 carried out by militants with links to the former French colony of Algeria that included the Musee' d'Orsay attack, French authorities enacted harsh anti-terrorism laws that allow prosecutors to charge the mere intention to commit an act of terror as a crime and also to hold those suspected of such crimes for up to three years as prosecutors investigated their cases. Since then, France has been effective at thwarting terrorist attacks -- largely due to these laws and a robust intelligence service -- and only a few terror attacks, such as those that occurred this week have been successful. The laws, however, did not inhibit people from traveling to countries in the Middle East to join groups like ISIS and al Qaeda. Indeed, it did not stop Said Kouachi, the older of the two brothers involved in Wednesday's attack, from traveling to Yemen to train with al Qaeda in 2011. Charlie Hebdo attack: What we know and what we don't . Because of the recent travel of hundreds of French fighters to the Middle East, the French Parliament adopted new anti-terrorism laws in November to prevent French nationals from traveling abroad to fight. A travel ban can be imposed on French nationals when ""there are serious reasons to believe that someone is planning to travel abroad to take part in terrorist activities..."" The ban is effective for at least six months but can be renewed for up to two years. The law also allows for blocking websites that ""glorify terrorism"" in an attempt to counter radicalization online. With so many hundreds of French Islamist fighters traveling to the Middle East, hopefully, these kinds of measures will help to counter the kind of violence that took place in Paris over the course of this week.","Peter Bergen: As with some other French Muslims, the brothers were marginal, economically and socially .

"(CNN) -- Prince is back in a big way. The legendary musician is putting his reclusive reputation to the side to celebrate the simultaneous release of two albums out this week: ""Art Official Age"" and ""PlectrumElectrum,"" his first studio albums since 2010. ""Art Official Age"" is being billed as Prince's latest solo effort, while ""PlectrumElectrum"" is the first release from his band 3rdEyeGirl. The former is described as a classic Prince album: ""A contemporary concoction of soul, R&B and funk,"" a recent press release said. The latter is a live band record, featuring the musician surrounded by three female rockers. The hitmaker kicked off the week with a party livestreamed on Yahoo Tuesday night, his only scheduled performance surrounding the release. Rapper of the moment Kendrick Lamar joined the Purple One on stage, and the event included a rare tour of Paisley Park, Prince's legendary studio complex, where most of his recording over the years has taken place. The 90-minute event only contained three live performances, however. Prince also sought a greater social media influence, joining Facebook Tuesday to host a live Q&A with fans. The star might not have a full grasp on the requirements of being social online: It took Prince three hours to begin his answering duties, and he only ended up responding to one question. Prince now has 34 albums under his belt, but that doesn't mean he can't use the extra push. The ""Purple Rain"" star hasn't had a platinum album since 2004's ""Musicology,"" and hasn't had a song break the Top 40 since 1995. But he has been a consistent touring artist, and appears to have used 2014 to get his brand back into the pop culture consciousness. Indeed, he's been pretty un-reclusive so far this year. The Grammy winner kicked off the year with a guest star stint on the post-Super Bowl episode of ""New Girl,"" even releasing a duet with the show's star, Zooey Deschanel. The appearance was followed by a sold-out European tour and a headlining gig at the Essence Festival in New Orleans in July. The release marks Prince's return to Warner Bros. Records, which released many of the star's early hits. It was that break-up that sent the musician to change his name to a symbol moniker. Prince now owns the masters to his Warner Bros. recordings in a deal he was able to work out with the label. ""Art Official Age"" and ""PlectrumElectrum"" are both available for streaming on Spotify.","Prince released ""Art Official Age"" and ""PlectrumElectrum"" Tuesday.

"(CNN)After staying away from the news of the attack, Zunera Mazhar felt so outraged that she had to say something. ""Being a mother, having a 6-year-old daughter, how do I explain it to her? 'No, this is not us?' "" said the Muslim from Virginia. The immigration worker's powerful video message hit on the emotions some Muslims around the world were feeling: outrage, disgust and shame. ""I am just livid,"" said the 31-year-old. ""I don't know why we feel that it's OK to kill innocent people in the name of protecting something that does not need or require protection. I am really sorry to the whole world as a Muslim that we have some ignorant people that have taken some very ignorant actions in the name of faith."" To be clear, Mazhar and other Muslims who spoke to CNN were not apologizing for their beliefs -- some are apologizing to the world on behalf of their religion, sullied by the few Muslims extremists who attacked French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo this week. Of the 12 people who died, four were cartoonists and one was a Muslim police officer on the scene. Theresa Corbin, a self-described feminist, converted to Islam two months after September 11. The New Orleans resident wears a hijab and says she has felt more stares than normal after the Paris terror attack. ""I fear the attack will mean that people will be more likely to sneer at me, to call me names in public, or even attack me,"" she said. ""But I hope that it means that people will ask me questions about my faith and that I can make it clear that these attacks have no place in Islam."" I'm a feminist and I converted to Islam . Perception is also playing into Ahmad Basel Burghul's mind. The 20-year-old student from Istanbul, Turkey, is no longer thinking of studying abroad in France. The attack made him suspect that some French might look upon Muslims differently after Wednesday's attack. Meanwhile, Stephanie Dunbar Siam, an American living in Muscat, Oman, was initially angry at the ""hijackers"" of her religion. But she became angrier when she realized she would have to reassure the people around her that ""This is not Islam."" ""I want to reaffirm my intense alarm and disheartening at the deaths of the Charlie Hebdo staff members. But I will not apologize for my beliefs or my religion,"" she said. Siam sees this time as an opportunity to educate people. ""It means I will persevere even harder to learn more about my faith so I can counter misunderstanding and discrimination in a positive manner, the way Prophet Mohammed did it.""","Shame, anger and outrage are among emotions felt by Muslims since Paris attacks .

"(CNN) -- Hours before being honored for his peacemaking efforts, Tony Blair revealed a secret weapon: Bill Clinton. The former U.S. president was constantly on the phone with Blair during the Northern Ireland peace process in 1998, providing analysis and advice that proved crucial to reaching an agreement, the former British prime minister said Monday. ""He played an absolutely critical role,"" Blair said of Clinton on Monday as the two sat side-by-side to answer questions before the evening ceremony where Blair was to receive the 2010 Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""Without your intervention, we would never have achieved that peace in Northern Ireland,"" Blair said to Clinton, adding that he never had the chance to publicly thank him. Clinton and Blair sign autographs at event . The hour-long session featured anecdotes and rare insight on historical developments of the 1990s, when Clinton was U.S. president and Blair became the British prime minister. The Liberty Medal, an annual award given by the nonprofit constitution center that has Clinton as its board chairman, went to Blair this year for ""his steadfast commitment to conflict resolution,"" the group's website says. Along with the Northern Ireland peace agreement he helped mediate, Blair was cited for his role in Middle East peace negotiations and the work of his Tony Blair Faith Foundation in promoting global understanding. Asked about the necessary components for successful peace talks, Blair joked that ""blind luck"" was essential. He then listed the willingness of the participants, a framework agreement on basic principles and perseverance as the key factors. ""Never give up. No matter how difficult it is, no matter how hard it is, just keep going,"" Blair said as Clinton nodded in agreement. In the Northern Ireland talks, Blair said, the acute focus on the negotiations created an expectation that helped force participants to reach an agreement. ""It was, in a sense, luck that we got into such a hothouse atmosphere that people began to feel it was more embarrassing not to do the deal than to do it,"" Blair said. Clinton added that it was important for outside parties to help warring nations or factions realize the benefits and future possibilities of peace. ""We've got to paint a picture of what this is like at the end of the road, and we have to be there to help maximize the benefits and minimize the risks,"" Clinton said. On several occasions, Blair mentioned particular advice or help he received from Clinton, such as strong U.S. support for European intervention in the Kosovo conflict to stop forced removals and killings of Muslims by Serb forces. ""The truth is, without America and without President Clinton coming in, we couldn't have handled that,"" Blair said. Such backing reflected the longstanding ""special"" relationship between their countries, and Blair insisted that the shifting global dynamics of the 21st century made that partnership more vital than ever. He called the relationship ""something living and breathing now, with relevance today and tomorrow, and we should keep it."" To Clinton, the shifting role of the two industrial powers made their relationship important for everyone. ""On balance, it's been a good thing for the world because we're not imperialists anymore and whatever we do, we do partly because we have a capacity most other countries don't,"" he said. Both men listed the economic rise of China as a major current issue, and Blair also mentioned the growing role of religious extremism. ""It's there, and it's powerful and it's not, I'm afraid, going away,"" he said. For his part, Clinton said, a changing dynamic in the Arab world made a Middle East peace agreement more possible now than 10 years ago, when he was president. Back then, he said, Arab leaders privately encouraged him to seek an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement but were unable to publicly endorse a proposed deal for political reasons. Now, he said, the Arab world fears the rise of Iran as a regional power and threat, and therefore seeks a sustainable relationship with the United States and Israel. ""The most hopeful thing is that the Arabs want this done,"" Clinton said of renewed peace talks guided by his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.","Former British premier will receive medal from nonprofit center .

"Washington (CNN)Mike Huckabee is releasing a new book as the former Arkansas governor prepares for a potential 2016 presidential run, and it covers everything — from reality television to government surveillance (in a curiously-named chapter ""Bend over and take it like a prisoner!""). We read ""God, Guns, Grits and Gravy"" and rounded up all the info you might not know about the former Arkansas governor: . 1. He's got a surprisingly thorough familiarity with pop culture — and very little patience for it. Huckabee thinks Miley Cyrus is a bad dancer but Beyonce is a good one. He describes Cyrus' 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance as one in which she ""contorted her barely-clad, barely legal-age body in a disgustingly pornographic performance that showed just about everything she had — except talent — and focused national attention on a new term, 'twerking,' which describes a vulgar movement better saved for a stripper pole than prime-time television."" Beyonce, however, is ""incredibly talented ... has an exceptional set of pipes"" and ""is a terrific dancer — without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom."" But he didn't like her dance with husband Jay Z during the 2014 Grammy Awards to their song ""Drunk in Love."" ""Jay-Z is a very shrewd businessman, but I wonder: Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?"" Huckabee wrote of the performance. WATCH: Grammys 2014: Performances . He's also not a big fan of Rihanna's style. ""I've seen dusty pickup truck windshields that were less see-through than the mesh 'dress' Rihanna recently 'wore' on the red carpet at a fashion show,"" he noted. (The Council of Fashion Designers of America, which awarded her its 2014 Fashion Icon Award — an event that prompted the dress — would probably disagree.) And don't even get him started on reality television, which takes up an entire chapter of his book. Huckabee appears to be familiar with The Real World, Survivor and the Bachelorette — and has problems with all of them. Later in the book, Huckabee compares a government without checks and balances to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off on steroids (and boozed up)."" ""[The Founding Fathers] knew that the sheer power of [the government] is an intoxicant and that most of the people who enter government will be like sixteen-year-old boys with keys to the liquor cabinet whose parents are gone for the weekend,"" he writes. Huckabee also name-drops Lady Gaga twice. 2. His views on gay marriage are more nuanced than you'd think. Huckabee recounts in the book that he got his introduction to the idea of homosexuality from a Boy Scout troop leader who was molesting members of his troop. ""To be clear, I am not equating all gay men with pedophiles; I'm just relating how this particular person was my introduction to the then-unfathomable concept of same-sex attraction,"" he notes. Describing his outlook as ""God-centered and not man-centered,"" Huckabee offers up some questions on homosexuality: . ""Are such variations normal? Which ones? Are there any limits on what is an acceptable attraction? If so, what is the objective basis for those limits, and who gets to draw that line?"" He later adds: ""Is Lady Gaga correct when she sings about being 'Born this Way'?"" And yet, he declares: ""The claim that same-sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated."" ""Christians who themselves abandoned the primacy of lifelong marriage to follow the divorce and remarriage customs of a secular society have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage,"" he adds. 3. He has a soft side. ""I think of myself as a pretty sensitive guy. I'm not callous or cold. I've been known to cry at movies, particularly when a dog dies or a kid gets hurt. That's why I couldn't even see Marley & Me and had to sit in the theater until everyone left before I exited after sitting through My Dog Skip."" 4. He's not particularly pleased with conservative outside groups . Huckabee faced opposition from the Club for Growth during his 2008 run for president, and apparently still holds a grudge. He writes that ""groups like Club for Growth are basically 'pay for play,'"" and says big donors can write checks to the Club and ""it will do the dirty work for you."" ""It's a coward's way to fight,"" Huckabee writes. Huckabee goes on to compare the battle for conservative purity forged by some of those outside groups to, well, mass-shooters and suicide bombers. ""I really don't think [Fort Hood shooter] Nidal Hasan is the role model the GOP wants to emulate. We should leave the kind of Sunni/Shiite fights for the real jihadists. The goal of conservatives should be to build up America -- not blow up the Republican Party."" 5. He's got a lotta love for some of his potential 2016 opponents — but disdain for others. Huckabee praises and defends a handful of potential 2016 opponents. He gushes over Mitt Romney, calling him ""a good man with impeccable integrity in his personal and business life,"" praises Rick Perry for recruiting businesses to come to Texas during his time as governor, and defends his work with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Common Core. He makes no mention of Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz or Rand Paul, but does implicitly knock the prospect that they all might run for president while serving in the Senate. During his last run, he says, ""I saw others who were sitting members of Congress or the Senate, who would still receive the paycheck plus all their benefits that I helped pay for, and yet never had to show up for work to get the check!"" he writes. ""Nice work if you can get it!"" 6. His verdict on the Obamas' parenting skills is still out. Huckabee says that he's ""generally admired the parenting instincts of the First Couple,"" but is appalled that they let their daughters listen to Jay-Z and Beyonce's ""Drunk in Love."" ""With the First Lady so concerned about making sure her daughters' bellies don't ingest unhealthy food, how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics?"" 7. He's allergic to cigarette smoke . ""I suppose I'm lucky to be highly allergic to tobacco smoke, because I've never smoked a single cigarette and never wanted to.""","Former Arkansas Gov.

"(CNN)A convicted rapist needs to ""rethink"" his strategy as he attempts to resume his professional football career, according to the chief of player welfare in the game in Britain. Ched Evans had been on the cusp of a move to Oldham Athletic, which plays in English football's third tier, but the club pulled out of the deal because of ""unbearable pressure"" on its staff. Linked with a return to former club Sheffield United last year, Evans remains without a club after being released from prison in October having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl. Both Oldham and Sheffield United were dissuaded from signing Evans due to pressure from sponsors as well as criticism from leading politicians and also the British public, with thousands signing petitions against his proposed moves. Asked if Evans looked likely to sign for another British side,  chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor told the BBC: ""At this moment in time, you would have to say you'd be very doubtful of that. ""It may well be he would have to go abroad but at the moment because he's out on license he can't go abroad so we need a serious rethink now."" Previously refused leave to appeal, Evan's case is now before the Criminal Cases Review Commission, an independent body that reviews potential miscarriages of justice. Hull manager Steve Bruce admitted he had backed Oldham to sign Evans and also believes the Criminal Cases Review Commission will be key to his hopes of playing again. ""I might be upsetting people but there is a question of the rape and how he's been convicted by a jury,"" said Bruce in his press conference prior to Saturday's English Premier League game between Hull and West Bromwich Albion. ""When you do look at the case and look at the evidence then certainly Ched has got a case. ""For me the appeal can't come quick enough for Ched. It must be a frustrating and difficult time for him and I think the events of the appeal, for me, will see Ched be allowed to play football again."" Sheffield United, whom Evans originally joined on leaving Manchester City in 2009, pulled out of their initial approach to sign the player on his release from prison in October following a 160,000-strong petition against the move. And more than 60,000 people signed a petition calling on Oldham not sign Evans. Hartlepool also signaled their interest only to then back away,  while a potential move to Maltese club Hibernians was quashed when the Ministry of Justice clarified its zero-tolerance policy on sex offenders working abroad. Evans' case has also put PFA chief Taylor under pressure after he likened the situation with Evans to that of the families of the 96 people that lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. The tragedy struck following a crush of people at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield. After years of appeals by the families involved over the miscarriage of justice, an inquest is now ongoing into events and culpability surrounding the tragedy. ""He wouldn't have been the first person to be found guilty, maintained their innocence and be proved right.,"" said Taylor in an interview with the BBC, referring to Evans. ""We know that happened with Hillsborough. ""It's now unraveling and very different to how it was portrayed at the time, indeed by the police at the time."" Taylor's comments led to calls for him to stand down from his post while Dr Phil Scraton, the main author of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report, wrote to him concerning his ""ill-judged"" remarks. ""Drawing Hillsborough into the maelstrom that has surrounded the Evans case... while suggesting a parallel between these two entirely distinct cases demonstrates not only poor judgment but also extraordinary naivety,"" Scraton wrote. Taylor has since backtracked on his previous remarks apologizing for any offense called. ""I wasn't comparing the case but I was looking for a comparison of the principle really of people looking to have the right to maintaining their innocence and how it's become a national issue and campaign with regard to Ched Evans,"" said Taylor In an interview with BBC Radio. ""In no way was it a comparison of the offenses, it was the principle of establishing the truth and his right to do that. ""As it has turned out, I don't want to upset any of the Hillsborough family support groups. ""We've always been supportive of them. It's far from that. I admire the way, the tenacity and determination to get to the truth and that was the point I was looking to make. ""The last thing I was wanting to do was offend any of them -- quite the opposite. ""And with Ched Evans of course he similarly has that right. He's done his time in prison and has done longer in prison than normal because he's determined to prove his innocence and has the right to return to work."" Under current rules, Evans is permitted to return to playing football despite still serving his conviction on license. But chairman of the Football Association Greg Dyke admitted the regulations may change the over eligibility of players to return to the game under certain circumstances. In the first statement from the FA amid the Evans furore, Dyke said in a statement: ""Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable. This cannot be overstated. ""We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in some detail at the FA and we have examined both the legal requirements and our rules and regulations, and there is no basis for us to intervene directly in this particular case. ""That said, it is important that we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognize the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a participating member of the national game. ""I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct. ""The FA will certainly be considering it in line with our own ongoing review of what constitutes public or private communications and behavior.""","Players' chief Gordon Taylor warns convicted rapist Ched Evans he needs to ""rethink"" strategy .

"(CNN)If you are fan of goal-packed football matches look away now. And whatever you do steer well clear of Aston Villa. In the English Premier League, often described as the most entertaining in the world, the Birmingham-based team are a mundane anomaly. With over half of the current season gone, Villa are the Premier League's lowest scorers with 11 goals in 20 games. That miserly total is the lowest of all the 92 clubs in England's four-tier football pyramid, with only Germany's Hamburg dipping below Villa's scoring ratio of one goal every 1.8 games. In Spain, leaders Real Madrid have rattled in 56 goals in 16 games, while over in Germany, Bayern Munich have notched 41 goals in 17 games. In Italy, a league that prides itself on defensive ruthlessness and was so in love with the idea of defence they even invented a word for it -- Catenaccio -- leaders Juventus are averaging two goals every game. So if European football is the land of goalscoring gunslingers, Villa are very much the stumbling drunk crouching behind the saloon door. For the hardy souls who attend the team's matches, now is the winter of their discontent. In the seven matches Villa have played at their Villa Park stadium, Paul Lambert's shot-shy side has managed just seven goals. To put that into context, fans who own season tickets have been paying between $25 and $46 per goal. It's hardly surprising that the team played in front of its lowest Premier League attendance since 1999 during a December match against Southampton. Three Premier League players, Sergio Aguero, Diego Costa and Charlie Austin, have scored more league goals this season than the entire Villa team, while league leaders Chelsea and second placed Manchester City have each scored four times as many goals as the Birmingham team. Even England's two cup competitions have proved scant consolation for those Villa fans hoping their team might just cut loose away from the fevered pressure of the Premier League. Villa lost in the League Cup to third tier Leyton Orient -- failing to score in the process. The FA Cup did provide a goal -- just the one mind -- though even then the Villa took 88 minutes to get off the mark before Christian Benteke's strike earned a 1-0 win over second tier Blackpool. At times Villa fans must have felt the football Gods were truly conspiring against them. How else to explain that first-tier Bournemouth recently turned up in the Midlands city to play Villa's rivals Birmingham City and won 8-0 -- as many goals as the Villans have scored in their home city all season. Despite the team's unerring defiance of the very essence of the sport, it's not all bad news for Villa fans with the team sitting in a surprisingly healthy league position. With only five wins to their name this season, Villa still find themselves 12th in the table six places and five points clear of the relegation zone -- the bottom three positions of the 20-team league. This weekend they face bottom team Leicester City who, despite having picked up just 14 points to Villa's 22, have scored eight more goals heading into Saturday's match. Social media has been a release mechanism for the club's fans, with many using statistics to damn Villa's lousy performances, with manager Paul Lambert taking his fair share of the flak. Villa are the only side in the Premier League yet to have a substitute score a goal this season. And it's probably fair to say that Lambert couldn't be described as a game-changing manager when it comes to the art of substitutions -- just three goals have been scored by substitutes during the 96 top-flight games Lambert has overseen. According to Lambert it's not just his shot-shy team that are responsible for Villa's goal drought. ""There's been some good goalkeeping in games and some poor finishing,"" Lambert told reporters ahead of the Boxing Day game against Swansea -- a match that Villa lost 1-0. ""It's not a lack of confidence. That's just the way it is. ""Things have gone against us in the last third, there's been good goalkeeping. ""But if the lads keep creating chances they will go in. ""I don't have a problem -- as long as they keep going into those areas to miss them."" Villa have now gone three league games without a goal -- the last time the opposition net bulged in a league match was on December 20 in the 1-1 home draw against Manchester United. Their goal in that match was scored by Christian Benteke, a Belgian striker who actually does know where the net is, but has only played 10 league games due to injury and suspension. The 24-year-old's record of 37 goals in 79 games since joining Villa in 2012 is impressive, making Villa's difficulties all the more baffling. If you have the misfortune of watching Villa this weekend, spare a thought for the forlorn Benteke. History shows that Villa are not alone in their Premier League impotence and it's a story that might just provide a ray of hope for Villa's long suffering supporters. Everton matched Villa's uninspiring total at the same stage of the 2005-06 campaign, although the Merseyside club did give their supporters something to cheer about in the remaining 18 games of that season by scoring 23 goals. Remarkably, two teams have registered lowing goalscoring totals at this stage of a Premier League season. Derby and Manchester City both had just 10 goals after 20 games of the 1995-96 and 2007-08 seasons respectively.","Aston Villa have scored just 11 goals during the 2014-15 Premier League season .

"""The Avengers"" have conquered America -- for one weekend, at least. The superhero smorgasbord featuring Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The Hulk brought in $200.3 million its opening weekend in 4,300 U.S. theaters, smashing the previous domestic record for any movie's first three days, Walt Disney Studios said Sunday in a news release. While ""The Avengers"" was predicted to be a hit, the performance outpaced expectations. Box Office Mojo, for instance, had projected the film would pull in $172.5 million on its opening weekend. Its ultimate domestic haul is well ahead of the $168 million ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" conjured up in its opening weekend domestically in July. The stateside fun for Disney and the comic book-inspired cast began on Friday when the movie took in $80.5 million, a figure that the studio described as the second-highest one-day domestic total. Saturday's receipts added up to $69.7 million, which Disney said was a record for that weekend day. Add international ticket sales since opening April 25 -- including openings in Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the Philippines -- and "" The Avengers"" has already amassed $641.8 million in its first 12 days. Its success is another boon for the movie industry, which racked up about $2.3 billion at the U.S. box office for the first three months of 2012 -- up almost 46% from a year earlier, according to Box Office Mojo. Still, in some ways Hollywood had nowhere to go but up after posting its worst year for ticket sales in 2011 in 16 years. ""It's already started out to be a strong year,"" James Gross, analyst with Buckingham Research, said of 2012. Before ""The Avengers"" burst on the scene, ""The Hunger Games"" from Lionsgate had been this year's box-office champ, taking in an estimated $155 million domestically in its first weekend. Other might-be blockbusters on the horizon include ""Men in Black III"" hitting theaters Memorial Day weekend, and ""Brave,"" the latest animated feature from Pixar due in June. And two other comic-inspired vehicles, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" are also on the summer movie calendar. The success of ""The Avengers"" comes on the heels of Disney's epic flop ""John Carter,"" which lost an estimated $200 million and cost the head of the company's studio unit his job. ""This is happening at the right time for them to erase that ugly memory,"" said Box Office Mojo analyst Reagen Sulewski. Disney gained the rights to the characters from ""The Avengers"" with its $4 billion purchase of comic book publisher Marvel three years ago.","""The Avengers"" earns $200.3 million in the U.S. its first weekend, Disney says .
That beats the $168 million opening weekend record of the last ""Harry Potter"" film .
Having opened internationally April 25, ""The Avengers"" has taken in $642 million worldwide ."
"(CNN) -- The new trailer for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is, in a word, ""Hulktastic."" Marvel and Disney unleashed the first official look at the next Avengers movie on Wednesday night, not long after a leaked version made its way online, and now May can't come fast enough. The two-minute clip features everything Marvel fans could've asked for, between James Spader's chilling narration as Ultron, the introduction of Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver, and the glimpse of Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor. Not to mention the well-played use of ""I've Got No Strings"" from Disney's ""Pinocchio,"" which serves as an eerie soundtrack for the destruction that unravels in the clip. The teaser trailer for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" wasn't supposed to make its debut until Tuesday's episode of ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" but that plan was scrapped shortly after Wednesday's leak. Marvel went ahead and released both the official teaser trailer and a teaser poster to boot after giving a good-natured response to the rogue teaser. Most fan reaction to the ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" clip has been one of total rapture.

"September 11 has been somewhat eclipsed in the last decade by a more notorious anniversary, but it remains a date etched in Chileans' minds: in 1973, this was the day General Augusto Pinochet seized power from the democratically elected Socialist government of Salvador Allende. Forty years after that sudden coup, and 23 years since its return to democracy, Chile is still recovering from the effects of Pinochet's brutal rule. Its relevance today may not be immediately obvious. The world's attention is focused firmly on the Middle East, particularly the brutal civil war in Syria. As the international community debates what its responsibilities might be, people are dying. The shadow of Iraq looms large, obscuring and darkening the potential consequences of humanitarian intervention. Yet among all this, Chile's influence can be felt. Javier Zuniga, 70, is a Mexican human rights activist and special advisor at Amnesty International; he argues that ""what happened in Chile goes beyond its borders, because it shook the international community into understanding that human rights violations were the business of everybody, inside Chile and outside Chile."" Zuniga visited the country many times during Pinochet's rule, documenting abuses and disappearances, and has since campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the relatives of the disappeared. Four decades after coup, divisions remain in Chile . Carlos Reyes-Manzo is one of many thousands who were detained and tortured by the Pinochet regime. Now 68 and living in London, before the coup he worked for the Allende government, specifically for Chile Films, while also working as part of the Socialist Party. When the government was overthrown, he remembers how suddenly it happened: ""In a way, we were expecting something would happen. [But] we never expected it would happen so quickly, and in such a way."" By sheer luck, Reyes-Manzo had been at meetings when the militia raided his apartment, and initially avoided capture. Seeing what was happening, he decided to head for the Socialist Party headquarters in the center of Santiago. ""It was quite near to the presidential palace, and on my way I saw bodies in the street. The military immediately started shooting and killing people... And very soon they put fire to the Socialist Party headquarters."" Carlos pauses. ""That was the day, there was just shooting everywhere and killing everywhere."" By the end of that bloody day, President Allende was dead, having committed suicide as troops stormed the presidential palace. Within 24 hours, the Socialist government had been deposed and replaced by a military junta. Some were pleased, particularly in the United States, where the coup enjoyed the covert support of the Nixon administration. Allende's sweeping nationalizations and quite radical reforms had proved unpalatable for many Chileans and outside observers, particularly transnational corporations. After the coup, free market economic policies were pursued with vigor, inspired by the theories of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and others. As for the Socialist Party members, Reyes-Manzo recalls what happened next: ""The leaders of the party were detained, some were killed, and some went underground. I went underground myself. So I spent six months underground, working there, just trying to get everything back into place... [Eventually] someone I was working with gave my name and I was detained. They came to my house and almost ransacked everything... I was with two little children and was taken away."" Reyes-Manzo spent months in detention, being moved around to different locations and tortured regularly. In one prison, he found he recognized the voice of the person in charge: it belonged to a man called Romo, whom he had known before the coup -- not that this changed anything. ""They were not shy -- in a way they wanted you to know who they were."" Zuniga says ""the torturers were mentally prepared to torture because they felt they were defending the country."" Today, Reyes-Manzo still remains baffled by this. ""It was impossible for them to believe that what they were doing was wrong. This is the kind of ideology where you've convinced the people it's right to torture, right to kill, right to rape the women, right to... whatever they did, that it was right."" He shakes his head. ""And that was incredible."" Eventually, Reyes-Manzo managed an extraordinary escape. He was first exiled to Panama, before being kidnapped again by the Chilean secret police. They intended to take him back to Santiago, but first the plane had to stop over at London's Heathrow Airport. He says, ""When I arrived to London, I realised it was my only chance to escape."" Fortunately, he says, his guards had gotten drunk and had fallen asleep. ""I dashed outside the plane, and asked for political asylum."" Reyes-Manzo spoke practically no English, and was nearly returned to Chile -- at the time, the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and General Pinochet had a famously close relationship. However, he managed to contact Amnesty International, who in turn got Lord Avebury to raise the case in parliament. Asylum was granted, ""and it saved my life, that's why I'm here."" So what lessons can the events of Chile 40 years ago offer to us today? ""Some of the lessons are quite clear,"" Zuniga says. ""What happens inside the country is not just a matter for the national authorities. Human rights are something that we are all responsible for. When there is a disappearance in Chile, or in Argentine, or in other countries [like] Sri Lanka, the Philippines, it is also humanity that is aggressed. I am aggressed. I am also a victim of these violations, even if it's not in my country. Because I am a human being... The lesson of Chile is that these human rights are a responsibility of everybody."" Of course, such platitudes don't make the dilemmas presented in Egypt, Syria and elsewhere any easier to grapple with -- and Zuniga accepts that international treaties and humanitarian agreements don't themselves prevent violations and violence. ""You also need the political will of governments inside the countries, and those who are outside to exert the pressure to help the people who are victims,"" Zuniga says. ""And you can see that that is not working the case of Syria."" Nevertheless, Zuniga says organizations such as Amnesty are ready. ""Even in very difficult circumstances, it's very important to document violations... Certainly the lessons of other countries like Chile and Argentina [are that] when the conflict ends, then it will be time for accountability."" Though he has travelled around the world's most troubled and violent regions for decades, Zuniga is not despondent. He points to the ongoing trial of 92-year-old Siert Bruins, a former Nazi SS officer, as an example that international law has a long memory. ""It takes time,"" he says. ""But there will be justice.""","September 11, 1973 was date Salvador Allende's government overthrown in coup .
Many thousands were detained and tortured by Augusto Pinochet's regime .
After the coup, free market economic policies were pursued with vigor .

"Washington (CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's political brand is built almost entirely around a single personality trait: authenticity. He's a self-styled what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of politician, unapologetic that his blunt style can come across as brash. The approach has earned Christie plenty of love for being himself and sets him apart from other potential 2016 presidential contenders such as Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, who often come across as stiffer and more disciplined. Christie's authenticity was on full display this week when he stood by his beloved Dallas Cowboys. In the face of Internet bullies who shunned his love for America's Team or mocked his bear hug with Jerry Jones, Christie brazenly defended his lifelong loyalty for an out-of-state team that's either the most loved or most hated franchise in the NFL. ""You are who you are as a fan,"" the Republican said in a radio interview on Monday. While he faced scrutiny for his long-distance affair with the Cowboys, he won some admiration for not pandering all these years by switching to a local team. Former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe tweeted that it ""takes guts"" for Christie to back the rival Cowboys when he's ""surrounded by Giants, Jets & Eagles fans."" But Christie's insistence on remaining true to himself is the same quality that has gotten him in trouble over the years and, if left unchecked, could run the risk of being seen as more schtick than authentic. It was just a few months ago when Christie shouted at a heckler who was interrupting an event to ""sit down and shut up!""  The moment became instant fuel for critics to push a narrative of Christie as a bully and paint the governor as a loose cannon who's not ready for the presidential stage. In an interview with NBC's Matt Lauer, Christie argued that he never lost control and knew exactly what he was doing when he gave the heckler a verbal beat down. ""I'm not going to change, Matt. This is who I am,"" he said. Asked whether Christie can learn to hide that part of his personality, the governor said ""there's no hope in that."" Trying to get it just right . Voters often say they're looking for real, genuine candidates. But striking that perfect balance of authenticity without being too hot or too cold is ""one of the most difficult lines to navigate"" for a politician, said GOP strategist Ford O'Connell. It's a tough cycle to break out of, experts say. No one is perfect and if a candidate tries to be himself or herself entirely, flaws will eventually be exposed. But those flaws could result in criticism or negative media coverage, which then prompts politicians to be more guarded. There's no steadfast rule to finding just the right middle ground. ""And that balance is different for every candidate because you don't know what the candidate is going to do until you shine the spotlight on them,"" O'Connell said. Craig Shirley, a presidential historian who's written two books on Ronald Reagan, says the authenticity factor for voters dates back to President Andrew Jackson and has seen periods of popularity off and on ever since. Its most recent resurgence started with Jimmy Carter in 1976, not long after Richard Nixon resigned amid the Watergate scandal. ""The American people had had it with all the corruption in Washington,"" he said. Carter frequently used the word ""trust"" in his campaign and invoked his Christian and farmer roots as a way to build a populist reputation. ""People were just hungry for something different."" Previous elections . During the 2012 Republican primaries, Mitt Romney was often accused of being too robotic and not showing his true cards. Newt Gingrich called him out on a primary debate stage once, telling him to cut the ""pious baloney."" The rebuke came after Romney answered a question about why he didn't run for re-election as governor of Massachusetts. Romney said he simply wanted to help the state get into good shape, then return to the private sector. ""For me, politics is not a career,"" Romney said. Yet in reality, Romney ran for president shortly thereafter in 2007, and in addition to his successful 2002 bid for governor, he ran for Senate in a failed 1994 attempt. Similarly, Al Gore was noted for having difficulty appearing comfortable in his own skin and was criticized for trying to adopt a regular guy persona. In The Politics of Authenticity in Presidential Campaigns, author Erica J. Seifert notes that voters in 2000 sided with Gore on nearly every issue in the polls, but fell well behind George W. Bush on questions about character, honesty and personality. Whether voters consider a candidate authentic is also heavily dependent on how successful opponents are at defining them. President Barack Obama's campaign and allies, for example, spent millions trying to craft Romney as greedy and out-of-touch because of his background in private equity. Clinton also been accused of struggling with authenticity, particularly during her 2000 Senate campaign in New York when she said she was a lifelong Yankees fan despite having grown up as a fan of her hometown team, the Chicago Cubs. Clinton struggled to connect with voters during much of her 2008 campaign. Clinton's supporters argue she was in fact a Yankees fan as a child and photos from 1992 published in her 2003 memoir ""Living History"" show her in a New York hat. Still, Christie mentioned the Clinton example in a 2013 radio interview defending his adoration of the Cowboys. ""I'm not going to be Hillary Clinton, OK? I'm not going to, you know, be a Cubs fan my whole life, and then when I go to run for office in another state, pretend I'm a Yankee fan,"" he said ""I don't think there's anything--in sports--more reprehensible than that."" A challenging cycle . On the flip side, when politicians try to be themselves in the public eye, they may wind up saying or doing something that people find politically incorrect, offensive or careless. Vice President Joe Biden has gotten in trouble for being too candid at times, or as some like to say, Biden just being Biden. He took his freewheeling approach to the Senate this week, where he joked around -- sometimes awkwardly -- with senators and their families as he swore in lawmakers for a new term. One of Biden's most memorable moments was when he endorsed same-sex marriage in May 2012, before President Obama had officially evolved on the issue. Biden has frequently tried to clarify his off-the-cuff remarks with a go-to line: ""No one ever doubts I mean what I say, but sometimes I say all that I mean."" Renowned surgeon and conservative activist Ben Carson, who's known for making controversial comments, is also sometimes too honest for his own good, his spokesman acknowledged last month. ""If I could create the Webster's dictionary of words Dr. Carson could use in the campaign, there would be some words I'd leave out,"" Terry Giles told the Washington Post. ""Like 'Nazi' or 'Hitler.'"" Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist and pollster, said a good politician is almost by definition careful with what they say and how they say it. ""That doesn't mean they can't be candid or they can't be clear or they can't say what they mean, but it does mean that they can't say the first words that come into their brains without thinking about the consequences,"" he said. Christie is certainly aware that he has to tone himself down at times. When he was in Mexico last September, reporters noticed the governor was acting more guarded and restrained than his normal Jersey Guy self. In an interview with the New York Times, he acknowledged that he can be ""flamboyant"" at times. ""But it doesn't mean that's the way I am all of the time,"" he added. Being able to adjust to different contexts is an important perquisite for leadership, he continued. ""You know, I have more than one club in the bag, and I've demonstrated that over time,"" he said. It's unclear whether voters in Iowa or South Carolina will buy Christie's explanation, or whether it will break past opposition ads and attacks against his personality. Christie has dismissed such skepticism as ""garbage"" and forcefully defended his style in a radio interview this summer. ""Yeah there are some ... regional differences in our country. But in the end, people like people who are genuine, who are real,"" he continued. ""People who are real do well. And they're happy, too."" ""I would rather lose than try to pretend to be somebody else,"" he added. O'Connell, the GOP strategist, acknowledges there's always a risk in being too much of yourself on the campaign trail. But at the end of the day, he argued, ""it's better to be too authentic than to be too plastic."" CNN's David Chalian and Dan Merica contributed to this report.","Chris Christie's fierce loyalty to the Cowboys demonstrates the governor's authenticity .

"(CNN) -- They say the first step to overcoming a problem is realizing you have one in the first place. If you asked me whether I'm addicted to my smartphone or whether I overuse it, I would say absolutely not. I pride myself on not keeping my devices (I have two of them!) in my bedroom while I sleep, and keeping them out of reach on the kitchen counter when I'm home with my kids. But, every time I walk into the kitchen, I find myself checking my email and Twitter feed. There's almost a gravitational pull toward my BlackBerry and iPhone even when I know the chance that there is anything I need to see at that moment is next to zero. I feel that same pull the minute I wake up and make checking my devices one of the first things I do once I get out of bed. Those behaviors alone probably put me in the ""you have a problem"" camp, but I'm sorry to say there's now even more evidence. I recently took the ""Smartphone Abuse Test,"" an online quiz administered by the Center for Technology and Internet Addiction, one of the few organizations focused on the issue. 'I've got a problem' The quiz asks questions like: ""Do you find yourself spending more time on your Smartphone than you realize?"" and ""Do you feel reluctant to be without your Smartphone, even for a short time?"" If you answer ""yes"" to more than five of the 15 questions, ""you might benefit by examining how much time you spend on your Smartphone,"" according to the quiz. I answered ""yes"" to 11 questions. I've got a problem, and I'm not alone. Dr. David Greenfield, the director of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, says around 90% of Americans would fall in the category of overusing, abusing or misusing their devices, according to a recent nationwide telephone survey he did with 1,000 people in conjunction with AT&T. ""The analogy that I use is right before they go to bed, the last thing they do before they pass out is check their phone and the minute they open their eyes, they check their phone,"" said Greenfield during an interview. ""Doesn't that sound like a smoker? This is what we used to hear with smokers is that the last thing they would do before they go to bed is they'd have their last cigarette."" 61% of respondents in the survey said they regularly sleep with their cell or smartphone turned on under their pillow or next to their bed, and more than 50% feel uncomfortable when they leave their smartphone at home or in the car, or when they have no service or their phone is broken. Signs you are truly addicted . Greenfield, who is also author of ""Virtual Addiction: Help for Netheads, Cyber Freaks and Those Who Love Them,"" says fewer people would actually be classified as addicted to their devices. That number is around 10 to 12%, according to his latest research. ""What puts somebody in that category is they are using it to a point where they are experiencing some degree of withdrawal. They are developing intolerance, meaning they are using it more and more,"" said Greenfield, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. ""They are using it like a drug so they're bored, they pick up the phone. They're tired, they pick up the phone. They're lazy, they pick up their phone. They're angry, they pick up the phone. They're lonely, they pick up the phone."" To fall into the addicted camp, Greenfield also says your smartphone use has to have ""some deleterious impact on a major life sphere, whether it's an impact on your work, your academic performance, your home life, primary relationship, parenting, legal status."" ""Let's say you get pulled over and get a ticket for texting and driving. There has to be some negative impact generally for us to say you have a problem,"" Greenfield said. And while the majority of Americans wouldn't be classifed as addicted, and are more likely overusing their devices, there is a fair amount of denial at work, he said. Greenfield's research found that while 98% of respondents said that texting while driving is dangerous, nearly 75% admit having done it. ""Just like drinking and driving, people have a very poor perception of impact, so, in other words, people will be doing their normal thing,"" he said. ""They'll be driving and balancing their cell phone and drinking their coffee, and they'll say to you, and they'll mean it, that they are not impacted ... but actually we know from a lot of data and research that that is absolutely not true."" PHOTOS: Our mobile 'addiction' So how else can you tell if you might be addicted to your smartphone or if you fall in the larger category of your smartphone use getting out of hand? I asked on social media and got a tremendous response from people who were on their smartphones at the time! Here are ten of my favorite responses: . Ten signs you may have a problem . 1. When you check your phone to see the current temperature instead of opening a window, and/or when you check your phone to see the current time instead of looking at the watch that's right on your wrist. (I just did this!) 2. When you have to consciously say to your spouse ""Let's put our phones away"" while watching TV because it's more common that they're out than away. 3. If you are answering emails in a dimly lit reception area while waiting for your massage therapist to destress you, you may have a problem. (OK, I've done this too!) 4. When your kids have to text you their carry-out orders because you've lost the ability to retain information that is not received on your phone. 5. When you hope you hit a bunch of red lights on the way home so you can comment on a Facebook post. 6. When one of your daughter's first drawings of you has a BlackBerry in your hand. 7. When you wake up, you grab your phone and check it before you get up to pee. 8. When you drop a phone on your face because you're dozing off. 9. When you choose your clothing based on the best pockets to hold your phone. 10. When you are staring at photos you took on your phone while the actual moment is taking place right in front of you. (Done that too!) I promised ten but here is one more that cracked me up: If you let your lunch get cold so you could answer a query -- on your smartphone -- about signs you may have a problem with your devices. Do you think you are addicted to your smartphone or have a problem with how much you use it?

"A group of current and former soccer players has filed a lawsuit against FIFA, claiming football's world governing body isn't doing enough to manage the issue of concussion in the game. The action, which is also targeted at U.S. Youth Soccer, American Youth Soccer and others, alleges these groups have ""failed to adopt effective policies to evaluate and manage concussions."" It also claims women and children are put in danger by a lack of adequate rules to manage concussion as they are ""more vulnerable to traumatic and long-lasting brain injury."" The lawsuit seeks no financial damages and instead is insisting on rule changes it has been suggesting for over a decade. The plaintiffs, which include Rachel Mehr -- a former youth club soccer player -- and several parents on behalf of their children in youth soccer leagues, are led by attorney Steve Berman. ""Despite simple, best-practice guidelines, which have been updated three times since the initial international conference on concussions, FIFA has failed to enact the policies and rules needed to protect soccer players,"" he said in a statement sent to CNN by his firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP. ""We believe it is imperative we force these organizations to put a stop to hazardous practices that put players at unnecessary risk. ""The negligence is remarkable, given that FIFA actively promotes its activities to children. Yet no rule limits headers in children's soccer, and children are often taught to head the ball from the age of three. ""We estimate that a dedicated youth player might sustain 1,000 headers per year, and a high school player more than 1,800 headers."" The lawsuit, filed in California, claims FIFA guidelines appear to suggest it is referees and players who diagnose brain injuries and not medical professionals. It wants provision made for temporary substitutions to be allowed when a player is being examined for a brain injury, above the permitted three per match, and a limit on how many times players under 17 can head the ball. Concussion has become a hot topic in major sports in the United States with the National Football League, the National Hockey League and the National Collegiate Athletic Association all involved in litigation. In 2013, the NFL struck a deal worth $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, as well as litigation expenses. Currently, any player who is knocked out or concussed during an NFL match is removed from the game, but no such rules exist in soccer. According to FIFA's most recent newsletter, there were five incidents of concussion at the recent World Cup in Brazil, including one in the final between Germany and Argentina. German midfielder Christoph Kramer received medical treatment after being knocked out but returned to the field of play. He was substituted a short time later after he asked: ""Is this the final?"" the newsletter reported. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said in the newsletter that the topic of concussion in football has the ""highest priority."" ""The decisive factor is how those involved react to this kind of incident,"" Blatter wrote of the Kramer injury. ""The German team doctors assessed the situation correctly. Kramer initially showed no symptoms of concussion, but a little later he realized something was wrong and asked to be substituted. ""Coach Joachim Low did not hesitate even for a moment, sending out an important signal and demonstrating that the player's health and the doctors' opinion matter more than sporting considerations. ""That is fully in line with the principle: ""When in doubt, sit them out"". This topic has the highest priority for FIFA."" When contacted by CNN, FIFA said it had not received anything regarding the lawsuit and, as such, was not in a position to comment, but it did offer a statement outlining its work on the issue. ""FIFA has always assigned high priority to the topic of prevention and treatment of head injuries,"" it read. ""Together with other leading sports federations FIFA initiated 12 years ago discussions on this topic which led to four scientific consensus meetings and the development of clear recommendations. ""FIFA has also initiated a series of scientific studies related to head injuries in football that have resulted in modifications to the Laws of the Game. ""For instance, in 2006, the International Football Association Board (The IFAB) adapted the Laws of the Game to punish incidents which cause concussion such as an elbow to the head with a red card. This led to a significant decrease in such incidents and head injuries. ""For FIFA competitions, all team doctors are fully informed about these recommendations. It is the responsibility of each team doctor and any support staff in their team to decide whether or not a player can continue playing."" The organization is running a pilot in the Swiss first division this season to better monitor players' cognitive abilities and to help with swift diagnosis of brain injuries. It will be supervised by FIFA's chief medical officer professor Jiri Dvorak, who told the newsletter: ""In parallel with this research, we must -- sooner rather than later -- also discuss an additional substitution. ""That would give coaches greater personal leeway, as they could react more quickly and decisively in the case of injury."" The English Premier League announced prior to the start of the new season it had introduced new regulations regarding head injuries. It said the final rulings on head injuries would be made by the medical professionals present and insisted a new ""tunnel doctor"" attended each match to assist the doctors already attached to the competing teams.","Lawsuit filed against FIFA claiming it isn't doing enough about concussion in soccer .

"The NFL was set to hold a grievance hearing Monday that could put running back Adrian Peterson back on the gridiron, but the hearing follows a weekend of debate over whether the league is treating the Minnesota Vikings star fairly. Peterson has been on the exempt/commissioner's permission list -- which kept him off the field, with pay -- since September after allegations he disciplined his 4-year-old son too harshly with a ""switch"" or thin stick. Initially charged with felony child abuse, Peterson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault this month. The running back avoided jail time, receiving probation, community service and a $4,000 fine. But he must attend the league hearing to have the exempt status lifted. The NFL told the NFL Players Association in September that Peterson would be removed from the list once the charges against him were adjudicated. At Monday afternoon's hearing, which Peterson was expected to attend via teleconference, arbitrator Shyam Das was scheduled to examine Peterson's case and determine whether the running back, who has missed several games, will be allowed to return to football. Das has five days to make a decision. Meanwhile, the league has told Peterson he won't be able to play football until it finishes reviewing the incident under its personal conduct policy. The matter of a Friday review of his case, however, had the NFL and NFL Players Association at odds, as the league claimed Peterson skipped the review, while Peterson called the review arbitrary and said he ""can't excuse their refusal to be fair."" Review goes on; Peterson absent . The Friday review was scheduled with Peterson last Tuesday, a league official told CNN. ""As Mr. Peterson was advised, the purpose of the meeting would be to review his case, and would include a group of outside experts who could offer broader expertise on the legal, clinical and football issues involved,"" the official said in a statement. The NFL Players Association replied Thursday that ""it was unavailable"" that day. The league said it would not postpone the hearing because Peterson's camp wants the matter resolved quickly and ""we had been given no meaningful reason why Adrian and the union could not appear and participate,"" the official said. Peterson also has provided only ""cursory materials"" in response to the NFL's request for more information on the case, the statement said. Defense attorney Rusty Hardin referred CNN's requests for comment to sports agent Tracy Lartigue, saying Peterson's legal case had been resolved. Lartigue did not respond to a request for comment. Hardin told the Pioneer-Press, a St. Paul, Minnesota, newspaper, that Texas law forbade him from handing over materials the state gave him during discovery. Phil Grant of the Montgomery County district attorney's office, which prosecuted Peterson, told the newspaper private entities aren't entitled to see the prosecution's files. It's also been widely reported that Judge Kelly Case sealed Peterson's case file earlier this month. The NFL official told CNN alternative dates were offered for last week's review, but they were deemed unacceptable, so the NFL conducted the review without Peterson present. ""We had hoped that Adrian would take advantage of his opportunity to be heard and present whatever information he believes should be considered before a decision on discipline, counseling and services is made. Because he and the NFLPA elected not to do so, we will have to address this based on the information currently available to us,"" the official said. Peterson disputes league claim . Peterson's Sunday statement called reports that he backed out of the meeting ""not true."" The review is ""something new and inconsistent with"" the league's collective bargaining agreement, Peterson said, so the NFL Players Association contacted the league numerous times last week to inquire about the nature of the review and the logistics. The league responded late Wednesday but ""didn't answer important questions about their proposed 'hearing,' "" his statement said. Peterson said he told the NFL he would attend Monday's hearing -- which is in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement -- ""but I wouldn't participate in a newly created and non-collectively bargained pre-discipline 'hearing' that would include outside people I don't know and who would have roles in the process that the NFL wouldn't disclose.""

However, I will not allow the NFL to impose a new process of discipline on me, ignore the (collective bargaining agreement), ignore the deal they agreed to with me, and behave without fairness or accountability. ""The process they are pushing is arbitrary, inconsistent, and contrary to what they agreed to do, and for those reasons, I never agreed to the hearing."" George Atallah, the NFL Players Association assistant executive director, also released a statement: ""The League office seems more focused on creating an arbitrary disciplinary process for Adrian instead of honoring a signed agreement to remove him from the Commissioner's list.

"(CNN) -- Prince Albert of Monaco will tie the knot to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock next July, the palace announced Thursday. The pair have set July 8, 2011, as the day for a civil wedding at the palace. The next day, they will take part in a religious ceremony, the palace said. The 52-year-old prince and ruler of Monaco, the only son of Princess Grace and the late Prince Rainier, has never married. In a 2004 interview with CNN's Larry King, Albert admitted it had taken him ""longer than most"" to find a wife. ""There have been some relationships where, had they gone on a little bit more, they would have headed that way,"" Albert said. ""But I think it's -- it's so much your own timing and your own agenda and the person you want to be with."" Like his fiancee, Albert is also an Olympian, having competed in five Olympic Winter Games -- from Calgary in 1988 to Salt Lake City in 2002 -- in bobsledding. He is a member of the International Olympic Committee and president of Monaco's national Olympic committee. Albert has two sisters, Princesses Caroline and Stephanie. The prince and Wittstock have been photographed together many times in the past four years, leading to speculation they would eventually marry. Albert has two children from previous relationships -- a 6-year-old son born to Nicole Coste, a flight attendant from Togo, and an 18-year-old daughter born to American Tamara Rotolo, a former waitress. Neither child is in line for the throne under Monaco law, which says succession passes only to direct legitimate descendants. Albert was formally invested as Monaco's ruler following the death of his father in 2005. Monaco, a sovereign principality, is one of the smallest countries in the world, measuring just under 2 square miles. It sits on the French Riviera and is bordered on three sides by France. It has a population of about 33,000 people.","Two ceremonies are planned for July 2011 .

"(CNN) -- New research suggests that crabs not only suffer pain but that they retain a memory of it. No thanks for the memories: The scientific study applied mild electric shocks to hermit crabs to determine if they could 'feel' pain. The study, which was carried out by Professor Bob Elwood and Mirjam Appel from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen's University, Belfast, looked at the reactions of hermit crabs to small electric shocks. It was published in the journal ""Animal Behaviour."" Professor Elwood, whose previous work showed that prawns endure pain, said his research highlighted the need to investigate the treatment of crustaceans used in food industries. Hermit crabs have no shell of their own so inhabit other structures, usually empty mollusc shells. In the research, wires were attached to shells to deliver the small shocks to the abdomen of some of the crabs within the shells. The only crabs to get out of their shells were those which had received shocks, indicating that the experience is unpleasant for them. The research suggests that this response is not just a reflex, but that central neuronal processing takes place. Hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred. The main aim of the experiment was to deliver a shock just under the threshold that causes crabs to move out of the shell, to see what happened when a new shell was then offered. Crabs that had been shocked but had remained in their shell appeared to remember the experience of the shock because they quickly moved towards the new shell, investigated it briefly and were more likely to change to the new shell compared to those that had not been shocked. ""There has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs, prawns and lobsters feel pain,"" said Professor Elwood in a press statement. ""We know from previous research that they can detect harmful stimuli and withdraw from the source of the stimuli but that could be a simple reflex without the inner 'feeling' of unpleasantness that we associate with pain. ""This research demonstrates that it is not a simple reflex but that crabs trade-off their need for a quality shell with the need to avoid the harmful stimulus. ""Such trade-offs are seen in vertebrates in which the response to pain is controlled with respect to other requirements. Humans, for example, may hold onto a hot plate that contains food whereas they may drop an empty plate, showing that we take into account differing motivational requirements when responding to pain. ""Trade-offs of this type have not been previously demonstrated in crustaceans. The results are consistent with the idea of pain being experienced by these animals."" Previous work at Queen's University found that prawns show prolonged rubbing when an antenna was treated with weak acetic acid but this rubbing was reduced by local anesthetic. According to Queen's University the findings from both studies are consistent with observations of pain in mammals. But Professor Elwood says that in contrast to mammals, little protection is given to the millions of crustaceans that are used in the fishing and food industries each day. ""More research is needed in this area where a potentially very large problem is being ignored,"" said Elwood. ""Legislation to protect crustaceans has been proposed but it is likely to cover only scientific research. Millions of crustacean are caught or reared in aquaculture for the food industry. ""There is no protection for these animals (with the possible exception of certain states in Australia) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain. ""With vertebrates we are asked to err on the side of caution and I believe this is the approach to take with these crustaceans.""","New research from Queen's University says crabs feel and remember pain .

"(CNN)Place both hands flat on your chest, just below the clavicle, and say something out loud. Feel that? Every time you speak, your chest cavity vibrates. Physicist Shahriar Afshar thinks recreating that feeling is the key to making video games, movies and music more immersive, emotional experiences. He's created a vest called KOR-FX that plugs into an audio jack and turns sound into chest-rumbling vibrations, mimicking what your vocal cords do. Most virtual reality hype has surrounded tools that create a visual experience, like the Oculus Rift goggles. Gadgets like this vest could provide an additional physical, tactile element to virtual reality. The $150 KOR-FX feeds sound to the two transducers on the front of the vest. Regular sounds are translated into vibrations that are felt directly on the body. It's the same thrill you get in a movie theater when the bass is so strong it shakes your seat, but it uses less power and is portable. I strapped the vest on and tested it. The vibrations ranged from heart-racing to subtle, and are surprisingly effective when paired with audio from a good pair of headphones. Footage of a DJ Tiësto show imitates the experience from the bass at a live concert. Explosions and gunshots rock you in the first-person-shooter game ""Counter-Strike: Source."" It was most effective in the cockpit of a fighter jet playing ""Battlefield 3"" while wearing an Oculus Rift. The vest hums with the constant roll of the engine and you feel the other planes shake as they zip by. Vibrations in the body make the brain interpret experiences as more immediate, as if they're really happening to them and not just taking place on a screen, according to Afshar. ""The brain thinks, my goodness, all the stuff that's happening is so significant and the audio is so huge that it's vibrating my chest,"" said Afshar. Afshar's company, Immerz Inc., is focusing on the video game market for starters since the audio on many big budget games is outstanding. Gamers are early adopters and have already proven they care about immersion. Afshar, a self-described ""very serious-minded professor of physics,"" was not a gamer. He stumbled on the idea for the vest while staying in a dorm one summer as a visiting professor (he declined to identify the campus). The students were creating a ruckus in the common areas, blasting the sound on video games. Unable to escape the games' vibrations (or to convince them to turn down the volume), Afshar decided to learn more. ""I thought, 'They're enjoying something in the bass, go about it as a scientist,'"" said Afshar, who also has a background in neuroscience. After much research, Afshar launched a Kickstarter campaign, which raised $183,000 (245% of its goal) in July. The product became available in November and is available online. Eventually, KOR-FX wants to open the vest up to developers so they can add vibrations to give the sensation of movement. Afshar says the vest could even be used to manipulate emotional states, like calming the wearer down or getting them excited. Afshar recently used it to listen to Bach and experience classical music in a new way. ""All of the sudden I was engulfed in the genius, the amazing indescribable wrapping up of emotions masterfully put together,"" said Afshar. ""It opened all these vistas that I had never thought of.""","A new vest makes games and movies more immersive by vibrating your body .

"(CNN) -- Leading Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan says he was detained for nearly two hours Friday night at New Jersey's Newark International Airport because of his last name. Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan said he was detained by authorities at the Newark, New Jersey, airport. In an interview with CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, Khan said immigration officials at the airport detained him for questioning after they said his name was flagged. ""They kept on telling me that my name is common to some name that has popped up on the computer, so they need to follow procedure,"" he said. ""It took them an hour and a half, two hours; they kept on asking me questions, if I could give them any ... numbers in America that they can contact and vouch for me and who I am."" A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said the agency could not comment on specific incidents. ""I was really taken aback because there were people who knew me there,"" Khan told CNN-IBN, referring to other travelers who were nearby. Rajeev Shukla, the secretary of India's ruling Congress party and a friend of Khan's, told CNN that the actor called him from Newark, as well as Khan's secretary and family. Shukla said Khan, who was en route to Chicago, Illinois, was allowed to leave after Indian Embassy officials intervened. In New Delhi, India, U.S. Ambassador Timothy Roemer issued a statement describing Khan as a ""very welcome guest"" in the United States and a ""global icon."" ""Many Americans love his films,"" Roemer said. ""We are trying to ascertain the facts of the case -- to understand what took place."" The Indian government said in a written statement that it understood that Khan had been ""taken aside for 'secondary questioning'"" at Newark airport. ""The consulate general of India got in touch with him immediately upon learning about the incident,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Khan said that he was all right. The consulate offered him any assistance that he may require."" The government said it has taken up the matter with the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.

"As Americans make up their minds and gear up to vote, CNN asks some of America's foremost presidential historians to weigh in on the question: What does it take to make a president great? Richard Reeves: FDR's place in the 20th century . Presidential greatness is determined by being in the White House at the right time -- or the wrong time. The presidency is a reactive job and we judge the presidents by their handling of one or two big crises, usually unforeseen. Nobody remembers whether Abraham Lincoln or Franklin D. Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan balanced the budget. What we remember is the agony of the Civil War. The Great Depression and Pearl Harbor. The Cuban Missile Crisis and the threat  of nuclear war. The winding down of the Cold War. Roosevelt, who probably understood the presidency better than anyone else -- before or after him -- was the greatest president of the 20th century because he knew what people wanted from the highest office in the land: action, words and optimism. That all came together when he said he was no longer ""Dr. New Deal"" -- he became ""Dr. Win The War."" While historians will argue forever whether FDR actually ended the Depression, he did take aggressive action and fought with the right words with his ""infamy"" speech on December 7,1941, after Pearl Harbor was attacked. When the Soviet Union was putting nuclear missiles in Cuba, Kennedy said in private that doing nothing was the worst option and he would be impeached if he did not take action. In good times or bad, a president is expected to do something! Sometimes he does the right thing and becomes great for it. Richard Reeves is the author of a presidential trilogy: ""President Kennedy: Profile of Power,"" ""President Nixon: Alone in the White House"" and ""President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination."" He is senior lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California. Aida Donald: Truman believed in the strength of character . In early 1962, my husband and I were invited to the White House by first lady Jackie Kennedy because she wanted the president -- who loved history -- to listen to my husband, David Herbert Donald, talk about Abraham Lincoln. When the talk was over, President Kennedy asked: ""Do you think that what makes a president great is a war?"" My husband blanched and said, ""No, Franklin Roosevelt was a great president before World War II started. His domestic program had already made him a great president."" Of course, Lincoln was a great war president. His saving of the Union and the freeing of 4 million slaves were his greatest accomplishments. Now, I would add that Harry Truman was also a great president, because he was commander in chief in a great war and then reconstructed the world after World War II. Truman drew red lines to keep the Soviets from continually gobbling up countries.  He saved Greece and Turkey with his Truman Doctrine. He saved Berlin with an airlift when the Soviets blockaded it. He led in forming the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to protect Europe. He started the Point Four program to assist poor countries. He was behind the Marshall Plan of giving Europe $6 billion to reconstruct itself and be a bulwark against Communism.  He encouraged the rebuilding of Japan as a democratic and capitalist country and as a counter to Communist China. One should add two other momentous decisions Truman made that affected his greatness: He recognized the state of Israel as soon as it declared its independence, and he desegregated the American armed forces by executive order. From his earliest days, Truman kept a motto in his head: ""A leader needed a true heart, a strong mind, and a great deal of courage.""  And he loved what Ben Franklin said: ""Always do the right thing. This will satisfy some people and astonish others."" In a nutshell, Truman believed that above all else, character made for greatness. It just happened that his greatness came from the battlefield and its aftermath. Aida D. Donald, former editor-in-chief of Harvard University Press, is the author of ""Citizen Soldier: A Life of Harry S. Truman."" H. W. Brands: Don't dare to be great . Great presidents are those who change the course of American history. Andrew Jackson established the principle that ordinary people should exercise political power. Abraham Lincoln reversed secession and freed the slaves. Franklin Roosevelt founded the welfare state and led the alliance that defeated fascism. Ronald Reagan dismantled large parts of the regulatory state and legitimized demands for smaller government. Not everyone agrees with the policies of great presidents; transformation is often painful. Great presidents are opportunists: They acknowledge America's strong bias toward the status quo and recognize that large changes are possible only when the status quo has been severely compromised. The greatest presidents -- Lincoln and FDR -- embody the paradox that they preside over the worst times, when the status quo is so broken (the Civil War, the Great Depression) that it cannot continue in its old form. Great presidents appreciate that their authority is as much emotional and moral as it is institutional. They manifest charisma suited to their eras and convey compelling visions of new ways forward: popular democracy for Jackson, Union and liberty for Lincoln, social security for Roosevelt, lower taxes and lighter government for Reagan. Is America ripe for another great president? Not yet. The economy underperforms but hasn't collapsed. The federal debt mounts but hasn't prompted a flight from the dollar. So must we wait for things to reach a crisis before we can expect another great president? Yes. But this is the wrong way to view our predicament. We do not need a great president to fix what ails us. A good president will do. James Polk broke the impasse over expansion to the Pacific. Theodore Roosevelt tamed the trusts. Lyndon Johnson defeated Jim Crow. Each appealed to America's core values and sense of self. Each proposed substantial but achievable goals. Each played politics, and played it well. The next president shouldn't strive for greatness, which would confer historical reputation but require more than the rest of us can bear. Being a good president will be good enough. H. W. Brands' new book is ""The Man Who Saved the Union: Ulysses Grant in War and Peace."" Joan Hoff: Presidents and war . A review of polls of presidential scholars since 1948, but especially since 1962, reveals that all of the top great or near-great presidents, except for Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt, were involved in war during their presidencies. Six of them -- James Polk, Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, FDR, Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower -- were wartime presidents.  LBJ, Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush have not secured great or near-great status in these polls because of the failed Vietnam War, the successful but forgotten First Gulf War, and the misguided invasion of Iraq based on false intelligence. Given the length, expense and unpopularity of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is conceivable that future presidents may not automatically receive the vaunted accolade of presidential greatness when they commit the nation to military action. Taking action in a time of perceived crisis is also not always wise, as demonstrated by JFK's Bay of Pigs fiasco, Jimmy Carter's mishandling of the U.S. hostage situation in Iran, and Reagan's hostage-for-arms scandal known as the Iran-Contra affair. This leaves us with the greatness of Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt. How did their success as leaders emerge without waging war? Importantly, both were intellectuals while most of the wartime presidents were not. So their writings and peaceful actions enhanced their reputations as thoughtful presidents. Despite Jefferson's silence about his own slaves, the principles of the Declaration of Independence about fundamental human rights and equality still ring true. He also doubled and explored the nation's land area and established the precedent of executive privilege. Likewise, Roosevelt -- despite his macho association with the Rough Riders during the Spanish-American War and his great white hunter lifestyle -- was the first president extensively to preserve national forests and parks, support civil service reform, oppose unregulated great corporations, and promote inspection of food and drugs. He also was the first American president to win the Nobel Peace Prize, because of his mediation of the Russo-Japanese War. Responding to crises and initiating wars may not represent the best way to determine the greatness of American presidents for the rest of the 21st century. Joan Hoff, author of ""Faustian Foreign Policy from Woodrow Wilson to George W. Bush,"" is research professor of history at Montana State University. Joseph Ellis: When major crisis strikes . Presidential greatness is a rare thing. The three greatest American presidents -- George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt -- all came to office at times of great crisis.  Washington created a nation out of a confederation of states.  Lincoln saved the nation that Washington created from dissolution.  Roosevelt rescued the capitalistic economy of the nation from the Great Depression and, in World War II, its democratic legacy from totalitarianism. If history is a guide, then, presidential greatness only occurs in the crucible of major crises. If Islamic terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb in New York or Washington, or if an American attack on Iran's nuclear facilities generated a widespread war in the Middle East, then the conditions would exist for the display of presidential greatness. Let's hope that neither Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney will have to face such a predicament. Joseph J. Ellis is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation.""","America's top presidential scholars weigh in on what makes a president great .

"She-Ravers rejoice! A new She-Ra comic has arrived. The comic is one in a series of ""Masters of the Universe"" character origin digital one-shots published by DC Entertainment. Not a continuing story of She-Ra, it is rather a dramatic retelling of her beginnings. Wondering what a one-shot is? Here's a primer if you're more a fan of the animated ""She-Ra: Princess of Power"" TV series that began airing in 1985: . ""A one-shot is simply an issue (or digital release) that tells a full story on its own,"" writer Mike Costa said. ""... All the way up through the 1990s, telling single-issue stories was the norm. But today stories are increasingly told over several issues that are later collected into books, so a one-shot is becoming an unusual, special thing."" The She-Ra digital one-shot delves into our heroine's pre-Princess of Power's past -- before the Sword of Protection came to her, before she became the Most Powerful Woman in the Universe and before she ever uttered the phrase, ""For the honor of Grayskull!"" Kidnapped as a baby by the evil Skeletor, She-Ra's alter ego Princess Adora -- twin sister of Prince Adam (who later became He-Man) -- was raised by the evil Lord Hordak in the dark dimension of Despondos. Lord Hordak renamed Adora Despara and brainwashed her into become a villain. Despara became a force captain in Hordak's army and Hordak's own personal assassin. Upon return to her birth planet, Eternia, Despara was initially Adam's enemy. Female superhero 'She-Ra' marks 25th anniversary . ""Readers unfamiliar with her history might be surprised to learn that she was a very different person before that transformation,"" Costa said, ""but the hero she would become is there, slumbering inside of her, and that's what our story is really about."" Put simply: An unhappy young girl who dreams of a better life discovers she's a princess and her dreams come true. ""But She-Ra's story is such a great inversion of that,"" Costa said, ""because rather than being just a passive dreamer, she's actually already a very powerful character. Sure she's a powerful character working for evil, but that only makes her journey all the more heroic and interesting. The messages of strength, capability and redemption, those are some really empowering and sophisticated ideas for a princess character aimed at girls from 30 years ago."" The new release presents a darker, more unusual take on She-Ra. ""I think the trick for me was drawing this version of She-Ra as not really evil but detached and cold,"" artist Drew Edward Johnson said. ""She wasn't born as this deadly Hordak enforcer but was made one, and over the course of the story, we can see how she's been kept in line and made to do things that are against her nature. I tried to show in a couple of close-up shots that her eyes are not those of a killer, and in those shots, divided her face down the middle with the panel borders to show her split nature."" In creating the planet Etheria, Johnson worked with colorist Kathryn Layno to ""create the most infernal atmosphere possible."" They surrounded She-Ra with fire, smoke, dead trees and hopeless people to get that bleak, drab, uninviting feel. An individual dragged down by dire circumstances beyond her control, She-Ra -- in true hero fashion -- rose above those circumstances to become an inspiration to the world around her. Johnson said he believes She-Ra still resonates with audiences because ""like Wonder Woman, She-Ra is iconic. She stood, and stands, as a strong and good-hearted character that anyone of any age can get behind."" The other ""Masters of the Universe"" comic releases consist of a printed miniseries in which Skeletor -- having rewritten the laws of reality on Eternia -- rules from inside Castle Grayskull. In addition, there is a digital series of 10-page stories featuring fresh takes on the origins of individual characters that are fan favorites, such as Orko and Trap Jaw. The new She-Ra is one in a series of full-length one-shots showcasing the origin of a particular character. Past comics told the back stories of He-Man and Skeletor.Gift of the Day: He-Man She-Ra ugly Christmas sweater . ""The line is diverse,"" Mattel executive Rob David said, ""but every title shares one thing in common: We're not playing things safe. 'Masters of the Universe' isn't just part of our cultural past; it's alive and constantly growing."" For the most part, fan response has been overwhelmingly positive, but some die-hards resist the retooling of classic characters. ""Fans are thrilled to see He-man and the Masters of the Universe back in action,"" David said. ""Not everybody wants to see any changes, of course, but He-Man -- ever since he first premiered -- has evolved. Hey, when he first came out, there was no Prince Adam! So long as you stay true to the core concepts, it's always fun to explore the possibilities.""","New She-Ra comic is a revamp of the story about how the Princess of Power came to be .

"(CNN) -- There didn't seem to be too much that Robin Williams couldn't do. As an actor, he had the range to go from playing a loveable alien on the small screen in ""Mork & Mindy"" to winning an Academy Award for his portrayal of Professor Sean Maguire in ""Good Will Hunting."" Whether it was spastic slapstick or heart-rending drama, the actor, who died on Monday from an apparent suicide, was as prolific in his career as he was hilarious. Evidence of that work ethic won't end with his death. There are four completed Williams films expected to be released posthumously: ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"" ""Merry Friggin' Christmas,"" ""Boulevard,"" and ""Absolutely Anything."" Given his love for his craft and his fans, the final work feels like a gift left behind by the beloved actor. Williams was known for taking on as many projects as he possibly could. In a 2010 interview with The Guardian, the actor said heart surgery in 2009 helped him to ease his pace a bit. ""In one two-year period I made eight movies,"" Williams reflected. ""At one point the joke was that there's a movie out without you in it. You have this idea that you'd better keep working, otherwise people will forget. And that was dangerous. And then you realize, no, actually if you take a break people might be more interested in you. Now, after the heart surgery, I'll take it slow."" Gilbert Gottfried: Robin Williams' generous heart . Set for release in December, ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" saw Williams revisiting his role of Teddy Roosevelt, which he had portrayed in earlier films in the series. ""There really are no words to describe the loss of Robin Williams,"" said a statement from 20th Century Fox, the studio behind the movie. ""He was immensely talented, a cherished member of our community, and part of the Fox family. Our hearts go out to his family, friends and fans. He will be deeply missed."" Complete coverage on Robin Williams . Williams also completed a role in the holiday comedy ""Merry Friggin Christmas,"" which is set to be released in November. The film centers around father Boyd Mitchler, played by Joel McHale, who realizes he has left behind his son's gifts while on holiday with his estranged family. Williams stars as McHale's father, who makes the trek with him to retrieve the presents in time. ""When you talk to Robin you think, 'I have learned more in the last 20 minutes than I ever learned,'"" McHale told the New York Daily News earlier this year. ""He is such an open soul and one of the most sensitive and great guys..."" Known for his voice work in films like Disney's ""Aladdin,"" Williams provided the voice of Dennis the Dog in ""Absolutely Anything,"" which will be released in 2015 and costars Kate Beckinsale and Simon Pegg. But it is his role in the drama ""Boulevard,"" which premiered at the Tribecca Film Festival in April, that may become the most discussed and heralded of Williams' final films. Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy . In it, Williams plays a married man who comes to terms with his homosexuality later in life and connects emotionally with a young male prostitute played by Roberto Aguire. ""Tapping into that same loneliness felt in 'One Hour Photo' and 'Good Will Hunting,' the actor projects a regret so deep and identifiable, viewers should have no trouble connecting it to whatever is missing in their own lives â€” whether those regrets are romantic, sexual, professional or spiritual,"" critic Peter Debruge wrote in a review of the movie for Variety. During a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session with fans in 2013, Williams said he couldn't choose between comedies or dramas. ""I like doing both comedies and dramas, so it's very difficult to say which one I prefer,"" he said. ""I've been very blessed to have had the chance to explore such a variety of characters.""

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Dubai has forgiven the nearly $7 billion Baghdad owes it, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced Sunday. UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan has promised to appoint an ambassador to Iraq. UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan promised to ""put out these debts,"" appoint an ambassador to Baghdad, and ""help Iraq building the holy shrines that were targeted by the terrorists,"" al-Maliki said in a written statement. Al-Maliki and the sheikh met Sunday, the first day of a two-day official visit. Al-Maliki was accompanied by the Iraqi ministers of Interior, Commerce and Industry. ""Our biggest challenge is now the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the economic situation and to provide services to our citizens,"" al-Maliki said. Debt relief is a major issue for Iraq, and the United States has urged other nations to forgive Iraqi debt, most of which is held by Arab states, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said in late May. Also, the UAE Cabinet on Sunday nominated Abdullah Ibrahim al-Shehhi to be the country's ambassador to Iraq. Al-Shehhi, who previously served as the Emirates' ambassador to India, is to travel to Iraq after his nomination is confirmed. An official government source said the UAE intends to reopen its embassy in Baghdad by the end of the year. The United States and other nations have urged Arab countries to post ambassadors to Iraq, reopen embassies and forge closer relationships with Iraq's government. The UAE mission in Iraq hasn't been active since a UAE diplomat was kidnapped and released two years ago. The year before that, two Iraqis working for that mission were killed. No ambassador from an Arab country has been stationed permanently in Iraq since July 2005, when Egypt's ambassador, Dr. Ihab al-Sherif, was abducted from a Baghdad street and slain. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the assassination, saying it had killed al-Sherif  because of Egypt's foreign policies and its alliances with the United States and Israel. The UAE's announcement Sunday came a month after its foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, visited Baghdad. During that visit, al-Nahyan extended the official invitation that brought al-Maliki to Dubai. Iraq's government said that al-Nahyan's one-day visit was the first to Iraq by a Gulf Cooperation Council foreign minister since the 2003 U.S-led invasion that toppled the regime of President Saddam Hussein. The Gulf Cooperation Council also includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Prior to al-Nahyan's visit, only Syria and Jordan had sent foreign ministers to Iraq in the post-Saddam Hussein era. The Arab League's secretary-general has also visited. War and the Sunni-Shiite rivalry in Iraq and the Muslim world have slowed the Arab world's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Iraq. Iraq's mixed population is mostly Arab with some Kurds and Turkmens, and mostly Shiite Muslim, with a Sunni Muslim minority. Most Arab countries -- including the UAE -- are Sunni-ruled. Iraq's government is Shiite-dominated and it is forging a close relationship with its neighbor, the non-Arab Shiite nation of Iran -- a development that concerns Arab nations wary of Iran's Islamic Republic government. Al-Maliki's government is seeking to develop close ties to all countries of the region.

"A rare letter written by Napoleon Bonaparte in English will go to the auction block in France on Sunday. The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors ""was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge"" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. ""He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him,"" Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. ""I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written,"" he said. ""There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English."" Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. ""He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising,"" he added.","It's the first letter Napoleon wrote in English from captivity, the auction house says .

"The truck that rear-ended comedian Tracy Morgan's limo was speeding 20 mph over the limit, and its driver was approaching federal limits on how long he could be behind the wheel, according to investigators. The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report Thursday on the New Jersey Turnpike crash that badly injured Morgan and killed one of his friends, comedian James McNair, in the early morning hours of June 7. Morgan, 45, suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg. His condition has been upgraded from critical to fair, his publicist Lewis Kay said this week. The condition of another limo passenger, Jeff Millea, has also improved to fair, Kay said. Hospitalized Tracy Morgan upgraded to fair condition . A criminal complaint filed by police said driver Kevin Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. Roper, 35, pleaded not guilty to charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. He is free on $50,000 bond. The NTSB report said the 2011 Peterbilt truck owned and operated by Walmart was speeding at 65 mph for the 60 seconds before the crash. Roper allegedly ignored a sign a mile earlier warning that lanes were closed ahead for construction and another sign a half-mile later reducing the speed limit from 55 mph to 45 mph, the report said. The 2012 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter limo carrying Morgan and five other passengers had slowed down because of congestion caused by the center and right lanes being shut down to allow contractors to work on a large overhead sign nearly 3 miles down the road, the NTSB said. The truck struck the rear of Morgan's limo, and the ""two vehicles moved forward and were involved in secondary impacts with other vehicles that were slowed in the traffic queue,"" the report said. ""The limo van rolled over and came to rest on its left side, facing east, across the center and right lanes."" Roper, who lives in Georgia but was based in Delaware, reported for work at 11:22 a.m. on June 6, according to the NTSB report. He made deliveries to Walmart stores in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania before the wreck 13 hours, 32 minutes later, it said. Federal rules limit interstate commercial drivers to 14-hour shifts before they must rest, the report said. His total driving time that day was 9 hours, 37 minutes, which is below the 11 hours allowed by federal limits, the report said. The NTSB, however, is also looking at how long Roper was awake and driving before he reported to work the day before the crash, officials told CNN on Thursday. He lives in Georgia and commutes to his job more than 700 miles away in Smyrna, Delaware, NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said. Federal investigators based their preliminary findings largely on the small computer on board the truck that records speed, engine performance, brakes and other information, the report said. Walmart said last week that it believed Roper was operating within federal rest guidelines but said it would take full responsibility if the investigation shows its truck was to blame. ""The details are the subject of the ongoing investigation, and we are cooperating fully with the appropriate law enforcement agencies,"" said Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for the company. The NTSB also released new images of the truck and van based on 3-dimensional scans of them after the crash. Morgan was a regular on ""Saturday Night Live"" for seven years and later received an Emmy nomination for his role in the comedy series ""30 Rock."" Funny man Tracy Morgan has known fame and foibles .","Walmart driver had been working almost 14 hours, NTSB says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Some call gridlocked Washington a ""hopeless place,"" but the ""Good Girl Gone Bad"" found much more than just love outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday -- Rihanna found new Instagram photos. The photos don't prove she could ""Run This Town,"" but Rihanna's certainly got a flair for this ""This Town."" Less than two weeks after making her triumphant return to Instagram, the pop star toured the White House on Monday with a large entourage and seemed genuinely excited to see the inside of the White House. Rihanna even took to the podium in the White House briefing room and pretended to field questions from the press before taking a walk on the North Lawn. The Barbados singer apparently also channeled her inner Olivia Pope, the fictional star of ABC's ""Scandal,"" played by Kerry Washington. In one caption where Rihanna is talking on a pay phone, the caption reads ""Fitz, darling,"" an apparent reference to ""Scandal""'s President Fitzgerald Grant, the fictional two-term incumbent Republican and former governor of California. In another caption, Rihanna drops the acronym ""O.P.A."" though it was unclear if she was referencing Oliva Pope and Associates, or the Department of Health and Human Services branch Office of Population Affairs. But the tour wasn't all fun and games as Rihanna also met with administration officials about potential areas of partnership like working on the President's ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative. Rihanna is in town for the Veterans Day benefit Concert for Valor, where she will perform Tuesday alongside Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood and other artists. .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said that police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, ""acted stupidly"" in arresting a prominent black Harvard professor last week after a confrontation at the man's home. Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. talks Wednesday about his ordeal with Cambridge police. ""I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played,"" Obama said Wednesday night while taking questions after a White House news conference. Cambridge authorities dropped disorderly conduct charges against Henry Louis Gates Jr. on Tuesday. Obama defended Gates on Wednesday night, while admitting that he may be ""a little biased,"" because Gates is a friend. ""But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately."" The incident, Obama said, shows ""how race remains a factor in this society.""  Watch the president address the incident » . The mayor of Cambridge said she is going to meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that caused Gates' arrest does not happen again. ""This suggests that something happened that should not have happened,"" Mayor E. Denise Simmons said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The situation is certainly unfortunate. This can't happen again in Cambridge.""  Watch how the mayor plans to handle the situation » . Gates said Simmons called him to apologize. He told CNN on Wednesday that although charges had been dropped, he will keep the issue alive. ""This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,"" Gates told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. Have race relations improved since Obama's election? Gates said he'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer ""if he told the truth"" about what the director of Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were ""fabrications"" in the police report. The officer, Sgt. James Crowley, told CNN affiliate WCVB earlier Wednesday that he will not apologize. ""There are not many certainties in life, but it is for certain that Sgt. Crowley will not be apologizing,"" he said. Gates said the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, called him to apologize about the incident, in which he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.  Watch Gates talk about his arrest » . CNN could not confirm Wednesday night that an apology was made. Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons did not respond to requests by CNN for comment. Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, the police report said, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, ""Why, because I'm a black man in America?"" the report said.  Was the professor profiled? » . The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification, but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police. ""While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,"" Crowley said, according to the report. Gates was arrested for ""loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space"" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station. He said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit. Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him, ""I would do the same thing exactly again."" Earlier this week, a prosecutor dropped the charge against Gates and the city's police department recommended that the matter not be pursued.","NEW: Obama: Incident shows ""how race remains a factor in this society""

"Dallas (CNN)Kisha Bell walks into the Neighborhood Medical Center in Dallas complaining of abdominal pain. But she has a much more pressing concern weighing on her mind. ""Ebola -- can you tell me, I guess, as far as like the symptoms?"" she asks the doctor. Ebola isn't spreading across the United States, but anxiety about the virus certainly is. The epicenter is Dallas, where the country's first diagnosis and the first transmissions of Ebola were made. Before this month, Dr. Martin McElya said he's never been asked about Ebola. Now he's fielding a wave of questions. ""I say, 'You're not going to get it from someone who sneezes across the room, or because you're sharing an airspace,"" McElya said. ""It's going to require more of an intimate contact, and people seem relieved by that fact."" 2nd health care worker tests positive for Ebola at Dallas hospital . False alarms galore . But in the sky and on the ground, the fear persists. And with the news Wednesday that a second health care worker tested positive for the virus at the Dallas hospital while tending to the now-deceased Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, those fears are magnifying. Five people with flu-like symptoms on a flight from Dubai to Boston were examined by workers in hazmat gear upon landing. It turns out none had the criteria for Ebola or had visited West Africa. At Los Angeles International Airport, 40 firefighters responded to a plane from New York when a passenger had flu-like symptoms. ""It has turned out that there was some miscommunication,"" Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Jaime Moore said. ""This patient had been to the continent of Africa, but not near West Africa. As a matter of fact, it was South Africa."" And a hoaxter wearing a mask in Los Angeles exited a city bus saying, ""Don't mess with me, I have Ebola."" The bus driver was rushed to a hospital. And police begin a manhunt. Spreading misinformation . On top of the false alarms, high-profile voices have spread misinformation about the disease. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal told the Marietta Daily Journal that the state's public health commission told him that ""water kills the Ebola virus"" and that her advice was to ""wash your hands."" In fact, water alone does not kill Ebola. Chlorine and bleach do. And singer Chris Brown suggested to his 13.7 million Twitter followers that the Ebola outbreak is intentional. ""I don't know ... But I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of population control,"" he tweeted. ""(Expletive) is getting crazy bruh."" According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, 65% of Americans are somewhat or very concerned about the possibility of a widespread Ebola epidemic in the United States. Perry heads to Europe despite Ebola situation . Eleven beds for the entire country . But some worry is understandable. Of the thousands of hospitals in the United States, only four have biocontainment units and years of preparation in handling highly infectious disease like Ebola. But between those four hospitals, there are only about 19 beds in the specialized areas: 10 at  Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha; three at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta; three at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana; and an estimated three at National Institutes of Health in Maryland. Even the count of 19 beds may be deceiving, CNN's Drew Griffin said. ""The center director in Omaha says his staff could only realistically handle no more than two Ebola patients at a time,"" Griffin said. ""That's because of the danger, the staffing and the waste removal necessary when you're treating any Ebola patient."" So that essentially means 11 beds for the entire country. That, coupled with a slew of complaints from a nursing union, may seem troubling. After nurse Nina Pham contracted Ebola while treating an Ebola patient, National Nurses United said there was no protocol in place on how to take care of such patients at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. On Wednesday, Texas state health officials said a second health care worker at the same hospital has tested positive for Ebola. Reasons to calm down . But in the end, it's extremely difficult to get Ebola in the United States. Unlike a cold or the flu, Ebola can't be spread until an infected person shows symptoms. And transmission requires direct contact with that person's bodily fluids. Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell sought a temporary restraining order to block the disposal of incinerated waste from an Ebola patient's personal items at a Louisiana landfill. But it's impossible to spread Ebola through anything that has been burned, infectious waste expert Dr. Gavin Macgregor-Skinner said. ""Incineration is going to kill the virus,"" he said. ""That virus is dead. Now it is not infectious, it has no risk -- zero risk -- to the environment, to people, to anyone."" The United States is far better off than the three countries grappling the most with Ebola -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- where thousands of people have died from the virus this year. Despite fledgling protocols on Ebola at American hospitals, medical facilities are better in the U.S. Remember the anthrax scare? Yet this kind of anxiety isn't new to the United States. Just take the anthrax scare from a decade ago. ""For a little while, people were freaking out about white powder, and that was costly,"" risk communications expert Peter Sandman said. ""People don't freak out about white powder anymore. They're used to that risk, and they take it in stride. People will take this one in stride, too but it takes a while."" Opinion: Ebola highlights public health crisis . A run on supplies . Back in Dallas, some medical supply stores have seen a spike in sales. Jennifer Wilson of One Source Medical Solutions say the big sellers are the three Gs: goggles, gloves and isolation gown. ""Typically, we only have purchases from clinicians,"" she said. ""We have everyday people coming in, saying, 'I just want to have them just in case.'"" At the Neighborhood Medical Center, McElya examines Bell. ""So, tell me. What makes the pain worse?"" ""I think when I have something spicy,"" she replies. It turns out Bell doesn't have Ebola. She'll be getting tested for a possible gallbladder condition. CNN's Gary Tuchman reported from Dallas; Kyung Lah from Los Angeles; and Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Jake Tapper, Drew Griffin and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","A Dallas doctor says he has many patients asking him about Ebola symptoms .

"The ""kill switch,"" a system for remotely disabling smartphones and wiping their data, will become standard in 2015, according to a pledge backed by most of the mobile world's major players. Apple, Google, Samsung and Microsoft, along with the five biggest cellular carriers in the United States, are among those that have signed on to a voluntary program announced Tuesday by the industry's largest trade group. All smartphones manufactured for sale in the United States after July 2015 must have the technology, according to the program from CTIA-The Wireless Association. Advocates say the feature would deter thieves from taking mobile devices by rendering phones useless while allowing people to protect personal information if their phone is lost or stolen. Its proponents include law enforcement officials concerned about the rising problem of smartphone theft. ""We appreciate the commitment made by these companies to protect wireless users in the event their smartphones are lost or stolen,"" said Steve Largent, president and CEO of CTIA. ""This flexibility provides consumers with access to the best features and apps that fit their unique needs while protecting their smartphones and the valuable information they contain."" HTC, Motorola, Nokia are among the other smartphone makers who have signed up, along with carriers AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular. The feature would let a phone's owner erase contacts, photos, e-mail and other information, and lock the phone so it can't be used without a password. The feature, which will be offered at no cost to consumers, also will prevent the phone from being reactivated without an authorized user's consent. The data would be retrievable if the owner recovers the phone. Some phone makers already include the ability to remotely wipe phones. In Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 7, a feature called Activation Lock lets users prevent their phones from being reactivated even if they're reset. The new pledge marks a reversal for wireless carriers, who have resisted making the kill-switch feature mandatory. Industry representatives have said they fear hackers exploiting remote-kill technology, while critics accuse the industry of not wanting to lose revenue from replacing and activating stolen phones. Carriers have faced mounting pressure from lawmakers, some of whom are working on laws at the state level that would require remote shutdown capability. In Minnesota, the state legislature could pass a mandatory kill-switch bill as early as next week. Oregon state Sen. Bruce Starr, president of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said his group ""applauds today's announcement unveiling the wireless industry's commitment to reduce the number of smartphone thefts each year by providing anti-theft tools on future devices."" ""This voluntary effort serves as another positive illustration of the wireless industry adapting to address consumer needs through self-regulation,"" he said. But an optional deal didn't go far enough for others. ""The wireless industry today has taken an incremental yet inadequate step to address the epidemic of smartphone theft,"" said California state Sen. Mark Leno, who represents parts of San Francisco, in a statement. ""Only weeks ago, they claimed that the approach they are taking today was infeasible and counterproductive."" Leno fears that because consumers would need to activate the feature, many phones would remain unprotected. ""While I am encouraged they are moving off of that position so quickly, today's 'opt-in' proposal misses the mark if the ultimate goal is to combat street crime and violent thefts involving smartphones and tablets.""","""Kill switch"" will become standard on smartphones in U.S. in 2015 .

"The trial of three Al Jazeera journalists held on terrorism-related charges in Egypt was adjourned until May after the court on Tuesday viewed videos presented by the prosecution. Bail was again denied for correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohamed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed, who have been in jail since December 29. The three were arrested at a Cairo hotel room and later charged with joining what the government says is a terrorist group -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- as well as broadcasting false information and working in Egypt without permits. Their case has drawn widespread international condemnation from human rights groups. The prosecution presented video and audio recordings and photos from the pool of material collected from the defendants' laptops, cameras and phones. The defense challenged the meaningfulness of the evidence. ""These are very ordinary videos that don't come close to national security in accordance with the list of charges,"" lawyer Ibrahim Abdel Wahab told CNN. Fahmy told reporters during recess, ""Every journalist has this on their computer. Why is this evidence?"" Throughout Tuesday's seven-hour session, lawyers expressed frustration with the type of evidence accepted by the court as relevant. Following the display of a video on sheep herding and meat consumption, Fahmy's lawyer, Khaled Abu Bakr, told the court, ""Put the sheep aside and cut the chase to the case. This is a waste of time."" Many people in the courtroom, including journalists in attendance, found much of the video evidence inaudible. The judge disagreed. Tuesday's material was supposed to be what the prosecution saw as the most relevant to the case following an April 10 session in which random footage of Greste's work in Kenya and some Sky News Arabia reports dating back to 2012 were shown. Greste, an Australian who had worked in Egypt for three weeks when he was arrested in December, told reporters earlier this month that the evidence was ""ludicrous"" and ""a joke."" The trial comes as part of an intermittent crackdown on journalists. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranked Egypt as the third deadliest country for journalists in 2013. Reporters Without Borders said 80 journalists were arrested from July to September last year. Human rights groups have criticized the trial, saying the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. Al Jazeera is a large news television and digital outlet with headquarters in Doha, Qatar.","The trial of three Al Jazeera journalists is adjourned until May .

"(CNN) -- It's a bit like train-spotting but rather more serious. On October 10, Korea-watchers pored over live televised coverage of a massive military parade in Pyongyang, held to mark the 65th anniversary of North Korea's ruling party. Just like the Soviet parades of yore, it was a chance to see what military hardware the North might be showing off. The official news agency said the parade showed ""the will and might of Songun Korea to wipe out the enemy."" The hardware was accompanied by slogans such as ""Defeat the U.S. Military. U.S. soldiers are the Korean People's Army's enemy."" And besides the incredible synchronized goose-stepping, there were tanks and new missiles. Analysts paid special attention to the first public appearance of a road-mobile ballistic missile with a projected range of between 3,000 and 4,000 kilometers (roughly 1,900 to 2,400 miles), though reports of its existence had circulated for several years. There was also a new version of the No-dong ballistic missile, with a tri-conic nosecone, on show. That led Aviation Weekly and others to observe design similarities to Iran's Shahab missiles, suggesting further military cooperation between the two governments. North Korea's nuclear capability and ballistic missile technology are its trump card, to make up for its aging conventional forces and as a bargaining chip in negotiations. So that's what receives the bulk of funding and expertise. But despite economic stagnation, technological limitations and international sanctions, its conventional forces can't be discounted, if only because of their size. According to South Korean analysts, the North scraped together what little foreign exchange it had to buy $65 million of weapons from China, Russia and eastern Europe between 2002 and 2008. One example: It appears to have bought Chinese-made ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, using one to ""illuminate"" two U.S. Army Apache helicopters flying along the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone in 2003. None of the crew members was injured. China says it continues to be open to military collaboration with Pyongyang and last month welcomed a senior North Korean official to Beijing to ""enhance coordination of the two militaries."" China is thought to have supplied the North with multiple rocket launchers and spare parts for planes, among other equipment. Pyongyang has also turned to Iran and Egypt for military transfers. Much of the North's hardware is locally built using Chinese and Russian templates. It has begun deploying a new tank, called the P'okpoong (Storm), which is modeled on the Russian T-62 tank but hardly a match for modern U.S. battle tanks. It's not clear how many of these are in service, but Jane's Armed Forces Editor Alexander von Rosenbach says it is thought that only a few have been delivered -- and they lack devices like thermal imaging sights. Also on show at the October parade: a new surface-to-air missile similar to a Chinese model. Jane's concluded that it represented ""a major expansion in North Korea's air defense potential,"" with a radar/guidance system that would be harder to jam. And although little is known about the size and scope of the North's artillery, the barrage fired this week at Yeonpyeong Island suggests that it can't be ignored. The North Korean regime has also devoted great resources to developing its navy, not with battleships but fast-attack vessels and an array of submarines. Jane's estimates that it has more than 400 surface vessels. And it is not hesitant to use its maritime forces, as demonstrated by the sinking of the 1,200-ton South Korean corvette Cheonan by a torpedo in March. But in a confrontation, the South Korean navy is likely to come off best, as happened in a firefight in 1999. The main weakness of the North's military is a chronic shortage of computers, modern command and control and electronic warfare assets -- in other words, much of what makes up the 21st-century battlefield. At the same time, South Korea has used its economic strength to modernize its armed forces: for example, building three $1 billion Aegis-class destroyers to counter ballistic missiles. The same applies in the air. North Korea's air force largely comprises aging Soviet MiG fighters (though it has some MiG 29s) that would be unable to compete with South Korean F-15 jets or the F-16 fighters of the U.S. 7th Air Force, based in South Korea. In addition, the North's air force has suffered fuel shortages, and Jane's estimated that the North's fighter pilots may get as little as 25 flying hours per year. The North Koreans also have a large fleet of Russian-design biplanes that would be better suited to crop-spraying but could be used to drop special forces behind enemy lines in the event of conflict. To compensate for obsolescence, the North deploys boots on the ground in great numbers. Jane's estimates that its standing army numbers just over 1 million personnel, with reserves estimated at more than 7 million. But North Korean soldiers are poorly fed, according to analysts and reports from defectors, and rarely train due to scarcity of fuel and ammunition . Despite the size of its armed forces, few analysts expect that the regime in the North would want to launch a general assault on the South, knowing that it would probably be repulsed and that in turn would imperil the regime. It might also ignite dissent. ""With the ongoing leadership transition in North Korea, there have been rumors of discontent within the military, and the current actions may reflect miscommunications or worse within the North's command-and-control structure,"" geopolitical risk analysis firm Stratfor says. There is another practical reason why a land invasion would be difficult. South Korea has built an array of obstructions on roads from the North that would force an invader's tanks off the pavement and into rice fields. Only in the winter would those fields be hard enough to allow the tanks to cross them. Short of a general assault, the North clearly has enough in its arsenal to cause damage and death to its adversary, as the torpedo attack in March and the barrage this week have shown. And it has thousands of artillery pieces close to the Demilitarized Zone, which is just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Seoul. Recent events show that  it is also quite ready to exploit the element of surprise. There remains the great unanswered question about intentions. There's plenty of what one expert calls ""echo chamber analysis."" But as former President Carter wrote with a hint of understatement in the Washington Post on Wednesday: ""No one can completely understand the motivations of the North Koreans.""","A massive military parade in October gave a rare window on North Korea's hardware .
Its nuclear capability and ballistic missile technology are its trump card .

"(CNN)Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo -- who rose from the Depression-era streets of Queens to serve three times as governor and whose passionate keynote address at the 1984 Democratic political convention vaulted him onto the national political scene -- died Thursday. He was 82. Cuomo had been hospitalized recently to treat a heart condition. His family said he passed away, at home, from ""natural causes due to heart failure."" Cuomo was governor for three terms, from 1983 to 1995. He was married to his wife, Matilda, for more than six decades. They had five children, including current New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was sworn in for his second term Thursday, and Chris Cuomo, host of CNN's ""New Day."" Asked once how he wanted to be remembered, Mario Cuomo replied: ""One of the simple things I wanted to achieve is -- I want to be governor. I want to be the hardest working there ever was.  And I want, when it's over  -- and I figured on four years at first -- I want people to say, now, there was an honest person."" Democratic standard-bearer . Cuomo burst onto the national political stage with his keynote address at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. To say he was a powerful speaker would be an understatement. A Queens native, Cuomo was born in New York City, in the apartment above his father's grocery store. After a brief shot at a career in minor league baseball, he pursued a law degree and graduated at the top of his class at St. John's University School of Law. Although the allure of public service was strong, Cuomo's early attempts at seeking political office ended in defeat. His first electoral success came in 1978 as running mate to former Gov. Hugh Carey. Four years later, Carey stepped aside, and Cuomo entered the race and won. He held the governorship for three terms, winning two more handily by emphasizing lower taxes, balanced budgets, public education and affirmative action. He was a strong opponent of the death penalty. In 1993, Cuomo passed up the opportunity to be appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court, choosing instead to run for a fourth term as governor. He lost in 1994. Having fun in the face of defeat, Cuomo made a popular commercial for Doritos, which also starred Ann Richards, who lost the Texas governorship the same year. 'You can now sleep with the greats' President Barack Obama praised Cuomo for his faith in God and championing of progressive values in a statement issued by the White House. ""His own story taught him that as Americans, we are bound together as one people, and our country's success rests on the success of all of us, not just a fortunate few,"" the President said. Cuomo announced Bill Clinton's nomination for President at the 1992 Democratic Convention. ""It was Mario Cuomo's great gift and our good fortune that he was both a sterling orator and a passionate public servant. His life was a blessing,"" Clinton said in a statement. Obamas praise Mario Cuomo . Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, praised Cuomo's 1984 address as one of his all-time favorite speeches. ""Used to read it constantly for inspiration,"" he tweeted. Cuomo's death touched people across the political spectrum. ""Our country and our region lost a giant today with the passing of Governor Mario Cuomo,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in a statement. ""He was a strong, eloquent leader who loved New York and its people. As an Italian-American, he was also a role model for future generations that anything was possible through hard work and education."" The Rev. Al Sharpton remembered the former governor as ""the last liberal giant of New York politics."" ""He was a philosopher at heart that always saw the bigger picture.

"(CNN) -- The world's first stem cell burger was cooked and eaten in London today. The brainchild of Maastricht University's Mark Post, the burger was made of 20,000 small strands of meat grown from a cow's muscle cells and took three months to create. Breadcrumbs and some egg powder were added to the cultured beef to make it taste like a normal beef burger. To give it a beefy color, red beet juice and saffron were added. Chef Richard McGeown fried the stem cell burger with sunflower oil and butter and remarked that it looked slightly paler than a traditional burger. Two volunteers got to taste the five ounce (142g) burger, which was presented on a plate with a bun, salad and some tomato slices. After having the first bite and chewing thoughtfully many times, Hanni Rutzler, an Austrian food trends researcher, said: ""I expected the texture to be more soft -- it's not that juicy. It's close to meat but it misses salt and pepper."" The second volunteer to taste it agreed that the burger was missing something. Josh Schonwald, a Chicago-based author who writes about the future of food, said: ""It has a familiar mouth-feel to real meat. The flavor is different though. It misses fat."" Post presented the burger at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London, in front of more than 200 journalists and guests. ""Today's presentation is only a proof of concept that it's not science fiction,"" he said. ""However, there is still an efficiency issue and it remains expensive to develop."" Post spent four years researching and developing the cultured beef burger. He said he tasted it a couple of times during his research. ""I'd be perfectly comfortable with letting my kids eat it."" His kids might have to wait a while to get a bite of his burger. The cultured beef burger cost around $330,000 to develop, mostly funded through an anonymous donation. ""I think most people don't realize that the current meat production is at its maximum. We need to come up with an alternative,"" Post emphasized. Meat consumption is expected to rise nearly 73% by 2050, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Post hopes that his research into laboratory-made food could solve the looming food crisis. He says cultured beef does not burden the environment and will put an end to animal cruelty. The developers hope that cultured beef could end up on supermarket shelves within the next 10 to 20 years. The next step for Post and his team will be to work on how to get fat into the burger. Another challenge.","The first stem cell burger was cooked and eaten by two volunteer tasters in London .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)Divers are preparing to investigate underwater pings that may be coming from the flight recorders of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, Indonesia's military chief said Friday. An Indonesian search vessel had earlier detected the pings, said Gen. Moeldoko, the head of Indonesia's armed forces. He was speaking on board the ship that is being used as a base for divers trying to raise the tail of the AirAsia plane, which went down in the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board. But there is also caution surrounding the possible pings, because the sound could be emanating from other sources.  In the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, several signals raised hopes of locating the missing plane, but proved to be false leads. Search teams, which had been battling bad weather and strong currents, found the tail section on the sea floor Wednesday. That discovery was seen as significant because in the Airbus A320-200, the aircraft model of Flight QZ8501, the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder are housed in the tail. But before Friday, searchers hadn't reported detecting any possible pings from the locator beacons on the flight recorders, which are popularly known as black boxes. It was unclear whether the devices remained inside the tail or had come free. Batteries that send out the pings last 30 days.  It has been 13 days since the AirAsia plane fell into the sea. Conditions cleared up Friday, as divers prepared for a complicated operation to raise the tail to find the recorders. Divers are lowering ropes and slings down to the tail. The plan is to inflate giant airbags or balloons underneath to lift the tail from the bottom of the sea. A crane would then be used to raise the section. Search officials said that the underwater visibility and currents are much better than conditions in previous days. Experts say the information contained within the flight recorders is likely to enable investigators to figure out why Flight QZ8501 dropped off radar and went down in the sea on its way from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. The plane's pilot had asked to change course and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost, according to Indonesian officials. The vast majority of the people on the plane were Indonesian. There were also citizens of Great Britain, France, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. A total of 48 bodies have so far been recovered from the sea, Indonesia's search and rescue agency said Friday. Some of the bodies have been found still strapped into seats. CNN's Brad Olson, Madison Park and journalist Intan Hadidjah contributed to this report.","An Indonesian search vessel detected the pings, the country's military chief says .

"(CNN) -- Legalizing marijuana is a civil rights issue, according to one of California's most prominent African-American advocacy groups. The California State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, led by President Alice Huffman, recently announced its ""unconditional endorsement"" for Proposition 19, a legislative initiative on the November ballot that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana in California. Huffman said African-Americans are disproportionately affected by the criminalization of marijuana which makes passing the law a civil rights issue. ""We have empirical proof that the application of the marijuana laws has been unfairly applied to our young people of color,"" Huffman said in an official statement. ""Justice is the quality of being just and fair and these laws have been neither just nor fair."" Police departments in California have made more than 60,000 marijuana possession arrests in 2008, three times more than in 1990, according to a recent study released by the Drug Policy Alliancean organization that says it promotes policies to end the war on drugs. Although blacks and Latinos make up less than 44 percent of the state's population, together both ethnic groups constitute up to 56 percent of arrests that are made for marijuana possession in California, according to the study. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has found that African-Americans use marijuana at lower rates than white Americans across the country. The study said arrests in California are ""racially-biased"" and have led to a ""system-wide phenomenon, occurring in every county and nearly every police department in California, and elsewhere."" Hilary O. Shelton, vice president of advocacy for the NAACP, said these numbers make it a civil rights issue. ""We are usually conservative in terms of the issues that we support, but disproportionate prosecution of [African-Americans for] drug-related offenses for marijuana has called us to fight for decriminalization in our community."" ""If the law on drug possession was being enforced correctly, then the number of arrests and prosecutions and prison sentences would be proportionate to our society across the board,"" Shelton said. ""Sadly, that's not the picture."" But some African-Americans don't think the solution to the problem is to legalize marijuana. Bishop Ron Allen, an outspoken leader of the International Faith-Based Coalition and member of the NAACP, is outraged by the endorsement. He, along with 24 other faith- and activist-based organizations held a press conference in California Wednesday, calling for the resignation of Alice Huffman, claiming the California NAACP's endorsement of marijuana legislation is selling out the African-American community. ""If you think you are a civil rights leader, you should know better than anyone not to open the door to laws that will poison our community,"" Allen said. But Huffman's endorsement has been backed by other organizations that support civil rights, including LEAP, the Law Enforcement Against Prohibition. However, Allen believes that by supporting this initiative, Huffman is giving the NAACP ""a black eye."" ""We agree that the disproportionate arrests should change, but legalizing marijuana is not the way,"" Allen said. ""What it will create is for more incarceration, more drug babies, and more crime on the street. This is not a civil rights issue."" Allen, a former drug addict, said marijuana is a gateway drug that causes violence in poor communities and impedes the education of African-American youth. The California NAACP ""does not speak for the majority of the African-American community in this country,"" Allen said. ""What we need to do is support initiatives that help the black male progress in education and job placement."" ""How do you educate a mind that is intoxicated?"" In addition, Allen said, revenue raised from legalizing and taxing marijuana sales would not end up serving is community. ""To raise the $100 billion that would be needed to fund education in this state, the use of marijuana would have to increase by 20 to 40 percent,"" he said. ""This is a smokescreen and it's blood money."" But Shelton said Huffman's stand against criminalization supports NAACP founding principles. ""What the California state conference is trying to do is simply what is rooted in our mission: to eliminate racial prejudice wherever it may be,"" Shelton said. ""If members of our own community are able to see this as not just a drug issue, but a civil rights issue, I think individuals across the nation will reconsider their views on the marijuana legislation."" The decision on Proposition 19 will be made in California in November.","California NAACP supports state legislation for legalizing marijuana .

"When Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, anticipated his death more than 2,000 years ago, he wanted an army of warriors to guard his mausoleum forever and protect him in the afterlife. So he ordered the creation of some 8,000 terra-cotta soldiers, along with hundreds of terra-cotta horses and chariots, to be buried with him in his tomb. Historians speculate the soldiers were modeled after eight individuals. When the statues were discovered by workers digging a well in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, in 1974, the world was stunned by the spectacular funerary art and the legacy of the powerful emperor. Since then, it's become a major tourist attraction and a World Heritage site. Now, these soldiers have a counterpart: female terra-cotta warriors. Prune Nourry, a Paris-born artist based in New York City, has created a small army of them. In ""Terracotta Daughters,"" 116 are featured in an exhibition at the China Institute from September 10 through October 4. The show's U.S. premiere is presented by the French Institute Alliance Francaise and China Institute as part of FIAF's Crossing the Line festival. The difference is these female terra-cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor, but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in China. ""In China, there is a huge imbalance between boys and girls. I wanted to highlight the issue of gender preference,"" said Nourry. ""I needed a strong cultural symbol to base this project on, and a universal one that would speak both to Chinese villagers in the countryside and to citizens abroad."" And, in a striking parallel to the terra-cotta soldiers, the terra-cotta girls will also become an archaeological project. After the exhibition, they will be buried in China until 2030, the year that, according to Chinese sociologists, men will have the hardest time finding a wife because of the skewed gender ratio. The imbalance of the sexes is a serious problem for the Chinese. A 2010 census indicates there are at least 34 million more men than women. Due to the one-child policy and traditional preference for boys, as well as sex-selective technologies, China will have a huge surplus of men, which presents daunting demographic challenges for the world's most populous country. Perhaps for those reasons, Nourry didn't encounter difficulties with the Chinese government in pursuing this project in China. She started working on the terra-cotta statues two years ago after finishing an installation in India that also explored gender bias. In deciding on the size of the female army, Nourry chose the number eight because of its auspiciousness in Chinese culture. She created the first eight statues modeled after eight girls whom she met through an orphan charity in China. Then, working with local craftsmen in Xi'an, 108 permutations of statues were made based Nourry's original eight statues by combining the different heads, torsos and legs. ""For Xian Feng, the main craftsman I worked with in China, my project seemed at first impossible since women 'can't be soldiers.' But after we began the project, he changed his view and even turned one of the 108 combinations into a portrait of his own daughter,"" said Nourry. The local craftsmen of Xi'an are used to making copies of the terra-cotta warriors which are sold primarily to tourists. When Nourry asked them to give their artistic interpretation in sculpting the female statues, they were initially tentative. Over time, they lost their hesitancy and gave each statue unique faces. No two statues have the same features. Each terra-cotta warrior girl stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs about 260 pounds. Their hairstyles are contemporary, as are their uniform, which is modeled after the orphan girls' school attire. Unlike the male warriors, they look approachable, friendly and even charming. ""It was a very enriching collaboration, based on exchange and mutual respect,"" said Nourry. Her favorite moment was when the eight girls saw the terra-cotta statues of themselves and were delighted. Part of the proceeds from the sale of the eight original statues will pay for the cost of the eight girls' education for three years. ""Terracotta Daughters"" is impressive in its artistic craftsmanship and social statement. It's a refreshing reinterpretation of one of China's national symbols. With these modern female warriors, Prune raises the pressing issue of gender discrimination without pointing fingers at anyone or anything. One looks at these amazing terra-cotta statues and feel compelled to ask -- why aren't there more of them? And why aren't there more girls in China?","Artist Prune Nourry's show, ""Terracotta Daughters,"" opens in New York on Wednesday .

"Jason Griffin straps his right arm in bandages, preparing himself to grip the reins of a wildly bucking bronco. Tall, broad-shouldered, with a rough beard, he steps into his cowboy boots, fits a Stetson hat and heads out to meet his mount in the rodeo arena. Griffin is a four-time world champion bareback bucking horse rider -- competing in a sport that began in the 19th century heyday of the Wild West. With each victory -- he has also won three all-round rodeo championships -- the Texan raises awareness of a strong tradition which is rarely seen in the many novels, films and television series dedicated to the tales of the old West: The historic story of America's black cowboys. On cinema screens and paperback covers, the cowboys of old were heroic, hard-bitten and -- almost always -- white. In reality, the American West of the 1800s was traversed by an assortment of black, white, Mexican and Native American cattle hands. Contemporary records are rare but historians now estimate that up to one in four Texan cowboys was African American, while the number of Mexican cowboys was even greater. Watch online: the video trailer for the documentary ""The Forgotten Cowboys"" John Ferguson and Gregg MacDonald's documentary film -- and multimedia project -- ""The Forgotten Cowboys"" follows Griffin and other contemporary black cowboys as they gain a following competing at rodeos and go about their working lives. London-based photographer Ferguson first became interested in the group 10 years ago while watching a news report in New York about local black cowboys holding a parade. His interest was immediately piqued: ""It's really nice to find something that's new, isn't it?  They have been around for hundreds of years, but history has forgotten about them."" Read related: 'Texas in Queens': Junior wranglers find refuge with black cowboys . During the 17th and 18th century, many slaves were displaced from areas of Western Africa where cattle herding cultures -- as depicted in 4,000 year old cave paintings at Tassili n'Ajjer, in the south of modern-day Algeria -- had existed for millennia. But historians say that those who became cowboys in the 19th century joined a new cultural tradition -- developed in the company of their European and Native American counterparts -- with different breeds of cattle and new techniques. Life for a black cowboy was tough, explains Michael Searles, Emeritus Assistant Professor of History at Augusta State University, who has edited an anthology of writing on the subject. ""Black cowboys were sometimes expected to do ... more than their white counterpart -- in other words, some of the roughest work."" ""Breaking of stock (taming horses) and getting horses ready to ride each morning was often the work of the black cowboy -- where there were black cowboys -- and when they had to cross a swollen river to move cattle ... black cowboys were the first to cross that river."" Searles -- known to his students as Cowboy Mike -- lectures in a check shirt, bandana and ten gallon hat. He explains that life as a cowboy was still preferable to other roles given to slaves and, later, free African Americans in the South, such as picking cotton on a plantation. ""Many black cowboys, when they were slaves, weren't treated as you'd think a traditional slave would be treated, because a cowboy needed a lot more independence,"" said Searles. In America: Top-ranked polo players hail from Philadelphia's inner city . Even after the abolition of slavery, prejudice and discrimination were still common -- but black cowboys could expect a better relationship with white Americans than many. Ferguson talks about a ""cowboy code"" of equal responsibility, teamwork and mutual protection binding today's cowboys and their black and white ancestors. Mike agrees that a kind of loyalty developed between cowboys of different races -- but suggests that cowboys were initially united by necessity. ""If you've got nine or 10 cowboys on a cattle drive, you are interdependent with the folk who are riding with you -- they can either save your life or they can let you die. ""There are times when you really need the assistance of another cowboy. That was not the place to be too prejudiced or too hostile to the cowboy riding next to you,"" says Ferguson, the filmmaker. Asked how the image of the black cowboy disappeared from popular culture, Ferguson points the finger at the Western movie business of the mid-20th century. ""Hollywood played a major part in dismissing the role of black cowboys. In 99% of Western cowboy films, there is no black cowboy."" ""America was a divided country -- segregation -- Hollywood played their part down. Compare Clint Eastwood or John Wayne to the black cowboys. It just doesn't fit the image. Black cowboy. A hero.""","Photographer John Ferguson documents the lives of modern-day black cowboys .

"(CNN) -- It debuted in obscurity on early morning cable TV and took off in a way that has ""gobsmacked"" its creators. The sitcom parody video, ""Too Many Cooks,"" first aired on October 27 at 4 a.m. on Adult Swim, CNN cousin late-night network. The 11-minute video started making the rounds on social media after its creators uploaded the video to YouTube on Friday and it got a boost from Reddit users. ""We made TOO MANY COOKS for Adult Swim and think the level of response is more surreal even than the thing itself,"" creators Casper Kelly and Paul Painter said on Reddit. What's fueling its popularity? It's hard to say, exactly, because there's a lot going on in the video. But for those susceptible to pop culture nostalgia it's hard to look away, despite the long run time. On the surface, the video is a parody of television intros from the 1980s, evoking quintessential motifs of the era, from sweater vests, side ponytails and tacky couches to twin actors playing a cute baby and an ALF-like creature named Smarf. The catchy jingle and ugly credit font bring to mind TV hits like ""Growing Pains,"" ""Perfect Strangers"" and ""Family Matters."" As the video moves from one genre to the next, introducing more characters in cop dramas, sitcoms and a GI Joe-like cartoon, a machete-wielding serial killer emerges, and things just get weirder and weirder. Lars von Trier plays a pie? Where does an idea like this come from? ""I've always been a fan of humor that just pushes things past the point of funny,"" Kelly told Rolling Stone. ""When you watch those Andy Kaufman routines, or the old David Letterman bits where he keeps repeating and repeating a joke until it becomes banal and irritating -- and then eventually works its way back to being hilarious again -- that, to me, is the funniest. So the notion was simply, what if you had this credits sequence to a Full House-type show that went on and on and on...""

"Hundreds of women gathered on Sunday in Istanbul in the latest demonstration against the religiously conservative ruling party's plans to restrict access to abortion. Last month Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan catapulted the issue to forefront of public debate in Turkey when he called abortion ""murder."" A day later, he amplified the controversy by equating a botched military operation in Uludere with abortion. The Uludere massacre claimed the lives of 34 Kurds in southeastern Turkey when faulty intelligence led to an airstrike on a group of smugglers crossing the Turkish- Iraqi border. After Erdogan's comment, Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdag issued a statement indicating that he would be submitting a proposal to lawmakers in the upcoming month, raising fears that the ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, was preparing to introduce legislation to curb, if not fully block, access to abortion. Forced abortion sparks outrage in China . The protesters who convened Sunday marched to Istanbul's busy Taksim Square, carrying signs that read ""AKP: Get your hands off my body,"" ""Murder is outlawing abortion,"" and ""Abortion is a right. Uludere is a massacre."" Many protesters believe that Erdogan is playing to his base of culturally conservative voters, a strategy in line with his views as a pious Muslim as well as one that protestors see as an attempt to divert attention from the operation in Uludere. ""The prime minster is conservative. He does have Islamist sensibilities as well as his party, obviously, so he is trying to impose his understanding of faith and what Islam demands and so on to the rest of the population,"" said Binnaz Toprak, an opposition party Parliamentarian attending Sunday's march. ""But at the same time I also feel that this is a cover-up for the Uludere massacre."" Abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy was legalized in Turkey in 1983 and has rarely, if ever, inspired much public debate in the three decades since. Public support today also seems to remain high, with a poll commissioned by Turkish newspaper Haberturk indicating that 55.5% of Turks do not support a ban on abortion. Experts warn that restricted access does not decrease the abortion rate but drives the procedure underground, creating a black market that threatens maternal health and more adversely affects poorer women who do not have access to safe abortions abroad. Turkey has a 14.8% abortion rate compared to 18.9% in the United States, according to a 2011 United Nations Population Division study. U.S. House rejects sex-selection abortion ban . Erdogan is seeking to restrict not only abortion but also births by caesarean section, a procedure whose growing popularity he has attributed to secret foreign plots to stall Turkey's economic growth. Turkey's incidence of births by caesarean section -- more than 45% in 2011, according to the Turkish Health Ministry -- is much higher than the World Health Organization's recommended rate. CDC: More C-sections than ever in U.S. Erdogan's worries about declining birth rates may be unfounded. Turkey, in comparison to its European neighbors, does not face population decline, with a projected population growth rate of 1.14% compared with Europe's 0.11%, according to the United Nations. ""It is about having more people in Turkey. To have more workers to work and then during war, they need more soldiers,"" said Nacide Berber, a member of the Feminist Collective at Sunday's protest. Poll: 'Pro-choice' at record low . Erdogan, a social and religious conservative, has outraged feminists in Turkey in the past by insisting that women bear at least three children to ensure a young population to keep Turkey's economy strong. Then, while on a trip to Kazakhstan, he urged women to have five children. ""Actually, you know, it's not a shock for us, for women.

"(CNN) -- Talk show host Oprah Winfrey on Monday said she was not satisfied with the acquittal of a woman accused of abusing students at the her South African girls school. Tiny Virginia Makopo, 30, was found not guilty of allegations that she improperly touched several teenage girls when she was a matron at the campus near Johannesburg soon after it opened in 2007, the South African Press Association reported Monday. ""We began this child molestation trial in July 2008,"" Winfrey said in a written statement. ""More than two years later, I am profoundly disappointed at the outcome of the trial."" Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about abuse she suffered as a child -- became personally involved in the abuse investigation after a student reported the alleged abuse in October 2007. She cried for half an hour after receiving the call from the CEO of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls, and she then hired a team of American private investigators to work with South African police on the case, she said. ""I wanted to hire an independent team because my experience with child predators is that no one ever, ever abuses just one child,"" Winfrey said at the time. Despite the verdict, Winfrey said she appreciated the efforts of the prosecutors and police, ""who sought justice and treated the girls with the utmost care and respect."" ""I will forever be proud of the nine girls who testified with the courage and conviction to be heard,"" Winfrey said.

"""Frequency modulation,"" exclaims South African radio shock jock Gareth Cliff in an online video posted earlier this year. ""Which f***ing Hitler used in World War II for propaganda!"" Cliff -- who is famous for his outrageousness on the airwaves and is sometimes compared to American radio personality Howard Stern -- tries hard to stifle a grin that betrays a mischievous mixture of exasperation and comedic bombast. ""Is this a medium we should be proud to use?"" The audience laughs -- but the bonhomie belies a serious point. How has radio progressed so little over the last 70 years? Sure, there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today, Cliff explains. But much of the original formula where a presenter broadcasts to a passive listener interspersed by advertisements remains. It was this stasis that eventually pushed Cliff to earlier this year quit his popular morning show at national station 5FM and take a leap into the unknown. Radio Revolution . He has since founded Cliff Central, a web-only ""un-radio"" venture that aims to merge online broadcasting with social media and instant messaging platforms. The idea is to engage directly with listeners (and attract advertisers) and the early benefits are many, Cliff says. No longer is he constrained by regulatory guidelines -- meaning he can drop the F-bomb live on air without a rap on the knuckles -- nor does he have to pay for a broadcast license. But the real advantage, he explains, is interacting with listeners in a new and exciting environment. ""Mobile is definitely where the action is,"" Cliff says. ""We have phones with us wherever we go."" This is increasingly the case in Africa. Market intelligence firm, the International Data Corporation, expects the smartphone market on the continent to double in volume over the next three years and account for close to a third of all handset shipments by 2017. South Africa will remain the largest smartphone market in Africa in the near-term with more than a million units being shipped there each month, the IDC said last year. ""Anybody who isn't adaptable to the possibilities that mobile represents is going to miss out on a huge business opportunity,"" according to Cliff. The rise of mobile . Like most modern media outlets, Cliff Central has embraced the likes of Facebook and Twitter (a task made easier by the fact Cliff has close to a million Twitter followers), integrating them into its service early on. All shows are also available via live streaming, podcast and for online download after the event. The most intriguing development, however, is what Cliff Central is doing on the hugely popular mobile communication app, WeChat. Thanks to an initial partnership with the Chinese firm -- who have been looking at ways of publicizing their services in Africa -- users have been able to listen to Cliff Central shows through the app, as well as being able to directly contact presenters and debate the content of shows with friends and fellow WeChat users. The concept is similar to the way that people may watch something on TV and then use Twitter to discuss what's going on via hashtags. The major difference with Cliff Central's WeChat platform is that broadcast and discussion all happen within one app. ""We've got 120,000 WeChat official account subscribers to Cliff Central. I don't know if that's a lot or a few as I don't really have a frame of reference to compare it to,"" Cliff explains. ""But what I'm pleased about is that the level of engagement with those people is extremely high and it's growing."" It's this engagement that Cliff explains is proving attractive to advertisers. In the future, rather than being subjected to five or six minute advertisements for products that may or may not be relevant -- as currently happens on the radio -- he foresees companies targeting consumers more directly through the app and podcasts. This will leave greater time for programming and should prove more fruitful for advertisers. ""I think that's a real value proposition to an audience,"" Cliff says. ""It's also a very big commercial proposition and it ties radio in most especially in a measurable way."" Relaying the instant message . Numerous other media organizations have already tried to square the circle of using popular instant messaging platforms to distribute their content. The BBC used the WeChat and Whatsapp products when covering the Indian elections in early 2014. The corporation also adapted the Mxit app to distribute content during South Africa's parliamentary elections in May. Elsewhere, Buzzfeed have added a Whatsapp sharing button on their mobile stories while WeChat has stated its intention to move into Nigeria and other African countries where smartphone usage is high by working with local media organisations. Closer to Cliff Central in South Africa, other web-only stations have popped-up in recent years. 2Oceansvibe Radio was one of the country's first online-only outfits and paired up with WeChat a few months after Cliff Central launched. According to Chris Botha, managing director of industry analysts The Media Shop, both ventures have generated a lot of buzz. But Botha is quick to add that it's difficult to tell how successful they have been so far because they have ""been quite cagey in terms of the data they are sharing with advertisers."" Cliff even admitted earlier this year that releasing a rate card at the wrong time could ""kill us."" And building the audience isn't the only problem the online upstarts face. Broadcast radio remains popular, free to listen to and attractive for advertisers, Botha adds. Then there are the potential added data costs for listeners streaming content on their phones. For Cliff, these are challenges, but they are not insurmountable. He is clear that he doesn't want to replace radio in South Africa, rather offer something different. ""What's different is we are using superior technology to allow people to consume on their own basis what they'd like,"" he said. Advertisers ""really get this. The people who really know about these things (media, digital advertising and branded content) are as excited about this as we are,"" he adds. Given the popularity of radio and the growth of smart phone devices in South Africa and across the continent, there will be plenty of observers interested in how Cliff's ""un-radio"" project turns out.","Cliff Central is new mobile 'unradio' station by South African shock jock Gareth Cliff .

"(CNN) -- Two employees at the Baltimore, Maryland, branch of the liberal community organizing group ACORN were caught on tape allegedly offering advice to a pair posing as a pimp and prostitute on setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS. The footage, which appears to have been edited in places, was recorded and posted online Thursday. The video footage -- which has been edited and goes to black in some areas -- was recorded and posted online Thursday by James O'Keefe, a conservative activist. He was joined on the video by another conservative, Hannah Giles, who posed as the prostitute in the filmmakers' undercover sting. The video shows the pair approaching two women working at the ACORN Baltimore office and asking them for advice on how to set up a prostitution ring involving more than a dozen underage girls from El Salvador. One of the ACORN workers suggests that Giles refer to herself as a ""performing artist"" on tax forms and declare some of the girls as dependents to receive child tax credits. ""Stop saying prostitution,"" the woman, identified by the filmmaker as an ACORN tax expert, tells Giles. The other woman tells them, ""You want to keep them clean ... make sure they go to school.""  Watch tape of alleged advice on prostitution » . Both women appear enthusiastic to help. Calls to ACORN's Baltimore offices were not immediately returned Thursday. Stuart Katzenberg, lead organizer for ACORN's Maryland chapter, told the Baltimore Sun that both ACORN employees were fired because they ""did not meet ACORN's standards of professionalism."" Sonja Merchant-Jones, chair of Baltimore City ACORN, told CNN affiliate WMAR-TV that the fired workers were seasonal, part-time employees and that no senior ACORN staff members were in the building at the time the film was made. Scott Levenson, a spokesman at ACORN's national offices said, ""The portrayal is false and defamatory and an attempt at 'gotcha journalism.' ""This film crew tried to pull this sham at other offices and failed. ACORN wants to see the full video before commenting further,"" Levenson said. The conservative filmmakers unsuccessfully attempted similar ruses at the group's offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Los Angeles, California, and New York, Levenson said. Law enforcement officials in the Baltimore area wouldn't confirm whether they are investigating the alleged incident at the local ACORN office. However, authorities said that under Maryland law, such undercover video may not be admissible in court as evidence. CNN attempted to reach O'Keefe and Giles; O'Keefe was not available for comment and Giles canceled an interview scheduled for Thursday. ACORN -- an acronym for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- made headlines last year when Republican groups seized on allegations of voter registration fraud by the group in Florida and several other states, claiming its workers were trying to push the election in Barack Obama's favor. On Wednesday, arrest warrants were issued for 11 Florida voter registration workers suspected of submitting false information on hundreds of voter registration cards, according to court documents. The Florida investigation was triggered by ACORN officials who noticed irregularities in forms they were receiving. Founded in 1970, ACORN calls itself ""the nation's largest grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people."" The group says it has more than 400,000 member families organized into more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in 110 cities. Besides voter registration, the group focuses on issues such as predatory lending, the minimum wage and funding for public schools, according to its Web site. It also provides free tax-return preparation for low-income people and screening for state and federal benefit programs. CNN's Bill Tucker, Chris Murphey and Steve Turnham contributed to this report.","Video shows pair ask ACORN employees for advice on setting up prostitution ring .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A Los Angeles County grand jury has indicted the former city administrator of Vernon, California, an industrial city that borders scandal-plagued Bell, on three felony counts after an investigation into questionable business practices. Court documents show that Donal O'Callaghan has been indicted on two counts of conflict of interest and a count of public officer crime related to the misappropriation of public funds. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office says the counts against O'Callaghan, 54, involve an alleged misappropriation of more than $140,000. ""The law prevents public officials from making contracts the have a personal interest in and Mr. O'Callaghan made a contract that paid his wife money,"" said deputy District Attorney Max Huntsman. ""We're alleging he paid her more than $140,000."" The grand jury was looking into business deals between O'Callaghan and his wife, Kimberly McBride. According to Vernon city records, the city hired McBride in 2009 as a $40-per-hour consultant and for ""administrative account services."" ""It's preposterous that he was indicted for the hiring of his wife, which was done with the knowledge and consent of the city attorney and the City Council of Vernon,"" defense lawyer Mark Werksman told CNN. ""We are seeing an overreaction and hysterical response to the scandal in neighboring Bell,"" he said. ""They are looking for examples of municipal government corruption behind every bush. But it isn't here."" Huntsman disagreed with Werksman's contention. 'I think it's a reaction to Vernon, which has a long history of criminal behavior by public officials. We heard complaints against Mister O'Callaghan, looked into the law and found a basis for the charges,"" Huntsman said. ""The fact that it coincides with criminal charges against officials in Bell has to do with raised public awareness about corruption in municipal governments."" O'Callaghan, who was not taken into custody, pleaded not guilty and posted a $50,000 bond, Huntsman said. His next court date is December 3. If convicted, his maximum sentence is four years and eight months in prison, prosecutors said. The former official was placed on administrative leave August 26 and resigned his city position October 14. The California attorney general's office also has launched an investigation into questionable business practices in the industrial city. Vernon has a population of a little less than 100 people, according to the Los Angeles Almanac. But Vernon is home to more than 1,800 businesses, including Farmer John, Tapatio Hot Sauce and Seven For All Mankind Jeans, stacked into just five square miles. The former city manager of Bell, along with four City Council members, two former council members and a former assistant city manager, were arrested in September and face charges that include misappropriation of funds, conflict of interest and making or receiving illegal loans.","NEW: Accused pleads not guilty .

"This week, the U.S. Navy forsook a tradition dating back to the 1800s. Why? Because it's now too easily confused with the musings of an Internet lunatic. Naval commanders this week announced that they would be getting rid of a rule that all official communications should be in all-caps. It's a tradition dating to the 1850s, when the military used teletype machines that didn't have lowercase letters. The change is meant to simplify communication and is supposed to save the Navy $15 million because it can get rid of a dedicated messaging service and use regular old e-mail instead. But we have to think not wanting to sound like you're shouting at someone who SAID SOMETHING WRONG ON THE INTERNET played a role, too. The most gentle message can come across as psychotically aggressive when typed in all caps. So as the Navy transitions, we decided to round up five of our favorite examples of all-cap craziness. The Kanye mea culpa . Perhaps it's not a rant, as such. (Though he's certainly been no stranger to them). But we had to go with the time Kanye West slammed down the caps lock to apologize, on his blog, for his infamous stage-bombing of Taylor Swift at the 2009 Video Music Awards. ""I'M SOOOOO SORRY TO TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS AND HER MOM. I SPOKE TO HER MOTHER RIGHT AFTER AND SHE SAID THE SAME THING MY MOTHER WOULD'VE SAID. SHE IS VERY TALENTED! I LIKE THE LYRICS ABOUT BEING A CHEERLEADER AND SHE'S IN THE BLEACHERS! ........................ I'M IN THE WRONG FOR GOING ON STAGE AND TAKING AWAY FROM HER MOMENT!................."" Of course, in the grand tradition of half-apologies, he spends several of his remaining loud sentences justifying the moment he interrupted Swift's acceptance speech to say that Beyonce should have won instead of her. ""BEYONCE'S VIDEO WAS THE BEST OF THIS DECADE!!!! I... WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD!!!! EVERYBODY WANNA BOOOOO ME BUT I'M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE!!! ... I'M STILL HAPPY FOR TAYLOR!!!! BOOOYAAAWWWW!!!! YOU ARE VERY VERY TALENTED!!! ...  I'M NOT CRAZY YALL, I'M JUST REAL."" Gotcha. The Bakery flame-out . Having your restaurant appear on ""Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"" is bad enough. Having the host quit on you because you're too hard to work with is even worse. Flaming out about it on Facebook in a series of profanity-laced all-caps outbursts? Priceless. Amy's Baking Company, in Scottsdale, Arizona, experienced just that last month after appearing on the show with the famously acerbic chef. So, after the show aired, the smart thing to do would be to take to social media to calmly explain how your restaurant was misrepresented, right? Or, you can try this: . ""WE DO NOT NEED THIS. YOU STUPID PEOPLE. ... DO NOT BLAME US BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT AFFORD QUALITY. THE YELPERS, AND NOW THE REDDITS, NEED TO BACK OFF. YOURE NOT RIGHT BECAUSE OF SOME TV SHOW."" A Facebook freakout? Wrong you are, apparently: . ""WE ARE NOT FREAKING OUT WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT A 'WITCH HUNT' I AM NOT A WITCH. I AM GODS CHILD. P--- OFF ALL OF YOU. F--- REDDITS, F--- YELP AND F--- ALL OF YOU. BRING IT. WE WILL FIGHT BACK."" Believe us when we tell you they were just getting started. Things got so bad that Amy's has since created a new Facebook page. Nearly a month later, let's just say that it's still not polite coffee talk. The Comic Sans LeBron slam . Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert's 2010 open letter to fans after LeBron James left the team for the shores of South Beach is mainly remembered for another typographical choice. His fiery screed was typed in Comic Sans -- an Internet-reviled font that is sort of hard to read without giggling. But it was the single sentence he decided to go all-caps with that makes this list: . ""I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE"" As you NBA fans may have noted, James already has one title under his belt with the Miami Heat and he's currently in the finals playing for number two. The Cavs? Still waiting. I'll tweet you, babe . OK, Cher, we get it. Donald Trump rubs a lot of people the wrong way. From the tone-deaf self-promotion to the strident political views, Mr. Apprentice has mixed it up with everyone from irreverent sports blog Deadspin to CNN's own Wolf Blitzer. So when the pop-music icon caught on to an effort to boycott Trump's line of neckties, she was so worked up she had to do it in all-caps. ""I'll NEVER GO TO MACY'S AGAIN! I didn't know they sold Donald Trump's Line! If they don't care that they sell products from a LOUDMOUTH,"" Cher wrote on Twitter. Then:  ""RACIST CRETIN,WHO'D LIE LIKE 'HIS RUG' TO GET SOME CHEAP PRESS! I CANT BELIEVE MACY'S THINKS HE'S THE RIGHT 'MAN' 2 REPRESENT THEIR NAME!"" Say what you will about The Donald. At least he didn't resort to all-caps in his response. ""@cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career!"" Trump wrote. We didn't say it was classy. Just that it wasn't in all-caps. Drunk Hulk Is drunk . OK, we didn't say they were the worst all-caps rants. Just the top ones. And it's hard to top an enormous green rage monster who has knocked back a few too many. Twitter's Drunk Hulk, one of our favorite parody accounts, tweets sort of exactly like you'd imagine a witty, pre-intervention Hulk would tackle the topics of the day. On government surveillance: ""IT GREAT GOVERNMENT RECORD EVERY PHONE CALL! NOW DRUNK HULK FIND OUT WHAT WAS SAID WHEN DRUNK HULK CALL YOU LAST NIGHT!"" On really sad fantasy epics: ""GAME OF THRONES! GO TO YOUR ROOM! AND THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DONE!"" On a Billy Joel classic: ""IF YOU SEE MAN MAKING LOVE TO TONIC AND GIN AT BAR! NO SING SONG ABOUT IT! CALL POLICE IMMEDIATELY!"" His whole Twitter feed is an all-caps rant. And we're not going to tell him to stop, are you? What did we miss? Let us know about some of your favorite rants in the comments.","The U.S. Navy has announced it will no longer communicate in all-caps .

"Two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot, who were serving two-year jail terms for their part in a performance critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, have been released from prison. Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were released about two months before their prison sentences were due to end. The release was approved last week when Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law announced by Putin. ""Two months out of the almost two years that the girls have served is not much,"" Tolokonnikova's husband, Pyotr Verzilov, told CNN. ""So the effect of this amnesty for Maria and Nadezhda is not really felt."" The Russian government said the amnesty marked the anniversary of the adoption of Russia's post-Communist constitution in 1993. But Tolokonnikova, released from a Siberian facility on Monday, told CNN she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in February. Verzilov said much the same. ""President Putin obviously used this amnesty option to (brighten) up his image before the Olympic games,"" Verzilov said. Russia's record on human rights is in the spotlight as the country prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Pussy Riot's 2012 performance of a ""punk prayer"" that criticized Putin, who was prime minister at the time, was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. The musicians were found guilty of hooliganism. Tolokonnikova went on a hunger strike during her prison term to protest what she said were poor conditions at a Mordovian prison. In October, she was transferred to a Siberian facility for medical treatment, and she remained there until her release Monday. She said Monday that she is eager to help Russian prisoners by calling attention to conditions they face. But first, she said, she is looking forward to reuniting with family, including her 5-year-old daughter in Moscow. In a lengthy letter in September to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described ""slave labor"" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury for up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties. Tolokonnikova wrote that her life was once threatened and other prisoners told her she was not beaten only because of the celebrity her case has brought her. Others are not so lucky, she said. Prison authorities told state news agency RIA Novosti then that Tolokonnikova was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have young children and therefore qualified for the amnesty, Russian media reported. The new amnesty law is also expected to free some detained Greenpeace activists. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic, was released from a lengthy period in prison last week after a pardon from Putin. Khodorkovsky had been in prison since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. He was due for release next year.","Nadezhda Tolokonnikova says she believes her release is pre-Olympics publicity stunt .

"The team behind a smartphone-based portable eye examination kit have just launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for new innovation. Peek comprises a smartphone app and low-cost adaptor that enables professional eye examinations anywhere in the world. Developed by a team of eye care specialists, software developers and product designers, it aims to increase access to high-quality eye care worldwide. The tools have been developed through a collaboration between the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the University of Strathclyde and the NHS Glasgow Centre for Ophthalmic Research. Their latest adaptor, Peek Retina, can be clipped over the camera of a smartphone to allow health workers to see inside an eye and capture high-quality images to be sent to experts for diagnosis. It removes the need for traditional ophthalmoscopes and bulky cameras, enabling examinations in any part of the world. Other conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure can be detected. ""Around 39 million people are blind,"" Peek's creator Dr Andrew Bastawrous told Mashable. ""80% of this blindness is avoidable, but in many regions people don't have access to eye care,"" he said. The Indiegogo campaign allows pledgers to purchase the kit for themselves for £60 ($95) or pay for it to be sent to a healthcare worker on their behalf, via their partners Médecins Sans Frontières and the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness. The estimated delivery date is October 2015. The kit currently only works on a Samsung S3, so they need investment to make it universal. It also doesn't currently have FDA approval so can't be shipped to the U.S. SEE ALSO: Hoax radio message sparks search for fake missing plane . More substantial donations offer the chance to be a founding supporter, or to join their distribution network. Peek Retina was borne out of Bastawrous' frustration at having to transport bulky eye equipment to remote areas in Kenya during a community study as part of his PhD at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. He was carrying ""around £100,00 of kit"", including a slit lamp, a retinal camera and big vision charts among other items. ""All required a stable power supply and people to operate them,"" he said. ""I thought there must be another way."" The Peek system can replace all of that, and offers more benefits on top, he insists. For example, a phone's GPS can be used to mark the location of someone the team has examined, so they can follow up with appropriate treatment. Another advantage of the system is that people without healthcare backgrounds can be trained to use the kit. The team saw a number of patients using both systems, the ""gold standard"" original kit and the smartphone option, and sent the results to Moorfields Eye Hospital, who decided both systems were comparable. The team received funding from The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust in 2013 and are using that support to conduct a series of trials over the next five years among communities in Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Malawi, India and the UK. Dr Giardini, Lecturer in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde, who also worked on the project said: ""Peek Retina is the optimal combination of solid engineering experience, ingenuity and outlook to social impact. The Peek Retina adapter is the most exciting thing my group has ever designed; it is incredibly simple and yet it will change the way we look at eyes.""

"An Army veteran who neighbors say played in a far-right punk band was the lone shooter in the rampage at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin that killed six people and wounded four, according to information Monday from law enforcement authorities. Wade Michael Page, 40, was shot to death by police responding to the Sunday morning attack in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, the community's chief of police told reporters. A long history of bias crimes against Sikhs . Sunday's attack occurred 16 days after a gunman killed 12 people and wounded scores in a Colorado movie theater, reigniting the gun-control debate in the United States. ""These kinds of terrible and tragic events are happening with too much regularity for us not do some soul-searching and examine additional ways that we can prevent"" such violence, President Barack Obama told reporters when asked about the Wisconsin shooting at a White House bill-signing ceremony. However, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg criticized Obama and certain Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for not advocating tougher laws to prevent dangerous people from obtaining guns. ""The fact that criminals, terrorists and other mentally ill people have access to guns is a national crisis,"" Bloomberg said during a visit to a Sikh community center in Queens. Bernard Zapor -- the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives special agent in the investigation -- said Monday that the 9mm semiautomatic handgun with multiple ammunition magazines used by the attacker had been legally purchased. Page bought the gun on July 28 at the Shooters Shop in West Allis, Wisconsin, and picked it up two days later, according to a law enforcement official. The suspect bought ammunition there and used the shop's range at some point, said the official. The gunman shot people inside and outside the Sikh house of worship, including a police officer, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said. Another police officer with a rifle then shot the gunman, who died at the scene. Read Obama's statement on the Wisconsin shooting . While authorities said Page was the only gunman, they also had been looking for another man spotted at the crime scene Sunday who left before anyone could identify him. On Monday, the FBI's Paul Bresson said the man being sought had been ""located, interviewed and cleared."" Edwards said authorities were still in contact with that person. According to Edwards and the FBI, authorities have received tips that Page might have links to the white supremacist movement, but nothing had been confirmed. ""I don't want to use that term (white supremacist) until we want to put it out there for sure,"" Edwards said Monday night. ""That's not something I can take back."" Authorities are following up on numerous leads and are still reviewing exterior videos of the temple, Edwards told CNN's ""AC360."" Investigators haven't identified a known motive, he said. Two neighbors of Page identified him in photos that showed him playing in the far-right punk band ""End Apathy,"" and the nephew of the slain president of the Sikh temple said the attacker had a 9/11 tattoo on his arm. Teresa Carlson, the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation of Sunday's shooting, said no motive for the attack has been established. The FBI was looking into whether it was domestic terrorism, which is the use of violence for political or social gain, Carlson said. ""We are looking at ties to white supremacist groups,"" Carlson told a news conference, adding there was no active investigation of Page prior to Sunday's attack. According to a man who described himself as an old Army buddy of Page's, the attacker talked about ""racial holy war"" when they served together in the 1990s. Christopher Robillard of Oregon, who said he lost contact with Page more than a decade ago, added that when Page would rant, ""it would be about mostly any non-white person."" ""He didn't seem like the type of person to go out and hurt people,"" Robillard said. ""He would talk about it all the time, but it was more like he was waiting for the ... revolution to start."" Page, born on Veterans Day in 1971, joined the Army in 1992 and left the service in 1998, according to Army spokesman George Wright. His service was marked by ""patterns of misconduct,"" though he received an honorable discharge, according to a Pentagon official. The suspect did have a criminal record, Edwards said. A background check showed Page had separate convictions for DUI in Colorado in 1999 and for criminal mischief in Texas in 1994. A federal law enforcement official told CNN that investigators interviewed a former girlfriend of Page. The woman said the pair had recently broken up, and she told investigators she had no indication Page planned such an attack. She provided the names of friends and associates of Page, the official said. Page's family said it was ""devastated by the horrific events,"" according to the Journal Sentinel newspaper. ""While there can be no words of comfort that will make sense of what happened that day, please be aware that our thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims and their families,"" the family said in a text message, according to the newspaper. ""We share in their grief for all who lost their lives that day and for those survivors, we hope for a speedy recovery. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the investigation in any way we can. Please respect our privacy as we try to deal with the tragic loss of life and family."" Obama noted Monday that the motive for attack had yet to be determined, but if it turns out to be based on the ethnicity of the worshipers, ""I think the American people immediately recoil from those kinds of attitudes."" Because of their customary beards and turbans, Sikh men are often confused with Muslims, and they have been the targets of hate crimes since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. The six victims of Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. Photos: Shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin . Two other Sikh victims remained hospitalized in critical condition, while a third was treated and released, Edwards said. Prayer vigils were held Monday night in the Milwaukee metropolitan area, with another scheduled for Tuesday evening. The wounded police officer, identified as 51-year-old Lt. Brian Murphy, also was in critical condition, the police chief said. Edwards told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that Murphy had a ""promising,"" but long, recovery ahead. The officer suffered nine gunshot wounds. Terror, tragedy for tight-knit Sikh community . One of the dead, Prakash Singh, was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children, said Justice Singh Khalsa, a temple member since the 1990s. Relatives of Kaleka, the president of the temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, said that he was killed fighting the attacker. ""From what we understand, he basically fought to the very end and suffered gunshot wounds while trying to take down the gunman,"" said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka, his nephew. Kaleka said those inside the gurdwara, or Sikh house of worship, described the attacker as a bald white man, dressed in a white T-shirt and black pants and with the 9/11 tattoo on one arm, which ""implies to me that there's some level of hate crime there."" Belief Blog: Who are Sikhs? While officials try to piece together what prompted the man to go on his shooting spree, America's Sikh community struggled to come to grips with the brutal attack. A Sikh human rights group said it would give a $10,000 reward to Murphy, the police officer wounded in the attack. ""Our government must take urgent steps to educate the country about the Sikh population and help put an end to these horrific and deadly acts of violence,"" said a statement by the group, Sikhs for Justice. Kaleka was horrified to have such violence occur at his place of worship, especially so soon after the 12 killings at a screening of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in Aurora, Colorado. ""You're talking about Aurora one minute, and the next minute it's you and your family,"" Kaleka said. Meanwhile in India, the birthplace of Sikhism, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the shooting. ""That this senseless act of violence should be targeted at a place of religious worship is particularly painful,"" Singh, himself a Sikh, said. The country's main Sikh political party, the Shiromani Akali Dal, held a demonstration in New Delhi's embassy district Monday to protest. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke by phone with India's foreign minister, and U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell met with Sikh community leaders in New Delhi and visited the largest Sikh temple in the city, said State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell. Sunday's attack occurred about 10:30 a.m., when temple members were reading scriptures and cooking food in preparation for the main Sunday service and community lunch. The temple has more than 350 members. According to witnesses, the gunman started shooting in the parking lot, killing at least one person. He then entered the temple and continued firing, they said. Police spent Sunday night searching the shooter's home in nearby Cudahy, a short distance from the temple. Political leaders at the national, state and local level offered condolences for the killings and declared solidarity with the Sikh community. Obama ordered U.S flags flown at half-staff through Friday ""as a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence."" In a statement Sunday, Obama said the United States had been ""enriched"" by Sikhs, and that his administration ""will provide whatever support is necessary to the officials who are responding to this tragic shooting and moving forward with an investigation."" Romney, meanwhile, called the slayings ""a senseless act of violence and a tragedy that should never befall any house of worship."" Romney: A 'senseless act of violence' The United States is home to about 700,000 Sikhs, nearly all of Indian origin, according to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund. The men are easily identifiable by their beards and turbans, a tradition that's lasted for 500 years. Obama: Shooting a 'tragedy' Six people were killed in a shooting rampage.

"Oh, Oprah. The media mogul and former talk-shown queen has been gushing for weeks about Microsoft's new Surface tablet, which she compared to a Mercedes and named one of her ""Favorite Things"" of 2012. On Sunday, she went a step further, sending a Twitter message to her 14.8 million followers saying ""love that SURFACE!"" and adding that she'd already bought 12 of the devices for Christmas gifts. There's only one problem. Winfrey -- or whoever manages her Twitter account -- sent the tweet from an iPad. The people of the Internet, who never miss the opportunity to poke fun at an online gaffe, took notice. ""She does have legions of fans, making her an effective marketing channel for Microsoft. Except for when the narrative around her promotion is tossed on its head by a foolish, and utterly avoidable mistake,"" wrote Alex Wilhelm on tech-news site The Next Web. ""Surface ads, now brought to you by iPad."" Tweeted All Things D's Kara Swisher: ""Ok, this made me laugh out loud."" Microsoft Surface tablet goes on sale for $499 . But other observers said people shouldn't read too much into Winfrey's tweet. ""The tweet being sent from an iPad doesn't necessarily mean Oprah prefers the iPad over the Surface RT; just because you bought a Wii U doesn't mean you'll never use a Sony or Microsoft console ever again,"" wrote James Plafke at Geek.com. Besides, some bloggers have noted that no official Twitter app exists yet for Windows 8, the new operating system on the Surface, although Twitter says it's building one. So maybe there's room in Oprah's heart for two tablets? Apple fans may remember the original iPad made Oprah's ""Ultimate Favorite Things"" list back in 2010. ""Words cannot describe what I feel for this magnificent device,"" she said at the time. ""I really think it's the best invention of the century so far."" At least, until the Surface came along.","Oprah Winfrey endorses the new Surface tablet in a gushy tweet -- sent from an iPad .

"At least one country will leave the eurozone in the next five years, according to a survey of central bank reserve managers who collectively control more than $8,000bn. The results of the poll, conducted by UBS, highlight the concern among some of the world's top central bank officials ahead of the Greek election this weekend that is widely seen as a pivotal moment for the future of the single currency. UBS surveyed more than 80 central bank reserve managers, sovereign wealth funds and multilateral institutions with more than $8,000bn in assets at its annual seminar for sovereign institutions. The results were not weighted for assets under management. The central bankers and SWF managers said that a break-up of the eurozone was the greatest risk to the global economy over the next 12 months. Nearly three quarters of them said at least one country would leave the eurozone within five years. Of those, roughly a quarter said that more than one country would drop the euro. Their views stand in contrast to the attempts of some central banks to shore up confidence in the single currency. But they carry weight because the reserve managers hold significant influence over foreign exchange markets with their decisions about how to allocate their assets. The prospect of a eurozone break-up has unnerved investors of all types in recent months, triggering a sharp sell-off in European equities, a jump in the bond yields of peripheral eurozone governments and a slide in the value of the euro. The uncertainty over Greece's future in the eurozone -- which is coming to a head with a crucial election this weekend -- has combined with a banking crisis in Spain to undermine investor confidence. That has already prompted some sovereigns to diversify away from the euro. The Swiss National Bank revealed last month that it had doubled its holdings of sterling in the first quarter of the year as it reduced its exposure to the euro. Analysts and traders say that other reserve managers have been doing the same thing. The reserve managers' caution about the future of the euro was borne out in their forecasts. They predicted that by the end of the year the euro would be trading between $1.15 and $1.25, compared to a level of around $1.26 on Thursday. A small minority said that the euro would no longer exist by the end of the year. In contrast, the central banks and SWF mangers were more bullish on the prospects for gold. They predicted that the precious metal, together with emerging market debt, would be the best performing asset class between now and the end of the year. The price of gold has stagnated so far this year, as investors have grown wary of its ability to act as a haven in times of crisis. On Thursday it was trading at $1,620.70 a troy ounce, up 3.5 per cent since the start of 2012.","UBS survey: At least one country will leave the eurozone in the next five years .

"Pulsating light bursts into the cockpit of a plane thousands of feet in the air, filling it with seething brightness, and blinding the pilot and copilot. What sounds like a cheap reenactment in a hokey UFO reality show has become everyday reality in the United States. Laser attacks on aircraft occur an average of 11 times a day, the Federal Aviation Administration says. Powerful handheld lasers are affordable and widespread, and some people are making sport of shining them up into passing aircraft. The trend seems to be catching on. There were 3,960 such strikes reported last year, the FAA says. That's up from 283 in 2005. But reporting of these crimes has also caught on, which has contributed to the rise in official numbers. Still, hundreds of attacks go unreported and remain uncounted. Perpetrator roundup . The FBI wants them to stop and is offering reward money for tips leading to the pranksters. And it's making some arrests. Though it takes work to track down the source of the laser, it can be done with a helicopter, a dispatcher and squad cars. The FBI has posted YouTube video of one such bust. It has detained mostly teenage boys and men in their 30s, who face a possible five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. And the FBI is not the only one posting a bounty on them. For the next two months, 11 U.S. cities and San Juan,  Puerto Rico, are offering up to $10,000 for information leading to arrests. Attacks are particularly common in New York and Los Angeles, and they often obstruct the work of the targeted pilots. ""When a laser light flashes across the cockpit, it's about 25% brighter than a flashlight flashing in your face. So what that does is, that can cause temporary incapacitation,"" said Stephen Woolery, an FBI agent pursuing laser pranksters. Rise in lasers pointed at aircraft in New York, FBI says . Eye injuries . But the consequences can be much worse than just annoying. A pilot coming in for a landing at JFK two years ago radioed the tower right after an attack. ""We just got lasered up here,"" he said. ""Two green flashes into the cockpit. It caught the first officer's eye."" A direct hit can burn the cornea, and that has put pilots in the hospital. So far, no laser strike has been known to cause a pilot to crash an aircraft. But the FBI fears it is only a matter of time.

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- Ron Paul supporters have a plan. As they doggedly work the Republican system from the ground up, electing more of their team as delegates to the Republican National Convention, they have a heavyweight plan that's markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to the podium. ""We want to change the Republican Party,"" said Chris Stearns, the Virginia state director for the Ron Paul campaign. ""We are making sure our people get in positions of leadership -- in the nation, in their state, in their county and city, all the way down to the grass roots level."" Libertarians such as Stearns aspire to nothing less than the kind of bottom-to-top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and anti-abortion forces in the 1980s. Many of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top rungs of the GOP now. And similar to that movement, Ron Paul and his campaigners for liberty are looking down the road. ""This is not just for this term,"" Stearns told CNN Radio from the southern end of the state, ""but four, six or eight years from now."" Nearly 200 miles away, in northern Virginia, a separate Ron Paul supporter is similarly forward looking. ""Four years, eight years, 12 years, we are here for the long haul,"" said Patrick Bailey, a 26-year-old who moved from New York to Washington specifically to get involved in electoral politics. He plunged in on Saturday as one of three Paul supporters running for delegate to the national convention from Virginia's 8th Congressional District. Battle in the grass roots . That kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and pundits, but it's where Ron Paulians are waging their most furious battle. Primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state's delegates should vote, but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be. They represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention. The 8th District, which includes the Washington suburbs of Alexandria and Arlington, felt the Paul surge Saturday. Four years ago, the district convention saw some 350 participants. The 8th District Republican chairman told CNN that participation had nearly doubled this year. Anyone can attend and vote, as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a Democratic primary in the past five years. This is how the Paul strategy works: Sign up. Show up. Vote. ""We have been calling and e-mailing,"" Bailey said ahead of the vote. ""Our turnout's looking great."" But some feel it is an attempt at political hijacking. ""There are people out here who are still fighting for Ron Paul who got defeated at our primary,"" said Fran Redmon, who has been involved in the 8th District Republican Party for 40 years. ""It's so ridiculous. They should either be a Republican or not be here today."" Asked what she thought the Paul supporters were trying to accomplish, Redmon replied, ""I think they aren't really thinking it through. I suppose they think we're people who don't have an agenda or something."" Indeed, the agenda is the rallying cry for the libertarian forces. CNN spoke with more than two dozen Paul supporters at this local Republican meeting and they shared common goals: substantially smaller government both in spending and in power, far more limits on the Federal Reserve, an end to what they see as American interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights. The second-ballot gambit . ""This is a movement,"" said Homan Rabie, who came to the 8th District convention with his high school friends, ""(Republicans) need a true philosophy."" They need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group, he added. So it's a movement. Why then all the national convention delegates? Especially in a place like Virginia where, by Republican rules, nearly all the elected delegates must vote for Mitt Romney on the first ballot. Let's get the nomination theory out of the way. One supporter at the 8th District convention mentioned a much-forwarded idea that Paul delegates could abstain on the first ballot, forcing a second vote at the convention and then, on that second ballot, cast votes for Paul. But there are two problems with this notion: One is that if a delegate abstains, an alternate delegate, who may or may not be a Paul supporter, would step in. The other problem? Many Paul supporters told CNN they think it's a pipe dream. They're distancing themselves from the idea. ""To me personally, it doesn't look like any way that's going to happen,"" said Bailey, the candidate trying to get to Tampa. ""I don't see (the Paul delegates) going in and causing a ruckus. The last thing we need is to become a scapegoat (if Republicans don't win in November)."" Change the party from the bottom up . Paul says as much himself. He told CNN last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention ""is not in my plan. That is against my plan."" The plan, say supporters up and down the Paul chain, is to put their people in Republican positions of power from the bottom to the top, and change the party. Saturday, the few hundred voters at Virginia's 8th District convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats. While Bailey came in fifth, his friend and fellow Paul supporter Matthew Burrow took third place and won a spot for libertarians in Tampa. Stearns says Paul supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in Virginia so far. Add it to the list. Paul took all 21 elected delegate spots in Maine and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in Nevada, state party officials confirmed to CNN. Party officials in Minnesota have not been able to certify their exact results to CNN but agreed that Paul won most of the up-for-grabs delegates there as well. That is especially notable because Minnesota's delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention. But the 2012 nomination is not the point, Bailey reminded those around him. Instead, it's learning the process, getting better at it, gaining positions and changing the Republican party, no matter how long it takes. ""We're all getting training on the ground now,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, this is all practice for the next time. And the next time all be practice for the time after that. And eventually we are going to win."" It is a big plan, requiring not just determination but stamina.","Ron Paul supporters want bottom-to-top takeover of GOP .

"Two pro-euro candidates appeared headed for a February runoff in Finland's presidential race after a first round of voting Sunday, according to complete results. With all boxes reporting, conservative former Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto had a solid lead with just under 37% percent of the vote. Meanwhile, pro-European Green League candidate Pekka Haavisto passed euro-skeptic Paavo Vayrynen to claim the No. 2 spot, with 18.8% over Vayrynen's 17.5%. Vayrynen had been running second in earlier returns. Niinisto and Haavisto -- Finland's first openly gay presidential candidate, according to Finnish media -- are vying to succeed Tarja Halonen, Finland's first female president. Halonen has has reached her two-term limit after beating back a challenge from Niinisto, of the conservative National Coalition Party, in 2006. A runoff between the top two finishers is slated for February 5. Turnout was estimated at nearly 73% of Finland's 4.4 million eligible voters. The eventual winner will break a 30-year lock on the presidency by Halonen's Social Democrats. Finland is one of the states that joined the euro from the beginning, when Niinisto was finance minister. He insists Finland should stay in the eurozone, despite the debt crisis that has taken some of the shine off the common currency. His NCP won the top share of votes in last  April's parliamentary election, and already leads a broad coalition government that includes the Social Democrats. Finland is one of the few remaining AAA-rated countries in the eurozone. But 2012 is only expected to deliver a growth of 0.4%, with the possibility of a new recession, its finance ministry reports. It has had to take part in the bailouts of other euro states who faced deep financial problems, such as Greece and Ireland. Many Finns now see Niinisto -- who also served as deputy chairman of the European Investment Bank -- as someone who can stand up for Finland's interests in the single currency. Haavisto, meanwhile, has served as Finland's environment and development minister and has international experience working for the European Union and the United Nations in Sudan and the Middle East. Vayrynen and his Center Party have argued that Finland should leave the euro, and he insisted before Sunday's vote that polls showing him running third were wrong. His third-place showing Sunday followed a strong finish in April by the euro-skeptic True Finns Party, which won 39 seats in parliament to become the third-largest party. The True Finns demanded that Finland stop supporting the eurozone bailouts, but its presidential candidate, Timo Soini, was running fourth in Sunday's balloting. He told Finnish public broadcaster YLE that his weak support was an indication that his party wants him to remain as party leader, rather than president. Finland's president is in charge of the country's foreign policy, together with the government, and serves as commander-in-chief of its defense forces. But recent changes have seen more power being given to the government and parliament, and former President Mauno Koivisto told YLE that there was a risk of an ""imbalance"" between the direct public election of the president and the office's diminishing power.","Pro-euro candidates appear bound for February runoff .

"In a bold declaration of its ambition, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has laid claim to leadership of the global Islamist movement, calling on Muslims worldwide to swear allegiance to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. By claiming such preeminence, ISIS is seeking to eclipse al Qaeda and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in what analysts see as the most dramatic shift in militant jihadism since 9/11. But ISIS also makes the outlandish claims -- if its words are taken literally -- that it leads 1.5 billion Muslims and that the world, not just the deserts of Syria and Iraq, are its new stage. What did ISIS say? The declaration was made Sunday in a 34-minute audio message by ISIS spokesman and ideologue Abu Muhammad al-Adnani al-Shami, who said that from now on, ISIS would simply be called the ""Islamic State."" That is much more than a change of name; it simultaneously strips away the geographical limits imposed by the previous name and underlines the movement's control of a wide swath of territory in Iraq and Syria. It even suggests that the group should exercise authority over Islam's holiest places. In a direct challenge to al-Zawahiri, al-Shami said it is now ""incumbent upon all Muslims to pledge allegiance to the Khalifah Ibrahim and support him."" Khalifah Ibrahim is the name now given to al-Baghdadi, a secretive figure never seen in ISIS' voluminous propaganda output. Al-Shami says that al-Baghdadi has accepted the pledge of allegiance offered by senior figures of the ""Islamic State."" ""Thus he is the imam and Khalifah of Muslims everywhere,"" al-Shami concluded with stunning brevity. Why a caliphate matters . Al-Shami said that in the areas now controlled by the group, the legality of all states and organizations becomes null and void, an assertion that the colonial-era borders of the Middle East are no longer valid. Instead, they are replaced by a caliphate carved from ISIS' recent territorial gains. A video released by the group Sunday underlined the point in graphic fashion, showing the destruction of a border crossing between al-Hasakah in Syria and the Iraqi province of Nineveh. ISIS also released a series of photographs purporting to show a parade through its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa in celebration of the declaration and of the Khalifah Ibrahim. The restoration of the caliphate was the dream of al Qaeda  leader Osama bin Laden in establishing al Qaeda, but ISIS has seized more territory, and more cities, than any al Qaeda affiliate. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula briefly took control of a string of towns in southern Yemen early in 2012 but was driven out of them later that year. ISIS' methods -- especially its habit of summary executions -- and its refusal to accept al-Zawahiri's authority have also led to a very public and bitter rupture with the parent organization. ISIS was disowned by al Qaeda in February after defying al-Zawahiri's demand that it cease operating in Syria in favor of another al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al Nusra. Al Qaeda's General Command said that ISIS was ""not a branch of the al Qaeda group ... does not have an organizational relationship with it, and al Qaeda is not responsible for their action."" But the group's successes have shifted the balance. In language that appears to taunt al Qaeda and al Nusra, al-Shami said Sunday: ""They never recognized the Islamic State to begin with, although America, Britain and France acknowledge its existence. ... Should we consult those who have abandoned us? Those who have betrayed us? Those who have disowned us and incited against us?"" Different from al Qaeda . Charles Lister, a Fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, said the impact of the announcement ""will be global as al Qaeda affiliates and independent jihadist groups must now definitively choose to support and join the Islamic State or to oppose it."" ""While it is now inevitable that members and prominent supporters of al Qaeda and its affiliates will rapidly move to denounce al-Baghdadi and this announcement, it is the long-term implications that may prove more significant,"" Lister says. Al Qaeda's declining potency in its Afghan-Pakistan heartland, the death of bin Laden and the group's fracturing into semiautonomous franchises have left a new generation of jihadists looking for a spiritual home -- and a field of combat. ISIS provides that, and it has a slick propaganda machine producing high-quality videos posted on social media. But Charles Lister says: ""Al Qaeda will retain considerable support, and once the dust has settled, we will very likely find ourselves in a dualistic position of having two competing international jihadist representatives: al Qaeda, with a now more locally focused and gradual approach to success, and the 'Islamic State,' with a hunger for rapid results and total hostility for competition."" Lister said ISIS has evolved as a tightly controlled group with ""an almost obsessive level of bureaucracy, account-keeping, and centrally controlled but locally implemented military-political coordination."" But unlike al Qaeda, it has also ""developed an increasingly efficient model of governance, capable of simultaneously implementing harsh medieval justice and a whole range of modern social services."" To Aram Nerguizian, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the question is: ""How can they create governance structures that don't completely chafe against the social fabric of these towns?"" ISIS has grown exponentially over the last four years, taking advantage of ungoverned space and violent Shia-Sunni sectarianism to win the attention and support of thousands of would-be jihadists. It has attracted hundreds and probably thousands of fighters from across the Arab world and Europe. Even so, its forces are spread across a huge area and would be vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Iraqi military should it reorganize into an effective force. And ISIS depends on powerful Sunni tribes to the west and north of Baghdad as its hosts and partners. If they perceive its practices as too draconian or its caliphate as marginalizing them, the tolerance they have shown in the face of a common enemy -- the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki -- will soon evaporate. What happens in Syria? One of the biggest questions is how other groups in Syria respond. One smaller Syrian faction, Jeish al-Sahaba, has already declared its allegiance to the ""Caliphate."" At a local level, some al Nusra fighters pledged allegiance to ISIS before it declared the caliphate. ""We unified with ISIS to stop bloodshed and spare our region and its countryside the danger of war and displacement,"" said al Nusra's leader in the eastern town of al Bokamal. But other al Nusra elements clashed with ISIS in the town Monday and seem to be still working with other factions, even the relatively secular Free Syrian Army, in Deir Ezzor, a province where ISIS is strong. Most analysts foresee an inconsistent mix of competition and coexistence, even cooperation between the two groups, whose ideological roots are similar. But many Muslims see the declaration of a caliphate as both apostasy and a ludicrous overreach by ISIS. The Syrian opposition council in Eastern Ghouta, an important area in the battle against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, last week attacked any notion that ISIS could form a state. ""ISIS must delete the world 'state' from the name of the faction and to be jihadi faction because ISIS does not have tangible or religious structure,"" the council said, in a statement obtained by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army in eastern Syria, Omar Abu Leila, described the declaration of the caliphate as ""unbelievable."" ""There are millions of Syrians who are not with ISIS, so how can they speak about a caliphate in our land?"" he said. ISIS declares 'caliphate' stretching across Iraq and Syria .","The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has laid claim to leadership of the global Islamist movement .
In a challenge to the head of al Qaeda, ISIS calls on ""all Muslims to pledge allegiance"" to its leader .
In essence, the group is saying the colonial-era borders of the Middle East are no longer valid .

"It was a horrific chapter in American history, but now some people who were sterilized against their will by the government may be getting compensation for what they endured. After going back and forth on the issue for 10 years, on Thursday the North Carolina legislature agreed to give $10 million to victims. If signed by the governor, North Carolina would become the first state to compensate sterilization victims. ""It's been a long hard fight,"" said state Rep. Larry Womble, who championed the cause. ""We're trying to correct a wrong."" It's believed that the government of North Carolina sterilized more than 7,000 people between 1929 and 1974. Of those, only about 200 have come forward, according to Charmaine Fuller-Cooper, former director of the North Carolina Justice for Sterilization Victims Foundation. That would mean each victim would get about $50,000. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory still must sign the measure into law, and if he does, Charles Holt hopes to go to Raleigh and shake his hand. Holt was 19 and  living in an institution for boys in Butner, North Carolina when he was given a vasectomy without his consent. ""They sent me to the hospital and then they just put me in a room and she gave me gas and I just went off to sleep,"" Holt remembers. When he awoke, the nurse told him what they'd done. ""I wasn't happy,"" he said. From 1907 through the 1970s, more than 60,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized. Some, like Holt, were in institutions, while others were deemed ""feeble-minded"" or had ""unfit human traits."" Others were children of alcoholics whose parents couldn't care for them. Thirty-three states had forced sterilization programs. California's was the largest, sterilizing 20,000 people. The programs were supported by some of the nation's most respected doctors, lawyers, and social workers. Even the U.S. Supreme Court approved it, as Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in one 1927 court case, ""Three generations of imbeciles are enough."" Under the eugenics laws in North Carolina, anyone could request that someone could be sterilized. Fuller-Cooper remembers reading about neighbors who recommended sterilization because they thought a young woman was sexually promiscuous. A board would then consider the request. Fuller-Cooper remembers the first time she read the case files from the state eugenics board. ""I literally sat at my desk and cried for about 15 minutes,"" she said. If signed into law, payments are expected to be made in June, 2015. Namibian women were sterilized without consent .","Thirty-three states had forced sterilization programs for much of the 20th century .

"French lawmakers voted Wednesday in favor of making it an offense to pay for sex, a move toward criminalizing use of prostitutes. The bill passed the National Assembly, or lower house, by 268 votes to 138, with 79 abstaining. It must pass the Senate and be signed by the president before it becomes law, a process that could take several months. Prostitution is currently legal in France for both the prostitute and the client. The measure would impose fines of at least 1,500 euros (about $2,000) on people caught paying for sex. The divisive proposal has sparked public demonstrations both for and against, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV. The vast majority of lawmakers from the governing Socialist Party were expected to vote in favor, with some exceptions. The majority of the opposition center-right UMP is against the measure, as is the Green Party. Socialist lawmaker and former minister Jean Glavany wrote on his blog that he would vote ""with my head, but without enthusiasm."" He said he was backing the law on two grounds: ""on the one hand, the fight against mafia and pimping, on the other hand, social protection and help for prostitutes to reintegrate."" According to the draft bill, research suggests that there are about 20,000 prostitutes in France, of whom 85% are women. At the same time, 99% of the clients are men. France witnessed a historic shift between 1990 and 2000, it says, in which the proportion of foreign-born prostitutes jumped from 10% to close to 90%. The countries of origin are principally Romania, Bulgaria, Nigeria and China, it says, showing the ""growing influence of trafficking networks on prostitution.""","France's lower house votes in favor of a law that penalizes those who pay for sex .

President Obama believes it is ""up to the club to decide, (but) his personal opinion is that women should be admitted to the club.""

"The only known suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was in custody Wednesday night. Jesse Matthew, who had been sought on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile, was arrested in Galveston County, Texas. He was found on the beach in Gilchrist on the Bolivar Peninsula, according to that county's sheriff's office. ""We have a person in custody, but there's a long road ahead of us, and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham,"" Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters. He declined to go into the circumstances of Matthew being taken into custody. An extradition process is under way for the 32-year-old Matthew, who is also wanted on suspicion of two counts of reckless driving, Longo said. According to CNN affiliate KPRC, deputies got a call about a suspicious person camping on the beach. One responded, and ran the license plate of that person's vehicle. It came back as wanted, the affiliate reported. Matthew did not resist arrest, KPRC said. Earlier, Matthew's lawyer was mum about most everything. ""I am Mr. Matthew's attorney,"" said James Camblos, who spoke outside his office in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""I was hired on Saturday. That's the only thing that I'm going to confirm at this point. The family and I -- nobody is making any statements at this point in time. We might later on, but right now we are not,"" he said. His comments came one day after authorities obtained an arrest warrant for his client, who police believe was the last person with Graham. She was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Investigators have been looking for her since, and in an increasingly large area. ""We're asking for a broader community search with property owners,"" Longo told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" Wednesday night. Specifically, he said he wants property owners of large parcels in surrounding counties to search their land and report back. Authorities have previously searched Matthew's apartment and car. Although they have declined to discuss the specifics of what might have been found, potential evidence was sent to a lab for analysis. According to Longo, Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, when there was no warrant for his arrest. He asked for a lawyer. They spoke and then left, Longo said. Camblos confirmed that he was the attorney who met with Matthew at the police station. ""I'm not telling you anything else at this point,"" he said. Authorities are now offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, a second-year student at the University of Virginia. They have received 1,500 tips so far in the case, and are urging anyone with information to call the police tip line at 434-295-3851. ""We're asking every person within the sound of my voice to help us find Hannah Graham,"" Longo, the police chief, said.

"Visiting the Jefferson Memorial in Washington never gets old to me. Not only is it architecturally stunning, but the quotes on the four panels surrounding the sculpture of our third president stir a profound sense of patriotism and spiritual clarity inside me. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal."" ""Almighty God hath created the mind free."" ""God who gave us life gave us liberty."" And then there's my favorite: . ""I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind."" That quote goes on to talk about the importance of having a fluid Constitution, one that reflects the society of the time as opposed to ""the regimen of their barbarous ancestors."" It's really quite profound when you think about it: a founding father granting future generations permission to make changes to a document with the ink barely dry on the original. And we have taken Jefferson up on his suggestion, such as granting women the right to vote. But that tends to be the nature of most of the biggest changes that have been made to the Constitution: affecting the rights and behavior of citizens as opposed to the structure of the government itself. Today, given how money, special interest groups and technology, including electronic media, have diseased the entire political process, I believe it's time we considered some sweeping changes. And I believe those changes should start at the very top -- the president. There are three ways America can make the presidency better equipped to respond to the 21st century world. The first would recognize that the functioning of the federal government is impeded by a president's bid to run for re-election. So how can we change that? We start by eliminating second terms. President Obama's open mic comment, telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have ""more flexibility"" to discuss missile defense after the November election, wasn't as much an appalling gaffe as it was an accurate assessment of the inherent flaw of a two-term system for presidents. In an election year, each time the president goes to Congress with a new initiative it's inevitably going to be met with  partisan grandstanding and resistance. And that's just one negative byproduct of having two terms for a president. When you think about it, the first year is spent operating under the previous administration's budget, and part of the third and all of the fourth are spent running for re-election. Essentially we give a new president about 18 months to focus on creating meaningful policies. A good chunk of the rest of the term is spent fundraising. But what if we were to amend the Constitution so that each president gets only one six-year term? He or she spends five years focused on governing without handwringing over a bid for re-election. The second change: a requirement that no person could be elected president without prior military experience. I'm OK with GOP candidates questioning Obama's foreign policy. I'm not OK with all of this tough talk about Iran, with the risk of starting another war, by Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich, who chose not to serve during the Vietnam War. Military experience does not necessarily mean serving in wartime, and clearly military experience alone doesn't guarantee a sharp strategic mind (insert President George W. Bush joke here). But it just seems logical that if you're going to be called commander in chief, there should something tangible on your resume to suggest that title has been earned and not handed to you by a super PAC. It was our 34th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who said, ""I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can."" When I hear Romney, Gingrich and Rick Santorum speak about Iran, their words are not spoken through the filter of Eisenhower's insight, but rather shouted arrogantly out of a megaphone at some people who hate Obama. It's so twisted that the views of the only candidate with military experience, Rep. Ron Paul, are routinely dismissed as being naive by a handful of warmongers who don't look as if they've ever thrown a punch in their lives. While I agree with the overall tone Obama has taken in the Middle East, I believe he too would have been better served with military experience. It certainly would have added credibility to his push to overturn the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy as well as his decision on the Afghanistan surge. The third change I would like to see may seem small, but it's a long overdue amendment: Raise the age of eligibility to run for president from 35 to 45 -- and cap it at 70. I know, I know, President Reagan was great -- for some -- but we don't need to be wondering if the person we elect is going to die while in the White House. And since 35 is the new 25, we definitely don't need an inexperienced youngster with his or her finger on the button either. We're living longer and getting married later, so it would only stand to reason that we alter the age window to reflect those changes.  And in this same vein, it would also make sense to establish term limits on members of Congress, and cap the amount of money one can spend on elections. If we all take a look around, we'll see a good chunk of our political process has been kidnapped by career politicians and lobbyists, working to serve each other more than the American people. In order to rescue this process we must do what Jefferson encouraged us to do -- adapt. Change. And I believe such changes should -- no, need  to -- start at the top.","LZ Granderson: Thomas Jefferson urged America to keep its government current .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A manufacturing defect blamed for the mid-air breakup of an F-15 Eagle fighter may cause the Air Force to ground a quarter of its fleet of those warplanes permanently, a top general said Thursday. The mid-air breakup of an F-15 fighter jet is being blamed on a a manufacturing defect. Gen. John Corley, the head of the U.S. Air Combat Command, said about 160 of the jets may never return to service after an investigation into the November 2 crash that left the plane's pilot seriously injured. The single-seat F-15C broke up in a 500-mph turn during a combat training mission over Missouri, with its fuselage breaking in half behind the cockpit, an Air Force probe of the crash determined. Investigators concluded that a critical piece of the jet's airframe broke during the flight because of a manufacturing defect. A defective longeron -- a metal strut that runs lengthwise down the fuselage -- was cut improperly by the manufacturer, Boeing, and led to a series of cracks over the plane's lifespan, Corley said.  Watch a report on the plane and its problems » . ""Some of these airplanes will never return to flight,"" Corley said. ""The age, the fatigue on these airplanes has been manifest as we looked under the hood extensively over these last two months."" The Air Force has been flying the twin-engine, supersonic F-15 since the early 1970s. The C model involved in November's crash is credited with 34 of the 37 ""kills"" credited to Air Force pilots in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, according to Thursday's report on the accident. The service has about 700 F-15s in its fleet, all of which were grounded after the November crash. Most were returned to service after being checked out, but about 40 percent of the Air Force's 442 F-15 models A through D remain grounded. ""I flew these airplanes 30 years ago,"" Corley told CNN ""This is a fleet of airplanes that's 25-plus years old on average. That constant pulling and pushing and twisting has also caused fatigue."" If the grounded planes are retired, the Air Force would still have about 240 of the older fighters and nearly 300 of the newer F-15E, a two-seat version used for ground-attack missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Investigators released the results of the Missouri crash at a news conference Thursday in the St. Louis suburb of Bridgeton, home of the Air National Guard wing involved in the accident. The pilot, 37-year-old Maj. Stephen Stillwell, told reporters that his plane broke up in a turn that produced about eight times the force of gravity. ""I had no idea what was happening,"" he said. ""I knew something bad was happening, but I didn't know what it was."" Stillwell suffered a broken arm and still has problems with his shoulder. He credited his survival to the training he received. ""You always prepare for the worst-case scenario,"" he said. ""I think luck played a small part in it, but a large part of it was due to the training I received and my faith in God,"" said Stillwell, who is also a pilot for Northwest Airlines. Col. Bob Leeker, the wing's commander, said the first four of his F-15s took off Thursday after receiving clearance. Six other planes in the 131st Fighter Wing have not been released, but three are expected to be once additional examinations are completed, he said. The F-15 was first built by McDonnell-Douglas, and it's now manufactured by Boeing. The service is trying to determine whether Boeing would be liable for the defect after 30 years. The A through D models are used in the United States for air-defense missions. After the initial grounding, the service had to move F-16s to cover for F-15 missions, and Canadians had to help cover missions over Alaska, according to Air Force officials. The defect was discovered as the Air Force continues to fight for more advanced F-22 Raptors, seen as the future of the service's fighter fleet. Congress allowed the purchase of only 183 of the almost 400 the Air Force wanted, but the service continues to ask for another 200. Corley said suggestions that the service is trying to use the problems with the F-15 as leverage to get more of the Lockheed-built F-22s ""makes me just outraged, because it's just flat wrong."" ""I'm the one who looks into the eyes of the moms and dads, the sons and daughters, the husbands and wives that I put in that airplane,"" he said. ""To think that I would put one of those individuals at risk, to almost kill one aviator and to risk other aviators, that is beyond my possible belief.""

"To veto or not to veto: It's up to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. She must decide if she is going to sign into law legislation that would allow business owners, as long as they assert their religious beliefs, to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. If she approves it, the state could face litigation and a boycott, potentially harming Arizona's economy and tourism industry as well as next year's Super Bowl. Arizona lawmakers pass controversial anti-gay bill . In an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash on Monday, Brewer addressed the aspects she must consider. ""I have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial, to listen to both sides of those issues, and I welcome the input and information that they can provide to me. And certainly I am pro-business, and that is what's turning our economy around, so I appreciate their input, as I appreciate the other side,"" she said. Earlier, Brewer told CNN that her decision will come after she returns this week to Arizona from Washington, where she has been attending National Governors Association meetings. ""I have to look at what it says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing,"" she said. The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law. She has been a conservative champion for much of her five years in office. And if that's any indication, the measure could very well become law. But it's not that straightforward. Her conservative creds . As secretary of state, Brewer landed the gubernatorial gig in 2009 after previous Gov. Janet Napolitano left her job to head the Department of Homeland Security. Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the ""show me your papers"" law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos. She made national headlines again for wagging her finger at President Barack Obama on a Phoenix tarmac after he stepped off of Air Force One over immigration. In her bid for re-election in 2012, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, even though her primary opponent sat on the organization's board of directors. The endorsement was well-earned, as was her A+ rating. Under her, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. And people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed. But her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said Arizona would participate in the controversial expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Many conservative governors chose to opt out, but Brewer called it a ""moral"" obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured. LGBT record . While social and religious conservatives hope her conservative principles continue to guide her action regarding the LGBT measure, her record on lesbian and gay issues is thin. Nathan Rhoton, vice president of Equality Arizona, said that Brewer's record on related issues is ""largely unproven."" While she vetoed a similar measure last year, it had nothing to do with the content of the bill, but political power plays inside the Arizona state Capitol. The one substantive time she acted was not on the side of gay rights. She ended domestic partner benefits for state employees, which was a measure her predecessor implemented. Brewer said the state couldn't afford it, and she defended her decision in court. ""She's been mostly silent on the issue of marriage equality and those types of things,"" Rhoton said. LGBT rights: The patchwork states of America . Some insight . Where Brewer has a proven record is in the area of Arizona businesses, cutting regulations and taxes. And that could provide the clearest signal on what Brewer might do this week. Some influential business groups in Arizona oppose SB1062, the ""religious freedom bill."" A letter that numerous business leaders sent Brewer on Monday encouraged her to oppose it. ""After analyzing the bill, we are very concerned about the effect it could have on Arizona's economy,"" said the letter, signed by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, among others. ""We cannot support measures that could expose our businesses to litigation, nor do we want to send a message that our state is anything but an open and attractive place for visitors and the top talent that will be the cornerstone of our continued economic growth."" And Brewer is well liked in the business community. ""We believe she's done more than any governor nationwide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state,"" said Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the Arizona Chamber. ""We know this governor always does what she believes is in the best interest of the state."" And LGBT rights groups hope that her close ties with the business community is enough to persuade her to oppose it. ""This is where we hope her pro-business stance will prevail,"" Rhoton said. Growing support . Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto. Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue? Public pressure is mounting. Another major protest took place Monday evening outside the state Capitol. Businesses are hanging signs in their windows that read ""open for business to everyone!"" Both Arizona senators, Republicans John McCain and Jeff Flake, have publicly urged Brewer to veto. And according to the local newspaper in Prescott, state Sen. Steve Pierce, who voted for the measure, is now urging Brewer to pick up her veto pen. While the measure is not about same-sex marriage, a likely indicator of where Arizonans stand on the SB1062 is a Behavior Research Center's Rocky Mountain Poll from last year. It found that a majority of Arizonans support same-sex marriage. Kim Fridkin, an Arizona State University professor of political science, noted that ""it's an extreme measure even for (conservative) Arizona."" ""She'll be viewed more reasonable than liberal"" if she vetoes it, Fridkin said. A spokesman for the NFL, which will host Super Bowl XLIX, in Glendale next February, said the league is watching developments in Arizona. ""Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard,"" Brian McCarthy said.","The fate of SB1062 rests with Brewer, who says she will ""do the right thing"" for Arizona .

"Dozens of Air Force officers entrusted with maintaining U.S. nuclear missiles are now accused of cheating or turning a blind eye to cheating on a competency test. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. The scandal involving 34 Air Force officers at Malmstrom Air Force base in Montana marks the latest trouble for U.S. nuclear forces plagued by problems over the past year. Here's a look at other recent cases: . October 2013 . A U.S. general who oversaw nuclear weapons was relieved of his duties after he boozed, fraternized with ""hot women"" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia, Air Force officials said. Maj. Gen. Michael Carey led the 20th Air Force responsible for three nuclear wings. According to an Air Force Inspector General report, Carey bragged loudly about his position as commander of a nuclear force during layover in Switzerland, saying he ""saves the world from war every day."" While in Russia, Carey and an unidentified man walked to a nearby hotel to meet ""two foreign national women."" He returned to his Marriott hotel room in the wee hours of the morning. As a result, Carey was 45 minutes late in joining a delegation in a Moscow suburb, according to the report. He attributed the tardiness to jet lag, and said his body clock was out of whack. In addition, Carey announced he'd ""met two hot women the night before,"" and continually interrupted a monastery guide during a tour, his speech slurred the entire time, the report said. During dinner at a Mexican restaurant, he drank more alcohol and wanted to perform with the live band, which wanted no part of it, the report said. He later left his delegation and joined the two women he'd met the night before at a different table. There was no indication Carey's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or went beyond drinking, dancing and fraternizing with the women, officials said. CNN's repeated attempts to reach Carey were unsuccessful. October 2013 . Days before Carey was relieved of his duties, another military officer with high-level responsibility for the country's nuclear arsenal lost his job. Vice Adm. Tim Giardina was formally relieved of his duties as deputy chief of U.S. Strategic Command, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Navy's chief of information. Giardina oversaw nuclear weapons forces. A military official said his demotion was connected to allegations that he used counterfeit gambling chips at an Iowa casino. He was demoted to rear admiral and transferred to a job in Washington. August 2013 . The same missile unit at Malmstrom linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection ""after making tactical-level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons,"" the Air Force Global Strike Command said. The 341st Missile Wing operates about 150 of the 450 Minuteman III nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the U.S. force, according to an Air Force statement. A failed inspection does not mean that the safety of the nation's nuclear arsenal is at risk, AFGSC Commander Lt. Gen. Jim Kowalski said in August. ""These inspections are designed to be tough to pass,"" he said. ""Commanders use these inspections to continually improve our training and procedures."" April 2013 . In an unprecedented move, an Air Force commander stripped 17 of his officers of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles. The officers, based in Minot, North Dakota, did poorly in an inspection. They  were ordered to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs. Lt. Col. Jay Folds announced the action in an April e-mail to his unit. ""Did you know that we, as an operations group, have fallen -- and its it time to stand ourselves back up?"" Folds wrote. Folds also told his troops to ""crush any rules violators."" ""We are, in fact, in a crisis right now,"" he wrote.","34 nuclear Air Force officers are accused of cheating or not reporting cheating .

"(CNN) -- The American Psychological Association concluded Wednesday that there is little evidence that efforts to change a person's sexual orientation from gay or lesbian to heterosexual are effective. The report looks at 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007. In addition, the 138-page report -- covering 87 peer-reviewed studies -- said that such efforts may cause harm. ""Contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation,"" said Judith M. Glassgold, chairwoman of the task force that presented the report at the group's annual meeting in Toronto, Canada. The Washington-based association represents more than 150,000 members. ""At most, certain studies suggested that some individuals learned how to ignore or not act on their homosexual attractions. Yet, these studies did not indicate for whom this was possible, how long it lasted or its long-term mental health effects. Also, this result was much less likely to be true for people who started out only attracted to people of the same sex."" In response, the group's governing Council of Representatives passed a resolution Wednesday urging mental health professionals not to recommend to their clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or any other methods. The group's Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation reached its conclusion after its review of 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007 and finding ""serious methodological problems"" in the vast majority of them. Those few studies that did have ""high-quality"" evidence ""show that enduring change to an individual's sexual orientation is uncommon,"" it said. In addition, the report cited evidence that efforts to switch a person's sexual orientation through aversive treatments might cause harm, including loss of sexual feeling, suicidality, depression and anxiety. Many who tried to change and failed ""described their experiences as a significant cause of emotional and spiritual distress and negative self-image,"" it said. The six-member task force was appointed two years ago to address concerns about ""efforts to promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed through psychotherapy or approaches that mischaracterize homosexuality as a mental disorder."" The American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1975. The task force noted that some people attempt to change their sexual orientation because it conflicts with their religious beliefs, and recommended that their mental health care providers help them ""explore possible life paths that address the reality of their sexual orientation, reduce the stigma associated with homosexuality, respect the client's religious beliefs, and consider possibilities for a religiously and spiritually meaningful and rewarding life."" ""In other words,"" said Glassgold, ""we recommend that psychologists be completely honest about the likelihood of sexual orientation change, and that they help clients explore their assumptions and goals with respect to both religion and sexuality."" Alan Chambers, president of Exodus International, a network of more than 250 ministries that he said ""reach out to men and women and families that are affected by what we call 'unwanted same-sex attraction'"" disagrees. He offered himself as proof that such efforts can work. ""The fact is that there are tens of thousands of men and women just like me who once identified as gay,"" Chambers said in a telephone interview. ""For me and for these people, the truth is change is possible."" Chambers said his transformation from gay man began more than 18 years ago, when he attended a support group at the organization he now leads. Chambers, who said he married a woman nearly 12 years ago, has written a book, ""Leaving Homosexuality,"" which was published last month. ""You can't refute a personal story,"" he said, adding that about a third of those who try to switch their sexual orientation through the group's ministries wind up doing so. ""We're not talking a light switch that you turn on and off, we're talking about very deep and complex issues that, I think, take years to resolve."" Though all mainstream health and mental health organizations concluded years ago that homosexuality is not a mental disorder, the American Psychological Association formed the task force to work on the report two years ago after noting a resurgence of groups that identified homosexuality as a defect or spiritual or moral failing.","American Psychological Association: Trying to change orientation can be harmful .

"Turkey's flagship airline is facing the threat of a strike after negotiations with the country's main aviation workers union collapsed. The head of the Turkish Civilian Aviation Union, or Hava-Is, said the strike against Turkish Airlines would go into effect at 3 a.m. local time Wednesday. ""All of Turkish Airlines' functions will stop, no passenger flights, no cargo services, no connecting flights,"" Hava-Is president Atilay Aycin said in a phone interview with CNN. ""All sectors starting with the tourism industry who are doing business with Turkish Airlines will be affected,"" Aycin added. Hava-Is says it represents 14,000 Turkish airlines workers. Turkish Airlines published a statement Tuesday, acknowledging that its management failed to reach an agreement on a labor dispute ""due to uncompromising and imposing approaches of the Union."" The airline urged its employees to ""disregard"" the proposed strike.  It also accused Hava-Is of ""trying to plunge Turkish Airlines and its employees into an indefinite strike adventure which will benefit nobody."" Hava-Is' leadership says it is has been negotiating salaries and rest periods for long flights, which the union's president says do not meet international standards. Though recently privatized, Turkish Airlines is 49% government-owned.  Its fleet of airplanes and schedule of routes have expanded dramatically in the last decade, as Turkey has enjoyed a period of solid economic growth. The Turkish government has developed a pattern of using the airline as an extension of Turkey's ""soft power.""  The airline has extended routes to new countries, in conjunction with bilateral diplomatic overtures from Ankara. But the airline has also been caught up in the culture wars that frequently pit Turkey's ruling pious Muslim elite against more secular segments of Turkish society. This month, Turkish Airlines attracted international attention when the company announced it was banning certain shades of lipstick and nail polish among flight attendants. Turkish flight attendants see red over lipstick policy . Outrage spilled into social media and newspaper columns, as secular critics accused the airline's management of imposing conservative religious values on the company. A similar uproar emerged after the company announced it would stop serving alcohol on a number of domestic and international routes.","Negotiations with the country's main aviation workers union have collapsed .

"If, as many observers believe, Daniel-Day Lewis wins the Academy Award for best actor on Sunday, he will become the first man to win three (Meryl Streep has done this; Maggie Smith might match her if she wins for her turn in Quartet). Such an honor would ratify Day-Lewis' standing not simply as one of the greatest actors of his time, but for all time. Like Robert De Niro, Day-Lewis is seen as the quintessential method actor, a commitment he has taken to extremes in his well-known penchant for embodying his characters even when the cameras aren't rolling. Day-Lewis also is notable for the extraordinary breadth of roles he has played. He first came to global attention in 1985 when he appeared simultaneously as the priggish Cecil Vyse in the Merchant-Ivory film adaptation of E.M. Forster's 1907 novel ""Room with a View"" as well as Johnny, the gay East End punk, in Stephen Frears' brilliantly brash ""My Beautiful Launderette."" But it has been in playing Americans where Day-Lewis has made his most distinctive impact. Between 1988 and 2007 he played a string of American figures that ranged from a 17th century Puritan (""The Crucible"") to a contemporary art collector (the otherwise forgettable ""Stars and Bars""). His turn as the lead character in the 1992 film version of James Fenimore Cooper's 1825 novel ""Last of the Mohicans"" has become a classic, while his role as the driven oil prospector Daniel Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"" won him his second Academy Award for best actor in 2008. For all the range of the characters, however, there is a surprising degree of continuity in this gallery of Americans. The quintessential Day-Lewis character is a frontiersman, even when that frontiersman is disguised as a gang member staking out a territory (""Gangs of New York""), or an iconoclastic Manhattan attorney chafing against social convention (""The Age of Innocence"") on the same New York streets. Day-Lewis always plays a man apart -- someone at odds with the institutional arrangements that surround him. If he is to survive, which in many cases he does not, his protagonists must move to the margins, finding a place on the outskirts of society. It's in this context that one can begin to appreciate how Day-Lewis's latest Oscar-nominated performance as Abraham Lincoln breaks fresh ground. For the first time, he's not playing an estranged outsider, but rather a man at the epicenter of his society, exercising the levers of power to -- successfully -- bend a system toward his will. And that will is not of a personal and/or self-destructive variety; instead, it's a collective moral vision codified in a 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to end slavery. The novelty of the performance doesn't end there. We all know about figures who attain greatness in public life but whose private lives are a mess, repellent, or both. Abraham Lincoln has rarely been portrayed as a tyrant (except by die-hard Confederates), but often as inscrutable. But more than any other actor, even Henry Fonda's folksy ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), Day-Lewis' version seems like a likable, three-dimensional human being. He seems equally at ease chatting with troops, black and white, as he is in spinning a yarn for his Cabinet. He argues with his wife and son to the point of losing his temper (there's a memorable slap at Robert Lincoln, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Much has been made of Day-Lewis' rendition of Lincoln's voice, free of the stentorian tones one might expect of a man of his literal or figurative stature; contemporaries reported it as high and reedy, which is how the actor renders it here. This Lincoln is a man of moderation. Though clearly trying to lead public opinion in the face of significant political opposition, he's no radical; his foil in the film is Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) who indeed was part of a Republican-party faction impatient with Lincoln's pace on emancipation. Stevens is portrayed far more kindly in ""Lincoln"" than he was almost a century ago as the villain of D.W. Griffith's 1915 epic ""Birth of a Nation,"" but the film ultimately affirms Lincoln's recognition that compromise (including possible moral compromise) is an indispensable element of statecraft. Yet for all the novelty of this performance, the role is of a piece with Day-Lewis' larger body of work. For while his Lincoln is far more integrated into the fabric of his society than any of his other characters, he remains a man who struggles against a sense of isolation, whether personal or political, amid the maelstrom. Unable to escape the fierce hatreds that rage around him, he becomes a casualty in a war he is determined to prosecute toward a just end. The truest Americans, Day-Lewis seems to be telling us, are those who can never be fully at home in the world: Our collective character is a restless one. It's an insight with which Day-Lewis may make some history of his own.","Jim Cullen: If Daniel-Day Lewis wins best actor award at the Oscars, it will be a record .

"Morganza, Louisiana (CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the first of potentially several bays of the Morganza spillway on Saturday afternoon, a move intended to spare some areas from severe flooding while redirecting water into others. ""We think there is a successful operation going on right now,"" Col. Ed Fleming, the Corps' New Orleans District Commander, told CNN an hour after the first floodgate was opened. Fleming explained that the difficult decision to open the spillway, and similar ones made in recent weeks, is being done to address a historic excess of water in the Mississippi River system, including its tributaries. On Saturday afternoon, the river was cresting near Helena, Arkansas, at 56.4 feet -- 12.4 feet above the flood stage, the level at which the river may begin flowing over its banks -- the National Weather Service noted on its website. That crest, or high point of water, was moving slowly and steadily southward. The move in Morganza, about 115 miles northwest of New Orleans, will lower anticipated cresting levels -- as well as lessen the potential for severe flooding caused by things like overtopped levees and cracks in flood-control structures -- along the rising Mississippi River and divert water from Baton Rouge and New Orleans. But it will flood parts of low-lying south-central Louisiana. Fleming said that one or two other additional bays of the flood-control structure would likely be opened Sunday, and more gates could be opened later depending on water levels. The Corps could choose to let out as much as 600,000 cubic feet of water per second, with Saturday's opening leading to the release of 10,000 cubic feet per second. ""As the river needs it, we'll open it,"" said Fleming, referring to the spillway's bays. By 2:30 p.m. Saturday, all those ""within the first 24 hours"" -- meaning, those who should see flooding caused directly by the spillway's opening -- had evacuated, Fleming said. The opening came after several days of warning, as residents in the flood zone prepared to move to save their lives, even if their homes were washed away. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal predicted this week the high water resulting from the Morganza spillway opening could impact 3,900 people and 2,600 structures. ""Right now, a lot of people are real nervous about it. It's sad,"" said Larry Doiron, a resident of Stephenville, a town that could face flooding because of the spillway's opening. ""We need to have protection so that they don't flood us."" He said his subdivision would likely be fine, as it was built at a relatively high elevation, but that his neighbors were building additional levees and putting out sandbags. Seven Louisiana parishes -- Pointe Coupee, St. Landry, St. Martin, Iberia, Iberville, St. Mary and Terrebonne -- will likely be affected by the first opening of the spillway since 1973, according to the Corps. Fleming said Saturday that the spillway will likely be open for weeks, and it will be at least until that long that those who have evacuated can safely return. That's because that, even after the river crests at a certain point, it will take considerable time -- in some cases, weeks -- before it falls back below the flood stage. Morgan City, which sits on the banks of the Atchafalaya River, is among those communities expected to see rising water. The Corps has joined with state and local authorities to build-up safeguards in that community of about 11,600 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""Really, we're just waiting,"" said Evie Bertaut, who has lived in Morgan City for 50 years. Officials believe that the levees will protect the city from flooding, but some are taking preliminary precautions, she said. At Sacred Heart Church, where Bertaut works, people spent the day Friday moving important documents such a baptismal, marriage and financial records to the second floor. ""Most people are getting their photographs together, things that you can't replace in case you have to go,"" she said. The river's slow pace has given emergency responders more time to prepare, forecasters said. But while the slow-moving water gives residents extra time to get ready, it also means that land could remain under water for some time. Louisiana state authorities have been working with federal and local counterparts to combat flooding -- or, in some cases, prepare for it -- in 19 of its 64 parishes. That includes bringing in 700 National Guardsmen, as well as state police officers and prison inmates to lay down sandbags, direct traffic and otherwise deal with the crisis, the state's office of homeland security and emergency preparedness said in a release Saturday. They have brought in and laid out thousands of linear feet of HESCO flood-control material, as well as rought in hundreds of yards of reclaimed asphalt, sand and other substances aimed to keep floodwaters at bay. The National Weather Service said that as of noontime Saturday, the river was at 16.8 feet in New Orleans, just a fraction below flood stage. It is expected to crest May 23 at about 19.5 feet. The New Orleans levees are built to withstand 20 feet, according to the weather service. Still, the effects there could be felt soon: The U.S. Coast Guard said floodwaters could close the Mississippi River to ships at the New Orleans port as early as Monday morning. To help New Orleans, the Army Corps of Engineers said Friday that it will open 52 more bays at the Bonnet Carre Spillway just north of the city, diverting water into Lake Pontchartrain. That will mean a total of 264 bays will be open in the 350-bay spillway. In Vicksburg, Mississippi, the river is expected to crest at 57.5 feet May 19. This would be significantly above the flood stage at Vicksburg of 43 feet. Homes that were built between the levee and the Mississippi River were the first affected. ""We estimate that every home built on the river side of the levee from Memphis all the way to the Louisiana line is flooded,"" said Mike Womack, executive director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. Residents near Vicksburg counted on a levee for protection. In addition to the mainline levee along the river, starting near Vicksburg and extending northeast for more than 20 miles, a so-called backwater levee offers shelter. The backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the Yazoo River delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it. That level is expected to be reached Monday, said Charlie Tindall, attorney for the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners. The backwater levee was being ""armored"" by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out, he said. ""There's a chance it might not make it through an over-topping event,"" said Mississippi Levee Board Chief Engineer Peter Nimod about the backwater levee. ""There is a risk. We don't think it will break, but we want people to be prepared."" ""It's hard to plan for a multi-100-year event,"" he said. Nonetheless, 1.4 million acres in Mississippi, including 602,000 acres where crops are growing, could flood, said Rickey Grey of the state's Department of Agriculture. Across the South and lower Midwest, floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland, eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn, wheat, rice and cotton, officials said. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Mariano Castillo, Mia Aquino and Erica Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: A Corps official says: ""We think there is a successful operation going on""

"London's Metropolitan Police have opened investigations into the deaths of three young boys, a probe that is tied to ""allegations of serious and organized sexual abuse,"" it announced Thursday. In a statement, detectives involved in Operation Midland, an investigation launched last month into sexual abuse dating back more than 30 years ago, pleaded for the public's help in tracking down victims, witnesses and assailants. ""Today I want to appeal directly to those other young boys, now men, who were also subject to abuse at the hands of these men,"" Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald said. ""I believe that there were other boys who were abused, or who were present whilst the abuse took place."" In addition to sex abuse, McDonald said that his team ""is also investigating the possible murder of three young boys."" ""Our work is ongoing, and we are examining reports of missing people from that time,"" he added. ""To date, we have not recovered any bodies."" The abuse is believed to have taken place over at least a decade, at various locations across London and the counties surrounding the capital, including military premises, the police statement said. One site for the alleged abuse is the Dolphin Square estate, an apartment complex in Pimlico, central London. ""One witness, known as Nick (not his real name) has spoken to us. He has said he was abused from the age of seven until he was 16, from 1975-1984,"" said McDonald. ""Some of the abuse took place at a flat on the Dolphin Square estate. However I can't rule out this was the only flat used."" Nick has told police how a car would be sent to collect him and drive him to the apartment in Dolphin Square, McDonald said. ""The abuse he has detailed that he was subjected to was carried out by a man on his own, a group of men, or during what have been described as 'parties,'"" the officer said. Police want to speak to anyone who lived in the area from the early 1970s onwards and may have seen something that they now realize could be significant to this investigation, McDonald said. Detectives are in touch with the families of two boys, one who disappeared in 1979 and another who vanished and then was found murdered in 1981, but it is not yet possible to say if those two cases are linked to the current investigation, he added.","Police are investigating the possible murder of three boys and claims of sexual abuse .

"Even as authorities sort out the events that ended with a Virginia state senator stabbed and his son dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, mental health advocates warned Wednesday that a national shortage of beds for psychiatric patients could portend similar incidents. State Sen. Creigh Deeds was stabbed more than 10 times Tuesday after an altercation with his 24-year-old son, Austin ""Gus"" Deeds, state police said. The younger man then shot himself, authorities said. ""This is such a crystal-clear example of the problem,"" said Doris Fuller, executive director of the Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center. ""If Sen. Deeds weren't a public figure, we wouldn't be talking about this. The fact of the matter is that individuals and families and communities suffer every single day everywhere in this country because there are not sufficient acute facilities for people."" Deeds remained hospitalized Wednesday, but his condition was upgraded to good, authorities said. Deputies called to Deeds' home day before fatal fight . The stabbing came one day after the son was taken to a local hospital under an emergency custody order. Police confirmed that Gus Deeds was brought in by the local sheriff for evaluation by mental health professionals. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that Gus Deeds received that evaluation, but he was released because no psychiatric bed could be found in the area. CNN has learned that at least three Virginia hospitals had psychiatric beds available the day before the stabbing and suicide. Officials at Western State, Rockingham Memorial and UVA Charlottesville hospitals told CNN on Wednesday beds were available, but they had not been contacted by medical personnel who evaluated the younger Deeds. The hospitals are within an hour or two from Bath County, where the incident occurred, but it was unclear whether those who had the initial contact with Gus Deeds reached out only to hospitals closer to Bath. In the wake of the stabbing, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell ordered a review of state and area mental health services, according to his spokesman. ""The governor has directed the (state) secretary of Health and Human Resources to conduct a full internal review of the events leading up to Tuesday's tragic situation,"" said McDonnell spokesman Taylor Keeney. ""The secretary has already begun his assessment, working in cooperation with all relevant state and local authorities. We will have further comment on this review at the appropriate time."" Where are we putting our mentally ill? The incident renewed public attention on a chronic shortage of beds for the mentally ill -- an alarming national trend that mental-health advocates say is responsible for a long list of violent acts. Research from the nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center found that the number of state psychiatric beds decreased nationwide by 14% from 2005 to 2010. In 2005, there were 50,509 state psychiatric beds, compared with 43,318 in 2010. In 1960, by comparison there were 535,000 public psychiatric beds nationwide. Fuller said a person with severe mental illness now is more likely to end up in jail or a state prison than a psychiatric hospital. ""This is a population with no voice,"" Fuller of the advocacy center told CNN. ""The people who are sick enough to be committed to a hospital for care are not people who are voting, and they are not people who are a political constituency. They're not a political priority."" A 90-day audit by the Virginia's inspector general in 2012 termed the practice of releasing the mentally ill because of bed shortages ""streeting."" The audit found that ""72 individuals determined to meet the statutory criteria for temporary detention were denied access to inpatient psychiatric treatment"" -- placing ""the person and his/her community at risk."" In Gus Deeds' case, the young man was released after the mental evaluation Monday because no psychiatric bed could be located across a wide area of western Virginia, Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Tuesday. Cropper declined to comment on the specifics of the case but said not finding a bed was unusual for his agency. The recommendation is 50 beds per 100,000 people to provide the minimally adequate intensive care for people in crisis, Fuller on the Treatment Advocacy Center said. The state of Virginia averages 17.6 state psychiatric beds per 100,000 people, and ""that's actually above average,"" Fuller said. Arizona, for instance, has 4.1 state psychiatric beds per 100,000 people. England has 62 beds per 100,000 people. Mental health warning signs parents can't ignore . A rapidly ticking clock on finding beds . Cropper told CNN that under Virginia's emergency custody order process, medical staff members have four hours to decide whether someone should be committed after the family petitions a court to order an evaluation. The clock starts when authorities deliver the patient for clinical evaluation. Physicians make a recommendation to the court after the evaluation. If a magistrate approves, medical staff search for an available hospital bed. ""In certain conditions, a two-hour extension is granted by a magistrate, but under no circumstances can a person be held beyond six hours involuntarily,"" Cropper said in a statement. After 32 people were killed in the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, Virginia lawmakers sought to overhaul the emergency-evaluation processes and increase funding for community mental-health services. But according to the Virginia-based National Alliance on Mental Illness, the state's overall state mental-health budget decreased $37.7 million dollars from $424.3 million to $386.6 million from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2012. ""What you don't have is sustainable funding,"" said Mike Fitzpatrick, executive director of the alliance. ""A tragedy happens, the legislature reacts. You see this in other states then, over time, that's chopped away and these services aren't available."" Fuller said the shortage of psychiatric beds dates back half a century to President John Kennedy's signing of the Community Mental Health Act in 1963. The goal was to shut down public psychiatric hospitals, replacing them with small community-based centers. ""It was a perfectly reasonable idea, except the community facilities were never built,"" she said. ""The hospitals were closed, and the people who once got hospital treatment for the most part no longer do, and the beds aren't there, period."" Institutionalized -- in prisons . ""We have an estimated 450,000 people with mental illness in jails and prisons today,"" Fuller said. ""You sort of add up that we have 43,000 in beds and 450,000 in jails and prisons, and you're almost back to the hospital bed number we had in 1960 -- except we've just reinstitutionalized them. And, of course, if Gus Deeds had not killed himself, he would be today in jail. There wasn't a hospital bed for him, but we would have found a cell for him."" At a forum on mental illness in Boston last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius recounted the recent experiences of two people close to her dealing with mental health issues. The forum marked the 50th anniversary of Kennedy signing the community mental health act. ""It gave me a real snapshot into some of the challenges in both our mental health and substance abuse systems,"" she said. ""I'm the secretary of Health and Human Services. I know who to call. I know where the resources are. So if our friends and family had difficulty, I had a real snapshot into what people in communities deal with every day."" Gus Deeds withdrew from The College of William & Mary last month after being enrolled off-and-on since 2007, according to a statement from the school. Cory Jessee, a high school and college classmate of Gus Deeds, said his friend was brainy and a talented bluegrass musician. He said those close to Deeds knew the family had sought professional help for him. ""I can't imagine him being conscious of what he was doing,"" Jessee said of the assault. ""I knew his family was trying to get him help. Everyone did. ""I knew they had the means and the ability to search for stuff like that and put time into it. I wasn't aware of how much time.""

"Imagine if going through airport security was just a matter of walking past a stretch of wall. No pat-downs, no X-rays, no metal detectors, and no need to remove any clothing. The harsh reality of today's air travel is at strong odds with such a fantasy, but a new type of body scanner bears the promise to make every frequent traveler's dream come true. It's called ""Alfa3"" and it's based on the established technology of ""millimeter wave imaging"", which is used in hundreds of scanners currently deployed in airports the world over. But unlike those, Alfa3 does not require you to enter a chamber, raise your arms and stand still while the machine analyzes your body: it is able, instead, to do its job as you simply walk by. ""It's a type of thermal imaging"", explains Dr. Naomi Alexander, the Madrid-based physicist who invented the Alfa3, ""so we see the difference in temperature between the body and objects that aren't part of the body."" Current systems return a detailed image of the person being scanned -- passengers can in fact opt out and receive a pat-down instead -- but Alfa3 uses a passive technology that can detect objects underneath clothing without revealing any anatomical details. And compared to standard metal detectors, it has the ability to spot non-metallic objects as well, such as liquids and gels. One of the problems with current scanners using the same technology is the high rate of false positives, sometimes greater than 50 percent. The Alfa3 uses a significantly higher resolution that promises excellent accuracy and automatic detection of threats, according to its inventor. Further advantages include the possibility to deploy the system outdoors and in a covert manner, which would make it an interesting option for military installations: Dr. Alexander has traveled to Kandahar, Afghanistan, to test one of the four prototypes in existence at a NATO military base. But the main appeal of the scanner is surely its high throughput, over 400 people per hour. This could mean the end of security lines at the airport. The problem is to now make potential customers aware of the new technology: ""It's not like selling sunglasses,"" says Dr. Alexander, ""somebody already knows they want sunglasses, so they go and buy them, whereas with this system you have to explain the advantages with respect to what else is available on the market."" ""It takes some time to sort of educate, I guess, the customer in that respect. So, it's a process that needs to be gone through."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece's Parliament has approved a key law needed to implement a five-year austerity package that was approved by lawmakers a day earlier. Lawmakers voted 155-136 in favor of the measure, with five voting ""present"" in the 300-seat house. The package had been demanded by international lenders -- and its passage should clear the way for an emergency loan to Athens. But Greece has seen weeks of sometimes violent public protests against the austerity plan, which follows a series of cuts agreed to last year. European Commission head Jose Barroso and European Union President Herman van Rompuy said they strongly welcomed Thursday's vote. ""This was the second, decisive step Greece needed to take in order to return to a sustainable path,"" they said in a joint statement from Brussels. ""In very difficult circumstances, it was another act of national responsibility."" They said the conditions ""are now in place"" for a decision on the release of a fifth round of emergency funds to Greece, part of a multi-billion euro deal agreed last year, and for ""rapid progress"" on a second proposed bailout. Following the vote, the Greek civil servants' union ADEDY called another rally outside Parliament for Thursday evening. Before Wednesday's vote, small numbers of demonstrators hurled stones at police, chanted, waved Greek flags and set small fires to protest the austerity measures, which include new taxes and job cuts. At least 19 police officers were injured Wednesday, police said. European and international lenders agreed last year to give Greece a $156 billion bailout package as its deficit soared, but were threatening to hold up an installment of $17 billion due soon. Greece has debt payments coming due in mid-July and needs the $17 billion in emergency funds to be able to pay them -- but lenders, including the International Monetary Fund and the EU, had demanded that it approve the austerity measures in order to get the loan. A default by Greece would send shock waves through the European banking sector and potentially dent global economic confidence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Wednesday's passage of the austerity measures ""really good news,"" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Twitter. Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker also welcomed the news, saying: ""I'm very happy and relieved that the Greek Parliament followed the government and voted in favour of a new program of structural reforms and budgetary adjustment."" Unions oppose the austerity package, but its backers say it is essential to the stability of the Greek economy, the euro, and the global financial system. Protesters lament that the cuts are being carried out on the backs of those who can afford it least.

"(CNN) -- Africa's oil and gas potential will grow significantly over the next two decades, driven by population growth, urbanization and the emergence of a wealthier middle class on the continent. Six of the top 10 global discoveries in the oil and gas sector in 2013 were made in Africa, with more than 500 companies currently exploring deposits there. There were nearly nine million barrels of crude oil produced daily in Africa last year, with more than 80% of it coming from established players such as Algeria, Angola and Nigeria. This is all good news for Africa, but look behind the figures and the story is more about gas than oil. Excitement remains around large gas finds in Mozambique and Tanzania, but even here there is much hype and unknowns. The scale of these East African finds is not in doubt but developing these discoveries will be massively expensive and a long-term investment. Mozambique's gas investment in particular will be dependent on what future gas prices will be -- and this is changing quickly due to the oil and gas revolution. Changing landscape . Ten years ago, gas investments in the Gulf of Guinea were made to service the U.S. market. Today, that market has disappeared and the U.S. itself is exporting gas, while Angola, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea are now exporting to Europe and Asia. Indeed, a decade ago it was unimaginable that Algerian, Angolan and Nigerian oil exports to the United States would have plummeted so dramatically and that India would so soon become the second largest importer of African oil after China. The lesson is that the international market can change quickly in response to technological innovation and geo-politics. If China and Australia develop their shale gas reserves, or if South Africa discovers and develops major reserves under the Karoo, then East Africa's mid-term prospects could change significantly. Qatar -- the world's largest source of liquefied natural gas -- could decide to export more, also changing the calculus. The gas sector is currently concentrated in Africa, with nine-tenths of annual production volumes coming from Nigeria, Libya, Algeria and Egypt. Gas is more costly to develop and export. I worry that governments in East Africa have become intoxicated by industry hype and have not managed public expectations -- not only is future gas pricing less certain, but the profits following the large investments are much lower than oil. Unlocking the potential . There is no doubt that Africa remains significantly under-explored by oil and gas companies. The price of oil and the incentives for exploration partly determine this, but major investors are also cautious because of the lingering challenges of corruption, lack of infrastructure and regulation. As regulatory frameworks tighten in the U.S. and Europe, international oil companies have to be more careful about how they conduct their business. The corruption allegations over ENI in Nigeria are a reminder of this -- but it is not only big oil companies that are impacted. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into U.S.-listed Cobalt International Energy has ensured that despite its exciting hydrocarbon in the Angolan pre-salt concessions it is unable to farm out to a major or super major International oil company and its share price has suffered. Likewise, the Houston-based oil and gas company Hyperdynamics Corporation's share price tumbled in 2013 when the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC requested documents relating to its business in Guinea. Look carefully and you can see the oil industry responding to greater scrutiny. In Angola this year, the Norwegian oil company Statoil successfully flipped its equity exposure from a partner that raised eyebrows to two small international oil companies with better probity records. Although finding oil and gas in Africa can still be low cost, developing it needs deep financial investment and long-term commitment. African governments that manage better their regulatory and business environment are more likely to attract this type of investment that is needed to unlock their natural resource endowments, which in turn can generate revenue.

"While the nation is watching and hearing the angry protests in support of black shooting victim Michael Brown, a different kind of support is being voiced for the white police officer who fatally shot the unarmed teenager. In a first account of its kind, a caller to Radio America's ""The Dana Show,"" who identified herself only as Josie, told listeners a detailed account of Officer Darren Wilson's side. A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN it accurately matched what the officer has told investigators. ""He said all of a sudden, he just started to bum rush him,"" she said. ""He just started coming at him full speed, and so he just started shooting and he just kept coming."" ""I can even say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements, that at that moment in time, he was scared for his life, I am 100% positive of that,"" Wilson's longtime high school friend Jake Shepard told CNN. But accounts of exactly what happened between Wilson and Brown vary widely. Witnesses have said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at a police car before the young man was shot. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . Facebook support . In a rally organized by the ""Support Darren Wilson"" Facebook page, more than 100 people gathered Sunday in downtown St. Louis to show their support for Wilson, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. The Facebook group is gaining attention on social media and has received more than 29,000 likes since its creation on August 9. A second Facebook page, ""I Support Officer Wilson,"" is almost at 33,000 likes since its creation Friday. According to the ""Support Darren Wilson"" page, another rally was set up over the weekend on a bridge that connects Illinois and Missouri. And in a recent post on the page, the group is preparing for another rally this week. The posts on both pages express frustration about not being heard in the media and allege a lack of support for Wilson and law enforcement. A recent post on the ""I support Officer Wilson"" page says, ""We started this page to be the voice that law enforcement did not have."" Another post from the same page says that Wilson has overcome a rough childhood himself and that becoming a police officer has helped him to overcome that. ""It has been brought to my attention that Officer Darren Wilson had a very hard childhood and was able to rebound from that childhood becoming a police officer. ... This man is a hero now and has always been a hero,"" one post reads. Wilson, 28, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he will have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities said. Shepard told CNN the officer was the ""nicest guy in the world."" ""I could never imagine him even in that situation taking someone's life, let alone taking someone's life with malicious intent,"" he said. A post from the ""I support Officer Wilson"" page says that Wilson is struggling with what he's done. ""This incident and the death of Michael Brown has been very hard for Officer Wilson and he is not handling it well,"" it says. Support from friends, families . Many who say they are wives of law enforcement officers have posted stories about their husbands facing similar situations. Others who say they're friends of fallen officers have also posted about the grief they have seen when an officer is killed in the line of duty. KimC shared her support on the St. Louis Police Wives' Association blog: ""Thank you from a Ferguson resident and friend of the officers here in the community. ... Thank you for the meals, donations to Darren and constant prayers. God bless you all."" A crowdfunding campaign for the officer is also gaining traction via fundraising websites. A Gofundme.com campaign raised over $10,000 in less than 24 hours and now has a goal of $100,000. And a Teespring campaign, which sells T-shirts to help raise funds, has sold 1,007 T-shirts, breaking its goal of 1,000 T-shirts. The outpouring is modest when compared with that for the Brown family. A memorial campaign fund set up by Brown's parents has raised over $82,363 in the last five days, breaking an $80,000 goal.

"(CNN)Opening statements in the trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev likely won't begin Monday as originally planned, because jury selection is taking longer than anticipated, a court official said Thursday. Monday ""is not realistic"" as a start date, and the court expects to announce a new date next week, said Ginny Hurley, spokeswoman for the U.S. District Court in Boston. Jury selection began more than two weeks ago. Authorities accuse Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, of planting two pressure-cooker explosives, hidden in backpacks, near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 260 others wounded in the explosions. Three days later, after the FBI released surveillance photos of the suspects, the Tsarnaevs shot and killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, authorities say. Early the next day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died of wounds he suffered during a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found and arrested that night, hiding in a boat behind a house. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged with 30 federal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. He pleaded not guilty in July 2013.","Jury selection has taken longer than anticipated, court says .

"""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" has stars aplenty, but does it have what it takes to make it a summer blockbuster? The reviews are in for the film, which stars Hugh Jackman, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and others -- and not everyone agrees on the latest installment of the ""X-Men"" series, a sequel to 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and 2011's"" X-Men: First Class."" The plot revolves around the group sending Wolverine (played by Jackman) into the past to try to change a calamitous future. Rolling Stone's Peter Travers writes, ""Step up, cynics, and see the summer 2014 blockbuster that gets damn near everything right. ""OK, maybe 'Days of Future Past' is merely a stopgap between 'First Class' and the upcoming 'X-Men: Apocalypse,' "" Travers continues. ""But it's also a movie that uses action to define character and has the skills to make you care about outcasts in a society that hews spinelessly to the norm. A rousing epic of mind and heart in a summer of craven formula."" A.O. Scott of the New York Times writes, ""In the case of 'Days of Future Past,' the plot is as overelaborate and muddled as some of the effects. ""The logic of the story -- a time-travel pretzel that strains after the brain-teasing power of an old ""Star Trek"" episode -- requires too many variables,"" according to Scott. ""The frantic crosscutting of the culminating battles, which take place simultaneously and also a half-century apart, requires too much thought on the part of the audience because it has received too little on the part of the filmmakers."" Chris Nashawaty of EW also references ""the pretzel-logic pop fantasia"" but takes a more positive view. ""I know all of this sounds like a tangled thicket of cosmically Big Ideas,"" Nashawaty writes. ""But Simon Kinberg's marvelous script makes it all move with a Swiss jeweler's precision and hum with internal logic. It's complex without being confusing."" The Washington Post's Michael O'Sullivan cautions fans to not expect some questions from past films to be answered (like how is Patrick Stewart's Professor Charles Xavier still alive, anyway?). But, he says, "" 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' is, in itself, as intoxicating as a shot of adrenaline. It's what summer movies are meant to be.""

"(CNN)  -- Last year, the bus in which a young Congolese woman we met named Mary was riding was stopped by a militia. ""They wanted to all have me, to rape me,"" she related haltingly to us. ""I told them no, and then they took off my shirt and beat me. I have terrible marks now."" Mary's story is similar to hundreds of thousands of women's experiences in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where rape is routinely ""deployed"" as a weapon of war by the armed groups fighting over a nation that has some of the richest nonpetroleum natural resource deposits in the world. Congo holds the numbing distinction of being home to the deadliest war in the world since World War II -- with more than 5.4 million people killed during the past 15 years. ""This war is caused by the minerals,"" Mary told us. ""Those [armed groups] control the minerals. I hear that they are used in mobile phones. ... If you talk to Obama or the phone companies, tell them what happens here."" Armed groups in eastern Congo that control minerals, mines and trading routes generate an estimated $180 million each year by trading four main minerals: tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. This money enables the armed groups to purchase large numbers of weapons and continue their campaign of brutal violence against civilians. Conflict minerals are key components in the manufacture of cell phones, laptops, digital cameras, video games and portable music players. Because of increasing awareness of the links between electronics products and the worst sexual violence in the world, change is afoot. During U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit to eastern Congo in August, she said: ""With respect to companies that are responsible for what are now being called conflict minerals, I think the international community must start looking at steps we can take to try to prevent the mineral wealth from the DRC ending up in the hands of those who fund the violence here."" The U.S. Congress has also initiated a strong bipartisan effort to curb the conflict minerals trade. Senate and House bills on this issue represent a significant step toward having conflict-free cell phones and laptops by setting up a system of audits and minerals-tracing mechanisms. This would reveal which phones and laptops contain conflict minerals and which ones do not. Introduced by Sens. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin) and Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) on the Senate side, and Reps. Jim McDermott (D-Washington), Frank Wolf (R-Virginia), Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) and Donald Payne (D-New Jersey) on the House side, the bills already have the support of powerful committee chairmen but still must be moved through committee. With the Obama administration and Congress taking a strong interest in this issue, and activist campaigning building some momentum, companies have begun to react. The tin industry has gone the furthest by introducing an initiative to increase due diligence and trace minerals on the ground in Congo. Electronics companies also have a project under way to map out supply chains. And Intel, HP, Dell, and Motorola are hosting a meeting with activists on conflict minerals in San Francisco, California, this month. But it is not enough. Campus activists -- from New York; to Knoxville, Tennessee; to Nevada -- are taking up this issue with increased vigor, along with major faith-based groups, from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to Jewish World Watch. Are the government and company actions taken to date enough to stop the conflict minerals trade from continuing? The answer is no. Electronics companies must invest in a system to certify that the minerals used in their products are verifiably conflict-free. They must work with their suppliers to trace the minerals back to their mines of origin and have independent audits conducted of these supply chains so that we know with verified proof that none has passed through the hands of armed groups. The Obama administration should help companies develop a certification process for conflict minerals, built on the lessons of the Kimberley Process for blood diamonds. The administration can also help devise a public-private partnership to work with companies, the Congolese government and other key donor countries to help miners in eastern Congo and improve mining inspection and tracing on the ground. Companies and the government can take steps today. For a start, electronics companies should have audits conducted of their supply chains for the minerals. And Congress should pass the conflict minerals legislation, to get tracing started. If you have a cell phone, you can also have an impact. Ask your senator and representative to sign the Congo Conflict Minerals Act (S. 891) and Conflict Minerals Trade Act (H.R. 4128), and find a creative way to reach your cell phone manufacturer to tell it you want a conflict-free cell phone. The minerals supply chain involves multiple companies, and the war in Congo will not be resolved overnight. But if companies and consumers take a stand and say ""Give us conflict-free products,"" we can stop this deadly trade and put real pressure on the armed groups that rape women on a mass scale in eastern Congo. Let Mary's request not be forgotten. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sasha Lezhnev and John Prendergast.","Lezhnev, Prendergast: Congo ""conflict minerals"" fund deadly war in which rape is routine .

"Ukraine's ousted President is a wanted man. He's also a missing man. Viktor Yanukovych is not in Kiev. The mayor of Kharkiv, where Yanukovych was Saturday, says he hasn't seen him in a few days. He's also apparently not hiding in a bunker in a Ukrainian Orthodox monastery, a church spokesman said, swatting down the latest speculation. Ukraine's onetime -- and, by his account, current -- President is facing a warrant for the ""mass killings"" of civilians. Over the weekend, he fled to Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near the border. And he tried to board a charter plane in the eastern city of Donetsk but was turned away because he didn't have documents. In his last known public act, he delivered a televised speech Saturday from Kharkiv in which he rejected the parliament's ouster and vowed to fight. ""I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate President,"" he said Saturday in the televised broadcast. Critics weren't impressed. ""It's a remarkable situation when the most sought-after character in the country is the President of Ukraine, who is hiding and doing everything to leave the country, to avoid responsibility,"" opposition leader Vitali Klitschko said Monday. Yanukovych's ouster and disappearance capped a weekend of dizzying developments after the parliament voted to oust Yanukovych as a concession to relentless protests, which led to the deadliest violence in the country since its independence 22 years ago. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, 53, was freed from prison Saturday after 2½ years, most of them spent in a detention hospital. Tymoshenko, a longtime opposition leader, has accepted an invitation for medical treatment in Germany, her press officer Marina Soroka said. She will be attending a European People's Party summit there. On Monday, the Ukrainian Parliament continued work toward its goal of having a full interim government in place by Tuesday, naming a new chief prosecutor, security service chief and central bank head. Parliament had already named Speaker Oleksandr Turchinov to serve as acting President. He is a longtime ally of Tymoshenko's. The head of Ukraine's electoral commission, Konstantin Khivrenko, said the campaign to elect a new president will begin Tuesday, three months before the May 25 election date set by authorities. Russia's Foreign Ministry criticized those elections Monday, saying Ukraine's parliament was acting rashly, and accused lawmakers of discriminating against ethnic Russians by excluding them from the reform process. ""A course has been set for suppressing those who disagree in different regions of Ukraine with methods of dictatorship and terror,"" the Foreign Ministry said. Some protesters gathered Monday outside the Ukrainian parliament shouting ""shame"" in response to what they see as a lack of transparency on the part of lawmakers. Yanukovych's decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia prompted the protests in November. Now, the country's new leaders have made clear that Kiev's return to European integration will be a priority. But in doing so, they risk losing the largess that the Kremlin had bestowed on Yanukovych. Taking no chances, interim Finance Minister Yury Kolobov proposed Monday that an international donor conference be held in the next two weeks. Ukraine, he said, will need $35 billion in foreign assistance by the end of 2015. Yanukovych has traditionally looked upon eastern Ukraine, near Russia, as his traditional support base. Russian culture and language are predominant there. People in the east are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of those in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the protests against Yanukovych that filled central Kiev for months. The big question: How will Russian President Vladimir Putin respond? He's been Yanukovych's chief ally, and Ukraine is in his backyard. Will he act militarily? The U.S. has expressed support for the action of parliament. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with the Russian foreign minister Sunday and asked  Russia not to use military force in the country, according to a senior State Department official. The State Department also warned U.S. citizens to defer all nonessential travel to Ukraine. ""We have been very clear that we support an independent and unified Ukraine and that the idea of separation or partition or division is not in the interest of the Ukrainian people, of the Ukrainian nation, of Europe, or Russia, or the United States,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday. ""This is not a competition between East and West. This is not a restoration of the Cold War. This is about the Ukrainian people and their future,"" he said. Up to speed: Uncertainty reigns in a divided Ukraine . From prison to center stage for Tymoshenko . What's behind Ukraine's political crisis?","""This is not a restoration of the Cold War,"" White House spokesman says .

"A suicide attack in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Thursday morning killed five people and wounded 33 others, including at least four children, said Hashmat Stanikzai, a police spokesman said. An explosive-laden car was detonated as a foreign embassy convoy was passing in the 9th District police zone, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi. The UK Foreign Office said two of those killed worked for the British Embassy. One of the dead was a British national, a civilian security team member, and the second was an Afghan national working for the embassy, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in a statement. A second British member of the security team was injured, he said. ""I condemn this appalling attack on innocent civilians supporting our diplomatic activity,"" Hammond said. ""This outrage brings home to us once again the courage and perseverance of the people of Afghanistan and members of the international community who support them, who have lived together through decades of conflict."" British security firm G4S confirmed in a statement that the security workers caught up in the blast were its staff and offered its condolences to their families and friends. ""An investigation into the incident is under way and therefore we are unable to comment further at this time,"" it said. ""Next of kin have been informed and we will continue to provide them with support."" Police in Kabul had earlier said that at least one British diplomat was killed after a large explosion damaged a convoy of foreign embassy cars in the capital. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack. Pictures from Mustafa Deveci, a witness at the scene, showed at least five vehicles damaged at the site of the blast with their windows blown out. In a separate incident, armed insurgents attacked the office of a nonprofit organization in Kabul late Thursday. Security forces killed two of the three attackers, Stanikzai said.

"(CNN)Scientists who pulled off a huge achievement in space exploration showed numerous black-and-white images Thursday of where they think the Philae probe landed on a comet 310 million miles from Earth. Many at the European Space Agency have gone without sleep in the last few days, nervously anticipating whether Philae's difficult journey would actually end in success. A few who spoke to reporters in Darmstadt, Germany, choked up and said how much the mission -- dubbed Rosetta -- means to them and to space exploration. ""Rosetta is trying to answer the very big questions about the history of our solar system,"" said Matt Taylor, ESA Rosetta project scientist. ""What were the conditions like at its infancy and how did it evolve? What role did comets play in this evolution? How do comets work?"" There were flaws with the landing -- anchoring harpoons didn't deploy when Philae made impact, lander manager Stephan Ulamec said, and screws meant to burrow into the surface didn't work. But Philae bounced at least twice, they said, and stuck the landing. And that was all that counts. A jubilant Jean-Pierre Bibring, who has reportedly spent more than two decades working on the Rosetta mission, showed photos that scientists were just beginning to receive. ESA scientists and executives high-fived and hugged one another when the landing was confirmed on Wednesday. Spacecraft have crashed into comets before, but this was the first controlled landing in history. ""Our ambitious Rosetta mission has secured a place in the history books: not only is it the first to rendezvous with and orbit a comet, but it is now also the first to deliver a lander to a comet's surface,"" Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's director general, said in a statement. Many people, and not just the ones who work for ESA, are excited about what kind of information Philae will deliver. And science fiction writer Alastair Reynolds said, ""This is science fiction made real in terms of the achievement of the mission itself, but Rosetta is also taking us a step closer to answering science fiction's grandest question of all: Are we alone?"" Rosetta took off from Earth 10 years ago, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, and traveled a total of 6.4 billion miles before rendezvousing with the comet in August. The Philae lander separated from the orbiting Rosetta around 3:30 a.m. ET Wednesday and landed on the comet seven hours later. ESA lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that the orbiter had to be in the right position to allow the lander craft, which had no thrusters, to ""free fall"" on the correct trajectory so it landed on the comet. The lander weighs about 220 pounds and is the size of a domestic washing machine. The target comet is only 4 kilometers, or 2.5 miles, in diameter. Shortly after landing was confirmed, the probe tweeted: ""Touchdown! My new address: 67P!"" Later, it tweeted again: ""I'm on the surface but my harpoons did not fire."" What can we learn from comet landing? The mission has historic allusions. The spaceship is named after the Rosetta Stone, an inscribed piece of volcanic rock found in Egypt in 1799 that  allowed scientists to decipher hieroglyphics and thus understand the ancient Egyptian culture, ESA said. The lander is named after an island in the Nile River where an obelisk was found that helped decipher the Rosetta Stone, ESA said. Led by ESA with a consortium of partners including NASA, scientists on the Rosetta comet-chasing mission hope to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind: high energy particles blasted into space by the sun. The comet is currently 500 million kilometers (310 million miles) from Earth and pictures from the Rosetta mission to track it on its orbit around the sun have amazed scientists. We can land on a comet, but we can't... Philae is equipped with an array of experiments to photograph and test the surface of Comet 67P as well as to find out what happens when the roasting effect of the sun drives off gas and dust. Built by a European consortium, led by the German Aerospace Research Institute, the landing probe has nine experiments. According to details on ESA's Rosetta website, sensors on the lander will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface, gas analyzers will help detect and identify any complex organic chemicals that might be present, while other tests will measure the magnetic field and interaction between the comet and solar wind. What is a comet and what will Rosetta discover . Philae also carries a drill that can drive 20 centimeters (8 inches) into the comet and deliver material to its on board ovens for testing. Scientists are already pleased with progress of the mission, and they're wowed by what's already been accomplished. Bibring took questions from reporters about the failure of the harpoons, answering them in great detail. He appeared to get mildly frustrated, though, and implored that failure not be the focus. ""It's gorgeous where we are!"" he said. How comet mission helps search for alien life .

"(CNN) -- Five former Blackwater Worldwide security guards indicted on voluntary manslaughter and other charges in connection with killings in Iraq were released on their own recognizance Monday after a court hearing. Dustin Heard, an ex-security guard from Blackwater Worldwide, surrenders Monday in Salt Lake City, Utah. The charges, which the Justice Department announced Monday, stem from a September 16, 2007, shooting that killed 17 Iraqis in a Baghdad square. A judge ordered the ex-guards to appear for another court hearing in Washington on January 6. The 35-count indictment charges each of the former guards with 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime. Prosecutors do not believe they have enough evidence to bring manslaughter charges on three of the 17 deaths. If convicted, the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each manslaughter count, seven years in prison for each count of attempted manslaughter and a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms charge.  Watch victims speak of the shooting » . The men named in the indictment are Donald Ball, 26, of West Valley City, Utah; Dustin Heard, 27, of Maryville, Tennessee; Evan Liberty, 26, of Rochester, New Hampshire; Nicholas Slatten, 24, of Sparta, Tennessee; and Paul Slough, 29, of Keller, Texas.  Watch Ball's mother speak out » . A sixth former security guard -- Jeremy P. Ridgeway, 35, of California -- pleaded guilty last Friday in Washington to voluntary manslaughter and attempt to commit manslaughter. The five men turned themselves in to federal authorities in Salt Lake City, Utah, on Monday morning and then were released on their own recognizance, which means that they were released without bail on a promise that they will return for the trial.  Watch the scene in front of the courthouse » . ""We take no pleasure in charging individuals whose job it was to protect the men and women of our country,"" said Jeffrey A. Taylor, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. ""But when individuals are alleged to have violated the law while carrying out those duties, we are duty-bound to hold them accountable, as no one is above the law, even when our country is engaged in war."" The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" The attorneys for the defendants say that Blackwater's employees in Iraq are exempt from the provisions of the act because the company has a contract in Iraq with the State Department, not the Defense Department. Mark Hulkower, defense attorney for Slough, blamed the killings on insurgents who used civilians as ""shields"" in Iraq. Hulkower said his client and the other defendants were just trying to do their jobs in a very chaotic situation. ""These young men were fighting for their lives in a crowded area,"" Hulkower said to reporters on the steps of the courthouse Monday. ""What happened was a tragedy, but not every tragedy is a crime. We are confident that this case will be dismissed."" The federal magistrate judge in the case initially ordered all five suspects barred from using firearms as one of the conditions for their release. Attorneys in the case argued against this vigorously, saying the suspects were hunters and one of the suspects needed to use a gun for his job as a court bailiff. The judge allowed the court bailiff, Ball, to use his gun for work but barred the others from using firearms. The hearing was packed with relatives of the suspects, and about a dozen soldiers in uniform could be seen in the courtroom. Defense attorneys pushed for the Utah judge to have a probable cause hearing, a preliminary hearing that determines if the government has enough evidence to go to trial. But the judge ordered that the probable cause hearing should occur on January 6 in Washington. The six guards were informed during the summer that they were targets of the investigation into the 2007 shooting. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The former guards' company, Blackwater Worldwide, will not face charges. In a statement released shortly after the indictments were announced, Blackwater reiterated its position that its former employees had not acted improperly. ""Based on the information available to us, we understand that these individuals acted within the rules set forth for them by the government and that no criminal violations occurred,"" the statement said. Blackwater also complained about a number of ""misguided assumptions and generalizations that surrounded this unfortunate incident. ... [Blackwater's] work has been mischaracterized and all of our personnel unfairly maligned."" At the same time, the company noted that if ""it is determined that an individual acted improperly, then Blackwater supports holding that person accountable."" None of the former guards has worked for Blackwater since 2007, company spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said. An Iraqi official familiar with the investigation said that an FBI team and two U.S. prosecutors working on the case will meet in Baghdad on Saturday with more than 60 Iraqis involved in the incident. The meeting is intended to brief the Iraqis on the status of the case. Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents. The guards returned fire, Blackwater said. But an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder"" and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately. The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene told military investigators they found no evidence the contractors were fired upon, a source familiar with a preliminary U.S. military report told CNN. The indictments are ""a step in the right direction,"" said Mohammad Abdul Razzaq, whose 9-year-old son, Ali, was killed at Nusoor Square in Baghdad. ""It was heinous crime and a painful incident, [but] we can overcome that if a just verdict is handed down."" Hassan Salman, an Iraqi lawyer wounded in the shootings, said that the ""American judicial system, known for its integrity, should hand down [to] the perpetrators of this heinous crime against the Iraqi people nothing less than death sentences."" The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors. Among the potential problems is that the law under which the charges are expected to be brought covers contractors working for the U.S. military, but the Blackwater guards were contracted by the State Department. Some independent legal experts question whether U.S. courts have jurisdiction in this case. Also muddying the waters are alleged assurances of immunity given to the guards by State Department diplomatic security agents investigating the incident before the FBI got involved. The State Department said its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution but only promised that statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution. But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity, FBI agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again, complicating the FBI probe. The shooting heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws. Security contractors had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put in place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. But starting next year, under a U.S.-Iraq security agreement that Baghdad approved last week, Iraq will have the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. contractors and their employees. The State Department, which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees, renewed Blackwater's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government.

Watson gave the speech in light of the U.N. launch of the HeForShe campaign, which aims to engage men to stop violence against women. We live in a world in which 100 million girls globally are expected to be married off before age 18 in the next 10 years, a world in which even in the United States a girl can find herself plucked against her will from a New York classroom and forced by relatives to marry against her will in a country she has never known, a world in which 31 million girls of elementary school age remain out of school, a world in which two-thirds of the world's 774 million illiterate citizens are female. Indeed, Watson's star is only the latest to illuminate the rebranding of feminism. As Jessica Bennett wrote on Time.com, Beyonce put the word ""FEMINIST"" in a blaze of full-stage glory at the MTV Video Music Awards, ""making Sunday the sixth-highest day for volume of conversation about feminism since Twitter began tracking this year (the top three were days during #YesAllWomen)."" Beyonce also penned a piece last year arguing that ""men have to demand that their wives, daughters, mothers and sisters earn moreâ€”commensurate with their qualifications and not their gender. Equality will be achieved when men and women are granted equal pay and equal respect."" The question now is how to translate all the high-profile feminizing into visible, on-the-ground gains in the lives of ordinary women and men. The retaking of the ""feminist"" label by cultural luminaries lending their platform to the issue is laudable, but to date we have seen a lot of promise and much less progress. One example: On the media front women are embarrassingly absent from editorial pages still content to feature women's voices a fraction of the time. Women ""are less likely than men to be sources or appear in authoritative roles in news stories, are depicted less frequently than males and less prominently, such as appearing further down in the columns, with fewer quotes or only paraphrased."" (A recent Washington Post review of a Civil War book noted that the author's prose seemed ""to have been borrowed from the pages of a women's magazine."" Rarely have I spotted such a reference to GQ or Esquire.) In entertainment, research from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media found in a survey of recently released films that there are ""2.24 male characters for every female character. Only 30.9% of the speaking characters are female."" On the economic front, ""after a gradual rise in the 1980s and 1990s, the women's-to-men's earnings ratio peaked at 81% in 2005 and 2006."" So, the talk about access to opportunity for everyone is terrific. But now comes the hard part: the action to make the change and in the process create a world that is fairer for everyone. One that does justice to the ambition of girls in any and every corner of the world, and to our own hopes for a more stable, secure and prosperous future. It will take a village. One boosted by a lot of high-wattage celebrities helping to light the way.","Emma Watson gives a rousing speech at the United Nations about gender inequality .

"(CNN) -- ""I won't even sleep in the same room with them."" A fellow named Daniel Sieberg was telling me his hard-and-fast rule for getting through the night. He takes all of his digital devices -- laptops, tablets, cellphones, anything portable that has a screen -- to another room before he turns off the light. He has come to terms with the fact that the technological gadgets that have so thoroughly insinuated themselves into our lives can become addictive. So, when it's time for slumber, he locks them out. He won't even let his cellphone charge overnight in the bedroom: . ""If it's there, I would have the temptation to turn it on and check it."" We have learned to celebrate, even revere, the wireless gadgets we carry around and the inventors who bring them to us; the response to the death of Steve Jobs this month was emblematic of how important our do-it-all phones, our computers, our tablets and related digital devices have become. We say that the technology has changed life as we used to know it. But how much is too much? And, more to the point: How many of us have the nagging feeling that we are somehow unable to disconnect -- that the electronic devices we own have begun to own us? There is an instinct to treat the subject whimsically: ""Land o'Goshen, Ma, those kids are walking down the street staring at their cellphone screens."" It's as if any criticism of what the digital age has done to society brands the person raising the questions as backward, afraid of change, irrationally wedded to outmoded ways. So the addiction question is often one that people silently ask themselves. Shouldn't we be spending less time checking and rechecking our many screens, large and small, and more time taking part in what used to be regarded as real life? Is there something inherently wrong when people being separated from their phones, computers and tablets makes them feel nervous, irritable, tense -- in other words, when they begin to exhibit classic withdrawal symptoms? For guidance on this, I got in touch with Sieberg, who has given as much thought to the subject as anyone of whom I'm aware. A former CNN correspondent, he is a lecturer, writer and broadcaster on technology issues who, in his own life, became increasingly conscious of the unhealthy hold that digital devices can have. He wrote a book called ""The Digital Diet"" that argues persuasively that there can come a time in a person's life when he or she is a good candidate for technology detox. I asked him if ""addiction"" is too strong a word to use in relation to devices that seem to hook their users emotionally, but not chemically. ""Unfortunately, the word 'addiction' has become overused,"" he said, and should not be trivialized. Addictions to illegal drugs, alcohol and prescription medication are grimly somber matters. But, he said, the idea of an addiction to digital devices is genuine and is not something that should be greeted with a sardonic wink. ""One definition of 'addiction' is when other people and other activities in your life begin to suffer because of something you know you should cut back on, but don't,"" he said. Some of his examples are things that many people will instantly recognize: . -- The urge to pull out a cellphone even when someone you're with is in the midst of a conversation with you. -- Texting even while your child is telling you about his or her day at school, and realizing later that you can't remember the details of what your son or daughter has said to you. -- Having the vague feeling that something hasn't really happened until you post it to Facebook or Twitter. -- Feeling isolated and anxious if you are offline for an extended period of time. -- Noticing that even when your family is all together in one room at home, each person is gazing at his or her own screen and tapping at a miniature keyboard. ""There are people who, even when they aren't using their digital devices, find themselves creating status updates or Twitter feeds in their heads while they are experiencing things,"" he said. ""It's as if they have lost the ability to live in the moment, and have become conditioned to feeling that they have to instantly share it electronically while it is still going on."" Sieberg is hardly a guy stuck in some dust-covered, pre-technology past: He has always been among the first to own each new portable device, and he likes the many good things the digital experience can provide. But he realized -- when his wife would wake up in the middle of the night to see him, in bed, illuminated by the glow of one screen or another that he had decided to check one more time before he fell back asleep -- that something might need remedying. There is, he said, a feeling common among people who are digitally hooked that, when it's just them and the real world and no screen, they are somehow cast adrift, cut off: ""It's a sense of, 'What am I missing?'"" But in truth, a strong case can be made that when a person lives too many hours a day in the digital universe, that is when he or she is really missing something -- missing the things that are taking place in the flesh-and-blood world. Sieberg has a phrase for it: You know you're in trouble when ""your footing in technology feels increasingly like quicksand."" And he has a piece of advice for all of us, regardless of how deep we feel we're sinking into that digital quicksand: . Like him, we should consider locking all of those devices in another room at night. He promises that it makes a difference: . ""You sleep better."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: People are increasingly wedded to smart phones, other digital devices .
He says author Daniel Sieberg suggests ways to avoid becoming addicted to gadgets .

"Grief and rage erupted on the streets of Turkey's largest city after a 15-year-old boy struck in the head by a tear gas canister died Tuesday morning in a hospital. Much of the anger was focused on Turkey's embattled prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A crowd chanted ""fascist government, Erdogan killer,"" as Berkin Elvan's coffin was carried through the streets of the working-class Istanbul neighborhood his family calls home. Some bystanders wept in the freezing, pouring rain. President Abdullah Gul spoke with the boy's father Monday and was saddened by Tuesday's news, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. ""I extend my condolences to his family. I share their pain,"" he said. Elvan was only 14 when he was critically wounded last summer, at the height of a wave of anti-government protests that erupted across Istanbul and other Turkish cities. His parents said he left home on the morning of June 16, 2013, to buy a loaf of bread.  Less than 15 minutes later, neighbors arrived, telling them their son had been wounded. The boy suffered blunt trauma to the head. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, an eyewitness said the child was hit by a police tear gas canister. For the next nine months, Elvan lay in a hospital bed in a coma. When Elvan's mother attempted to make a public statement about her son's ordeal in central Istanbul in July 2013, CNN journalists witnessed and filmed Turkish riot police hitting demonstrators with pepper spray and beating one man with a club in an apparent effort to break up the demonstration. More recently, riot police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators holding a vigil outside the hospital where Elvan was being treated. Members of the family said the boy wasted away to a weight of 16 kilograms (about 35 pounds) during his nine-month-long coma. ""The government has not accepted any responsibility and they have not brought the police who were responsible for this to justice,"" said Ali Kan, one of the men who attended the funeral procession. News of Elvan's death sparked a fresh round of protests in other parts of Istanbul, as well as in the capital Ankara, where riot police reportedly intervened using tear gas. Istanbul police denied using tear gas to disperse crowds that gathered Tuesday at the hospital where Elvan died, Anadolu reported. See photos from the protests on CNN iReport . Political passions are running high in Turkey.  In less than three weeks, the country is expected to go to the polls in nationwide elections.  Though voters will be electing town and city mayors in a series of municipal elections, the contest is widely seen as a referendum on Turkey's long-serving prime minister. Erdogan has been on the political defensive since December, when police detained dozens of people close to his government as part of a wide-ranging corruption probe. In subsequent weeks, the prime minister dismissed thousands of police commanders, as well as the prosecutors leading the investigation. He has also mounted a media offensive against his former political ally, the powerful Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Erdogan has repeatedly accused Gulen and his supporters of establishing a ""parallel state"" within the Turkish police and judiciary aimed at toppling his democratically-elected government. As the corruption probe ground to a halt, anonymous critics began publishing a series of audio recordings online that appear to be wiretaps of Erdogan's telephone conversations. Erdogan has denounced some of the recordings, calling them ""immorally edited material.""  But the prime minister has also confirmed the authenticity of at least one recording, in which he is overheard instructing the executive of a Turkish TV channel to censor the live broadcast of a rival politician's speech in parliament. On Tuesday night, Elvan's body lay in a ""cemevi,"" the house of worship of the Alevi religious sect to which he belongs.  The boy is expected to be buried following a funeral service on Wednesday. In the meantime, activists have called for symbolic funeral protests to be held in other cities across Turkey. More than 100 Turkish riot police walled off the center of Istanbul's busy Taksim Square on Tuesday evening, in a clear effort to prevent demonstrators from gathering in the heart of the city.","Turkey's president says he shares the family's pain, news agency reports .

"Algiers, Algeria (CNN) -- Tensions erupted in another restive North African nation as security forces in Algeria on Saturday clashed with anti-government protesters who chanted, ""Change the power."" Police detained about 100 protesters in the nation's capital of Algiers, according to the Algerian League for Human Rights. The league is one of the main opposition groups that organized the rallies -- unauthorized gatherings that came a day after embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down. ""We are here once again to tell this government that we want an Algeria (that is) democratic,"" one protester told Reuters television. ""That's why we are here today and we will always be, as this power is still here, we will be always here too."" More than 3,000 demonstrators, including activists, students, doctors, and parliament members, joined the rally but were blocked by more than 30,000 police officers, said league president Mustafa Boushashi. ""The police attacked the demonstrators,"" Boushashi told CNN. ""Many activists were beaten and over a hundred were taken into custody, including the parliament members from the Rally for Culture and Democracy Party."" Khalil AbdulMouminm, the league's general secretary, called the situation ""very tense on the ground"" and said police were preventing protesters from assembling, with authorities blocking all entrances to the capital. ""We want this rally to break the wall of fear in the first place,"" AbdulMouminm said. ""And to trigger change in order to reach our legitimate demands, like lifting the emergency law after all these years, liberating media, freedom of political expression."" Mubarak's ouster -- fueled by 18 days of angry protests -- was preceded by last month's overthrowing of Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, helping stoke demands for reform in the Arab world. In the past few weeks, demonstrators in the region have protested against various issues, including unemployment, high food costs and corruption. The problems are similar to those that fueled uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. ""Population growth and associated problems -- unemployment and underemployment, inability of social services to keep pace with rapid urban migration, inadequate industrial management and productivity, a decaying infrastructure -- continue to affect Algerian society,"" the U.S. State Department says in a background note about Algeria. Earlier this month, Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika said he will end a state of emergency that has lasted nearly two decades, according to a report from the Algerian Press Service. Experts have said the announcement is a clear attempt by the Algerian leader to head off the kind of social unrest that toppled Ben Ali and Mubarak. The state of emergency was imposed in 1992 to quell a civil war that eroded the country's resources and led to what the U.S. State Department says were the deaths of more than 150,000 people. ""The Algerian Civil War lasted well over a decade and pitted a corrupt military junta, which had ruled behind the facade of an elected government, against Islamists who effectively won a popular election in the early 1990s, and were then deprived of power,"" a paper by the Centers for Strategic and International Studies said in December. ""When civil war broke out, violent extremist elements among these Islamists quickly came to dominate the fighting, while the military increasingly relied on equally violent repression."" However, opponents of the regime say the Islamist threat has long since diminished and that the law now exists only to muzzle critics of the government. Journalist Nassima Oulebsir contributed to this report.","Anti-riot police gathered at the scene, blocked entrances to the city .

"A drone that just started flying for energy giant BP in Alaska is the first commercial drone operation authorized over land by the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency announced Tuesday. The FAA said Tuesday it approved BP's plan for an unmanned aircraft system to survey roads, pipelines and other equipment at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, the largest oilfield in the United States. The drone's manufacturer, AeroVironment, conducted its first flight for BP on Sunday, the FAA said, but the flight of the 4½-foot-long aircraft wasn't disclosed by the FAA until Tuesday morning. It was the first such commercial flight authorized over land.  Last summer, the FAA authorized drone flights over Arctic waters. The FAA has greatly restricted the commercial use of drones over U.S. land and water as it seeks to safely integrate them into national airspace. Entities that fly drones must first get certificates of authorization, and those have gone chiefly to government enterprises and those conducting research. Under AeroVironment's certificate, the company can operate only in daytime, where there is a visibility of 3 miles, and the aircraft must be kept in sight. The company must also notify air traffic controllers. Last week, the FAA announced that Nevada will host the third of six congressionally mandated drone research sites. The FAA granted the Nevada team a two-year certificate to use an Insitu ScanEagle at the Desert Rock Airport in Mercury, Nevada. Desert Rock, owned and operated by the Department of Energy, is a private airport and not for general use. Meanwhile, seven aerial photo and video production companies have asked for regulatory exemptions that would allow the film and television industries to use unmanned aircraft systems with FAA approval for the first time. The Motion Picture Association of America facilitated the exemption requests on behalf of its membership.","The 4½-foot-long aircraft aims to survey equipment and roads at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, oilfield .

"A senior Bloomberg News journalist quit his role earlier this month, saying the ""mishandling"" by his bosses of a story critical of China was behind his departure, amid suggestions that the New York-based company is pushing a financial strategy for China that overshadows editorial autonomy. Asia Editor-at-Large Ben Richardson left the news organization at the beginning of March in protest at his senior colleagues' approach toward a long-running investigative piece that sought to expose hidden financial ties between the families of Chinese officials and a wealthy businessman. The New York Times, amongst others, first covered the story of the piece's non-publishing in November of last year. In an email to the newspaper, quoted in the initial article, Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler said the piece was ""active"" and that it had not been killed. However, since then it has remained unpublished and, speaking to CNN Thursday, Richardson said that, while what he can say is limited by a confidentiality agreement, he could ""categorically state that it (the story) was spiked."" ""No work is currently being done on that story,"" he said. ""The primary reporter has left the company ... it's a risible excuse to say that the story is just resting."" Despite requests on a number of occasions, Bloomberg declined to comment on this story when contacted by CNN, or agree to requests for an interview with Winkler. 'Misleading statements' The piece, which was produced over several months in 2013, was due to be published late last year but ""ran into some opposition"" from senior staff, according to Richardson. The initial New York Times article cited journalists who worked on the story and participated in a conference call as saying Winkler informed them that a decision not to publish the story had been made. Winkler reportedly told the journalists -- Richardson included --  working on the story that it was necessary to stay on the right side of Chinese officials, given that several reporters from organizations including Al Jazeera and the New York Times along with Bloomberg, had had their visas withheld or rejected -- apparently following reports critical of Beijing. Subsequently, the story's lead journalist, Michael Forsythe, left the company. Forsythe declined to comment when contacted by CNN. In an email to media blog JimRomenesko.com, published earlier this week, Richardson wrote: ""I left Bloomberg because of the way the story was mishandled, and because of how the company made misleading statements in the global press and senior executives disparaged the team that worked so hard to execute an incredibly demanding story. ""The reporters who worked on the story for months didn't get to review the copy before it was unilaterally spiked on a conference call with a ludicrous amount of top brass."" Unlike many news organizations, Bloomberg has alternate revenue streams. Bloomberg L.P., Bloomberg News' parent company's financial terminals are sold in China. Currently, the number of subscribers in the country, estimated by the China Law and Policy blog at 3,000, is dwarfed by those in other parts of the world, meaning that there is considerable scope for growth. When asked about the subscriber numbers, a Bloomberg spokesperson told CNN that the company could not confirm subscriber numbers for individual territories. The timely, accurate access to Chinese financial data is also considered to be an important part of the company's success, enhancing its legitimacy as a provider of financial data worldwide. Backing off? Comments made by Bloomberg chairman Peter Grauer following his Asia Society Hong Kong speech on March 20, addressed the issue of sensitive stories in China and their ramifications. ""We have about 50 journalists in the market (in China), primarily writing stories about the local business and economic environment and ... every once in a while we wander a little bit away from that and write stories that (we) probably... should have rethought but China for us is very important,"" he said in response to an open-ended question about the company's strategy there. ""For us being in China is very much part of our long term strategy and will continue to be so going forward."" Yuen Ying Chan, Director of the Journalism and Media Studies Center of the University of Hong Kong, said she thinks the message Grauer's statement gives is that ""Bloomberg is willing to compromise the credibility of its news product."" ""I think it's problematic, and wrong for him to pitch business with journalism, with data, because you need good reporting to ensure...  (the) authenticity of your information. I don't understand... you're not selling apples and oranges, you're selling information to the world. Then credibility is your most valuable attribute, right? So you need a product that's credible, (or) you undermine yourself."" For Richardson, the decision to publish or not comes down to Bloomberg's view of itself as a journalistic organization, and where its priorities lie. ""The company has a duty to consider the interests of a majority of its workers. Now if your news division is part of that (but) doesn't provide the bulk of the revenue... If you're putting the company's entire business at risk because of an investigative journalists' project, then you have to ask yourself -- is that the right thing to do?"" The company's signature financial software product is by far its biggest revenue producer, representing about 82% of its $8.5 billion in revenue, Grauer said during his Asia Society speech. Timeline: Foreign journalists under pressure in China . Sensitive stories . Bloomberg has sailed close to the wind on previous occasions, such as former editor Amanda Bennett's June 2012 piece on then-incoming President Xi Jinping's family's business interests and its ""Red Nobility"" story, also edited by Richardson, which mapped the origins of an ""elite class"" of descendants of China's ""Eight Immortals"" -- an elite group of Communist revolutionaries who helped found the People's Republic of China. Since the publication of that article, Bloomberg's news website has been blocked in China. Richardson said that the story represented a new direction for the company but ultimately Bloomberg may have felt they have underestimated the severity of the reaction of China's political class. ""I don't know to what extent that (was) born out of naivety,"" Richardson said. ""Did they really realize what the consequences were? Anyway, I would think they probably would have rethought it with hindsight."" Reporters playing smart as China takes tough line with media . China's influence . The news of Bloomberg's alleged climbdown comes as part of a larger trend of international companies acquiescing to China's restrictions. While Internet giants Facebook and Google have chosen to remain outside of China rather than compromise their independence, others, such as LinkedIn, Microsoft and Apple have accepted that curtailment is a condition of doing business in China. In addition, in 2005 and 2006 Yahoo suffered a wave of negative publicity for handing over data on journalist Shi Tao to the authorities. At the time, a Yahoo spokesperson told CNN Money that the company's response was that they had ""only responded with what we were legally compelled to provide and nothing more."" In the last two years, international media companies, including Al Jazeera, Bloomberg, the New York Times and Reuters have fallen afoul of Chinese authorities, prompting a slew of comment from publications such as the Washington Post and the New Yorker about the cost of reporting in China. In its 2013 year-end statement, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said that Chinese authorities were increasingly using the denial of visas, or delays in their approval, in an apparent effort to influence journalists' coverage. Chinese authorities did not respond to requests from CNN for comment on this story. With regards to Bloomberg's possible editorial decisions, ""the interesting thing is whether a news organization, per se, has a duty to protect and enhance free speech,"" said Richardson. ""I think that the debate we should be having is not trying to treat Bloomberg as some kind of fallen angel but just to try another debate as to how the media engages with dictatorial regimes or this level of intolerance to free speech.""

"(CNN) -- Violence in recent weeks has prompted a ""slow but steady exodus"" of Christians from the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Mosul, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. The trend started after a Baghdad church attack on October 31 and subsequent targeted attacks of Christians in Baghdad and Mosul. The total death toll at Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad was 70, and 53 of the people killed in the strike were Christians, a minority group in a predominantly Muslim nation. U.N. offices in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon are reporting a growing number of Iraqi Christian arrivals. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Baghdad and Mosul Christians have been headed to other destinations in Iraq, such as the Kurdish region and the Nineveh Plains, a region in the north with a strong Christian presence. ""We have heard many accounts of people fleeing their homes after receiving direct threats. Some were able to take only a few belongings with them,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Churches and NGOs are warning us to expect more people fleeing in the coming weeks."" In Syria, since November, about 133 families, or 300 people, have registered with UNHCR, ""the majority of whom fled Iraq following the October church attack in Baghdad."" In Jordan, the number of registrations of Christians during October and November doubled from the same period last year. In September, 57 Christians had been registered and the figure rose to 98 and 109 in October and November respectively. ""One man who is now registered with UNHCR in Jordan narrowly escaped the attack, having left the church minutes before the bombing took place. This refugee had been deported from Europe just days beforehand,"" the statement said. Because of the recent hostilities, the agency urges ""countries to refrain from deporting Iraqis who originate from the most perilous parts of the country."" UNHCR said it was ""dismayed"" that Sweden on Wednesday forcibly returned a group of some 20 Iraqis, five of whom were Christians from Baghdad. ""One of the Christian men said he escaped Iraq in 2007 after militiamen directly threatened to kill him. Fearing for his life, he traveled through several countries in the Middle East and Europe before reaching Sweden where he applied for asylum. ""He said his claim was rejected three times in 2008 and that his claims were not accepted as he was not considered to have been personally targeted. The others we spoke to said their asylum claims were rejected on the basis of improved security conditions in Iraq."" UNHCR said asylum seekers from Baghdad, Diyala, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Kirkuk provinces shouldn't be returned by other countries and should get some form of protection. The agency said that despite Iraq's efforts to protect minority groups and their places of worship and an overall decrease in civilian casualties, these people are ""increasingly susceptible to threats and attacks."" ""Our position reflects the volatile security situation and the still high level of violence, security incidents, and human rights violations taking place in parts of Iraq. UNHCR considers that serious -- including indiscriminate -- threats to life, physical integrity or freedom resulting from violence or events seriously disturbing public order are valid reasons for international protection,"" the U.N. agency said.","Growing number of arrivals in nearby countries .

"Afton Burton was 16 and living with her parents in Illinois when she discovered Charles Manson. Now, nine years later, her name is Star, she's 25 years old, and she considers herself Charles Manson's wife, even though it isn't official yet. ""He filed for the first round of paperwork,"" says Star, who says she's in love with the 79-year-old convicted murderer.  ""I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say."" Star says she was first attracted to Manson after reading about ATWA,  Manson's environmental philosophy that stands for air, trees, water, animals. ""It's the life on the planet, you know,"" Star says. ""The Earth is a rock and everything else on it is ATWA."" Why people still pay attention to Manson . After a few years of sending letters and talking to Manson on the phone, Star, at age 19, moved to Corcoran, a small central California city that's home to Corcoran State Prison, where Charles Manson has lived for the past 25 years. She talks to Manson almost every day by phone and visits him on most weekends. ""We talk about anything and everything, you know, like what's going' on today-- who's doing what. I try to help him file papers and stuff like that,"" the slender brunette says. The prison limits physical contact. During visits, Star and Manson can only hug each other at the beginning and end.  Because Manson is serving a life sentence, they won't be allowed conjugal visits, even if they're officially married. Star says she knows people think she's crazy. ""I don't care what those kind of people think. It doesn't make any difference,"" she says. ""The man that I know is not what they have in the movies or in documentaries and the books.  He's nothing like that.  He doesn't tell people what to do.  He's not manipulative at all."" Star spends her days painting and maintaining several of Manson's social media sites, including MansonDirect.com. Her goal is to try to get Manson out of prison, arguing that he had nothing to do with the seven Tate-LaBianca murders that he was convicted of masterminding. ""Charlie never believed in something called Helter Skelter. That didn't have anything to do with why those people were killed,"" she says of the theory prosecutors used that Manson persuaded a group of followers to kill wealthy white people to incite a race war by framing the Black Panthers. ""He never ever thought any of that stuff.  That's ridiculous,"" says an emphatic Star. ""That's crazy."" Star is fiercely loyal to Manson. She still has a scar from when she shaved her head and carved an X in her forehead two years ago, an act similar to what girls in the so-called Manson Family did during his 1971 trial. She says she did it at Manson's request as a protest after he was put in solitary confinement. Critics believe Star is being manipulated by Manson, and that ATWA is just a ploy to get young people like her to pay attention to him. ""The only thing that he's trying to manipulate people into doing is planting trees and cleaning up the Earth. He genuinely cares about that,"" says Star. ""He's nice to everyone. I've never seen him try to be manipulative.  I've never seen any of that."" Star says Manson, who turns 80 in November, is in good health, and she doesn't think about what she plans to do with her life after he's gone.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- A blogger and political activist who has called for reform in the United Arab Emirates has not been heard from since he was taken from his Dubai apartment Friday, his wife said. About 10 men, including two wearing police uniforms, picked up Ahmed Mansoor from his apartment Friday afternoon, said his wife, Nadia. The men also took Mansoor's passport and laptop and left without telling his wife where they were taking him or why. Lt. General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, the commander-in-chief of Dubai police, said he was not aware whether Mansoor had been arrested, but promised to look into it. CNN has also sent queries to other Emirati officials inquiring about Mansoor but have not heard back. Earlier Friday, three men identifying themselves as police officers were at his apartment building, Mansoor wrote in an email. When he called police asking about the men, he said he was told they had come for his car. ""I told him if they want to take the car, they can do that in the morning, not 2:50 a.m.,"" he wrote. The men left. That afternoon, the second group came and took him away. Mansoor was part of a group of 133 nationals who petitioned the president on March 9 for direct elections. The group included academics, former government officials, journalists and activists. The petition was addressed to President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and the members of the Supreme Council of the seven Emirates that form the UAE. In addition to elections, the group asked that the Federal National Council be granted legislative powers. The body only works in an advisory capacity and has no regulatory powers. In March, the UAE announced that Federal National Council elections will be held in September.","About 10 mean pick up Ahmed Mansoor from his apartment, his wife says .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN)  -- President Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize Thursday by talking about war and the limits of non-violence. But he also praised the peacemakers of the past, and said the world can and should still strive for peace. ""Let us reach for the world that ought to be,"" he told the 1,000-member audience at Oslo City Hall. ""Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace."" The Nobel committee's choice of Obama as this year's laureate sparked controversy, in part because he is a president waging two wars abroad. Obama said force is sometimes necessary, but said that is simply ""a recognition of history, the imperfections of man, and the limits of reason."" Read a transcript of Obama's acceptance speech . ""Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms,"" he said. ""The service of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans."" Waging war is not a way of imposing the will of the United States on the world, he said, but a way of seeking a better future for its people. ""The instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace,"" he said. Preserving the peace in Oslo Thursday came with a price -- $60 million worth of security preparations. Norwegian police said they had more than 2,000 officers on the streets, along with snipers, canine patrols, and helicopters in the air, in the biggest security operation they have ever mounted for a single person. Force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, Obama said, because inaction can tear at the world's conscience and lead to more costly intervention later. But peace can be justified too, he said, and he outlined three ways to build a just and lasting peace in the world. First, Obama suggested the world find a better way to deal with nations like Iran and North Korea that break or ignore rules and laws. ""If we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something,"" he said. ""Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable. Sanctions must exact a real price."" What did you think of Obama's speech? There should be consequences for countries that ""game the system,"" Obama said -- and that may sometimes mean engagement. But peace, Obama said, ""is not merely the absence of visible conflict."" He said the world needs to seek a just peace based on inherent human rights. Obama praised pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar, Zimbabweans who voted despite election violence, and pro-democracy protesters in Iran. ""It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any nation,"" Obama said. Obama also defended engagement with such repressive regimes, mentioning President Nixon's trip to China in the 1970s, Pope John Paul II's trip to Poland, and President Reagan's efforts on arms control and talks with the Soviet Union. ""There is no simple formula here,"" he said. ""But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time."" His third point was that peace should be based not only on rights, but also on economic security and opportunity. ""True peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want,"" he said. Development rarely happens without security, and security does not exist in places where people don't have enough food, water, or medicine, he said, adding that it also doesn't exist if people can't aspire to decent education or employment. ""The absence of hope can rot a society from within,"" he said. Another controversial aspect to Obama's selection was the question of what he had done to deserve the prize. He had been in office for only days when he was nominated, and the prize recognizes his work toward peace for most of 2008, largely when he was still a presidential candidate. Some of the protesters outside the awards venue questioned whether Obama should have received the Nobel Prize in the first place, with one sign reading, ""Obama: You won it. Now earn it!"" Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who joined Obama at a news conference earlier in the day, said the prize was deserved because Obama has provided leadership on key issues facing the world like disarmament, nuclear nonproliferation, and fighting global warming. ""I cannot think about anyone else who has done more for peace during the last year than Barack Obama,"" Stoltenberg said. ""It is a well-deserved peace prize and hopefully it is really in the best spirit of Alfred Nobel, because it can contribute in itself to strengthening the efforts of the president to work for peace."" Thorbjorn Jagland, chairman of the Nobel prize committee, also said Obama deserved the award. Echoing the title of one of the president's books, Jagland said, ""Obama has the audacity of hope and the tenacity to make these hopes come true."" Obama, who earlier in the day said he had ""no doubt"" that others were more deserving of the award, acknowledged those questions early in his acceptance speech. ""I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage,"" he said. ""My accomplishments are slight."" He said he accepted the prize with ""great humility.""","NEW: Protesters demonstrate outside venue; Norway spent $60 million on security .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Three people were killed Monday in Iraq in the latest attack targeting Christians, police in the city of Mosul said. In one attack, two Christian brothers were killed in Mosul when gunmen broke into their workplace in an industrial part of the city and shot them. The brothers were welders who owned the shop. On Monday evening, police found an elderly Christian woman strangled in her home in central Mosul. The attacks on Christians started October 31 in Baghdad have extended to the northern parts of the country, such as Mosul. Last week, a bomb attached to the vehicle of a Christian man detonated in eastern Mosul, killing him and his 6-year-old daughter, local police told CNN. The November 16 attack came one day after two Christian men in adjacent homes were killed after gunmen stormed their houses. Also on November 15, a bomb detonated outside a Christian home. It caused damages but no injuries. Iraq's Christian community, which numbered 1.4 million in 2003, is estimated to have dwindled to 500,000 as many have left the country, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has said. The commission, a U.S. government agency that listed the numbers in its 2010 report, said Christian leaders are warning that this decline could signal ""the end of Christianity in Iraq.""","Attacks on Christians started October 31 in Baghdad and have spread north .

"At a town hall meeting where he campaigned for health care legislation in 2009, President Barack Obama pledged to voters that he did not want any tax on health insurance plans he perceived as wastefully generous to ever impact average Americans. But in recent comments by one of the men who helped draft the legislation, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, that is not only precisely what will happen -- but that was the intention of the tax. White House officials had no comment, despite repeated requests by CNN. At issue is the tax on so-called ""Cadillac plans,"" more expensive employer-provided health insurance plans. While employers do not currently have to pay taxes on health insurance plans they provide employees, starting in 2018, companies that provide health insurance that costs more than $10,200 for an individual or $27,500 for a family will have to pay a 40 percent tax. At a town hall meeting on health care on July 23, 2009 in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Obama explained that the thinking of the Cadillac tax was to target plans that spend unnecessarily and excessively, thus driving up health care costs, such as a $25,000 plan, ""so one that's a lot more expensive and a lot fancier than the one that even members of Congress get."" The thinking, Obama explained, was that ""maybe at that point what you should do is you should sort of cap the exclusion, the tax deduction that is available, so that we're discouraging these really fancy plans that end up driving up costs."" The President at that point hadn't yet signed off on a Cadillac tax (he would eventually) but he did make the pledge: ""what I said and I've taken off the table would be the idea that you just described, which would be that you would actually provide -- you would eliminate the tax deduction that employers get for providing you with health insurance, because, frankly, a lot of employers then would stop providing health care, and we'd probably see more people lose their health insurance than currently have it.  And that's not obviously our objective in reform."" That promise is completely at odds with how Gruber describes not only that provision of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, but the intention of that provision. In one of the videos that surfaced in recent days in which the man described by the Obama campaign as having helped to write Obamacare describes the many ways voters he calls stupid were easily misled about the bill by those pushing it, Gruber says the Cadillac tax will do exactly what the president pledged it would not -- dissuade employers in general from providing insurance for its employees. ""Economists have called for 40 years to get rid of the regressive, inefficient and expensive tax subsidy provided for employer provider health insurance,"" Gruber said at the Pioneer Institute for public policy research in Boston in 2011. The subsidy is ""terrible policy,"" Gruber said. ""It turns out politically it's really hard to get rid of,"" Gruber said. You can watch the full remarks here. Gruber said the only way those pushing for Obamacare could get rid of the tax subsidy for employer provider health insurance was to tax the more generous, or Cadillac, plans -- ""mislabeling it, calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans."" The second way was have the tax kick in ""late, starting in 2018"" and have its rate of growth tied to the consumer price index instead of to the much higher rate of medical inflation. Eventually, the 40% tax on the more expensive plans would impact every employer-provided insurance plan. ""What that means is the tax that starts out hitting only 8% of the insurance plans essentially amounts over the next 20 years essentially getting rid of the exclusion for employer sponsored plans,"" Gruber said. ""This was the only political way we were ever going to take on one of the worst public policies in America."" By 2018, Gruber said, those who object to the tax will be obligated to figure out how to come up with the trillion dollars that repealing the tax will take from the U.S. Treasury, or risk significantly adding to the national debt. This is obviously exactly what Obama told voters in 2009 he had ""taken off the table."" It is exactly a process to ""eliminate the tax deduction that employers get for providing you with health insurance"" that five years ago Obama noted would result in ""a lot of employers then would stop providing health care, and we'd probably see more people lose their health insurance than currently have it.""","At issue is the tax breaks business get for providing employees health insurance .

"(CNN)The slightest movement by this man's hand can change the behavior of at least 100 people. Andris Nelsons is the 35-year-old Latvian conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, known for his energetic conducting style. ""It's very mystical how you influence the process of music making with your gestures."" Nelsons says. ""You as a conductor have to somehow collect all these great personalities, the energy of these great people you're working with, and bring it together so that it all goes towards the same goal."" There is great power in Nelson's gestures, and this energy acts as code for the orchestra. Limp hands will not do in this business, as the orchestra needs to know where the upbeats are and how to play them. Celebrated French-American cellist Yo-Yo Ma -- who began performing at just five years old -- understands the importance of the conductor's energy; ""The conductor is like the lightning rod. He activates all the molecules in the air to get people to think and feel something that's really special."" Not only does the conductor need to be in sync with the orchestra, but both his or her hands need to work together. While the right hand typically holds the baton and keeps the beat in a metronome-like fashion, the left hand displays the emotion of the piece, and tells the orchestra whether to hold a note or get louder. While conductors train for years to master these fundamentals, natural talent is also important. ""There are agreed upon things that everybody knows,"" explains Ma. ""But beyond that, the stuff that makes something really special, that's authenticity and people have say he's bringing 100% of who he is on stage."" Every conductor has their own style and puts their own mark on the movements. But they all aim to move the crowd to their feet at the end of every performance. Watch the video to learn more about the art of conducting an orchestra.","Andris Nelsons is the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra .

"As Islamist militants swept through northern and western Iraq in early June in a lightning advance, President Barack Obama examined his options and announced that he would be prepared to ""take targeted and precise military action."" Nearly two months later, Obama, albeit reluctantly, on Thursday approved the use of airstrikes in Iraq. He said the step was taken to defend U.S. personnel in the city of Irbil and protect religious minorities facing what he called a ""potential act of genocide"" from the Islamic State, the extremist group most recently known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The escalation marks a turning point in the Obama administration's foreign policy, which has avoided direct military involvement in Iraq and Syria until now. It's been a cautious policy that has come under fire from Republicans and some military and foreign policy experts. And while Obama's foreign policy ratings have plummeted, he has sought to avoid dragging a war-weary nation into another Mideast conflict. 'Political cover' Administration officials acknowledge Obama was reluctant to authorize military action, but was compelled to act to protect the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil and stave off the potential slaughter of tens of thousands of Christians and Yazidis, both religious minorities in Iraq. ""When we have the unique capabilities to help avert a massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a blind eye,"" Obama said on Thursday. But he was still careful to emphasize the need to protect American diplomats and military advisers stationed in Irbil. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest stressed on Friday that the ""top priority"" of the military operation is ""first and foremost the protection of American personnel."" CNN military analysts retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks and retired Col. Rick Francona said the presence of U.S. personnel in Irbil gives Obama the political cover to act militarily to address the precarious humanitarian situation. ""If that humanitarian disaster was not in place, I don't know that the President would have acted as aggressively,"" said Marks, a CNN military analyst. But now, military commanders have a ""green light"" to act, Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser said. Francona agreed that Obama would not have authorized airstrikes unless U.S. personnel were stationed in Irbil and noted that the administration's goals are unclear. ""I think they're looking at this very tactically and I don't know if they have a strategic vision here,"" Francona said, noting that the immediate objectives are clearly to blunt ISIS's advance toward Irbil and help protect the Christian and Yazidi refugees. Opinion: Can the West live with 'brutal' al Qaeda offshoot ISIS? Political heat . That is not the first time the administration has been criticized for lacking a strategic vision for countering ISIS. Republicans on Capitol Hill have repeatedly criticized Obama for undermining American influence globally by not acting decisively enough on Iraq and Syria -- among other global crises. And even after Obama authorized airstrikes in Iraq Thursday, the most consistent critics of his policy in Iraq and Syria continued to slam him. Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who have partly pinned ISIS's advance on Obama's full military withdrawal from Iraq, knocked Obama's ""policy of half measures"" and called on him to ""degrade ISIS."" ""It is inherently expansionist and must be stopped,"" the pair said in a statement following the President's announcement Thursday. ""The longer we wait to act, the worse the threat will become."" And House Speaker John Boehner lamented the ""ongoing absence of strategy"" in a statement released Friday. And in June, an animated Boehner accused Obama of ""taking a nap"" instead of dealing with ISIS. Republicans, like House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers and Sen. Bob Corker, criticized Obama last summer for not ordering military strikes in Syria after that country's authoritarian regime reportedly used chemical weapons in the ongoing civil war -- which Obama had called a ""red line"" that would prompt action. The link with Syria . Many have also criticized Obama's inaction in Syria as contributing to ISIS' growth by failing to bolster the moderate rebel forces. Without sufficient financial and military support, moderate rebel factions have dwindled as some fighters and entire groups opted to join ISIS and other Islamist factions fighting against government forces. The hands-off  approach in Syria even prompted the American ambassador to the country, Robert Ford, to resign recently because he could no longer defend the policy, he told CNN in June. ""Had there been more military assistance ... the opposition would have probably been able to gain ground a couple years ago more quickly,"" Ford said. "" (And) the ability of al Qaeda and Islamist extremist groups to recruit away from the moderates would have been less."" And aside from the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal, Ford said there is ""nothing we can point to that has been very successful in our policy."" Ford and others have called ISIS a national security threat to the United States and fears are growing that its fighters could return to Europe or the United States and carry out terrorist attacks. ""To stand back and do nothing is to simply see this cancer metastasize further,"" Ford said. Map: Where is ISIS? Increasing strength . But even as Obama's policy in Iraq and Syria faces continued criticism, his reluctance to intervene militarily is in line with most of the American public's thinking. In a September 2013 CNN poll, about six in 10 Americans opposed a resolution that would authorize military action in Syria and 55% opposed airstrikes. And a recent Pew Research Center poll showed that only 39% of Americans believed in July that the United States has a responsibility to intervene in Iraq. Meanwhile, the militant group has not only continued to increase its territorial gains, but also increased its military strength by reportedly seizing weapons, armored vehicles and even tanks from Iraqi forces -- equipment the United States provided to Iraq. ""You can pull that thread,"" Marks said of the link to U.S. policy in Syria. ""It's positive in my mind that had we acted more aggressively in Syria, the problem with ISIS would probably be less exacerbated and aggressive."" What to know about ISIS . Will anyone stop ISIS?

"What would it be like to wear Google Glass? Google answered that very question Wednesday morning, posting a lot more information about Project Glass, including the user interface, through a series of photos and videos. You can see the UI and some of the features of Glass here, although the images don't quite capture the exact experience. The headset doesn't actually have lenses in front of your eyes, just a small screen (viewable via a mirrored glass block) above and to the right of the wearer's right eye. As such, the point-of-view images that show a large action window in the center of the field of view are a little misleading. Still, the photos, posted on Google's Project Glass website, show more about how Glass works than any photo of the hardware could convey. This video shows even more: Commanding the headset is as easy as uttering the words ""OK, Glass,"" a clever use of real-world speech to engage the device's listening mode. SEE ALSO: How Google Glass Could Change Advertising . Once engaged, Glass is capable of taking photos, recording videos, looking up answers on Google, showing reminders (such as for a flight) and sharing whatever you're looking at — either via messaging or through a Google+ Hangout. As Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself revealed previously, Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds).

"Sorry, no Chinese researchers allowed! Oh wait, seems like that was a misunderstanding. Please do come. NASA's management apparently misinterpreted a security law when it barred Chinese researchers from attending the space agency's Kepler Science Conference in November, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. Xinhua said NASA sent a letter to Chinese scientists inviting them back and cited excerpts from the letter. NASA did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Sunday morning. The confusion apparently stemmed from a U.S. law passed in 2011 that prevents NASA funds from being used to collaborate with China or to host Chinese visitors at its facilities. NASA had announced that Chinese nationals would not be allowed to attend the conference for NASA's Kepler space telescope program at the Ames Research Center due to national security. The space telescope has been searching for planets outside of our solar system. Earlier this month, China slammed NASA for its decision to ban Chinese scholars from the conference, calling it ""discriminatory."" Gong Li, an official with the Party School of the China Central Committee's  Communist party, said the ban was similar to previous U.S. action against the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. He said it also illustrated U.S. fear of China's fast development. NASA didn't release an official statement on its website due to the U.S. government's partial shutdown earlier this month. But some U.S. scientists joined in decrying the decision and called for a boycott of the conference. ""In good conscience, I cannot attend a meeting that discriminates in this way. The meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away, with no national security implications,"" Geoff Marcy, an astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an e-mail to the organizers. Russian divers find huge suspected meteorite chunk in Chelyabinsk . 'Inaccuracies' U.S. Republican Rep. Frank Wolf, who drafted the 2011 law, issued a statement on his website that sought to correct ""inaccuracies"" about the restrictions first reported by Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""I was concerned to read an October 4 article in The Guardian that reported on poor guidance about these policies with regard to restrictions on Chinese nationals attending a conference next month at NASA Ames Research Center. Unfortunately, the article is riddled with inaccuracies, as is, it appears, the guidance provided by NASA Ames staff to the attendees,"" Wolf wrote. ""As you know, the congressional provision -- which has been in place since early 2011 -- primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies. It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government."" Security fears . Wolf said NASA officials may have believed the decision was needed because of extra temporary restrictions on foreign nationals after a potential security breach by a Chinese citizen at a NASA facility earlier this year. In March this year, a Chinese aerospace contractor who worked for NASA was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport as he boarded a flight to Beijing. Bo Jiang, who worked at NASA's Langley's Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, was charged with making false statements to U.S. authorities by failing to disclose all of the electronic devices he was carrying on his one-way flight. Wolf, who oversees congressional funding of several agencies, told reporters in March he believed Jiang was spying and had access to highly sensitive documents, including source codes for high-tech imaging used in missiles, unmanned aerospace equipment and other technology desired by the Chinese government.

"The busiest shopping day of the year also saw a major boom for gun sales, with the federal background check system setting a record of more than 175,000 background checks Friday, according to the FBI. The staggering number of checks -- an average of almost three per second, nearly three times the daily average -- falls on the shoulders of 600 FBI and contract call center employees who will endure 17-hour workdays in an attempt to complete the background reviews in three business days, as required by law, FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer said. ""Traditionally, Black Friday is one of our busiest days for transaction volume,"" Fischer said. Indeed, Friday saw the highest number of background checks ever for a Black Friday, and second in history. The highest day on record was December 21, 2012, with more than 177,000 background checks. On average, more than 500 gun background checks a day fail because of incomplete information required for a decision, according to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which is responsible for checks on firearm purchases from federally licensed shops. Employees of the background check agency, who work every day but Christmas, worked through the weekend to vet Friday's purchases. ""We are averaging three checks per second,"" Fischer said Friday afternoon, before the final numbers were in. ""The challenge is to have staff keep up with this volume. We do that by limiting personal leave, asking employees to work extra shifts and reutilizing former ... employees to serve in NICS during this busy period."" The agency brings in 100 extra employees to deal with the increase. ""This means saving lives and protecting people from harm -- by not letting guns fall into the wrong hands,"" FBI Manager Kimberly Del Greco said in a statement. ""It also ensures the timely transfer of firearms to eligible gun buyers."" Opinion: Black Friday's liability risk for stores . Overall, about 186,000 background checks a year cannot be completed, according to the FBI. It's difficult to know exactly how many gun sales are authorized from that number because whether to make the sale is ultimately in the hands of the shop owner. Last year, the agency completed 21 million background checks, and about 1.1% of those purchases were denied, the agency said. Firearm background checks have doubled from the more than 9 million conducted when the system was implemented in 1999. Ten factors can disqualify a purchase: felony conviction, arrest warrant, documented drug problem, mental illness, undocumented immigration status, dishonorable military discharge, renunciation of U.S. citizenship, restraining order, history of domestic violence or indictment for any crime punishable by longer than one year of prison. Gun purchasers are required to fill out a form from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with basic identification information and questions about the 10 disqualifying factors. The history of Black Friday . The gun shop can read the information to the background check agency  over the phone or run the information through a secure Internet connection. The check sometimes involves calling courthouses to get records and dispositions. ""We won't make a determination unless we are absolutely sure,"" Fischer said. However, the agency cannot deny a transaction based on an arrest without knowing the disposition of a case. After the three business days have passed, completion of the sale becomes the prerogative of the licensed gun shop owner, according to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1998 . Fischer said major retailers such as Walmart, Dick's Sporting Goods, Cabela's and Gander Mountain usually won't go through with the sale without complete information.

"Soccer legend Pele has been moved out of intensive care but remains in a Sao Paolo, Brazil, hospital following treatment for an infection, the hospital said Saturday. Pele, 74, has no fever and is still on antibiotics, the city's Albert Einstein Hospital said. He was admitted there early last week for a urinary tract infection. Pele posted a message to his Twitter followers Friday telling them not to worry. ""Thank you very much, I know everybody (is) worried about my health, but I'm ok,"" he wrote. On Facebook, he posted a video of himself strumming a guitar. Known as ""The Black Pearl"" and simply ""The King,"" Pele is one of the best known names in all of sports. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams as well, in 1962 and 1970, in addition to a breakthrough career with the Brazilian club Santos and later with the New York Cosmos of the now-defunct North American Soccer League. In 2000, he and Argentina's Diego Maradona were named co-Players of the Century by FIFA, the international soccer governing body. Santos named him a lifetime ambassador for the club, Pele told fans this week. ""It is exciting to know that I will be wearing the shirt of my favorite team for the rest of my life,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I expect to keep bringing pride and joy to Santos fans all around the world."" Even after retiring from football, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of football and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up among them in the inland city of Tres Coracoes.","Pele was hospitalized in Sao Paolo for a urinary tract infection .

"(CNN) -- He may be a long way from the football field, but Pele at least is back to talking and getting better at a Sao Paulo, Brazil, hospital. The city's Albert Einstein Hospital issued a statement Saturday saying the football legend -- born Edson Arantes do Nascimento -- was improving but still in intensive care battling an illness. Pele is lucid, talking and responding to antibiotics, the hospital said. He remains on temporary dialysis, which was a reason he was moved to the ICU in the first place, because the machine he needed was there. The hospital issued a second statement later Saturday, indicating that Pele continues to recover and that doctors plan to take him off dialysis early Sunday. Earlier this week, the 74-year-old was admitted to the medical facility -- the same place he recently underwent surgery to remove kidney stones -- for a urinary tract infection. The athletic icon had one kidney removed during this days as a player, his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues, told CNN. Pele tweeted Thursday that he was looking forward to spending the holidays with family and starting ""the new year with renewed health, with many international trips planned.""

"(CNN) -- Paid family leave, which tops the agenda of Monday's White House Summit on Working Families, and which was discussed at Tuesday's CNN town hall with Hillary Clinton, is a good idea whose time has come -- and gone. And come. And gone. Asked whether paid maternity leave should be mandated by law, Clinton said ""eventually, it should be, but, right now, we're seeing some -- some very good proposals being implemented in other parts of the country, so that we have answers."" Efforts to pass paid maternity leave in the United States stretch back to at least 1919. In the intervening years, as most other countries have guaranteed income for new mothers taking time off and many have also covered new fathers and those caring for seriously ill family members, we've learned much about the specific ways paid leave helps babies, parents and entire families. So why don't we have a law requiring paid leave yet? At virtually every juncture, its benefits have been overshadowed by a single powerful argument: that paid leave is bad for business. But is it? As a journalist and researcher, I set about trying to answer that question over the past year by looking to one of those states that have passed their own paid family leave proposals. Though there's no national paid family leave law, three states now provide cash benefits to workers bonding with babies or caring for sick relatives: California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. Researchers were already studying employers in California, where paid family leave has been in place since 2004, and Rhode Island just began its program this year, so I decided to explore businesses' experiences in New Jersey. Since 2009, New Jersey has been offering workers caring for seriously ill relatives or new babies up to six weeks of payments that amount to two-thirds of their salary, capped at $595 a week. The state has granted more than 100,000 family leaves in that time, more than 80% of which were used to bond with and care for infants, according to the state's labor department. ""Family leave insurance,"" as it's called, poses no direct costs to businesses, because it's entirely funded by a small (up to 60 cents per week) tax on employees. Still, there are other ways that the program could be a drag on employers. So, with a grant from the Ford Foundation, I visited as many businesses as I could find where a worker had taken a family leave in the past year and asked if the law had hurt them in any way. Despite the diversity of the 18 businesses I wound up visiting, which spanned the gamut from shipping to home nursing, pharmaceutical, and accounting, most of the owners or human resources managers I spoke with said the same thing: that paid leave hadn't affected how they do business. Not a single company felt it affected turnover or productivity. And while some had feared employees would take advantage of the program -- receiving benefits they weren't due, for example -- no one knew of any instances of abuse actually happening. Perhaps surprisingly, since some had predicted the law would be so burdensome it would drive businesses from the state, many employers said they actually liked the program. When I asked how it had affected their work ""all in all,"" none responded negatively. Six saw the law as neutral, while 12 felt it had a positive impact. Employers seemed most appreciative of the fact that paid family leave decreased their workers' financial stresses. One human resources manager noted that, before the law, employees returning from leaves not infrequently received calls from collection agents in the office. Since the paid leave law has been in place, she said, the number of those calls has dropped. Another human resources manager, who worked for a bank, recounted her own contrasting experiences of taking time off to care for her two children -- one born before New Jersey's paid leave program was in place, the other after. The first time, money was so tight, ""I didn't even drive and put gas in my car,"" she said. Her second leave, during which she received six weeks of pay through the state program, was far less stressful. Though one might assume that employees would prefer to have income when they're out dealing with the exigencies of life, the experience of another employer I spoke with confirms the point. The company, a health and pharmaceutical firm, also has an office in Pennsylvania and its employees who work there may choose to file taxes in -- and thus participate in the benefit programs of -- either state. The person in charge of family leaves at the firm told me she has fielded several unpleasant calls from those who chose not to file in New Jersey. As she puts it, ""When they find out they can't get the benefit in Pennsylvania, they freak out."" Though employees have good reason to like paid leave, employers' financial health since the policy has been in place may be the most important measure of its success -- and I made sure to ask about it. Most of the companies I interviewed -- 14 of 18 -- felt the program had no effect on their bottom lines. Two others felt it actually saved them money by sparing them the cost of paid leave they had provided themselves before the state program was in place. One vice president at a professional services company explained that, though she's recently had to hire the occasional temp to cover the work of employees out on family leave, those expenses have been offset by the money saved by not paying workers' full salaries during those leaves. (The National Partnership for Women and Families estimates that 12% of workers in the United States have access to paid family leave through their employers.) Two employers, however, felt that the relatively new program did wind up costing them. Though their employees -- indeed, virtually all employees -- occasionally took time off to care for babies and sick relatives before New Jersey's paid family leave program was in place, these companies felt that the availability of wage replacement encouraged more of their employees to take leaves and to stay out longer when they did. Because some of them hired temps to cover the work of employees who were out, the program led to an increase in those costs. Interestingly, it was these two employers -- the ones who felt the program hurt their bottom line -- who did the most to obliterate the claim that paid leave is bad for business. Both were hospitals where many nurses took leaves to care for new babies and ailing relatives. Though the managers I interviewed felt they may have spent more on temps since the paid leave law has been in place, both felt that the financial burden was worth it. ""From an organizational standpoint, I'm not sure it's made a huge difference,"" a human resources manager at one of the hospitals said of the paid family leave program. ""It has made a difference to the people that use it, though."" Having overseen many leaves, she is familiar with the situations that lead to needing time off -- not just the arrival of new babies, which are both joyful and stressful, but also the decline of parents, which are primarily taxing. She was genuinely pleased to now be able to offer a leave option that doesn't add to workers' financial burdens. And her staff seemed to share her enthusiasm. ""I don't think it's until someone really needs it that they realize how valuable it is to them,"" she said of paid leave. ""They are so grateful knowing they can take the time off to be with their loved ones.""

"When Harry returned home the morning after the typhoon struck, he found part of the roof missing from his home. It wasn't as bad as Yolanda,"" he said, referring to Typhoon Haiyan, which completely destroyed his house in the Magallanes ""barangay,"" or district, of Tacloban a year ago. ""It was so scary."" Much of his barangay, which lies close to the water's edge, was decimated by the storm surge that was generated by the most powerful storm ever to make landfall in November, 2013. It is also one of the poorest areas in Tacloban. Little more than a year on and most people in this traumatized town in the central Philippines will be incredibly relieved that Typhoon Hagupit, which passed some 50 kilometers north, came with nothing like the force of Haiyan. Most of what has been rebuilt in the past few months has largely remained intact. Harry was one of many who heeded official warnings to evacuate to safer areas during the storm -- he was not going to repeat the mistake he made last year of trying to ride it out. Surveying the damage around his modest home, its walls held up by various metal sheets and cardboard boxes, Harry seemed remarkably positive: ""It's not so bad."" Pointing at the missing part of his ceiling above his living area and kitchen, he added: ""It was not nailed down as well as the other area of roof."" He'll just repair it again like last time. TYPHOON TRACKER: Follow Hagupit's path . Checking for damage . This was a typical scene across Tacloban on Sunday morning, as some 48,000 people anxiously prepared to return to their homes from evacuation centers to check the damage. According to the mayor and the city's disaster management authorities, there have so far been no casualties and power should be restored in the next day or so. Clearing up is more about mopping up; torrential rains drenched the entire area, flooding many roads. Though the storm was nowhere near as powerful as last year's, authorities took no chances and were prepared for what was to come. Our next stop was the Santa Nino church, a building that became symbolic of the damage done by Haiyan. Almost leveled completely, it was in the process of being renovated. Hagupit spared it this time around -- the only clues to what took place the night before were lots of tree branches and roots strewn around the surrounding streets. Still waiting for homes . Many people in Tacloban are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after Haiyan. They've been promised new homes but the process has been extremely slow. For those lucky enough to get one, they're often located miles away. They may be away from vulnerable, flood-prone areas, but they're also far from where they work, shops and their friends. These are the main reasons why many have chosen -- against the wishes of the government -- to rebuild their basic shanty homes in areas like Magallanes and San Jose. Yet some like Lucrecia Simbajon, 58, another resident of Magallanes, would jump at the chance of a new home if only she was offered one. She and her family are among hundreds who have spent the last few days camped out at the local Roman Catholic ""Redemption"" church. ""I don't know how long I'm going to be here, as the roof was blown off my house last night,"" she said. Her home --  a typical wooden and metal shack --  was wiped out last year. As a result, she spent more than 20 days at the Redemption, lying between pews with her children. Though it is easily the sturdiest building in the area, the church's perforated roof is a reminder that Haiyan spared little in its path. Simbajon doesn't know how she'll carry out the repairs this time around. Her house is located in an area declared a ""no build zone"" because it was so close to the coast and therefore vulnerable to storm surges. ""We need help from the government --  financial assistance, materials, so we can rebuild,"" she said. They got no help after Haiyan, she added. Aside from delivering parcels of rice and noodles, she said no one from the government had been near over the past few days. Asked if she'd consider one of the new houses the local government pledged to build in the wake of Haiyan, she was emphatic: ""We no longer have a home here. For my family we are willing to move, to transfer."" Sheltering in chapel . The atmosphere inside the main chapel at the Redemption was far calmer than a day earlier when everyone nervously awaited the arrival of Hagupit -- these were among the town's poorest and most vulnerable. A white board listed everyone who was evacuated here, including several heavily pregnant women. Alita Castillo, another local, is also a volunteer with a local NGO dealing with disaster risk reduction. Her entire family is staying in an adjacent hall. ""We're more prepared this year, with more people prepared to leave their houses,"" she said. ""Last year, we had 70 families staying with us in the church. This time we have more than 200."" Yet she and her family still don't have a house, more than a year after Haiyan. And now the house she had been staying in has been badly damaged. ""I don't know where we'll go this time,"" she said. ""We helped organize a home owner's association and luckily, with help from the church, the United Nations, and a few other groups, we'll be eligible for free housing -- but it's still in the process. Hopefully two years from now I will have one.""​ .","Residents of Tacloban returning to home to check for damage .

"The founder of the World Wide Web may not be the world's most prolific micro-blogger -- but Tim Berners-Lee's ""This is for everyone"" tweet at the Olympic opening ceremony set the tone for what has been dubbed the first ""social media Games."" In an interview with CNN, the British computer scientist who invented the Web in 1989 said he was deeply moved to be honored for his pioneering role in the digital revolution -- and hopes the combination of the Web and the Olympics can create a new understanding between people across the world. ""The Web is about connecting people through technology, not about documents,"" Berners-Lee told CNN. ""The Olympics are about connecting people too. It would be nice if the Olympics bring people to use the Web to understand each other, break down national and cultural barriers and look at each other from a more beautiful point of view."" There were more tweets during the opening ceremony of the London Games than during the entire Beijing Olympics in 2008. Many of Facebook's 900 million users shared photos and comments about the event, and millions more in China took to Twitter-like ""Weibo sites"" to air their takes on the show. More: How hashtags are shaping the 2012 Games . Berners-Lee was approached by fellow Brit Danny Boyle -- the Oscar-winning film-maker who directed the opening ceremony -- last year about making an appearance. During the dazzling ""Frankie and June say ... Thanks Tim"" segment of the show, a British pop music-filled tribute to the digital revolution, the house that was the centerpiece of the act levitated off the ground to reveal Berner-Lee sitting at a computer. Berners-Lee then sent his ""This is for everyone"" message -- Boyle's idea, according to the scientist -- which lit up more than 70,000 LED panels around the stadium and was re-tweeted more than 10,000 times online. ""I was honored to be asked but it was also amazing to be part of this huge piece of amateur drama with thousands of people on stage,"" Berners-Lee said. ""We only had three run-throughs (of the ceremony), but luckily I had probably the simplest part anybody has ever had in any show ever. I had to basically press ""run,"" type a little and it's done. It was a bit nerve-wracking but very exciting."" More: Decoding the Olympic opening ceremony . Berners-Lee wouldn't bite when asked about the irony of American commentators not knowing who he was and instructing viewers to look him up on the Web. ""If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either,"" declared NBC's Meredith Vieira before co-commentator Matt Lauer told viewers in America to ""Google him."" Berners-Lee refused to criticize NBC for the gaffe, and said: ""I am terrible at remembering people and places myself, so I can't really blame anyone for that."" Born and raised in London, Berners-Lee said his invention was ""one of the many things in the show that Britain can be proud of -- and an essential thing of it was that it was an open thing, it wasn't something that could be controlled by any one government."" Berners-Lee, who co-founded and is the director of both W3C and the World Wide Web Foundation -- devoted to improving and furthering the potential of the Web -- has called for governments to be more transparent in how they release data, and is also critical of government censorship of information on the internet. More: Get latest results at CNN's Olympics HQ . ""Censorship is generally a bad thing. A strong government is one which is able to allow the people in a country to access reality, go onto the internet and see and discuss how things really are,"" he told CNN. ""A more weak government is one that's so worried it has to control info from its own citizens -- I think that's a pity when and where it happens. And I think with time we'll see that go away, bit by bit. I think we'll see information get around these blocks. And after awhile governments realize that for the country to work, economically, it's got to be open."" His message during the opening ceremony may have been ""for everyone,"" but Berners-Lee is quick to point out that the Web is only used by a quarter of the world's population. ""Is it really for everyone? Only 25% of people (globally) use the Web and the other 75% don't,"" he said. ""It's a question of how fast can we actually get the other 75% as part of the information society."" Berners-Lee says the Web Foundation is focused on closing that gap. More: Welcome to the Twitter Olympics . ""The Web Foundation is working with other foundations to see what we can to do get people using the web on mobile, to get entrepreneurs in Africa building websites, to get people to be able to pick their villages up from poverty,"" he said.

And while Berners-Lee isn't the world's biggest micro-blogger, he says his opening ceremony tweet got him another 50,000 followers on Twitter.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The contentious debate over so-called enhanced interrogation techniques took center stage Wednesday on Capitol Hill as a former FBI agent involved in the questioning of terror suspects testified that such tactics -- including waterboarding -- are ineffective. From left: Sens. Lindsey Graham, Sheldon Whitehouse, . Patrick Leahy and Dianne Feinstein listen Wednesday. Ali Soufan, an FBI special agent from 1997 to 2005, told members of a key Senate Judiciary subcommittee that such ""techniques, from an operational perspective, are ineffective, slow and unreliable and harmful to our efforts to defeat al Qaeda."" Soufan's remarks followed heated exchanges between committee members with sharply differing views on both the value of the techniques and the purpose of the hearing. Soufan, who was involved in the interrogation of CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah, took issue with former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has said that enhanced interrogation techniques helped the government acquire intelligence necessary to prevent further attacks after September 11, 2001. The techniques, which the Bush administration approved, are considered torture by many critics.  Watch analysts discuss harsh interrogations and torture » . ""From my experience -- and I speak as someone who has personally interrogated many terrorists and elicited important actionable intelligence -- I strongly believe that it is a mistake to use what has become known as the 'enhanced interrogation techniques,' "" Soufan noted in his written statement. Such a position is ""shared by many professional operatives, including the CIA officers who were present at the initial phases of the Abu Zubaydah interrogation."" Soufan told the committee that within the first hour of his interrogation of Zubaydah, the suspected terrorist provided actionable intelligence. But once the CIA contractors took over and used harsh methods, Zubaydah stopped talking, Soufan said. When Soufan was asked to resume questioning, Zubaydah cooperated. After another round of more coercive techniques used by the contractors, however, Soufan said it was difficult for him to re-engage Zubaydah. One of four recently released Bush administration memos showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on Zubaydah and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the suspected planner of the September 11 attacks. ""People were given misinformation, half-truths and false claims of successes; and reluctant intelligence officers were given instructions and assurances from higher authorities,"" Soufan testified. ""I wish to do my part to ensure that we never again use these ... techniques instead of the tried, tested and successful ones -- the ones that are also in sync with our values and moral character. Only by doing this will we defeat the terrorists as effectively and quickly as possible.""  Watch as Soufan makes his case before the panel » . Soufan was hidden behind a protective screen during his testimony before the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Staffers for the committee cited ""documented threats"" against him, noting his previous interaction with al Qaeda terrorists as well as his undercover work against Islamic extremists. Philip Zelikow, who was a top aide to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, repeated an accusation during the hearing that Bush officials ordered his memo arguing against waterboarding to be destroyed. The order, ""passed along informally, did not seem proper, and I ignored it,"" Zelikow said. He said that his memo has been in State Department files and is being reviewed for possible declassification. Zelikow slammed the ""collective failure"" behind the government's adoption of ""an unprecedented program of coolly calculated dehumanizing abuse and physical torment to extract information. This was a mistake, perhaps a disastrous one."" He added that some ""may believe that recent history, even since 2005, shows that America needs an elaborate program of indefinite secret detention and physical coercion in order to protect the nation. ... If they are right, our laws must change and our country must change. I think they are wrong.""  Watch Zelikow tell CNN's Kiran Chetry how U.S. leaders came to the wrong conclusions on interrogation policy » . Committee Republicans warned that the hearing ultimately could contribute to diminished national security. ""As we harshly judge those who had to make decisions we don't have to make, please remember this: that what we do in looking back may determine how we move forward,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. ""And let's not unnecessarily impede the ability of this country to defend itself against an enemy who, as I speak, is thinking and plotting their way back into America."" A top intelligence source familiar with the Bush administration's interrogation program was dismissive of Soufan's credibility as a witness. ""It's puzzling that someone who questioned a single high-value detainee for just a few months claims to be able to talk about the value of a program that lasted nearly seven years after he was part of it,"" the source said. ""Suffice it to say, there are varying accounts of the facts and circumstances surrounding the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah."" Soufan wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in April arguing that there ""was no actionable intelligence gained from using enhanced interrogation techniques on Abu Zubaydah that wasn't, or couldn't have been, gained from regular tactics."" He said that ""using these alternative methods on other terrorists backfired on more than a few occasions. ... The short-sightedness behind the use of these techniques ignored the unreliability of the methods, the nature of the threat, the mentality and modus operandi of the terrorists, and due process."" While at the FBI, Soufan was involved with investigations of sensitive international terrorism cases, including the East Africa bombings, the 2000 attack on the USS Cole and the September 11 attacks. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, opened the hearing by accusing Bush administration officials of lying about the use of techniques that had damaged the country's standing in the world.  Watch Whitehouse and Graham at the hearing » . ""The truth of our country's descent into torture is not precious. It is noxious. It is sordid,"" Whitehouse said. ""It has also been attended by a bodyguard of lies. ... President Bush told us America does not torture while authorizing conduct that America has prosecuted. ... Vice President Cheney agreed in an interview that waterboarding was like a dunk in the water, when it was used as a torture technique by tyrannical regimes from the Spanish Inquisition to Cambodia's killing fields.""

"Royce White faces an extraordinary challenge at the start of his rookie year with the Houston Rockets, before the season even begins. He is terrified to fly. ""It's a day-by-day struggle for me,"" he said. ""I'm very happy that I made it here, and that the Rockets gave me the chance that I have."" The 21-year-old forward speaks openly about his generalized anxiety disorder, and the demands of his new role as a professional basketball player. ""But at the same time, just knowing what I know about anxiety and mental health, there is a side of my mind that can't look away from the fact that I do think about it every day. I wake up (and think), 'Am I cut out for this?'"" He calls his career in the National Basketball Association a dream come true. But living that dream is a challenge for the first-round draft pick from Minneapolis, Minnesota. His anxiety manifests itself in his fear of flying, as well as in his obsessive-compulsive disorder. Both could jeopardize White's career in the NBA, with all of its rigors, and rewards. He missed the Rockets' training camp in McAllen, Texas, earlier this month, apparently because of his flying phobia. That flight would have been his first with his new NBA teammates on the team plane, according to White. He appreciates the comfort of first-class air travel. But that doesn't completely alleviate his fear: ""I'm definitely afraid of heights,"" he said. ""And I'm not really running from that."" TV stars, travel bloggers not immune to fear of flying . In a phone interview with CNN, he recounted the panic attacks he had at airports when he flew to basketball camps and skills academies during high school. White said that he has managed to fly several times since he was drafted earlier this year. And he plans to fulfill his obligations for the team. But when there's turbulence: ""I'm scared sh**less."" Once the NBA season kicks off later this month, players will need to crisscross the country for games, often several times in a week. The season holds more than 80 games, nearly triple the demands of a college basketball season. White was the star player at Iowa State University last season, both on and off the court. The 6-foot, 8-inch tall power forward led the Cyclones in scores and rebounds, not to mention in assists and steals. Basketball analyst Nate Ross points out that the transition from college star to NBA newcomer is tough for any rookie. ""They are going from playing 30 games a year to almost 100 games a year,"" he said. ""That's three times as many games against bigger, quicker players than they've ever seen in their lives."" Of course, the NBA compensation is also far more than a player would have seen in college. And a $1 million-plus contract brings its own set of surprises for White as he grapples with his OCD. ""I live in a bigger house than I'm used to,"" White said. ""So the toughest thing is going around and seeing that dust has collected in a room you don't use often. And then I've got to spend 30 minutes dusting that thing. That's a new one for me."" He is candid about his personal struggle with anxiety, which is playing out in a public arena. White said he is grateful to the Rockets for their support. ""They're being very open to helping me in any way that I need and giving me the support I need,"" he said. For their part, the Rockets won't comment specifically on White's condition. A team spokesperson released a statement from General Manager Daryl Morey, which said: ""We are committed to Royce's long-term success, and we will continue to support him now and going forward."" White speaks publicly about his anxiety, for which he takes medication but isn't currently in therapy, because he wants to boost awareness about mental illness. He uses Twitter to share his own stories and respond to people who reach out to him. ""I'm actually starting an entire campaign, raising awareness to mental illness and destigmatizing it,"" he said. He lent his star power to his community while he was playing college basketball in Iowa. He spoke to young fans at Orchard Place, a charity for children with mental health and behavioral disorders. He signed autographs for more than an hour, and told his audience of enraptured young fans that his condition parallels what some of the children there have. ""It was inspiring to them,"" said Nancy Bobo, vice president of development and marketing at the charity. White said his new team is encouraging when it comes to continuing his philanthropy work and spreading his message. His new role already looks like it will resonate beyond Houston.

"Tensions escalated in the South China Sea region this week after China, Vietnam and the Philippines were involved in a series of potentially explosive confrontations over disputed territory. Vietnamese officials say Chinese military and civilian ships have been intimidating their vessels near the Paracel Islands -- which are controlled by Beijing but claimed by Hanoi -- since Sunday, even accusing the Chinese of repeatedly ramming into them and shooting water cannons. But China blames Vietnam for forcefully disrupting drilling activities, and demand that it withdraw all vessels from the area, said  Yi Xianliang, Deputy Director-General of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs in a press briefing yesterday. Meanwhile, a Chinese fishing boat and its 11 crew members were apprehended on Tuesday by Philippine authorities near the Spratly Islands, another disputed region in the South China Sea. Philippine officials say the boat was carrying a large number of endangered species and they seized the boat ""to uphold Philippine sovereign rights"" in the disputed waters. ""It's possible that an armed clash could occur, but not a full-fledged war. The situation with Vietnam is serious -- more serious than the situation with the Philippines,"" said M. Taylor Fravel, Associate Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""China has controlled the northern half of the Paracel Islands since the 1950s and the southern half since 1974. Unlike the Spratly Islands, China maintains that no dispute exists over the Paracels. So we can see that China believes that its claim there is quite strong,"" he added. Exclusion zone . Relations between China and Vietnam soured on Friday, when a Chinese platform began drilling for oil near the Paracel Islands. The oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, is owned by state gas and oil company CNOOC. The Maritime Safety Administration of China (MSAC) declared a three-miles exclusion zone around the rig, while military vessels have been deployed to patrol the area. ""At present, the number of escorting ships of China has reached 60, including military ships,"" Tran Duy Hai, Vice Chair of Vietnam's National Boundary Commission, said in a statement Wednesday. ""These vessels have intentionally hit and collided with Vietnamese law enforcement ships, including those of the Maritime Police and Fisheries Control, causing damage in human and property."" (sic) China maintains that its current drilling activities are legitimate and blame the Vietnamese for provoking conflict. ""The drilling activities of this rig are within China's territorial waters. The harassment by the Vietnamese side is in violation of China's sovereign rights,"" said Hua Chunying, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She did not confirm the boat collisions. According to CNOOC, a third of China's oil and gas resources are under the South China Sea, most of which it claims as its own, refuting rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei. 'Undermines peace' In Washington, U.S. State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki condemned China's drilling near the Paracels. ""This unilateral action appears to be part of a broader pattern of Chinese behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region,"" said Psaki. China's Hua hit back saying that Chinese drilling activities ""have nothing to do with Vietnam, let alone the U.S."" Meanwhile, the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs said it will deal with the detained fishermen ""in a just, humane and expeditious manner."" Philippines police claimed the fishing boat was loaded with 350 endangered turtles when it was seized near an area it controls called Half Moon Shoal. China urged Manila to ""stop taking further provocative actions."" ""It is possible that the Philippines may have been emboldened by the recent defense agreement reached with the United States. China and the Philippines are jostling for control of the waters in the area where the arrest occurred,"" said MIT's Fravel. The arrests follow U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the Philippines earlier this week, kicking off the annual military drills held jointly by U.S. and Filipino forces. During the trip, the U.S. and Philippines signed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, a 10-year security pact that gives the U.S. more military access in the region.

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama said Tuesday it is disappointing that Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich ignored warnings from Senate Democrats about appointing a successor to his Senate seat. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, right, names Roland Burris to fill President-elect Barack Obama's Senate seat. On Tuesday, Blagojevich, a Democrat, named former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to serve the last two years of Obama's Senate term. Senate Democratic leaders have said they will block the appointment and are urging the governor to step down after his arrest on corruption charges -- a move Obama endorsed. ""Roland Burris is a good man and a fine public servant, but the Senate Democrats made it clear weeks ago that they cannot accept an appointment made by a governor who is accused of selling this very Senate seat,"" Obama said in a statement. ""I agree with their decision, and it is extremely disappointing that Gov. Blagojevich has chosen to ignore it."" FBI agents arrested Blagojevich on December 9 after federal prosecutors alleged, among other things, that he had tried to sell Obama's former Senate seat. Blagojevich denies wrongdoing and has ignored calls to resign.  Watch Blagojevich appoint Burris » . Obama added that the best resolution would be for Blagojevich to resign office and ""allow a lawful and appropriate process of succession to take place."" Burris, 71, also a Democrat, served Illinois from 1979 to 1992, first as state comptroller and later as attorney general. Earlier in December, he said that despite the scandal associated with the seat, he wanted the job.  Read more about Burris' personal and political life » . He also appeared to support Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan's efforts to remove Blagojevich from office, calling his alleged actions ""reprehensible."" ""I certainly applaud her actions,"" he said of Madigan in a December 13 press conference, according to WBBM. ""Illinois is too important to its 18 million citizens to have a chief executive who is now incapacitated. ""The evidence that's been presented is pretty appalling, should that come out to be the case of what our governor is attempting to do,"" he said, according to WBBM. After Blagojevich's announcement, Burris asked to be judged on his own merits. ""I have nothing to do with the governor's problems,"" he told CNN. ""I am not tainted by this appointment.""  Watch Burris defend himself on CNN's ""No Bias, No Bull"" » . Asked whether he thinks Blagojevich should resign, Burris said he has ""no opinion on the governor's problems."" In a statement released Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, urged Blagojevich to not make this appointment. ""The governor must put the interests of the people of Illinois and all Americans first by stepping aside now and letting his successor appoint someone who we will seat,"" Reid said. Also, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White said Tuesday that Burris' appointment will not be certified by his office. But Blagojevich said at a news conference Tuesday that he is confident the U.S. Senate will seat his appointment and asked the media not to visit any of his political troubles on Burris.  Watch Anderson Cooper and his panel discuss the appointment » . ""This is about Roland Burris, not about the man who appoints him,"" he said after announcing his choice. ""Please don't let the allegations against me taint this good and honest man."" Burris does not have to be formally approved by the Senate. But if there is a question about the appointment, the Senate could reject the appointment and immediately vacate the seat, or vote to seat the senator pending an investigation by the Rules Committee or another body, associate Senate Historian Don Ritchie said. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, who appeared at the afternoon news conference, warned senators about blocking Burris from being seated. ""There are no African-Americans in the U.S. Senate. And I don't think any U.S. senator who's sitting in the Senate right now wants to go on record to deny one African-American from being seated in the U.S. Senate,"" he said. ""I would ask you to not hang or lynch the appointee as you try to castigate the appointer and separate the appointee from the appointer,"" Rush said.""  Watch Rush comment on the appointment » . Rush said he will take that argument to the Congressional Black Caucus as well as U.S. senators -- including Dick Durbin, a Democrat and Illinois' senior senator. Burris downplayed the importance of race in his appointment. ""I think that certainly is not a major issue,"" Burris said regarding race. ""Why those persons will not seat me is a question that they're going to have to answer, because I have done no wrong."" Many in the Senate maintained that concerns over the appointment had nothing to do with race or Burris' qualifications. ""The problem is the appointer, not the appointee,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, said Tuesday. ""The governor in this act of defiance is doing more harm than good."" Burris, a principal at Burris & Lebed Consulting in Chicago, would serve the remaining two years of Obama's Senate term. Burris previously ran and lost bids for the U.S. Senate and governor, losing the gubernatorial nomination once to Blagojevich. Also Tuesday, Burris responded to questions about Blagojevich's legal troubles.  Watch Burris accept the Senate appointment » . ""I have no comment on what the governor's circumstance is,"" he said. ""As a former attorney general of the state, I know ... that in this legal process, you're innocent until you're proven guilty."" Despite the pressure for him to step aside, Blagojevich said he was required by law to fill the Senate seat. ""The people of Illinois are entitled to have two United States senators represent them in Washington, D.C. As governor, I am required to make this appointment. If I don't make this appointment, then the people of Illinois will be deprived of their appropriate voice and vote in the United States Senate,"" he said. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said ""no comment"" when asked for reaction to the Burris announcement. Although Blagojevich, 52, has not commented publicly on the charges, his lawyer Ed Genson said the governor has done nothing wrong and does not intend to step down. It is the sole authority of the Illinois governor to name a successor to serve the remaining two years of Obama's term.

"Where are two of the fall season's best new shows? It turns out, they're on The CW. Between last week's debut of ""The Flash"" and Monday's arrival of ""Jane the Virgin,"" the younger-skewing network is batting 1.000. Critics have reacted positively to ""The Flash,"" a spinoff of ""Arrow"" and an origin story of the lightning fast superhero, as well as to ""Jane the Virgin,"" an adaptation of a Venezuelan program. ""The Flash"": What's the verdict? ""Jane"" stars Gina Rodriguez as 23-year-old Jane Villanueva, the daughter of a young single mother who has taken her grandmother's advice to preserve her virginity to heart. But when Jane accidentally gets pregnant during a doctor's visit -- it was accidental artificial insemination, to be exact -- Jane's life starts to look something like the telenovelas she watches with her mother and grandmother. The plot hinges on a twist that's soapy even by The CW's standards, but critics say ""Jane the Virgin"" works, and primarily because of star Rodriguez. The Los Angeles Times' Robert Lloyd has praised ""Jane"" as ""one of the best things to come out of the fall season,"" and ""The Wrap"" agreed that the freshman series is one of this fall's ""best new offerings."" ""(T)hanks to star Gina Rodriguez, who makes the lead character believable and likable, the journey to Jane's choice (about the pregnancy) and the inevitable consequences that follow make 'Jane the Virgin' highly entertaining and compelling television,"" The Wrap says in its review. The plot may seem overwhelming, ""but 'Jane' approaches the melodrama with a sly wink, and Rodriguez grounds it with a warmly genuine performance as Jane, whose relationship with her mother (Andrea Navedo) is already primed to be one of the show's best features,"" Entertainment Weekly said. ""Where the series could get preachy, it's tempered, and above all, the whole thing's just a lot of fun."" Ratings for The CW's two new shows have been strong, too, as ""The Flash"" became The CW's highest-rated and most-watched premiere in five years when it bowed on October 7. ""Jane"" didn't come close to ""The Flash's"" 4.8 million watching when it premiered Monday, but it also held its own against its competitors at 9 p.m. ET with an audience of 1.6 million and a rating of 0.6 in the adult demo of 18-49. That gives ""Jane"" the bragging rights of drawing The CW's biggest audience at 9 p.m. on Mondays in more than two years.","The CW's two new fall shows are getting strong buzz .

Pamela and Matthew Menz, along with their adult children Justin and Jennifer, were traveling northbound along Interstate 75 early Wednesday morning, when their 2001 Toyota Sienna plowed into the back of the semi. ""The truck driver had no idea they were back there,"" Roscommon County Undersheriff Ed Stern said. Matthew Menz, who is a truck driver himself, told the 911 dispatcher the truck was in the middle of the road, ""going about 2 miles an hour,"" without flashing hazard lights. There was ""no warning whatsoever,"" Matthew Menz told the 911 dispatcher, ''I'm just blown away at how slow the truck was going."" The impact shut down the Menzes' vehicle, disabling the heater and preventing the family from sounding the horn. A shattered windshield, along with near-whiteout snow conditions, prevented Pamela and Matthew Menz from giving the dispatcher a clear description of the semi or their location. The vehicles were later intercepted by deputies from the Crawford County Sheriff's Office, an entirely different county from where the incident began, according to a police press release. Justin Menz, 26, flew forward in his seat when the van hit the semi, causing minor injuries.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama unveiled his administration's blueprint for a new national network of high-speed passenger rail lines Thursday, saying such an investment is necessary to reduce traffic congestion, cut dependence on foreign oil and improve the environment. President Obama, with Vice President Joe Biden, called for clean efficient travel Thursday. The president's plan identifies 10 potential high-speed intercity corridors for federal funding, including California, the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and New England. It also highlights potential improvements in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor running from Washington to Boston, Massachusetts. Each of the corridors identified by the president's report are between 100 and 600 miles long. The blueprint envisions some trains traveling at top speeds of over 150 mph. Federal grants would also be directed toward separate individual rail projects that are deemed ""ready to go,"" with preliminary engineering and environmental work already completed.  Watch Obama talk about rail projects » . ""My high-speed rail proposal will lead to innovations that change the way we travel in America. We must start developing clean, energy-efficient transportation that will define our regions for centuries to come,"" Obama said at an event near the White House. The president cited the success of high-speed rail in European countries such as France and Spain as a positive example for the United States. His plan would be funded in part through the recently passed $787 billion stimulus plan, which includes a total of $8 billion for improvements in rail service. Obama has also proposed a separate five-year, $5 billion investment in high-speed rail as part of the administration's suggested fiscal year 2010 budget. ""We're going to make travel in this country leaner and a whole lot cleaner,"" said Vice President Joe Biden, speaking before Obama. The president spoke one day after the governors of eight Midwestern states sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood requesting stimulus funds for the construction of a regional network of faster passenger rail lines. The city of Chicago, Illinois, would be the hub of the proposed Midwest Regional Rail System, which would stretch to Madison, Wisconsin, in the Northwest; St. Louis, Missouri, in the South; and Detroit, Michigan, in the East. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama pledged to support a national network of faster passenger trains. The administration has already dedicated $1.3 billion in federal funding for Amtrak. The money for the rail service, which carried almost 29 million passengers last year, will go primarily to infrastructure repair and improvement.","He says it's needed to to unclog traffic, cut oil dependence, improve environment .

"(CNN)It was a tough decision for any space junkie. Comet sleuth Terry Lovejoy had just pinged me on Facebook Messenger answering my request for an interview. Then, my amateur astronomer husband, Jim Ribble, opened the garage door to shout that he had spotted Comet Lovejoy with his telescope from our driveway. So -- do I chat with the man who found a new comet late last year, or do I go outside to see the comet? If you're a space rock lover, you know the answer. I told Mr. Lovejoy I would email him my questions and dashed outside. The comet has Terry Lovejoy's name because he was the first person on Earth to spot it, an increasingly difficult accomplishment since he's competing with professional observatories. It's the fifth comet that he's discovered, but he denies having a secret formula for finding them. ""There is no real secret,""Lovejoy says. ""My job in IT (information technology) has helped me a lot with automation of the telescope and the actual detection of new comets."" The latest Comet Lovejoy was found on August 17, 2014, from Lovejoy's home in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The comet was closest to Earth on January 7, but you may get a better view as the full moon wanes. If you live far enough away from the glare of city lights, you might be able to spot it with the naked eye. I was able to see it from my house north of Atlanta with binoculars and through my husband's telescope. It looked like a faint, fuzzy, greenish cloud. Why bother braving the cold to see a green blur? For some, it's seeing something that's new to our sky. For Lovejoy, it's the excitement of the hunt and then the mystery of what the comet will do. ""It is very exciting from the point of view, not just from the point of finding a named object, but from the point of view the time spent developing the comet searching system has paid off,"" Lovejoy said. ""There is also excitement around what the comet might do, so there is a couple of days before it is possible to determine the future path of a comet which has a large bearing on how close it will get to us and how bright it might get."" If you want to to look for it, here are some tips from the comet man himself: . -- A number of the major astronomy magazines are covering the comet and have tips for finding it. -- You should be mindful that some of the spectacular photographs of the comet were taken with very specialized equipment from remote dark locations and are not representative of what you will actually see . -- It is more important to understand what you are looking at, rather than how it looks, that makes the comet interesting to view . -- One interesting observation is to note how the comet changes position over a period of, say, 30 minutes .

"Washington (CNN)Two anti-war protesters -- one of them an 83-year-old woman -- were arrested Saturday outside the home of former Vice President Dick Cheney in suburban Washington, police said. The two were part of about 20 activists affiliated with the anti-war groups Code Pink and Witness Against Torture, demonstrating Saturday morning at various locations on a ""torturers tour."" The protesters were inside Cheney's fenced property in McLean, Virginia, when police arrived, ""and the homeowners said they were not allowed to be there,"" said Fairfax County police spokesman Roger Henriquez. He did not know whether Cheney was home at the time. ""Police asked them to leave or face trespassing charges,"" Henriquez said. ""Two refused to leave the premises."" Tighe Barry, 57, and Eve Tetaz, 83, were arrested, according to Code Pink and Henriquez. They were processed within an hour, and released pending a court date. Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin disputed the police account, telling CNN, ""The police asked us to move to the street, so we did. And they arbitrarily arrested two of us."" The group's national coordinator, Ali McCracken, said protesters met earlier in the morning outside the home of CIA Director John Brennan, who also lives in McLean. She said police ""encircled"" Brennan's house, but made no arrests. They then went to the CIA headquarters nearby and protested there before then heading to Cheney's house, all part of what McCracken called a ""torturers tour."" McCracken said the group is calling for closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the prison's opening. ""It's ironic and ridiculous that while the men responsible for torture are out running free and profiting from years of failed wars -- Dick Cheney has profited grossly off the Iraq War -- police were out arresting peaceful protesters who are calling for a new foreign policy based on diplomacy and compassion, "" McCracken said. An exhaustive report released last month by the Senate Intelligence Committee found the CIA tortured suspected terrorists in a brutal and mismanaged program that produced little valuable intelligence. The George W. Bush administration deployed the tactics after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Cheney called the report ""deeply flawed,"" a ""terrible piece of work"" and ""full of crap."" He stood by his support of the extreme interrogation techniques used by the CIA on detainees in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks saying, ""I would do it again in a minute.""","Protesters from two anti-war groups were on what the groups called a ""torturers tour""

"The death threats, Mary Willingham expected. More shocking is that the University of North Carolina is now disavowing her research as a whistle-blower -- research that showed between 8% and 10% of the school's football and basketball players are reading below a third-grade level. UNC issued a statement Wednesday night saying it did not believe Willingham's account of a basketball player who could not read or write. It went on: ""University officials can't comment on the other statistical claims mentioned in the story because they have not seen that data. University officials have asked for that data, but those requests have not been met."" As well as questioning UNC many times about the story before publication, CNN has also detailed Willingham's research. And purported e-mail exchanges obtained by CNN since August show that Willingham did share her findings at least twice -- once with Executive Vice Provost James W. Dean Jr., and once with a member of a university committee on academics and athletics. In addition, Willingham says her research on the students in the athletics programs that make money for the university was done based on screenings that the university itself paid for. And, she says, she has gotten permission from the university several times since 2008 to access those findings to continue her research. ""It's already available to them,"" Willingham said. ""It's in their system. ... They have all the data and more. It belongs to them, and they paid a lot of money for it."" Women who blew whistle and what happened next . Last year, when CNN asked UNC for comment on Willingham's research, officials initially denied knowing about it, and said: ""Such analysis is not part of her job duties at the university."" Then, after being shown the e-mails, a spokesperson admitted that Willingham did share her findings and did have permission from the university to do the research in the first place, and said a meeting with Willingham was being scheduled. Apart from Wednesday's statement, UNC has not responded to CNN's request for an explanation. In the meantime, Willingham said she has heard from one branch of the university -- the Department of Public Safety. Since CNN's report, Willingham said she's gotten four death threats, and more than 30 other alarming messages. ""Not people who disagree, people who put in the subject or body (of the e-mail) straight-up hate speech,"" she said. But there have also been notes of support from several other academic advisers around the country, Willingham says, and they make it worth the trouble. ""I've been getting more and more nice notes from high school teachers and literacy specialists across the country saying 'Thank you.'""

"(CNN)The hunt is on for Hayat Boumeddiene, the 26-year-old woman wanted over Thursday's fatal shooting of a French policewoman. Early reports suggested she might have escaped Friday from a kosher grocery store in eastern Paris as French authorities mounted a rescue operation to free hostages being held there by Amedy Coulibaly, believed to be her boyfriend. However, CNN reports that no witness has publicly said the woman was actually at the scene of the siege, and now sources are saying she left France before the attack on the policewoman. Boumeddiene is believed to have left France for Turkey around January 2 with the final destination of Syria, according to French and Turkish sources. Regardless, photographs of Boumeddiene published by Le Monde show her shooting what appears to be a crossbow in an all-enveloping black niqab. At first glance, this might appear puzzling. After all, jihadist militant organizations support Taliban-style rule, which allows women only a role at home. However, we have seen a number of women from the West, including American citizens, taking an operational role in jihadist terrorist plots, including Colleen LaRose, a Caucasian-American 46-year-old from Pennsylvania, known as ""Jihad Jane,"" who traveled to Europe in 2009 to scope out an attack on Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who had drawn a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed's head on the body of a dog. European women have also played an operational role in jihadist terrorism. Muriel Degauque, a 38-year-old Belgian woman, died when she committed a suicide bombing in Iraq in 2005. And on May 14, 2010, Roshonara Choudhry, a 21-year-old British woman, stabbed Stephen Timms, her local member of Parliament, for his vote in support of the Iraq War. Timms survived the attack. And there is also 31-year-old British citizen Samantha Lewthwaite, who is, according to Interpol, ""wanted by Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to December 2011."" The Kenyans believe she was part of a terrorist cell that was planning to carry out an attack in Kenya. Lewthwaite is the widow of one of the suicide attackers who set off bombs on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005, killing 52 commuters. All this underscores that the phenomenon of females joining the jihad has become far more common in the past four years, fueled by the Syrian war, which is drawing an unprecedented number of foreign militants from around the globe, including from the West. According to data collected by New America, based on media reports and court documents, of the 455 individuals who have been publicly identified from around the world who have traveled or were arrested while attempting to travel to Syria to fight with a terrorist organization, 36 were women from the West. That's 8%. And their average age is, astonishingly, only 18 years. They hail from countries from around the West: Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Britain and the United States. And in many cases, these Western women are often going to Syria with the fantasy that there they will be able to marry the jihadist militant of their dreams. Several of these aspiring jihadist brides are Americans. In October, three teenage girls from Colorado were intercepted at Frankfurt Airport in Germany as they were trying to make their way to Syria to join ISIS. Their parents tipped off the FBI when they went missing. Another Colorado resident, 19-year-old Shannon Maureen Conley, was arrested at Denver International Airport before she departed on her journey to join an ISIS camp near the Turkish-Syrian border. She planned to marry a member of ISIS whom she had met online. She pleaded guilty in September. Another girl, the 17-year-old sister of Chicago-based Mohammed Hamzah Khan, was allegedly planning to travel with her brother to Turkey and from there to join ISIS. She and her brother were arrested at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in October. Khan faces up to 15 years in prison for trying to provide ""material support"" in the shape of his own services to ISIS, while his sister, who is not being named by the government, is a minor and likely won't be charged. Finally, there's Nicole Mansfield, a Michigan resident who left her 18-year-old daughter behind to join rebel forces in Syria. She died in May 2013 fighting, reportedly, with one of the many jihadist militant groups fighting there. It's a strange kind of jihadist female equal opportunity: You too can be part of the holy war that seeks to install a Taliban-style utopia that will ensure you can never have a job or get an education.","Peter Bergen: Search for Hayat Boumedienne highlights issue of female jihadists .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal landed a record extending ninth French Open title this year and also reached the final of the Australian Open. But typical for the Spaniard in recent campaigns, those grand slam accomplishments mingled with further health woes. Looking back on his 2014, it's no wonder, then, that Nadal utters: ""Too many things (happened) to be happy during"" the whole year. ""That's part of my life, though. It's happened a few times in my career."" Indeed. And in keeping with Nadal's approach during his recovery from an avalanche of afflictions in the past, he vows to ""keep working hard."" ""Now I have a month to prepare for the 2015 season, and that's my goal,"" the 28-year-old told CNN's Open Court in late November shortly before the groundbreaking ceremony of the Rafa Nadal Sports Center and Academy. ""I'm going to work as much as I can, hope to be healthy for that. If I am healthy, I am confident that I can come back strong again."" Jimmy Arias, a former top-five player who made the semifinals at the U.S. Open and quarterfinals at Nadal's beloved French Open in the 1980s, isn't about to disagree. ""Ever since he came onto the tour, he had all the markings of a guy that would be done with tennis by 26, 27, because his game was such a grind mentally and physically,"" Arias, now a tennis analyst for several networks, told CNN.com. ""He's obviously outlasted that age. He's made of sterner stuff than most of us because he's able to keep coming back from injuries and long layoffs and continues to dominate. ""Now, you get the sense that he's going to be as always -- if he's physically fit. If Nadal's body might be giving him a few problems, his mind remains as strong as ever. It's his psychological strength that sets him apart from the rest, according to Arias. ""I would say he's the greatest mental player in the history of the sport. Not strategy, necessarily, but the ability to play every point as if that's the most important one you've ever played, and do it every match."" Nadal is a veteran at coming back, having been slowed by, most notably, injuries to both knees. However, this year saw the 14-time grand slam champion miss a chunk of time due to a back problem, wrist complaint and appendix surgery, in that order. It all began at the Australian Open in January, when Nadal hurt his back while warming up in the final against Stan Wawrinka. Holding a 12-0 record without conceding a set to the Swiss heading into the contest, a hampered Nadal fell in four sets with the ordeal leaving him in tears. Recently he has undergone stem-cell treatment to aid his back after the same therapy, he said, helped his problematic, famous knees. The back bothered Nadal, he added, throughout 2014. ""I repeated the treatment that worked very well for my knees at the end of last year, so I am doing that for my back now and I hope I have a good success on that,"" he said. When the wrist sidelined Nadal at the U.S. Open, it ensured another year he skipped a major -- the last time he contested all four in a season came in 2011. Contrast his attendance with Roger Federer -- the only man ahead of Nadal on the grand slam ladder with 17 titles. The smooth Federer has appeared in 60 consecutive grand slams, a men's record. Nadal subsequently underwent appendix surgery in early November, ruling him out of the prestigious year-end championships in London. ""I started this year believing that I was ready for everything again,"" said Nadal, looking back to the start of 2014. ""I started well, playing the final in Australia, but during the final I injured my back. It was hard for me to accept that I didn't have the chance to compete in the final,"" he added, referring to his defeat by Wawrinka in the opening slam of the season. ""Then I went down for a while. Takes a little bit of time to recover from that mentally and physically. I was coming back to my best again ... playing better and better every single week and arriving in Roland Garros with a great level. ""Then I won there and I was fully confident again. It was the most beautiful part of the year for me."" Wimbledon's grass hasn't been as pleasant for Nadal since he nabbed the last of his two titles in 2010. Hindered by his knees in 2012 and 2013, he was on the receiving end of two of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history, exiting to Lukas Rosol and Steve Darcis, respectively. In the most recent edition, Nadal succumbed to fearless young Australian Nick Kyrgios, who seemingly could do no wrong on his serve in the fourth-round tussle. Kyrgios struck 37 aces and was broken once. There was, though, a positive for Nadal. ""I felt the knees were more comfortable playing there,"" he said. ""That's important for me. ""I loved that match, but I couldn't win that match. That can happen on grass but I was proud the way that I played this year."" Next year Nadal's chances at Wimbledon should increase, since an extra week features between the French Open and the year's third grand slam. Nadal isn't thinking yet about winning a 10th French Open or triumphing at Wimbledon, more preoccupied with being ready -- and competitive -- for the Australian Open next month. Nadal won the Australian Open in 2009, but lately his memories of Oz presumably haven't been as upbeat. Aside from his back issue versus Wawrinka, he retired in 2010, injured his hamstring in 2011 as he sought a fourth straight grand slam title -- or the 'Rafa Slam' -- and lost the longest grand slam final in history in 2012 to Novak Djokovic. ""My main goal today is try to put my body and my tennis again in a competitive way,"" said Nadal. ""That's what I'm going to try to do during this December. I am thinking I am (focused) about Australia because I like a lot of years in Australia, and I felt that I was doing the right things there so many years during my career. ""I have a special motivation for that.""","This year was bittersweet for Rafael Nadal, who won another major but suffered more injuries .

"(CNN)A young Muslim man is being hailed as a hero in French newspapers and social media for his actions during Friday's deadly hostage situation in a Paris supermarket. Lassana Bathily, an employee at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in Vincennes, helped guide a group of hostages into a downstairs walk-in freezer while gunman Amedy Coulibaly was allegedly preparing to kill them, according to French television station, BFMTV. Bathily, a ""practicing Muslim,"" says he entered the freezer with some people, then switched off the freezer and the light and told everyone to stay calm, according to BFMTV. ""I'm the one (who) is going to go out,"" he reportedly told them. ""I took the elevator and went upstairs."" ""[Coulibaly] asked us to all come upstairs, otherwise he would kill everyone who was downstairs,"" Bathily, 24, said to BFMTV. He exited a freight elevator and ran outside. Bathily, originally from Mali, was apprehended by police, but helped them by describing the location of the freezer. ""When [the hostages] came out, they congratulated me,"" Bathily told BFMTV. The exact number of hostages who remained safe in the freezer is unknown, according to French newspaper L'Express. Coulibaly was killed in the ensuing shootout with police. Authorities said Coulibaly killed four Jewish hostages. Rudi Hadad, among those in the freezer, said that a few others went back upstairs during the incident. Praise was heaped on Bathily via Facebook. Gwadelle Edom said, ""Lass, I have no words to express my pride in you. You put your life in danger to save others. God saw all of it, and his mercy will be without fault. You are blessed in the eyes of humanity."" A man who claims to be Bathily's cousin, Abdoul Bathily, posted, ""Bravo to my cousin, Lass Bathily, you showed courage yesterday, the rest of the world would not have done it.""

"(CNN)""Would you tell a joke mocking the Prophet Mohammed?"" Being a comedian who is Muslim, I can't tell you how many times I've been asked that question over the years.  And in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Paris, I am again being asked it over and over. My answer before the attack was that I have never told jokes mocking the Prophet Mohammed, nor have I told jokes mocking Jesus, Moses or any other religious figures.  And now after the attack, I'm certainly not going to go out of my way to write jokes about those subjects. I refuse to alter my freedom of expression because of terrorists. Yet some -- mostly on the right -- have insisted to me, via social media, that I must now do jokes mocking the Prophet Mohammed. They frame it—bizarrely-- as a litmus test for my patriotism to America or my support for freedom of expression. Just so it's clear, as a writer, comedian and Muslim-American, I strongly believe that all the cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad should be published, uncensored by media outlets. (In fact, I have organized a comedy benefit in New York for next week in defense of freedom of expression that will features mostly, but not all, Muslim comedians.) But what jokes are acceptable to show should be the choice of every media outlet, just as it's the choice of every comedian to decide which jokes he or she wants to tell. Freedom of expression encompasses both the choice to say what you want and to refrain from saying things you don't want to. So why won't I tell jokes about religious figures?  It has nothing to do with religious beliefs.  The reason, simply put, is that my comedy focuses on mocking the people in power; the ones who are committing the bad acts or holding elected office (and often those two are the same.)  The Prophet Mohammed died nearly 1,500 years ago.  He isn't doing anything.  ISIS, al Qaeda and the like are, so they are the ones I will continue to mock. This is the same reasoning that guided me and my co-director, Negin Farsad, in our choices for the 2012 comedy documentary ""The Muslims Are Coming!""  The film, which uses humor to counter misconceptions about Muslims, also comically mocks the anti-Muslim bigots. But even though some of these haters were self-proclaimed Christian leaders, like the Rev. Pat Robertson and the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer, we didn't mock Jesus for their actions. No, we went after the people spewing the hate. Still I was curious as to how my fellow comedians, especially the Muslim ones, would respond to the Paris attack.  Would it change their comedy in any way? Would it make them more defiant in their content choices? Would any be more hesitant to do certain jokes? So I asked about 20 comedians, via social media and email, about the Paris attack. Regardless of whether they were Muslims living in Cairo or atheists living in New York, the comics' responses were consistent: They denounced the Paris attack and stood up for freedom of expression. That was true even for some of the Muslim comedians, who acknowledged that they could understand why the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed could offend people. But none of the Muslim comedians said they were personally offended. (Generally, it takes a lot to offend a comedian!) Dubai comedian Ali Al Sayed explained by email that there are limits on comedy content in much (but not all) of the Middle East when it comes to jokes about religion, sex and politics. Some of the restrictions are based on laws, while others are imposed by comedy show producers in the hopes of not offending audience members (it's bad for business).   Of the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo, Sayed wrote, ""this 'gangsta Muslim' response needs to stop, it has no place in our religion and is no way justified by the Quran."" Maysoon Zayid, one of the best-known Muslim-American comedians, has pushed the envelope over the years. Zayid explained via email that she has told jokes that mentioned the Prophet Mohammed in the past and would do so in the future. ""I will not let extremists scare me silent,"" she said. Interestingly, Egypt's Rami Boraie did acknowledge that the Paris terror attack would change his comedy. But not as you might predict.  Boraie noted via Facebook that he's more motivated now than ever to become better known as a comedian so he can use his fame and comedy to ""reclaim Islam from these radicals."" This sentiment — taking back Islam from groups like ISIS through comedy -- has been gaining for months in the Middle East. Muslim comedians across the region have been risking their lives to ridicule ISIS in TV shows and YouTube videos. They have, in effect, called out ISIS for being the ""un-Islamic"" state. But as New York based comedian Joe DeRosa (not a Muslim) mentioned, telling jokes about any religious figure, not just Mohammed, can be challenging: ""I've been physically threatened for telling Jesus jokes. ... Am I a coward if I don't joke about certain things that could cause a dangerous reaction? Or am I smart? I honestly don't know."" There's no right answer to this thoughtful question. To me it sums up the essence of free speech.  It's a choice that each person should be free to make. We must defend both those who are making statements that offend and those who choose not to do so.","Dean Obeidallah: Some challenge him to tell anti-Muslim jokes in defiance of terrorists .

"(CNN)A woman who alleges she was gang-raped by three University of Oregon men's basketball players in March has filed a Title IX lawsuit against the university and head men's basketball coach Dana Altman. The civil suit was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon. According to the suit, the woman, a university student, alleges that three Oregon men's basketball players cornered her in a bathroom in March and gang-raped her multiple times. Prosecutors did not file charges against the men, citing insufficient evidence. The lawsuit says that Altman knew one of his players, Brandon Austin, had a history of prior sexual misconduct allegations at another school but that Altman recruited him to play for the Ducks anyway. Austin and two of his Ducks' teammates were dismissed from the team in May. The teammates are not mentioned by name in the lawsuit. The lawsuit also alleges that Oregon took no action until May, when it initiated procedures against Austin and his two teammates. Title IX requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault, even if criminal charges are never filed. ""This is a very important case that needs to be litigated,"" said John Clune, an attorney for the woman. ""It is time for athletic departments to stop trading the safety of women on campus for points on a scoreboard. The University of Oregon community deserves better, and we hope this case will help in that effort."" In an email to campus Thursday that also posted online, University of Oregon interim President Scott Coltrane acknowledged the lawsuit and said the filing is not unexpected. ""The university disagrees with the allegations against it and believes that it acted in accordance with the law, including Title IX,"" Coltrane said. ""This litigation in no way undermines the university's ongoing commitment to support the [student who says she was raped] inside and outside of the classroom."" CNN's attempts to reach Altman, Austin's attorney and representatives from his current school have been unsuccessful. In November 2013, before the start of his freshman season at Providence College, Austin and another player were suspended from the basketball team indefinitely over allegations of a reported gang-rape of another Providence student.  He ultimately was suspended for the season. Austin sought to transfer to resume his basketball career, going to Oregon. Prosecutors declined to press charges in the case. At the time, the Daily Emerald, student newspaper of the University of Oregon, reported that Laura Fine Moro, Austin's attorney, said the lack of charges exonerated her client. ""The accusers are cloaked in anonymity while the accused are plastered across the Internet. Even though my client is exonerated in the eyes of the law, justice was not served,"" she said, the newspaper reported. According to the lawsuit, Altman and other Oregon personnel knew about Austin's background and basis for his seasonlong suspension. ""UO and Altman did not notify the UO students and community that UO and Altman had knowingly brought a reported sex offender to the UO campus in Eugene,"" the lawsuit says. The three Oregon players were dismissed from the team in May and were suspended from the university for four to 10 years. Austin found a new team and is playing at Northwest Florida State College. He has started every game this season so far, and he is averaging 15.9 points per game. The filing of the lawsuit comes days before the Oregon football team will face Ohio State in the national championship game on Monday. It's also the second Title IX lawsuit filed against a university this week. On Wednesday, a woman who accused Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston of raping her in 2012 filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court in Orlando against the university, alleging the school violated her rights under Title IX. Winston has said the two had consensual sex. Prosecutors declined to press charges and a university investigation found he did not violate the school's code of student conduct.","Student files Title IX lawsuit against University of Oregon, head men's basketball coach Dana Altman .

"Robert Plant has reportedly thrown a wrench in another ""Celebration Day"" for Led Zeppelin fans -- though his publicist said the report was ""rubbish."" According to a report in the UK Daily Mirror, the Zeppelin lead singer turned down a £500 million ($800 million) contract for a Led Zeppelin reunion. The other members of the band -- Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones -- were all in, a source told the paper. Jason Bonham, son of the band's late drummer John Bonham, would have taken a fee. However, Plant's publicist told the UK Guardian that the Mirror report was ""rubbish."" The offer to re-form the band was reportedly made by Virgin chairman Richard Branson, a fan of the group, and would have set up dates in three locales: London, Berlin and New Jersey. ""Jimmy, John and Jason signed up immediately,"" the source told the paper. ""It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him."" Branson would have flown the group around in one of his jets and offered the group the opportunity to do more gigs if they so desired. ""He is gutted,"" the source said. Led Zeppelin, one of the most influential groups of all time, broke up in 1980 following Bonham's death, but reunited for four occasions, most recently a show at London's O2 Arena in honor of Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun, who signed the band in 1968. Plant is currently touring with another band, the Sensational Shape Shifters, behind his new solo album, ""Lullaby and ... the Ceaseless Roar."" He has been skeptical of all the attention Zeppelin inevitably gets, as it has this year with the re-release of its first five albums. ""This propagation of myths and anti-myths will continue forever,"" he told Rolling Stone.

"For years now, companies have been combing through Twitter postings, trying to glean any information that may help them improve their products and services. But with more than 250 million tweets sent every day, it would take an enormous staff to analyze the data. That task gave rise to hundreds of social media-monitoring companies, but they were still limited to the tweets that could be accessed by individual users. Twitter, however, has decided to make it easier for these companies to mine billions of messages for valuable marketing data. The company will open its archives and sell its old tweets. One of Twitter's new customers, DataSift, has formed an alliance with the social network to get access to tweets going back to January 2010. ""Twitter has really become an incredibly valuable information source,"" said Rob Bailey, DataSift's CEO. ""There are a flood of companies wanting to get more use from it."" Starting next month, DataSift will launch a cloud-based service that will allow other companies to analyze these two-plus years of tweets to learn more about their customers. According to its website, DataSift promises customers will be able to ""unlock trends from public tweets"" and ""access the full Twitter firehose."" Users will pay DataSift for only the data it retrieves. DataSift will then share part of the revenue with Twitter. The company emphasizes it won't have access to deleted tweets or users' direct messages. Twitter also has partnered with Gnip, a Colorado-based online data-mining company, to license its historical tweets. Because Twitter is a public forum, privacy watchdogs may face difficulties raising objections. ""We welcome the privacy debate,"" said Bailey, who is based in San Francisco.

"Washington (CNN)Cybersecurity and Internet access will be themes in the coming week as President Barack Obama highlights the agenda he will be emphasizing in his State of the Union address. Obama will meet with congressional leaders from both parties Tuesday to ""discuss a wide range of issues including places where he hopes we can work together to grow the economy and protect our national security,"" a White House official told CNN. This comes just after the House of Representatives voted to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, but its fate is uncertain in the Senate. The White House has promised a veto of that measure if it reaches the President's desk. On Monday, the President will visit the Federal Trade Commission, where he will lay out proposals and executive action on identity theft, Internet privacy and technology in schools, the official said. Next week, Obama will speak about the government's efforts to work with the private sector on cybersecurity and will travel to Iowa, where he will focus on increasing access to high-speed broadband across the country. This is all part of a new tactic by the White House to build support for its initiatives before the annual January 20 address. Ordinarily, presidents have held these types of events after the speech. In the past week, the President visited Michigan, Arizona and Tennessee, where he announced proposals focused on the economy and helping the middle class -- highlighting a strengthened auto industry, policies aimed at making homes more affordable, and a plan to make community college free for most students. But Republicans -- such as Sens. Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, who accompanied the President on his trip Friday to their home state of Tennessee -- have already voiced some skepticism. Asked whether he would support Obama's community college proposal, Corker said ""Oh no, no, no, no, no,"" instead urging other states to do something similar to the President's initiative rather than create ""a whole new bureaucratic federal program.""","At FTC, Obama will lay out proposals and executive action on identity theft, Internet privacy and technology in schools .

"The Obama administration, after initially resisting the idea, is weighing whether to deploy National Guard troops to the southern border to help address a surge of migrant youth from Central America, many of them unaccompanied, a White House official told CNN. The Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services sent a team earlier this week to assess Border Patrol efforts in the Rio Grande Valley, the official said, where tens of thousands of children have poured into the United States this year. The administration's latest efforts in what most agree is a humanitarian crisis come as Washington struggles to address the matter with little optimism for a solution before Congress breaks for its month-long August recess. Immigrants or refugees? Here's the latest: . Little optimism for a solution from Congress: House Speaker John Boehner accuses President Barack Obama of being ""AWOL"" on the crisis and flip-flopping on solutions. A key partisan point of contention is a Republican proposal to change a 2008 law that allows Central American immigrant children to stay in the United States until they receive a hearing. That process can take months or years. Republicans want to tweak the Bush-era law so that migrant youth from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, who do not qualify for refugee status, are sent home more quickly. Democrats worry the expedited process will mean many will fall through the cracks and will be sent back to what many have characterized as violent situations in their countries. ""The administration started earlier this month by signaling some openness to changes in the 2008 law to accelerate the process of returning these children to their home countries,"" Boehner told reporters on Thursday. ""The President called for this change, the secretary of homeland security called for this change, and other administration officials have called for this change. Now the President and his team have apparently flip-flopped."" House Republicans proposed a $1.5 billion package on Wednesday aimed at helping to resolve the crisis. The tally is nearly $1 billion less than that proposed in a measure by Senate Democrats just a day before and less than half of the $3.7 billion Obama has said he needs to effectively combat the problem. However, top congressional leaders from both parties say they doubt Congress will act before beginning its recess. Time to do something is also short when they get back in September due to the upcoming midterm elections in November. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and members from the Texas congressional delegation were to meet with officials from the Rio Grande Valley and the Brownsville office of Catholic Charitieson on Thursday to discuss the problem. White House reconsidering National Guard: The White House has not embraced calls from Republicans and even some Democrats to send guard troops to the border with Mexico. President Barack Obama suggested, in a conversation with Texas Gov. Rick Perry earlier this month, that it could be a temporary solution. Perry followed up this week, announcing he would deploy up to 1,000 guard troops to the border area most affected by the surge -- the Rio Grande Valley. A White House official told CNN there had been no request from homeland security officials for such a step, but that the Pentagon would make the call, if asked for help. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection told CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday the administration is ""very pleased"" and optimistic with conditions"" at the border. Kerlikowske also noted that the flow of migrant youth has slowed, but also said that is a usual occurrence in hotter parts of the summer. Central American leaders in the U.S.: Guatemalan President Otto Perez Molina and Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez are slated to speak at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit, foreign policy think tank, on Thursday about ways to stem the from of immigrant kids. Molina and Hernandez, along with El Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren, are scheduled to meet with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden on Friday. Bush calls on Republicans to fix the problem: Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a possible 2016 Republican presidential candidate, wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal asking fellow Republicans not abandon comprehensive immigration reform and asking for the affected immigrant children to be treated more compassionately when they are taken into custody. His piece echoes themes in a similar statement last week to CNN. ""President Obama has promised to once again act unilaterally if Congress fails to take up immigration reform,"" Bush wrote. ""Now is the time for House Republicans to demonstrate leadership on this issue. Congress should not use the present crisis as an excuse to defer comprehensive immigration reform.""

"Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown's shooting death? The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN. In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots. Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four. ""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."" The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said. He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said. The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend. ""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording. The meaning of the pause . It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports. Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots. ""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell. Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer. ""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' "" Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting. But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called into a St. Louis radio show last week with what she said was the officer's version of events. The caller, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" said Brown taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account accurately matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN. An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body. Will autopsy shed any light on what happened? Key witness speaks out . Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting. And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question. In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address. Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility. ""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon.  ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""

"New York (CNN) -- Let's imagine this terrifying scenario for a moment. You come home from a long day of work and sit in front of your computer to try out your newly purchased copy of the video game Assassin's Creed 2, and then ... nothing happens. You face an immobile title screen. You check to make sure everything's plugged in -- yup, sure is -- and simply cannot figure out what's going on. ""Why doesn't this game work? It cost me $60!"" Meanwhile, on the other side of town, some no-good 12-year-old is illegally downloading the game from the Internet and playing it way past his bedtime. Whom do you blame? You blame the game's publisher, Ubisoft, for implementing the most egregious form of digital rights management (DRM) ever seen by mere gamers; in order for the game you bought at a store to work, it has to interact at all times with the company's server online. Consumers, naturally, are the ones to suffer. Thanks, Ubisoft. The French video game giant has created a form of DRM that made its big debut this week with the highly anticipated release of the PC version of Assassin's Creed 2. (The game came out for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November.) DRM is an ""access control technology"" used by publishers and other content owners to prevent piracy by placing limitations on how you use their products. It is always annoying, almost by definition, but Ubisoft's latest implementation is particularly onerous and has caused a giant kerfuffle in the gaming world. The most glaring problem is the requirement that you always be connected to the Internet for the game to work. Now, in today's environment of widely available broadband, that might not seem like such a big deal. But unless you have a perfectly flawless Internet connection (or live in the middle of nowhere), you're going to run into problems -- namely that you won't necessarily be able to play the game when you want. The Wi-Fi routers typically used by consumers are cheap, flimsy things, and it's not uncommon for the signal to frequently ""die."" (I have a D-Link wireless router, and it dies four or five times per day.) Without a constant connection to Ubisoft's servers, the game disconnects; you lose your game and have to wait for your connection to come back to start again. This is an offline-only game, mind you, not an online multiplayer game like World of Warcraft. You shouldn't have to connect to any server at all. Imagine putting a new Blu-ray disc into your player and having the movie play for five minutes and then returning to the title screen because the player decided it didn't like the color of your shirt. Would you tolerate that? Yes, you can almost understand where Ubisoft is coming from. It's merely taking the only course of action that it and other publishers think will stymie piracy. (It won't.) Ubisoft is part of a lucrative industry that is doing everything it can to protect its content. Video games made $20.2 billion in 2009 and $22.11 billion the year before (the industry blames the recession for the slight dip). Estimates abound on what piracy costs the industry: The best-selling game of 2009, Activision's Modern Warfare 2, is said to have been illegally downloaded more than 5 million times, according to BitTorrent news site TorrentFreak. At $60 per copy, that's $300 million down the drain for the company. Even going back to the days of floppy discs, publishers have made users do such things as inputting (only once, and not over the lifetime of the product, as Ubisoft now requires) a unique serial number at installation to prevent the disc from being passed around the office or university computer club. Up until very recently, the only music Apple sold on its iTunes Store was wrapped tightly with DRM; songs could be played on only one iPod at a time. The music industry thought this would help ensure its survival, but it had long since alienated its customers with years of higher-than-necessary CD prices and uninspired pop acts hogging the spotlight (a discussion for another day). And plain old DVDs have always had DRM, too. Ever try to copy a DVD to your laptop? It's impossible without special (and illegal, I might add) software. As a consumer, your options with Assassins Creed 2 are fairly limited, which has caused the ongoing uproar on gaming Web sites. The new DRM cannot be circumvented legally -- you could pirate the game, but that would be stealing from the game developers' tables -- and Ubisoft has said the system is here to stay. Good luck trying to return the game, too, since many stores have a policy of only allowing a direct, one-to-one exchange of opened PC games. The best part? The DRM has already been hacked! That means unscrupulous pirates are able to play the game without having to deal with DRM at all. They get off scot-free while legitimate customers have to jump through hoops to use what they actually paid for. That'll teach you to spend your money like an honest person. [A Ubisoft representative said that gamers who download and play a hacked version ""will find that their version is not complete.""] . All of this, of course, assumes that Ubisoft's DRM servers are even working to begin with. This past weekend, the servers were down for several hours. Ubisoft initially claimed that it was because of ""exceptional demand"" but later admitted to being the victim of a denial of service attack, leaving legitimate customers completely unable to play the game. Think of all the time, money and effort that Ubisoft invested in coming up with this DRM, only for it to be broken before the big game even came out, and then for the servers themselves to go down. That's time, money and effort the company could have put toward, you know, just making a good game.

"The offices of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo burned early Wednesday morning, the day it was due to publish an issue with a cover appearing to make fun of Islamic law. The cover has a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the Prophet Mohammed saying ""100 lashes if you're not dying of laughter."" The magazine's publication director said the fire was caused by a Molotov cocktail. The executive, identified on CNN affiliate BFM-TV as ""Charb,"" expressed outrage at the attack. ""The arsonist didn't read this magazine -- no one knows what's in this magazine except for the ones who will buy it this morning,"" he said. ""People acted violently over a magazine where they don't even know the content. This is what is most deviant and dumb,"" Charb said. French Interior Minister Claude Gueant expressed the support of the nation for the magazine. ""The freedom of the press is a sacred freedom for French people. Everything will be done to find the perpetrators of this attack,"" he said. Bertrand Delanoe, the mayor of Paris, ""strongly condemned this act of violence."" ""We may not agree with this week's edition of Charlie Hebdo, but we are in a society that needs freedom of expression, and any violence that undermines this freedom... is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said on BFM-TV. He offered to help Charlie Hebdo find other offices ""in order to support the newspaper and its freedom. "" Paris police confirmed that a fire started at the Charlie Hebdo building at 1 a.m. Wednesday and was extinguished about two hours later. They could not confirm that the fire was started by Molotov cocktails. An investigation is underway, they said. France has been wracked by tensions over its rapidly growing Muslim minority. The country banned the wearing of Islamic veils and other face coverings earlier this year, claiming they were both degrading and a security risk. Belgium has passed similar legislation, and Switzerland banned the building of minarets, the tall spires which often stand next to mosques. Muslims around the world have demonstrated over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, and some of the cartoonists have been attacked or threatened. Islam generally bans depictions of its founder. The French magazine received threats after it announced an edition guest-edited by the Prophet Mohammed and dedicated to the Arab Spring, Charb told BFM. ""I don't think Islam is a taboo subject, I think we have the right to talk about anything,"" he said. The issue is renamed ""Charia Hebdo,"" a reference to Islamic law, or sharia. The website of the magazine has also been hacked by ""Cyber-Warrior TIM"" claiming to be from Akincilar, ""for Islam.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A civil case has been filed against the New York Police Department by a Brooklyn woman whose fiance was shot more than 50 times by police officers on the day they were to be married. Nicole Paultre Bell weeps in March as indictments in her fiance's shooting death are announced. Sean Bell was killed last November when five police officers opened fire on him and two friends outside a strip club in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, where he was attending his bachelor party. A criminal case is under way in Queens Supreme Court against three of the five officers. The civil suit accuses all five officers, as well as the NYPD, of negligence, recklessness and civil rights violations. According to Sanford Rubenstein -- who filed the civil suit on behalf of Bell's fiancee, Nicole Paultre Bell, and the two other men who were fired upon -- the criminal case remains the victims' ""primary priority right now."" His clients will not pursue the civil case until the criminal trial wraps up, he said. The next scheduled court date for the criminal case is September 7. Rubenstein said he expects a trial date to be set at that time. Paultre Bell legally took her fiance's name after his death.

"(CNN)A massive hunt was launched Friday for the only surviving suspect from the two standoff scenes in France, who may have escaped, police union spokesman Pascal Disant said. Hayat Boumeddiene, a 26-year-old woman, allegedly was the accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly, 32, in a hostage-taking incident at a kosher grocery store in eastern Paris. Four civilians were killed by a gunman in the hostage standoff before police stormed the market, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters Friday. Two police officers were also wounded in the raid, he said. Coulibaly was killed in the police operation, authorities said. Boumeddiene may have eluded capture during the confusion as the freed hostages were running away, Disant said. At almost the same time, the other pair of suspects, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, were killed in a police operation in Dammartin-en-Goele, near the Charles de Gaulle Airport northeast of Paris. The Kouachis, who were brothers and the suspects in the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine office Wednesday in Paris, had been cornered at a printing business in the town, according to the mayor of a nearby town. During the hostage-taking scenario allegedly involving Boumeddiene and Coulibaly, they had demanded the freedom of the Kouachi brothers, Disant said. Some police were injured in the operation at the grocery, and at least 10 hostages escaped, according to Disant. The hostages being held at the market near Porte de Vincennes are alive, and ""the terrorist is dead,"" tweeted Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States. During the police operation, officers shouted ""get down!"" and ""we've got him,"" video from CNN affiliate BFMTV shows. President François Hollande praised police but noted continuing dangers for the country, without specifying those perils. ""France is not done with threats that are targeting (the country),"" Hollande said in a televised address to the nation. Photos purportedly of Boumeddiene . Boumeddiene and Coulibaly lived together, a Western intelligence source told CNN. The French newspaper Le Monde posted photos purporting to show Boumeddiene wearing a niqab in 2010 and holding a weapon that appears to be a crossbow in a rural setting. A niqab is a head-to-toe black covering, except for the eyes. Another photo shows her pointing the weapon at the camera, but her face is obscured by the niqab, with only her eyes exposed. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the photos. In one of the photos, Boumeddiene in a niqab is posing nearly cheek-to-cheek with Coulibaly in what the newspaper called a selfie. Coulibaly holds a pistol in a firing pose in one photo. In another, Boumeddiene is kneeling and readies to fire the crossbow-like weapon. In that photo, her black niqab allows her face and hands to be exposed, but her face can only be seen in profile.","Le Monde says photos show Boumeddiene in a niqab and holding a weapon in 2010 .

"(Mental Floss) -- Most people are familiar with the stories of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, who achieved great success as the founders of Microsoft and Facebook, respectively, after dropping out of Harvard. Here are eight other former Harvard students who made out just fine without earning their degrees. 1. Robert Frost . Frost, a San Francisco native who had previously dropped out of Dartmouth after only two months, was accepted for admission at Harvard in the fall of 1897 and studied liberal arts in Cambridge. Two years later, Frost, who had married and become a father just prior to enrolling at Harvard, left school to support his growing family. ""They could not make a student of me here, but they gave it their best,"" Frost later said. Frost won four Pulitzer Prizes for poetry in his lifetime and received an honorary degree from Harvard in 1937. 2. Matt Damon . The future Hollywood star entered Harvard in 1988 and took time off during the second semester of his sophomore year to act in ""Rising Son,"" a made-for-TV movie. Damon stepped out during his junior and senior years as well, and never accrued enough credits to graduate. ""What was happening is that I would keep coming back, and I would almost get done with the semester and then I would be yanked out,"" Damon recalled in an interview with the Harvard Crimson. It's fitting, then, that Damon's big break was ""Good Will Hunting,"" the 1997 film he co-wrote and starred in with his friend Ben Affleck. In one scene, Damon's character tells a Harvard student, ""You drop $150,000 on an education that you could have gotten for $1.50 on late charges at the public library."" Damon appeared on ""Ellen"" earlier this month and said he doesn't have any plans to go back and finish his degree. ""I feel like I got everything I needed to get from that experience,"" he said. 3. Edwin H. Land . After graduating with honors from the Norwich Academy in Connecticut, Land enrolled at Harvard in 1926. The son of a scrap metal yard owner, Land studied chemistry as a freshman and launched experiments on ways to polarize light. Land dropped out of Harvard to focus full-time on his research, which he conducted at the New York Public Library, before returning to Cambridge to establish the Land-Wheelwright Laboratories with his former Harvard physics instructor in 1932. In 1937, Land co-founded the Polaroid Corporation, which would introduce the first instant camera in 1947. Land said the idea was inspired by his then-3-year-old daughter, who asked why she couldn't immediately see a photograph he took of her on a family vacation. Polaroid made another breakthrough in 1963 with the introduction of instant color photography. By the time of his death in 1991, Land, who was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in 1957 and had a street in Cambridge named after him, owned more than 500 patents, second only to Thomas Edison. Among his other inventions were instant X-rays, Polaroid sunglasses, and glare-reducing goggles for dogs. Mental Floss: He Took a Polaroid Every Day, Until the Day He Died . 4. William Randolph Hearst . Hearst, the son of millionaire mining engineer George Hearst, enrolled at Harvard in 1885 and acted as the first business manager of the Harvard Lampoon, the school's humor publication. It didn't take long for Hearst, who kept a pet alligator named Champagne Charlie in his room, to establish a reputation as a trouble-maker. According to legend, the future newspaper magnate once bought a jackass and snuck the animal into a professor's room, leaving a card around its neck with the note, ""Now there are two of you."" Hearst survived that stunt, but was later expelled for sending his professors chamber pots with their names inscribed on the bottom. After leaving Harvard, Hearst launched his successful career by taking control of one of his father's newspapers, the San Francisco Examiner. 5. James B. Connolly . Connolly, who was admitted to Harvard in 1895 despite never graduating high school, left Cambridge to participate in the first Olympic Games one year later. Connolly reportedly requested a leave of absence from the Harvard dean, but it was denied as a result of his low academic standing. Harvard informed Connolly that he would have to reapply for admission upon his return from Athens, but he left anyway, and became the first modern Olympic champion with a win in the triple jump. Connolly never returned to Harvard to finish his degree, but he was awarded an honorary Harvard sweater in 1948. Mental Floss: The Post-Olympic Careers of 16 Medal Winners . 6. Pete Seeger . As Seeger explains it, the folk singer and activist had his financial aid rescinded after his sophomore year because he got too interested in left-wing politics and let his grades slip. Seeger, who would've graduated in 1940, achieved fame after dropping out of Harvard as a member of The Weavers, whose rendition of Leadbelly's ""Goodnight, Irene"" topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950. Seeger doesn't seem to harbor any ill will toward the school. As the Harvard Crimson reported, he wrote the following in his alumni yearbook: ""I remember thinking when 1940 came along that I was glad I had spent the two years there, that I had learned certain invaluable things, but also that I had learned in two years that I had been away from certain things that Harvard wouldn't have been able to teach."" 7. R. Buckminster Fuller . The inventor, philosopher, and futurist was the fifth generation of his family to enroll at Harvard and the first not to graduate. Fuller wasn't accepted into any of Harvard's social clubs, so he sought companionship elsewhere and regularly skipped classes to attend Broadway shows. During one such trip to New York City, Fuller treated actress Marilyn Miller and her entire chorus to dinner, blowing all of his tuition money for that year in the process. Harvard dismissed Fuller, who went to work as a factory worker in Quebec before his mother convinced him to reapply. Fuller was readmitted and earned several academic honors, but eventually became bored and left Harvard for good. After a stint in the U.S. Navy, Fuller embarked on the first of many commercial failures, including the prefabricated Dymaxion House, before achieving fortune and fame in 1947 with the invention of the geodesic dome. Fuller returned to Harvard in 1961 to accept the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship of Poetry. 8. Bonnie Raitt . Raitt enrolled at Radcliffe College, Harvard's then-coordinate college, in 1967. The daughter of a Broadway musical performer, Raitt planned to major in African studies and travel to Tanzania to help ""undo the damage that Western colonialism had done."" Those dreams were sidetracked when Raitt, a skilled guitar player, met blues promoter Dick Waterman in Cambridge. Waterman introduced Raitt to established performers such as Son House and Fred McDowell. Though Raitt had every intention of graduating, she took a semester off during her sophomore year to explore the possibility of a musical career with Waterman and became a star. Raitt signed a recording deal with Warner Bros. in 1970 and released her debut album in 1971. Raitt won four Grammy awards in 1990 and received Harvard's third Arts Medal in 1997. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. Mental Floss: 15 Celebrities Who Started as Teachers . 9. Elisabeth Shue . At least one famous Harvard dropout eventually decided to return to school. Shue, who transferred to Harvard from Wellesley College, dropped out of school one semester short of receiving her political science degree in 1985 to pursue an acting career. Fifteen years later, she returned to Cambridge to complete her degree. ""My brain was starting to dry up,"" Shue told Movieline magazine. ""In Hollywood, you're fortunate if you get a role where your brain is engaged, but those experiences are rare. I felt like I needed to do something with my life. I wanted to feel more connected to the world."" At the time, Shue said she would eventually like to teach and make documentaries. Best known for her Oscar-nominated role in ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" one of Shue's most recent roles was as Sheriff Julie Forester in ""Piranha 3D.""

"Hornets have killed dozens of people in China and injured more than 1,500 with their powerful venomous sting. The Asian giant hornet, known scientifically as Vespa mandarinia, carries a venom that destroys red blood cells, which can result in kidney failure and death, said Justin O. Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwest Biological Institute in Tucson, Arizona. But perhaps a bigger problem than the toxicity of the venom is allergy, Schmidt says. Some people are naturally more allergic to stinging insects than others; a sting can trigger a deadly anaphylactic reaction, which may involve airway closure or cardiac arrest. Since July, hornet attacks have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 people in three cities in Shaanxi province, according to the local government. Among those attacked, 206 are receiving treatment in hospitals. What are these hornets? In person, the Asian giant hornet, which is the largest hornet species in the world, looks like ""the wasp analog of a pit bull"" with ""a face that looks like you just can't reason with it,"" said Christopher K. Starr, professor of entomology at University of West Indes in Trinidad & Tobago. These hornets are found throughout East and Southeast Asia, in countries such as in China, Korea, Japan, India and Nepal. And they're big. The giant hornet extends about 3.5 to 3.9 centimeters in length (1.4 to 1.5 inches), roughly the size of a human thumb, and it has black tooth used for burrowing, according to an animal database at the University of Michigan. The queens are even bigger, with bodies that can grow longer than 5 centimeters (2 inches). The species feed their young the larvae of other insects and use their mandibles to sever the limbs and heads of their prey. The giant hornets are attracted to human sweat, alcohol and sweet flavors and smells. They are especially sensitive to when animals or people run, according to Xinhua. Every breeding season, the giant hornets produce an average of 1,000 to 2,000 offspring, Schmidt said. They feast on other insects such as wasps and bees, launching coordinated attacks on the hives of their prey. Most hornet hives or nests are tucked away in secluded places, such as tree hollows or even underground. ""It's very difficult to prevent the attacks, because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites,"" said Shunichi Makino, director general of the Hokkaido Research Center for Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in Japan. Asian giant hornets and other terrifying creatures . What is the human impact? Over the summer and early fall, hornets have invaded schools full of children and descended upon unsuspecting farm workers in China. One of them is Mu Conghui, who was attacked in Ankang City while looking after her millet crop. ""The hornets were horrifying,"" she told Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. ""They hit right at my head and covered my legs. All of a sudden, I was stung, and I couldn't move. ""Even now, my legs are covered with sting holes."" Two months, 13 dialysis treatments and 200 stitches later, Mu still remains hospitalized and unable to move her legs. Makino, who specializes in entomology, warned that the sting from an Asian giant hornet was severe compared with those of other insects. The influx of venom to the human body can cause allergic reactions and multiple organ failure, leading to death. Patients like Mu have been receiving dialysis to remove the toxins from their bodies. In photos, patients bore deep, dark craters scattered across their limbs, the size of bullet wounds. Dr. Wang Xue, director of the intensive care unit at First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University and an expert of the provincial hornet sting treatment guidance unit, warned in a Shaanxi government release that hornets tend to be aggressive and more active during September and October, their breeding season. The hornets do not go into hibernation until December, according to local government authorities. Local authorities have deployed thousands of police officers and locals to destroy the hives. About 710 hives have been removed and at least 7 million yuan (about $1.1 million U.S.) sent to areas affected by hornets, according to a government press release. Why so many attacks now? The spate of attacks could be caused by the unusually dry weather in the area, authorities say. The arid environment makes it easier for hornets to breed. Urbanization could also be a contributing factor, as humans move into hornets' habitats. Some experts cited in Xinhua stated additional factors such as increased vegetation and a decrease in the hornets' enemies, such as spiders and birds, because of ecological changes. In other words, it's a good season for the hornet population, which makes it a bad season for people who encounter them. The provincial government of Shaanxi has warned residents to wear long sleeves when outdoors and not to attempt to drive the swarms away or remove the hives. Japan is familiar with Asian giant hornet stings, too. About 30 to 50 deaths are reported each year in Japan from such attacks, according to Japanese studies. Most of the deaths are due to allergies to the venom, Makino said. The giant hornets are also destructive to western honeybees. Research in Japan suggests that tens of thousands of honeybee hives are damaged by the giant hornets each year. How to protect yourself . People run into trouble when these hornets form a nest: a basketball-shaped nest that looks like it's made of gray paper, sometimes under an eave, Schmidt said. If you disturb one of these, or happen to whack a tree that has a nest in it, the hornets may respond as if they're under attack. Humans can get themselves in danger by reacting poorly to these large hornets. If you see a nest or a hive, just avoid it, Schmidt says. If one of them buzzes around you, don't panic. ""Don't flap or scream or freak out,"" he advised. ""Just calmly walk away."" One victim told local media this month that ""the more you run, the more they want to chase you."" Some victims described being chased about 200 meters (656 feet) by a swarm. An area of research that hasn't been explored is how many people get stung by these hornets while taking down a nest in order to use the larvae as fish bait, or even to eat. The larvae do not have venom, Schmidt explained. But in general, people should not tamper with these nests. As powerful as their sting can be, it is highly unlikely that these hornets would travel all the way to the United States to find a new home, Schmidt said, or in the United Kingdom for that matter. To go to Western Europe, they'd have to cross some ""nasty deserts"" to which they are not adapted. As deadly as live adult giant hornets can be, some people don't shy away from them altogether. There is a sports drink in Japan called VAAM that incorporates amino acids derived from hornets. In Taiwan, where the giant hornet is known as the ""tiger head,"" the insect is sometimes used in alcoholic drinks, Starr said, the idea being that ""the essence of this great big strong hornet will go out into the booze, and when you drink it, you'll become strong."" That's one way to get a buzz.","Hornet stings have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 in China since July .
Shaanxi province sees unusual level of activity; dry weather, human moves are factors .
People who have been stung are dying from allergic reactions or multiple organ failure .

"(CNN) -- Oil has driven Angola's booming economy over the last decade, helping the resource-rich country emerge from the wreckage of a long, vicious war to become one Africa's major economic players. One of the biggest producers of black gold in the continent, the southwestern African country has seen its GDP surge by several hundred percent in recent years as the hangover from long conflicts turned into a hunger for profits. More than 90% of Angola's revenue comes from oil production, but despite its oil wealth, Angola remains largely impoverished. In Luanda, the vibrant capital of Angola, shiny new boardwalks, luxury properties and an influx of Portuguese expats are all signs of oil money in a city that was last year named as the world's most expensive for expats. But despite the numerous new developments and Luanda's shiny facade, inequality prevails . Read related: Is oil-rich Angola a development success? Next to the sleek skyscrapers and luxury apartments, ramshackle shantytowns and crowded slums spread for miles in every direction, housing millions of people living on less than $2 a day. In many cases, even basic necessities like water and electricity are lacking. Activists like Elias Isaac say the much-vaunted oil wealth bypasses ordinary people in the country, run by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos since 1979. ""We don't see the money that is being generated from oil having direct impact on people's livelihoods,"" said Isaac, Angola program manager of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa. ""Angola makes a lot of money out of oil, there is no doubt about this,"" he added. ""Angola is one of the few countries that can really pay its national budget without any donor funding, which is great. But where this money goes, that's the biggest issue."" Oil deals are shrouded by confidentiality agreements, making it almost impossible to gauge how much money goes into Sonangol, Angola's state oil company. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Sebastiao Gaspar Martins, Sonangol's executive manager, admitted that Angola is making ""a huge amount"" from its oil. He said Sonangol produces ""1.75 million barrels a day, which of course, if we multiply at the end of the year we make billions."" When asked about Sonangol's closed books and the flow of industry revenues, Martins was quick to suggest that the oil money is being used for Angola's rebuilding efforts. Read related: Angola's post-war generation . But advocacy group Human Rights Watch has contended that tens of billions of dollars of oil money has skipped Angola's central bank entirely and disappeared. The International Monetary Fund says Sonangol spends billions off the books. Isaac said oil revenues have created an enormous slush fund for the country's elite. And when asked whether the oil money is being stolen, Isaac replied: ""To say that it's not being stolen would not be true to the situation, because if the oil money was not being stolen, we could have better social services in this country."" He added: ""Someone is taking it."" Critics have also accused Sonangol -- which is both concession-granter and regulator of the industry -- of acting as a way to funnel part of the oil revenues to the political elite. Martins responded to the criticisms by saying that ""most"" of Sonangol's revenues ""are used to the wealth of our country and our people."" He added: ""I would say all, depending on how you interpret it. Because what is our role? We have a production revenue, we put the production revenues on the hands of the minister of finance ... [it] goes through the hands of the government."" The Angolan government denies corruption in the oil sector. And recently, it announced a $5 billion sovereign wealth fund in a bid to diversify its economy, a move welcomed by lenders for its transparency. The state-owned investment fund, known as the Fundo Soberano de Angola, will invest domestically and internationally, focusing on infrastructure development and the hospitality industry. At the same time, oil companies will soon be opening up new oil fields off Angola and the country hopes to become the largest producer of crude in Africa. But with a history of corruption and problems of transparency, the biggest challenge will be ensuring that the profits filter down to ordinary Angolans. Until then, many in the country say that only a tiny sliver of elites will truly benefit from Angola's oil.","Angola one of the biggest oil producers in Africa .
Vast majority of Angola's money comes from oil but the country remains impoverished .
Critics say oil wealth is bypassing ordinary people in the country .

Public defenders are the embodiment of a criminal justice system that believes everyone is innocent until proved guilty, that even people accused of horrific crimes deserve someone to stand up for them and find their humanity. Many of Clarke's colleagues believe she is the perfect lawyer for the job. David I. Bruck, a law school classmate and occasional legal colleague, spoke with CNN in January 2011, when she was appointed to defend Loughner. ""Judy is as genuine as a person can be,"" Bruck said. ""She explodes every myth about lawyers. She is motivated by a passion to stick up for the little guy, and there is nobody littler than a defendant accused of a horrendous crime who everybody wants to string up."" Federal prosecutors have not decided whether to seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. But few legal observers will be surprised if they do. Nor would they be surprised if the defense raises issues about Tsarnaev's mental state. ""I'm glad she's on the case. She's a great lawyer,"" said Quin Denvir, a former federal public defender from Sacramento, California. Denvir recruited Clarke to help him with the Kaczynski case. ""She's a walking encyclopedia, she knows the law, and she has great empathy for the client,"" he said. ""She does it all."" Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School and a former federal prosecutor, said of Clarke, ""She is familiar with the federal death penalty, insanity defenses, high-profile cases, and difficult clients."" Clarke has no taste for designer clothes, sound bites or talking heads. In fact, she has absolutely no use for the media. As a public defender, she didn't need publicity to hustle up paying clients. She was on a government salary, and there was no shortage of poor defendants. For much of her 30-year career, Clarke ran the federal public defender offices in San Diego and in Spokane, Washington. In the mid-1990s, she became the first federal public defender to head the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Now, even though she is in private practice, other public defenders seek her help on the tough cases. And so Clarke prefers to do her talking to judges, juries, other lawyers and law students. Not surprisingly, Clarke did not return CNN's calls for comment. But she spoke freely last year with the magazine at Washington and Lee University Law School, where she and her husband teach, as does Bruck. She is a visiting professor, teaching third-year law students, and she articulated the philosophy that defines her as a defense lawyer: . ""We stand between the power of the state and the individual, and in doing so defend the core values that make this country great,"" Clarke said. ""None of us, including those accused of a crime, wants to be defined by the worst moment, or the worst day of our lives."" Colleagues say Clarke is highly effective. An ardent opponent of the death penalty, she has kept some of the nation's most despised criminals -- baby killers, bombers, white supremacists and terrorists -- off death row. You might know some of her clients by the public nicknames they acquired: the Unabomber, the Olympic Park bomber and the 20th hijacker. Clarke is so relentless, her work ethic so formidable, that she often seems driven. But her ambition is not for herself, colleagues say. She believes in the system. She was raised in Asheville, North Carolina, and graduated in 1974 from Furman College in Greenville, South Carolina. She received her law degree in 1977 from the University of South Carolina Law School, where Bruck was a couple of years ahead of her and served as a student adviser. Her talent was immediately apparent, he said. Later, as a defense attorney in South Carolina, Bruck recruited Clarke to help him defend Susan Smith, the emotionally disturbed mother who in October 1994 strapped her two boys into her car and let it roll into a lake, drowning them. The defense argued that it was a failed suicide attempt. It was Clarke's first capital case. ""This is not a case about evil,"" she told the jury as the trial began in state court during the summer of 1995. ""This is a case about despair and sadness."" Clarke didn't argue insanity but brought her client's abusive childhood and adult depression alive for the jury. She portrayed Smith as a woman so tormented by her failures in life that she even failed at her own suicide and jumped out of the car. ""She snapped, and Michael and Alex are gone,"" Clarke told jurors. ""Susan broke where many of us might bend."" She let jurors feel Smith's confusion and pain, and they took 2½ hours to convict Smith of murdering her sons. But they spared her life. Afterward, the judge was so impressed with Clarke¹s work, he increased her pay to $83,000. She paid the taxes and donated the money to a nonprofit agency that defends the poor in capital cases. State officials were not so impressed. They passed a law that prohibited out-of-state lawyers from working on South Carolina¹s death penalty cases. That law is still on the books, Bruck said. We've been hit before on home soil . Clarke went on to join the defense teams in other high-profile capital cases in the federal courts. All were settled through plea bargains that took the death penalty off the table. Among them: . Ted Kaczynski: The mathematician known as the Unabomber pleaded guilty in January 1998 to making and transporting bomb materials that killed three people. Federal prosecutors in Sacramento, California, backed away from the death penalty after their own expert diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Buford O. Furrow: The Aryan Nations member pleaded guilty in 2001 and was sentenced to five life terms for a racially motivated shooting spree at a Los Angeles Jewish Community Center and the fatal shooting of a Filipino-American postal worker in 1999. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty when the defense documented and charted Furrow's long history of psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder. The decision later was criticized by the victims' families. Child shooting victims: What they've learned from the past . Eric Rudolph: The man known as the Olympic Park bomber pleaded guilty in 2005 to bombing a women's clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, and other bombings, including at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. He was a survivalist and spent years on the FBI's most wanted list. Prosecutors dropped the death penalty after Rudolph led them to several dynamite caches in the North Carolina woods. Zacarias Moussaoui: The 9/11 conspirator is sometimes referred to as the 20th hijacker. Clarke worked only briefly on this case. He repeatedly fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself, abruptly pleading guilty to terror conspiracy charges in July 2002. His life was spared in 2006 when a lone juror held out against a death sentence after a trial punctuated by the defendant's outbursts. Jared Lee Loughner: The suspended community college student pleaded guilty to 19 murder and attempted murder counts in the Arizona shooting rampage that killed a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl and seriously wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Two mental health experts diagnosed him as paranoid schizophrenic, and he was sentenced to life in prison under a plea bargain.","Judy Clarke is considered the nation's foremost expert in defending capital cases .

"If you were disturbed yesterday by the video we released of Yasiin Bey (aka Mos Def) being force-fed like a Guantánamo prisoner, please consider: right now this is happening 90 times a day at Guantánamo Bay.  (If you haven't seen it yet, the video is here. You may find the images distressing.) In fact, what you saw slightly understates what Reprieve's clients and many others go through twice daily.  After all, Bey volunteered for the procedure and could stop it anytime.  Yet still it hurt him. The reason for this is that when you are nervous, as he naturally was, your throat tends to tense and catches the tube. Our doctors tried to intubate him twice but just couldn't get the tube through.  And you see for yourself how violated he felt by the end. This is the process Guantánamo's PR staff try to whitewash with the bland term ""enteral feeding."" In the real thing, a team of soldiers in riot gear come for my hunger-striking clients, like Nabil Hadjarab or Samir Moqbel.  After weeks of starvation the men are shrivelled, weak, and 10 times as afraid as Bey was.  When the military straps them into the chair, not a word they can say will stop the procedure.  And if they feel ill and throw up, as force-fed prisoners sometimes do, the military will just repeat the grim business all over again. The overwhelming reaction from Twitter and the web yesterday was disgust that this could happen in America. Yet it is, and the most worrying part is: it doesn't need to. President Obama could end the strike tomorrow with one decisive step -- he could start to transfer cleared prisoners. Eighty-six of the men (a majority of those left) have been cleared by the U.S. government, and it has the power to issue waivers so that these men can be transferred. My clients have consistently stated they will consider eating again when they see a cleared man go home.  This is much more achievable than the Obama administration would have us believe. This week, White House press secretary Jay Carney pointed to a Congressional moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, and said Obama ""calls on Congress to work with him to ensure we can lift the ban."" However, Carney -- and Obama -- conveniently ignore those cases for which there is no obstruction to release beyond the White House's lack of political will. This is especially true where cleared men are slated to go to close U.S. allies.  One of my clients, Shaker Aamer, a cleared hunger-striker, could be on a plane to London within a week -- the UK Prime Minister David Cameron has asked for him back. Another cleared client, Nabil Hadjarab, has family in France waiting to welcome him. And there are more like him. The best way for Obama to stop the strike is to show that he's serious about closing Guantanamo -- and the best way to do that is to release one of these men, a move for which he does not need Congressional approval. This week, a federal judge had to give the president an elementary lesson on Article II of the Constitution to remind Obama that, yes, he is Commander-in-Chief and therefore, yes, he has the power to deal with the ongoing crisis at Gitmo. Judge Kessler was responding to attempts by Reprieve and our co-counsel Jon Eisenberg to stop force-feeding for four of our clients, especially during the daytime in Ramadan. Muslims traditionally fast during those hours, and we told the court force-feeding during the holy month would be a further slap in the face. Although Judge Kessler denied our motion, her opinion also issued a stinging rebuke to the Obama administration, finding that despite Justice Department protestations to the contrary, ""it is perfectly clear...that force-feeding is a painful, humiliating, and degrading process."" While Judge Kessler felt she had no power to halt the feeding, she said she knew of one person who could: . Even though this Court...lacks any authority to rule on Petitioner's request, there is an individual who does have the authority to address the issue. In a speech on May 23, 013, President Barack Obama stated ""Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees who are holding a hunger strike. . . Is that who we are? Is that something that our founders foresaw? Is that the America we want to leave to our children? Our sense of justice is stronger than that."" The President of the United States, as Commander-in-Chief, has the authority—and power—to directly address the issue of force-feeding of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. The White House has been silent since Obama's speech at the National Defense University.  It has been over six weeks since the president asked the American people whether force-feeding was ""who we are."" Yet his military continues to do it. And there is no sign of any of the cleared 86 men being sent home. There is now an overwhelming consensus that the current state of affairs in Guantánamo -- a situation for which Barack Obama is directly responsible -- is unacceptable.  The American Medical Association has spoken. The clergy have spoken. Federal judges have spoken.  What will it take to get the White House to wake up, treat this like the crisis that it is, and do the right thing to stop the strike: send the cleared prisoners home?","Reprieve Director calls on White House to transfer cleared Gitmo detainees .

"The U.N. and Arab League point man on Syria praised the top U.S. and Russian diplomats Wednesday for their latest efforts to forge a solution to the Syrian conflict. Lakhdar Brahimi called remarks from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry ""the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy country in a very long time."" Speaking at a joint news conference Tuesday in Moscow, Kerry said he and Lavrov had agreed ""as soon as is practicable, possibly and hopefully, by the end of this month"" to ""seek to convene an international conference."" The aim would be to implement last summer's Geneva communique brokered by Russia and the United States outlining how a transitional government could be formed. If the conference takes place, it would be the first to bring together representatives of the warring sides, which have been unable to negotiate a settlement to the two-year conflict that has claimed more than 70,000 lives. The opposition has adamantly refused any role for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in any transitional government. But Lavrov, without naming al-Assad, said he is ""not interested in the fate of certain persons."" Kerry went further by telling reporters that ""it's impossible for me, as an individual, to understand how Syria could be governed in the future by the man who has committed the things we know have taken place."" ""But I'm not going to decide that tonight. I'm not going to decide that in the end. Because the Geneva communique says that the transitional government has to be chosen by mutual consent by the parties ... the current regime and the opposition,"" Kerry said. Brahimi said he has urged the United States and Russia ""to exercise leadership and work together to initiate a process to implement"" the June 30 Geneva declaration. ""The statements made in Moscow constitute a very significant first step forward. It is nevertheless only a first step,"" Brahimi said in a prepared statement. ""There is every reason to expect the three other permanent members of the Security Council as a whole and indeed all the Security Council members to work together amongst themselves and with the secretary-general to carry the process forward."" Deaths continue to mount, as 112 people were killed across Syria Wednesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said, including 30 in the Qusair area of Homs, in what the group said was a ""massacre by Lebanese Hezbollah forces."" A Syrian activist in Qusair who spoke with eight survivors of the attack said that Hezbollah fighters attacked civilian vehicles that were trying to flee the city. Activist Hadi Albadalla said the Syrian regime and Hezbollah have had Qusair under siege for 20 days. Residents have witnessed increased shelling and tank artillery fire, Albadalla said. The victims were trying to flee in four vehicles when they were spotted by Hezbollah militants and fired upon, Albadalla said. Many of those who escaped were found and killed, he said. In other fighting Wednesday, the leader for the hardline jihadist group al-Nusra Front, Abu Mohammed al-Joulani, was injured during shelling in a southern suburb of Damascus, the London based activist group, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said. An activist in the area told the group that several members of the al-Nusra Front were also injured in the shelling which targeted them. The U.S. State Department designates the al-Nusra Front rebel group as a terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq.

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter could turn to former U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger to help clean up soccer's world governing body. Blatter was the only candidate in Wednesday's election held in Zurich, Switzerland and was duly returned to serve another four-year term. The ballot was held among a storm of corruption allegations against the organization which saw Blatter's only rival, Mohamed Bin Hammam, suspended by FIFA's Ethics Committee on bribery charges. The Qatari subsequently dropped out of the presidential race. Blatter re-elected as FIFA president . After his re-election Blatter vowed to put ""FIFA's ship back on the right course in clear, transparent waters"" and former Nobel Peace prize winner Kissinger could now be approached to head up a new 'Solutions Committee'. The Swiss also said former Dutch legend Johan Cruyff could be a part of his bid to clean up FIFA's reputation after weeks of negative headlines. PR guru Max Clifford: How to rescue FIFA . At a press conference Blatter told reporters: ""This will be a commission of the wise. Kissinger loves football: he'll be part of it. ""And Cruyff, he's the perfect personality to help us in this solution commission."" Kissinger, 88, served under former U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and has been used in an advisory capacity by several governments since. He attended the 2006 World Cup in Germany and is thought to be friends with the FIFA president. Kissinger's spokeswoman Jessee Leporin was quoted by AFP as saying: ""Although Dr. Kissinger has not yet received a formal request, he did receive an exploratory letter from FIFA president Blatter, inviting him to join a committee."" Blatter vowed to reform FIFA in the wake of bribery scandals that engulfed the election process. Two FIFA executive members were suspended after they allegedly sold their votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup. Bin Hammam and FIFA vice-president Jack Warner were then suspended just days before the election after they were deemed to have paid bribes to officials. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame . Blatter himself was cleared by the Ethics Committee after it was alleged he had also offered financial incentives to FIFA delegates. Warner then released an email from FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke in which he claimed Qatar ""bought"" the 2022 World Cup. Qatar denied the claims and Valcke insisted his comments were misconstrued. FIFA's sponsors, who contribute a large part of their financial income, Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa, then voiced their concern about the ongoing corruption allegations. After Blatter's re-election FIFA voted through changes proposed by the president to alter the process they use to decide the host nations for future World Cups. He later told a press conference in Zurich: ""We have now instruments needed to restart the credibility of FIFA. ""When it comes to words from the beginning I have set the tone for this congress and I want the congress to know and to understand that we are in a situation which needs not only words as well as action in order to counter all these attacks. ""We have been hit; I have been slapped, we are [still] standing and we will no longer be slapped. We have created the necessary means to react against what we have fallen short of, so they say.""","FIFA president Sepp Blatter lines up Henry Kissinger for reform role .

"(WIRED) -- Professional sports teams are attempting at a furious rate to lure fans away from the comfort of their couches to live games. And sweet technological upgrades to their home venues become a bigger selling point every year. Roughly a dozen Major League Baseball clubs followed that strategy by making tech-centric improvements to their ballparks in advance of the 2011 season, which kicks off Thursday. Notable upgrades include ballpark-wide Wi-Fi access (Chicago White Sox) and LED high-definition ribbon boards (Arizona Diamondbacks). Here's a deeper look at nine other teams that have made similar significant upgrades. Houston Astros -- Minute Maid Park . The Astros join the Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins as the only MLB teams to feature a scoreboard with a 1080i display format. ""Fans are watching games on high-definition [television], so when they come out to the ballpark we want things to be in high-definition, as well,"" Kirby Kander, the Astros' senior director of creative services, told Wired.com. Where once stood a 26-by-45-foot scoreboard in right field, there's now a 54-by-124-foot Daktronics behemoth that ranks as the fourth-largest scoreboard in the majors. The 2.66-million pixel scoreboard was part of a $13 million project which included a 24-by-40-foot video board stationed in left field and 1,185 linear feet of ribbon boards spanning from one foul pole to the other. A state-of-the-art, two-level control room comprising 1,500 square feet was built at the suite level in left field to manage the new 'boards. Apps, Gear and Beer: The Wired.com Guide to the Baseball Season . Boston Red Sox -- Fenway Park . A 10-year, $285 million plan to modify 99-year-old Fenway Park concluded this off-season with $40 million in construction upgrades, the most prominent of which are three new scoreboards beyond right-center field. ANC Sports Enterprises teamed with Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Vision Systems to install three video screens: a 38-by-100-foot scoreboard in right-center field that replaces a 23-by-30-foot structure installed in 1976 (but the famous John Hancock sign will still tower over the new 'board), a 17-by-100-foot video screen in center field, and a 16-by-30-foot video board in right field. The primary scoreboard has the ability to display side graphics, as the old scoreboard did, or move to full-screen video to capture live action. The side 'boards will incorporate game info such as player stats, pitch speed and type, box scores, promotions, announcements and other types of messages . Philadelphia Phillies -- Citizens Bank Park . Phillies fans will get to watch live game action on a new 76-by-97-foot LED high-def scoreboard in left field. The old scoreboard, which was installed for Citizen Bank Park's 2004 debut, has been relocated to the Phils' spring training facility in Clearwater, Florida. The team partnered with Daktronics and Sony Electronics' System Solutions Group on the new 84,000-square-foot 'board, whose 2.9 million pixels dwarfs the former scoreboard's 459,000-pixel display. Fans get to view one of the clearest scoreboards in the world. Its HD-15 display and 1,512 lines of resolution surpass that of the standard for 1080p HD video boards, and its LED technology allows it to show up to 144 quadrillion shades of color. Citizens Bank Park's in-house video departments were also improved from standard to HD, including the video-coaching facility. Mark DiNardo, the Phillies' director of broadcasting and video services, told Wired.com the upgrade will most benefit the scouting and self-analysis performed by the team's coaches and players. ""They voiced a concern to upgrade,"" DiNardo said, ""and our management heard that concern."" Titanium Baseball Neckwear Big on Hype, Short on Science . Cincinnati Reds -- Great American Ball Park . The ability for fans to view information at high speed on their mobile devices headlines the pair of tech changes at the Reds' Great American Ball Park. The incorporation of a multi-tent cell-tower system with approximately 120 antennas will permit fans to access apps like MLB's latest At Bat rev on 3G or 4G networks through their iPhones, BlackBerries, iPads and Android devices. The app allows fans to view pitch-by-pitch tracking, real-time box scores and stats and searchable video highlights through a multitude of mobile service carriers, including ballpark sponsor AT&T. Reds IT director Brian Keys told Wired.com that roughly 1,500 to 3,000 fans demand high-speed mobile access at any given moment in the stadium, which seats more than 42,000 fans. ""We're trying to get the fans more stats, videos, replays and information to their smart devices,"" Keys said. Sixty luxury suites have also been outfitted with 46-inch Sony TVs and 25-inch Sony Vaio flat-panel PCs with Blu-ray functionality. Suite attendees can use the PCs to choose their preference of five camera angles on MLB.TV and view any league game, including typically blacked-out contests in Cincinnati, and reroute them to the high-def TVs. Milwaukee Brewers -- Miller Park . The primary aspect of the Brewers' three-pronged tech upgrade for Miller Park is a 5,940-square foot scoreboard in center field. At 54 by 110 feet, the Daktronics 'board boasts true 1080i display containing more than 2.35 million pixels, compared to the 134,000 pixels produced by the dual 10-year-old scoreboards it replaces. ""The technology to support the [old scoreboards] was changing, and we were running out of spare parts for them,"" Brewers COO Rick Schlesinger told Wired.com. For example, the new scoreboard, unlike the ones it replaced, doesn't require air conditioning to cool it down. According to the Brewers, that will translate into a 50 percent to 65 percent reduction in energy consumption. The Miller Park upgrades, which cost almost $11 million, also include a refashioned audio system that'll make it easier for the control room to manage the volume, bass and treble in different areas of the stadium. Kinect Could Hold Key to Next-Gen Baseball Biomechanics . Seattle Mariners -- Safeco Field . A new LED scoreboard in right field and LED ribbon boards stretching from the the press box to the foul poles along the first- and third-base lines will enable the Mariners to present customized game and sponsor information to their patrons. All three Mitsubishi Electric Diamond Vision boards will have their video powered by ANC Sports' VisionSoft display. The system allows for a presentation of statistical and game information tailored strictly to Safeco Field. Sponsors can also customize their messages to appear on the boards on a game, series, homestand or season-long basis. The 6-by-160-foot scoreboard above right field's Outfield Reserve seats will complement the ANC-installed out-of-town scoreboard in left field, implemented before last season. The 734 linear feet of ribbon boards permit the Mariners to show in-game information such as pitch count, type and speed; play-by-play from the prior three batters; animation and graphics; and messages from sponsors and the team's community relations department. Minnesota Twins -- Target Field . Though Target Field only debuted last season, the team spent more than $5 million on improvements for the stadium's sophomore campaign. Leading the way is a Daktronics HD-15 LED scoreboard in right field, clocking in at 28 feet by 50 feet and providing 552 x 984 resolution. The new scoreboard mostly accommodates fans sitting in left field, who often complained of having to crank their heads to view live game video and statistical info on the scoreboard towering over them. This off-season, Twins owner Carl Pohlad made the move to address all the grumbling. ""The Pohlad family said we'll just put up another [scoreboard], which is pretty cool,"" Twins VP of technology John Avenson told Wired.com. A new 100-foot tall, LED-illuminated tower adjacent to the right field scoreboard will display situational graphic material and supplementary head-shot content, such as autographs, head-to-toe player pictures and player names and numbers. Also manufactured by Daktronics, each of the tower's four sides will incorporate more than 4,300 LED strips. An improved ballpark-wide Wi-Fi system with more than 200 access points will be operated by MLB Advanced Media, providing fans with information about the game, and ballpark, and even a concession-stand finder. Tampa Bay Rays -- Tropicana Field . The Rays will play on a more durable and aesthetically pleasing surface at Tropicana Field, thanks to AstroTurf, the official synthetic turf of MLB. The company's GameDay Grass 3D60H model, installed during a three-week period this spring, contains a Horseshoe fiber which (literally) stands up to repeated use. The fiber's omega, or ""C"", dual-column design imparts mechanical memory to the fiber, so that it pops up even after repeated trampling by cleats and baseballs. Using 60 ounces of fiber per square yard ensures the surface's long-term durability. The fiber's design also reflects light, which has a two-fold effect: It reduces surface temperatures by up to 18 percent and cuts down on the sheen produced by ballpark lights. The Rays' Andrew Heydt said the old artificial surface would produce a ""glazing effect"" when the dome's interior lights were turned on. That's no longer the case, as the improved look and performance of the Trop's turf almost mirrors the promise the future holds for Evan Longoria, David Price and the perennially upstart Rays. Texas Rangers -- Rangers Ballpark in Arlington . New video boards in right and center field at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington use Daktronics' newest 15-millimeter LED technology. The 42-by-120-foot scoreboard above the Home Run Porch in right field and the 25-by-29-foot scoreboard in center field have the versatility to run as single displays or be separated into multiple windows to display various game info. A newly installed IPTV system from Daktronics also allows all existing ribbon and field-level video boards and more than 800 Sony LCD monitors throughout the stadium to receive game information on up to 10 high-def channels. Real-time scores, statistics and even in-game menu pricing changes can be sent to any board or monitor on any IPTV channel. An upgraded control room and a revamped audio system round out the improvements made for last season's American League champs.

"Usually a cause for techno-euphoria, Apple's iPhone-a-palooza event on Tuesday had an unintended and unlikely effect: It made some corners of the Internet mad. ""LET'S TALK *NEW* IPHONE ALREADY!!!!!!!!"" the Twitter celebrity @ijustine wrote during the company's much-hyped press conference, where it unveiled the iPhone 4S -- a phone that looks just like its predecessor, but is faster and has a better camera. ""Tim Cook is talking too much. I just need to know if I have to put pants on and run to the Apple Store righhttt now,"" she wrote closer to the start of the event, referring to Apple's new CEO, who was panned by many online as dull compared to Steve Jobs. The collective reaction online: Probably not. Many observers seemed underwhelmed by Tuesday's Apple news. Here are five reasons why some people are calling the iPhone 4S announcement a dud: . The rumor mill . Bloggers have been gossiping about the details of the fifth-generation iPhone literally since the iPhone 4 was unveiled in June 2010. In the process, they may have set some unrealistic expectations --- including hopes that the phone would ""radically change,"" which it didn't. The iPhone 4S looks exactly like the iPhone 4. For more on the rumors that didn't come to pass, check out Gawker's ""iPhone 5 Failboard."" Side note: Al Gore, an Apple board member, made an apparently offhand comment that fueled speculation Apple might announce not one but TWO iPhones on Tuesday. Again, high expectations. The wait . Apple usually announces a new iPhone in June. This year it waited until October, amid speculation that it was having trouble getting the parts it needed to manufacture the new version of the phone. Those extra four months gave the aforementioned rumor mill a little more time to rev up. Dull presentation . This was the first center-stage presentation for Tim Cook, who replaced Apple co-founder Steve Jobs as CEO on August 24 amid reports of Jobs' ailing health. Cook is notably less outgoing and charismatic than Jobs, and the company's presenters Tuesday took their time getting to the meat of the event -- the iPhone 4S announcement. That produced lots of chatter on Twitter and elsewhere that the company had nothing significant to say. A day in the life of an iPhone addict . Stocks also reacted bizarrely to the news, falling as much as 5% before closing 0.5% down for the day, CNNMoney reports. ""There's nothing wrong with a company coming out with an incremental improvement, but with a big news conference comes the expectation of something big,"" Jeff Kagan, a technology analyst, told CNNMoney's David Goldman. ""This wasn't big."" The name . When the iPhone 3GS debuted in 2009, critics were similarly unimpressed. Maybe that has something to do with the name. Many people expected Apple to announce a completely redesigned iPhone 5. iPhone 4S sounds much more like a facelift of a current product -- which is fair because that's what it is. It looks the same . This is perhaps the biggest reason people aren't wowed by the iPhone 4S: It has exactly the same shell as the iPhone 4. The rumor mill wanted to see a phone with a ""teardrop"" shaped back and a bigger screen. No such luck.

"(CNN)In spite of a successful rocket launch on Saturday, things didn't quite work out as SpaceX had hoped, when it tried to make history with an experiment. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off as scheduled at 4:47 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a routine mission to resupply the International Space Station. What went up is doing fine. What came down didn't quite, but the the rocket scientists were almost counting on that, and they're not too disappointed. The company tried to land the first section of the rocket, which is 14 stories tall, back down gingerly and on its feet on Earth, while the rest of the rocket continued on. A floating landing pad was waiting out in the Atlantic ocean for the booster. It made it there, but came down a little too hard, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in a tweet. ""Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time."" Don't lose it; reuse it . Normally, once it has vaulted the rest of the rocket to space, the huge booster falls back into the ocean as, basically, garbage. That has been compared to throwing away a Boeing 747 passenger jet after it makes one transatlantic flight. But SpaceX has been determined to change the practice to save millions in costs. Instead of losing the biggest part of the rocket, the company aims to reuse it. The Falcon 9 is made up of two sections, called stages, that contain engines. On top of the rocket is the capsule, which carries its payload. It could also carry astronauts some day. After the launch -- then the separation from the second stage of the rocket -- the Falcon 9 rocket's booster turned around to head back down to the floating platform. The company logo's signature ""X"" marked the spot in the middle of a bull's eye on the black tarmac of the ""spaceport drone ship"" that plowed through the water autonomously -- with no need of human drivers, who could get hurt in a bang-up. Some stuff on the ship did get dinged when the rocket plunked down on it, Musk said in a tweet. Second try . The originally planned launch on Tuesday was scrubbed due to technical issues that turned up in the rocket's second stage. Scratching a launch time is routine for the space industry -- sometimes due to weather, sometimes for technical reasons. As Musk said when a different model rocket self-detonated as a safety measure during a soft-landing test in August: ""Rockets are tricky."" The official mission . Though the landing was a test, the launch was not. The ""Dragon"" capsule is carrying a payload of up to about 5,000 pounds to the ISS. With five previous trips, the resupply missions have become somewhat routine. And this one appeared to be going as planned on Saturday. The Dragon will land back on Earth the usual way in four and a half weeks, plopping into ocean water, after blazing back through the atmosphere with red-hot heat shields glowing at up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The historic part . SpaceX has tried the landing experiment before, with the exception of the last step. If the Falcon 9's booster had pulled off the landing on the platform, that would have been historic. In previous experiments, engineers brought it down softly into the water. Here's how the booster was designed to get back down to Earth. First, fall at a speed of about a mile a minute. Then fire boosters three times in sequence, which Space X describes in colorful terms. The first boost, called the ""boostback burn"" turns the bottom of the first stage downward, then the ""supersonic retro propulsion burn"" cuts the fall speed to about 800 feet per second. Then comes the ""landing burn,"" when the landing gear legs also push out for the set-down. By then the booster descends at a speed of about seven feet per second. Falcon 9 boosters have gone through these phases successfully in two prior tests, SpaceX said. At the end, the rockets tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made them unusable. But that was according to plan, SpaceX said. Setting down with its landing legs onto the platform would have preserved the booster for its possible reuse. Though it didn't work out, SpaceX didn't necessarily expect it to.  It had puts the odds of success of this first try at 50% -- at best.

"An Atlantic City casino is suing poker champion Phillip Ivey Jr., claiming he cheated his way to more than $9.6 million in winnings. The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that Ivey exploited a defect in the line of cards used by the casino to increase his chances of winning in multiple sessions of the card game Baccarat. The Borgata claims that Ivey used a technique called ""edge sorting"" to identify cards by memorizing the unique markings on the back of the card. Gemaco Inc., the manufacturer of the cards used at the casino, was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit. ""The pattern used by Borgata on the back of the cards purchased from Gemaco is required to be perfectly symmetrical so that the back of one card is indistinguishable from the backs of all other cards,"" according to court papers. During play, Ivey and card player Cheng Yin Sun fixated on pattern flaws on the backs of the cards. The two asked to ""turn"" cards so that they could be distinguished from all others cards in the deck, according to court papers. Gemaco did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. ""We believe the lawsuit speaks for itself, and in accordance with company policy, we will not be commenting any further on pending litigation,"" Liza Costandino, a spokeswoman for the Borgata, told CNN. Ivey could not be reached for comment. According to the court documents, Ivey set up four sessions of Baccarat in 2012. For each session, he requested a private area in the pit, an automatic shuffler for the cards and a dealer who spoke Mandarin Chinese. Ivey was accompanied by Sun, who communicated with the card dealer in Mandarin to instruct the dealer on how to turn the cards as they were dealt, the lawsuit alleges. Once Ivey identified the good and bad cards based on their markings, he was able to tilt the odds of the game in his favor in 2012, winning $2.4 million in April,  $1.6 million in May, $4.8 million in July and $825,000 in October of that year. Attempts to reach Sun were unsuccessful Sunday. ""Ivey's true motive, intention, and purpose in negotiating these playing arrangements was to create a situation in which he could surreptitiously manipulate what he knew to be a defect in the playing cards in order to gain an unfair advantage over Borgata,"" according to court papers. This alleged incident of cheating is not the first time Ivey had been accused of using ""edge sorting"" techniques, according to the lawsuit. In August 2012, Ivey was accused of cheating at Crockfords casino in London in a game of Punto Banco, which is similar to Baccarat, according to the suit. The Borgata suit claims they confronted Ivey about the Crockfords allegations on his October visit, and the poker player ""did not want to talk about it."" According to his website, Ivey began his career as professional gambler at 17 using a fake ID to enter casinos in Atlantic City. Since then he has won nine bracelets at the World Series of Poker. Ivey represents other elite high-stakes poker players on his own ""Team Ivey.""","The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa is suing poker champion Phillip Ivey Jr.

"(CNN)Sri Lanka's current president Mahinda Rajapaksa has conceded defeat to rival Maithripala Sirisena in the country's presidential election, bringing an end to a decade of leadership increasingly criticized as corrupt and nepotistic. Rajapaksa acknowledged the defeat on his official Twitter account Friday, writing: ""I value and respect our democratic process and the people's verdict, and look forward to the peaceful transition of power."" Sirisena would be sworn in at 6 p.m. local time in Colombo's Independence Square, Dhanushka Ramanayake, the head of his media unit, said. The defeat of the once untouchable president, the longest-serving political leader in the region, was the result of a failed electoral gamble. In November, the 69-year-old called elections two years earlier than required, only to be shocked by the defection of many key political allies, including the man who would unseat him. The defections apparently wrong-footed Rajapaksa, and the opposition had the better of the campaign, say analysts. ""He didn't expect the candidate to be Sirisena,"" said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. ""I think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change."" Unexpected departure . Sirisena, 63, served as general-secretary of Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party and health minister in his cabinet, before switching allegiance to a broad opposition alliance that proved to be the former president's most serious political challenge. The unwieldy coalition includes the center-right United National Party, the hardline Sinhala Buddhist Jathika Hela Urumaya as well as parties representing the substantial Tamil and Muslim minorities. The alliance could prove fractious as Sirisena pursues his ambitious agenda, said political scientist Dayan Jayatilleka. ""Sirisena not only has this coalition to hold together, he has to do so having promised a fast-track program of drastic political reform,"" he said. ""One doesn't know how this coalition will handle that."" During a campaign focused on Rajapaksa's perceived nepotism and dynastic urges, Sirisena pledged to weaken the powers of the presidency, crack down on corruption and hold fresh parliamentary election within 100 days. 'Heartland appeal' A former Maoist, Sirisena was jailed as a young political activist, before being entering mainstream politics and being elected as a parliamentarian in 1989. The farmer-turned-politician comes from a humble background in the rice-producing North Central Province -- credentials that appealed to Rajapaksa's political base in the Sinhalese heartland, said Jayatilleka. ""He's a Sinhala Buddhist from a peasant background -- you couldn't get more mainstream than that in Sri Lankan politics,"" he said. ""He's someone that the Sinhalese would trust."" But he also had the overwhelming backing of the country's substantial Tamil and Muslim minorities, who had been alienated by Rajapaksa's perceived failure to advance national reconciliation efforts in the wake of the country's decades-long civil war, and perceived tolerance of hardline Buddhist extremists blamed for stoking anti-Muslim violence. READ MORE: Fascists in saffron robes? The rise of Bodu Bala Sena . Luster faded . Rajapaksa was elected president in 2005 and returned to office in 2010, a year after government forces routed the Tamil Tigers rebels to end the country's 25-year civil war. The victory remained his main political asset, contributing to a ""rock star appeal,"" said Jayatilleke. But in recent years, the luster seemed to have faded for voters, with criticisms that his presidency had become increasingly authoritarian, power-hungry and dynastic. Three of Rajapaksa's brothers occupied powerful positions: Basil as the Minister of Economic Development, Gotabaya as Defense Secretary and Chamal as the Speaker of Parliament. Following his 2010 reelection, in which he earned 58% of the vote, an emboldened Rajapaksa amended the constitution to concentrate power in the presidential office and remove term limits, allowing for a tilt at an unprecedented third term. Many Sri Lankans felt the move excessive, said Saravanamuttu. ""They want the force of the executive president trimmed or abolished."" Congratulations flow . World leaders were quick to offer their congratulations to the incoming president. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted that he had called Sirisena, and congratulated ""the people of Sri Lanka on the peaceful & democratic poll process."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Rajapaksa on accepting the results ""in the proud tradition of peaceful and orderly transfers of power,"" and said he looked forward to working with Sirisena on implementing his platform of building a ""Sri Lanka that is peaceful, inclusive, democratic, and prosperous."" Jayatilleke said there was a sense of satisfaction in Sri Lanka that, five years after the end of a decades-long civil war, the country had witnessed a smooth transfer of power. ""That's something that any society can be proud of,"" he said. CNN's Sumnima Udas and Iqbal Athas contributed to this story.","Sri Lanka's Mahinda Rajapaksa concedes defeat to rival in presidential elections .

"(CNN)In the aftermath of the heinous attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in France, many are tweeting and writing in solidarity: Je suis Charlie. But I'm not. Because I am not Charlie. Of course, I unequivocally support the right to free speech. Period. And I also believe in choosing to exercise that right responsibly and respectfully.  That's why I would not have published cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed, insulting 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide in the process (and no, I wouldn't have published many of Charlie Hebdo's cartoons insulting Judaism and Christianity, either). In no way should this be taken -- as it has been by some on Twitter -- to suggest that I somehow condone the killings of Charlie Hebdo's staff. That's a ridiculously insulting idea and just plain wrong. It's possible to honor and protect the free speech rights of publications like Charlie Hebdo while simultaneously believing such cartoons are unnecessarily disrespectful and offensive. As others have pointed out, in the wake of the Paris attacks we've conflated support for free speech with support for the actual speech in question. But while I unquestionably support the free speech rights of the KKK and ""god hates fags"" protesters, for example, that clearly doesn't mean I would support, never mind join in, their hateful messages. Some on the right insist that media should have to re-print Charlie Hebdo's anti-Islam cartoons or else they're cowardly. However, this is a fundamental perversion of free speech, to say the least. There is no inconsistency between supporting free speech for Charlie Hebdo's cartoonists and finding the content of some of their cartoons offensive and disrespectful. I don't profess to be a scholar of Islam. But it's plain that some branches or interpretations of the faith view any depictions of the Prophet Mohammed as blasphemy.  That doesn't mean that all Muslims who see such depictions as blasphemy think the appropriate response is violence; far from it. But a radical few do, and, as Middle East commentator Juan Cole has argued, they exploit such defamations against the prophet to try to radicalize others in the faith. Unfortunately, there are some in the West who think all of Islam is tainted, and who -- despite there being plenty of violence and intolerance in the texts and histories of Judaism and Christianity -- believe Islam is somehow uniquely violent and intolerant. But when we mistakenly believe that a narrow and violent interpretation of Islam is the only true version, we play right into the hands of the radical zealots who want the world, including all Muslims, to believe precisely that. The reality is that the Muslim world isn't just the leadership of Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also Indonesia and Mali. And it's worth pointing out that several Muslim countries have elected or appointed female heads of state, something the United States has yet to manage. And also that while much remains to be done on advancing gay rights, gay bars do still exist in Lebanon and in Jordan. Unfortunately, about 60 percent of Americans don't know a single Muslim, and so may only know about Islam what the media reports about terrorists. It is important to remember that there are a wide variety of interpretations and practices of Islam worldwide, including an active debate on those interpretations among scholars and spiritual leaders. Sadly, I have to wonder if Charlie Hebdo had been attacked for cartoons insulting Christians, whether there would be a similar outpouring in support of the magazine, especially in the United States. After all, many of the same people outraged just a month ago about the alleged ""War on Christmas"" have no qualms about launching a ""War on Islam"" because, well, it's not their religion being mischaracterized and insulted. It unsettles me to think that the reason so much of the outpouring of support for Charlie Hebdo is driven not just by the violence suffered or a defense of free speech, but by the opportunity to implicitly support jabs at Islam. But judging by some of the coverage, it seems a fair assumption to make. Indeed, on the same day of the attack in Paris, a bomb was placed outside the offices of an NAACP chapter in Colorado. Thankfully, no one died in that attack, but it was still a bomb on U.S. soil and yet the story was absent from much of the mainstream media. Had Muslims been the suspects, I think it's fair to say there would have been much more attention paid. As someone with a public voice, my free speech benefits from an extra megaphone, and while the principle of free speech means I can say what I want whenever I want it, in practice I try to think carefully about the impact of my words -- and how they might be felt among others whether or not they share my belief system. Personally, I believe in not saying something just because I want to speak, but because I want to be heard.  So, for instance, I don't casually condemn or denigrate people's religions because I want people of faith to hear me. All religions face the struggle of progressing from rigid tradition to evolving modernity, and so I want my voice to be clear and constructive in supporting that progress. Put another way, when I open my mouth, I don't want to be part of the problem, I want to be part of the solution.  I want to help Islam and Christianity and Judaism and society in general become more open and inclusive and democratic and liberated. Free speech is fundamentally essential to that project.  So is respect.  In the aftermath of the heinous attacks in Paris, it's important we remember that free speech and respect can go hand-in-hand.","Sally Kohn: It's possible to back free speech but object to Charlie Hebdo cartoons .

"A day after a spectacular meteor blast shook Russia's Urals region, the cleanup operation got under way Saturday in the hard-hit Russian city of Chelyabinsk. Although some buildings were unscathed when sonic waves from the Friday morning explosion reverberated through the region, others lost some or most windows or had walls come tumbling down. More than 1,000 people were injured, including more than 200 children, according to news reports. Many of them were hit by flying glass. Most of those hurt were in the Chelyabinsk region; the majority of injuries are not thought to be serious. However, one woman was flown to Moscow to be treated for a spinal injury resulting from the shock wave from the blast, state media reported. About 50 people were still hospitalized Saturday. Altogether, more than 4,000 buildings, mostly apartment blocks, were damaged and 200,000 square meters (77,220 square miles) of glass were broken, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency cited the Chelyabinsk regional emergencies ministry as saying Saturday. 5 things to know about meteors and asteroids . Local officials have estimated the damage at more than 1 billion rubles (more than $33 million), RIA Novosti said. Chelyabinsk Gov. Mikhail Yurevich promised compensation to all those affected, the official Itar-Tass news agency said. With temperatures dipping well below freezing at night, the need to fix windows left gaping by the blast is urgent. The city of Chelyabinsk was functioning normally Saturday as the repair work began. Workers swept up broken glass, boarded up holes and began fitting new panes of glass in some buildings. ""This is no exaggeration"" Residents told CNN of their shock as they saw, heard and felt the awesome blast, and the chaos and confusion they witnessed in the moments afterward, when no one knew what had happened. Many were relieved nothing worse came to pass and believe the city had a lucky escape as fragments of the meteor came raining down. Denis Kuznetsov, a 23-year-old historian from Chelyabinsk, told CNN via e-mail that he had heard and felt the shock wave despite being far from the center of the city. At first there was a blinding flash lasting several seconds, which made him want to shut his eyes. The light shone ""like 10 suns,"" he said. ""This is no exaggeration."" Kuznetsov said he experienced what felt like ""a push,"" as a sound wave passed through his body. ""For some seconds I simply stood,"" amid the sound of breaking glass, he said. After calming his parents, Kuznetsov tried to call friends, but all cellphone coverage was down. The Internet still worked, however, and he managed to reach a friend in the city center who told of emergency responders heading into the streets. At first, confusion was widespread, he said, with many people believing the boom had to do with a satellite or plane.  But within an hour or so, news broadcasts declared it was a meteorite. ""There was no panic. All behaved quietly,"" he said. Schools and many offices closed. Kuznetsov monitored the news, as the reported number of victims ""grew hour by hour,"" he said. ""Thank God no one died."" Meteor tweets we wish we'd thought of . CNN iReporter Max Chuykov saw the meteor trail from the city of Yekaterinburg. He shared on Instagram that it was close to the ground. Ekaterina Shlygina posted to CNN iReport and wrote on Instagram: ""Upon Chelyabinsk a huge fireball has exploded. It wasn't an aircraft."" ""Tiny asteroid"" packs a big punch . About 24,000 emergency response workers were mobilized across the Chelyabinsk region Saturday, Itar-Tass cited the governor's office as saying. Hospitals, kindergartens and schools were among the buildings affected by the blast, said Vladimir Stepanov of the National Center for Emergency Situations at the Russian Interior Ministry. West of the city, authorities sealed off a section of a frozen lake where it was believed a sizable meteorite crashed through the ice. But a team of divers has found no trace of any meteorite in the lake, an emergencies ministry spokeswoman told state media on Saturday. Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet . The meteor was a once-in-a-century event, NASA officials said, describing it as a ""tiny asteroid."" The space agency revised its estimate of the meteor's size upward late Friday from 49 feet (15 meters) to 55 feet (17 meters), and its estimated mass from 7,000 tons to 10,000 tons. The space agency also increased the estimated amount of energy released in the meteor's explosion from about 300 to nearly 500 kilotons. By comparison, the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 released an estimated 15 kilotons of energy. The whole event, from the meteor's atmospheric entry to its disintegration in the air above central Russia, took 32.5 seconds, NASA said. Saving Earth from asteroids . The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believe one meteoroid entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments. Amateur video footage showed a bright white streak moving rapidly across the sky before exploding with an even brighter flash and a deafening bang. The explosion occurred about 9:20 a.m. local time, as many people were out and about. A once in a lifetime event . Russians captured vivid images, many using dash cameras inside their vehicles. Dash cameras are popular in Russia for several reasons, including possible disputes over traffic accidents and the corrupt reputations of police in many areas. Drivers install the cameras for their own protection and to document incidents they could be caught in. Opinion: Meteor shows why it is crucial to keep an eye on the sky . Five regions of Russia, one of them Chelyabinsk, are thought to have been affected, Itar-Tass said. RIA Novosti cited emergencies ministry officials as saying three regions and Kazakhstan were involved. NASA said on its website that the meteor was the largest reported since 1908, when the famous Tunguska event took place in remote Siberia. In that incident, an asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded, leveling about 80 million trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two-thirds the size of Rhode Island -- but leaving no crater. ""We would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years on average,"" said Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. ""When you have a fireball of this size, we would expect a large number of meteorites to reach the surface, and in this case there were probably some large ones."" NASA estimates 4,700 'potentially hazardous' asteroids . In what astronomers said was an unrelated coincidence, a larger asteroid, called 2012 DA14, passed relatively close to Earth around 2:24 p.m. ET Friday. Stargazers in Australia, Asia and Eastern Europe could see the asteroid with the aid of a telescope or binoculars, but it never got closer than 17,100 miles to the planet's surface. The Russian meteor was about one-third the size of the asteroid. The two bodies were on very different trajectories, scientists said.","State media: 50 still in hospital, one woman with a spinal injury flown to Moscow .

"A New York City woman whose teenage autistic son disappeared in October may be facing every mother's nightmare. On Thursday night, police found legs and an arm next to the East River in Queens as well as size 5½ Air Jordan sneakers that match the shoes of her child, Avonte Oquendo, the teen's family attorney, David Perecman, told CNN on Friday. Investigators also found size 16 dark jeans, the same size the teen wore, and underwear, the lawyer said. Avonte's mother, Vanessa Fontaine, who has passionately advocated for a search for her son, will provide investigators with her DNA so they can determine whether the remains are the child's, the attorney said. ""She doesn't seem to me to have ever lost hope,"" Perecman told reporters Friday. ""This morning when I spoke to her she just said, 'You know, it's not Avonte until it's Avonte.'

""My thoughts are that my son is still out there, and I want everyone to continue to help me search for my son,"" Fontaine said. ""He is not gone."" The idea of her son wandering around New York was terrifying because he cannot communicate verbally, she said soon after his disappearance. ""He has the mental capacity of a 7- or 8-year-old,"" she said. Avonte was supposed to be with a monitor at all times, Fontaine said. But surveillance footage that captured her son bounding out of Center Boulevard School on Long Island at 12:38 p.m on October 4 did not show him with a supervisor. ""He doesn't know that, you know, 'I can get hurt in the street, someone can grab me and take me,' "" his mother said. ""He doesn't know that. He doesn't know fear."" Authorities said they have worked hard to find the teenager. They deployed sniffer dogs, combed surveillance footage, searched the sewer system, put up posters for missing persons and filled the streets with fliers. There were alerts on the New York subway and messages in local newspapers. Divers used sonar to explore the city's waterways. ""Obviously, we have devoted a tremendous amount of resources to the search,"" then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN affiliate WABC-TV in October. ""Unfortunately, we are not hopeful that we're going to find this young man alive, but we are continuing our search."" Fontaine said she wanted police to try new methods.

"(CNN)Tensions are running high following the massacre at the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on Wednesday, and that is exactly how it should be. The correct, human response to an atrocity of this nature is revulsion and deep moral anger. Far from precluding rational understanding, such anger should cause us to demand sensible, productive analysis and to brush aside comments from politicians or pundits that do not live up to the seriousness of the moment. The ""clash of civilizations"" has become a popularized frame that is wheeled out whenever an attack by Islamic extremists is carried out against a Western target. It casts a democratic, liberal West as being locked in an epic struggle with a backward and violently intolerant Muslim world. According to this narrative, the West, which treasures freedom of speech, has this week come under attack from an Islamic culture that refuses to accept any instance of what it regards as blasphemy. Voices from the left and right can be heard repeating the assumptions underlying these sweeping generalizations. Consider two examples from the United Kingdom this week. Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigrant party UKIP, opined that there are people living in Britain from other cultures who ""hate us"" and represent a ""fifth column,"" thus implicating entire communities as enemies of the nation. Separately, the liberal British journalist Jon Snow tweeted: ""Paris: brutal clash of civilizations: Europe's belief in freedom of expression vs those for whom death is a weapon in defending their beliefs."" Snow of course knows very well that a handful of armed men do not constitute a ""civilization,"" just as he knows what the phrase he employed is universally understood to mean. With the far right on the march across Europe, and violent reprisals being carried out against blameless French Muslims, now is not the time for inflammatory or even careless language. Moreover, these two-dimensional representations do nothing to help us make sense of what is actually going on. Ascribing characteristics to entire ""civilizations"" as though they are uncomplicated and homogenous, containing no competing or contradictory forces, is to tell ourselves a fairy tale rather than to face the world as it really is. Take the idea that freedom of speech is a Western value. Clearly Europe and North America enjoy a high degree of freedom of expression. But the elected governments of many Western states also provide material support to some of the most repressive regimes in the world. In Saudi Arabia Friday, dissident blogger Raif Badawi was publicly flogged for the crime of facilitating debate and insulting Islam. In states such as Bahrain and Egypt, those expressing unacceptable opinions can find themselves jailed, tortured, and even massacred, while the governments of the United States and United Kingdom continue to arm the regimes responsible. France too is a major weapons dealer in the region, supplying states such as the UAE and Qatar, the latter of which jailed the poet Mohammed al-Ajami for 15 years for ""insulting the Emir"" and calling for the overthrow of the government. The support given to these tyrannies by Washington, London and Paris is not an aberration, but a core component of long-established strategy. If democracy and freedom of speech are inherently and uncomplicatedly ""Western values,"" how does one account for this? Similarly, if democracy and freedom of speech are antithetical to the values of Arab or Muslim culture, then how to explain the thousands, even millions of people in the Middle East that have, especially since late 2010, fought and risked their lives for precisely these things, often against regimes backed by Western states?  Are we to airbrush from the picture those participants in the Arab uprisings who are both Muslim and defenders of human rights, ignoring their bravery and their sacrifices? Freedom has its champions and opponents in all parts of the world. The degree of freedom secured at any given moment merely reflects how the struggle between the two sides has played out so far, rather than some innate cultural attributes. The social systems of the West were not born democratic, but became that way through often painful periods of internal conflict, France being the classic example. Likewise, the extreme puritanism of ISIS and al Qaeda has not emanated smoothly and naturally from the cultures and religious practices of the Middle East (where it continues to be overwhelmingly rejected). In the modern era, it was originally imposed by force in the Arabian Peninsula when the House of Saud conquered the area in the early twentieth century. The Saudis have since promoted fundamentalism, often as a way of suppressing more secular forms of opposition, and have lost control of the results with disastrous consequences. The roots of Islamic extremism are complex. Western state support for regimes like Saudi Arabia, and pursuit of disastrous wars, not least in Iraq, may not be the decisive causal factors. But they are part of the mix, and profoundly unhelpful. What we need now is not false division between ""East"" and ""West"", but for democrats on both sides to stand together against extremism and violence in all its forms.","'Clash of civilizations' line wheeled out when Islamic extremists attack Western target is sweeping generalization, David Wearing says .
These two-dimensional representations do nothing to help us make sense of what is actually going on, Wearing writes .
What is needed is for Muslim and Western democrats to stand together against extremism and violence in all its forms, he says ."
"This year is the centennial of the First World War. One-hundred years ago this month, in April 1914, no one thought there would be a war. But war began, triggered by events in Eastern Europe, by the end of July. It came as an enormous shock, in retrospect almost like the Titanic hitting an iceberg. In the end, it shattered Europe, cost tens of millions of lives, bankrupted countries and changed forever those who survived the horrors. A century later, our focus is again on Eastern Europe, the site of a regional conflict that threatens to entangle the world's leading powers. The situation in Ukraine is a perilous one, much more so than our current debate acknowledges. In Russia, we are dealing with the largest country in the world geographically, a country that possesses thousands of nuclear weapons, plenty of ballistic missiles and a ruthlessly determined leader motivated by nationalism and an imperial drive: a leader who also has an entrenched machine capable of keeping him in power for a long time. In Ukraine, we are dealing with an ally that fought alongside us in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a nation now threatened with conquest by a much stronger neighbor against which it cannot defend itself. In Europe, we are dealing with a continent that for more than half a century has relied on the United States to guarantee peace, security and freedom. We have kept that promise through NATO, the alliance that war in Eastern Europe threatens seriously to undermine. And in the United States, we are dealing with a nation weary of war after more than a decade spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a public wary of more armed intervention abroad. We need a national debate on what our policy is going to be.  And then we need to engage our friends in Europe on what our policy is going to be. As retired former NATO Commander Gen. Wesley Clark and his colleague Dr. Phillip Karber, a former Defense Department official, detail in their recent report from Ukraine, the Obama Pentagon has adopted a position of not helping that country with any offensive weapons.  Offensive weapons including, for example, Kevlar vests, night vision equipment and aviation fuel. So while the United States has sent thousands of meals ready to eat (Army rations) to a country that is an agricultural exporter, the administration has refused to send even nonlethal equipment that would help Ukraine defend itself and possibly avert war. Instead of sending military supplies to Ukraine, we hear talk of more sanctions. And yet, as I discuss in my podcast this week, I suspect it will be apparent very quickly that sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin are going to be irrelevant. He is a very tough man. He heads a very big country with immense natural resources. He can cause pain fully as much as his neighbors can cause him pain.  He can block American shipments to Afghanistan from coming through Russia by the northern route.  He can cut off natural gas flow to Western Europe.  He has a veto at the U.N. Security Council, and can obstruct further sanctions against Iran. This is a very difficult situation, and we are now in two enormous dangers. First, of the Obama administration doing too little, in which case the world will become less safe as we show weakness to our allies and the Russians seek to reconstitute the Soviet empire. And second, of doing things too clumsily, in which case, as one-hundred years ago, a bad combination of miscalculations, delusions, laws and alliances could land us in a war no one intends.","Newt Gingrich: A century ago, no one expected events in Eastern Europe to trigger war .

"Iranian cooking can be seen as a metaphor for the country itself: It's tart, sweet, fragrant and vastly complex. It's one of the world's oldest, yet largely obscure, culinary landscapes, with roots dating back to the Persian Empire. In homes in Tehran, pots bubble for hours to braise tough cuts of meat in khoreshes, or stews, with all manner of local fruits like pomegranates and dried apricots and nuts like pistachios and walnuts. In the bazaars, there's hot and fresh sangak, a staple oblong flatbread, and trays of sweet pastries perfumed with rose and orange blossom water. Any visitor would be remiss to not try the chelo (chelow) kabab, as it's king here; juicy skewers of meat and minced meat are served on heaping plates of rice steamed with saffron, the most expensive spice in the world, and grilled tomatoes. Here's a recipe to get started with even if Iran isn't on your travel itinerary. Skewered Ground Lamb Kabab (Kabab-e kubideh) (Serves 6) Reprinted with permission by Mage Publishers from ""Food of Life: Ancient Persian and Modern Iranian Cooking and Ceremonies"" by Najmieh Batmanglij. For the kabab: . 2 pounds twice-ground lamb shoulder or beef (85%) 2 teaspoons sea salt . 2 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper . ¼ teaspoon ground saffron dissolved in 1 tablespoon rose water, or ¼ teaspoon turmeric . 2 tablespoons sumac powder . ½ teaspoon baking soda . 2 medium yellow onions, finely grated . 2 cloves garlic, peeled and grated . Zest of 1 lime . For basting: . ½ cup salted butter or olive oil . 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice . For cooking and garnish: . 14 flat 3/4-inch skewers . 1 package (12 ounces) lavash bread . ½ cup sumac powder . 2 limes, cut in half, and Persian basil . 1. To make the meat paste, in a warm, wide skillet, combine all the kabab ingredients. Knead with your hands for about 5 minutes. Cover the paste and let stand for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. 2. Start charcoal at least 30 minutes before you want to cook, and let it burn until the coals are glowing evenly. For this kabab, you want the coals to be as high as possible, close to the meat and at their hottest. Do not spread the charcoal thin. If you are using an indoor grill, make sure it is preheated and very hot. 3. Using damp hands (keep a bowl of water next to you), divide the meat paste into equal lumps about the size of small oranges. Shape each into a 5-inch-long sausage and mold it firmly around a flat, sword-like skewer. Pinch the two ends to firmly attach meat to skewer. Arrange on a baking sheet, separated from each other. Cover and keep in a cool place. 4. For the baste, melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the lime juice. Keep warm. Spread lavash bread on a serving platter. 5. Arrange the skewers on the fire 3 inches above the coals (bricks on either side make good platforms; keep in mind that the ground meat should not touch the grill). After a few seconds, turn the meat gently to help it attach to the skewers and to prevent it from falling off (these first few seconds are important for cooking skewered ground kabab). 6. Grill the meat for 3 to 5 minutes, turning frequently. Baste just before removing from the fire. Avoid overcooking. The meat should be seared on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. 7. Place all the kabab skewers on the lavash bread platter. Keep on skewers until ready to serve and cover with lavash bread to keep warm. Loosen the meat from each skewer and slide the meat off using a piece of bread. Sprinkle with sumac and lime juice to taste. Serve with fresh basil and yogurt and cucumber dip. Nush-e Jan! For a ground chicken variation: In a food processor, place 2 pounds chicken thighs, 1 small onion (peeled and chopped), 3 cloves garlic (peeled), zest of 2 limes, 2 teaspoons fine-grind sea salt, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, ¼ teaspoon ground saffron dissolved in 1 tablespoon rose water, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Pulse for a few minutes until you have a thick paste. Do not over mix. Transfer to a glass container. Cover and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Continue with step 2.","Chelo kabab is considered the national dish of Iran .

"Honolulu, Hawaii (CNN)The United States is hitting North Korea with a new set of economic sanctions after determining the country was behind last month's computer hack at Sony. The White House said a new executive order targets leaders in North Korea's government, preventing them from accessing property and entering the United States. The isolated nuclear regime, which has denied involvement in the Sony hack, was already subject to a strict set of U.S. economic restrictions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has maintained North Korea was behind the broad computer breach at Sony, despite evidence that some technology experts said points instead to former employees of the studio. On Friday officials said the new set of sanctions was further indication of their confidence in North Korea's culpability, and said that private tech firms aren't privy to the intelligence proving Pyongyang's guilt. President Barack Obama signed the executive order putting the new sanctions in place on the second-to-last day of his winter vacation in Hawaii. Before his vacation began in mid-December Obama said North Korea was responsible for the attack and the United States was preparing a response. The White House said Friday's announcement reflected the beginning of that response. RELATED: Obama says North Korea's hack not war, but 'cybervandalism' ""The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others,"" Obama wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner. The country poses a ""continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States,"" Obama wrote. Among the agencies targeted by the new sanctions Friday was the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency the United States said was responsible for ""major cyberoperations"" in North Korea. The new sanctions also target officials at North Korea's Mining Development Trading Corporation, which the United States says is responsible for the country's arms dealing and weapons export business. Seven officials who represent North Korea's arms dealing trade in Africa, Iran, Russia and Syria were designated by the U.S. Treasury as subject to the new economic sanctions. U.S. administration officials said the individuals targeted by Friday's sanctions are not thought to be responsible for the Sony hack. But in exposing their names and positions as North Korean arms dealers, the United States hopes to stymie their business prospects. Their names were not publicly known until now. U.S. officials said they didn't know whether the 10 North Korean officials listed by the Treasury Department held any assets in U.S. institutions. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions were meant to ""isolate key North Korean entities and disrupt the activities of close to a dozen critical North Korean operatives."" ""We will continue to use this broad and powerful tool to expose the activities of North Korean government officials and entities,"" Lew said. RELATED: North Korea lambasts U.S. over 'The Interview,' says Obama is the 'culprit' Speaking to CNN late last month, Obama said the United States would respond to the Sony hacking ""proportionately,"" without specifying what actions his government might take to punish Kim Jong Un's government for its role in the attack. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said on Friday, ""Today's actions are the first aspect of our response."" That seemed to indicate the widespread Internet outages reported in North Korea last week were not a retaliatory response to the Sony hack, though administration officials would not confirm the blackout came at the hands of the United States. ""There are many possible explanations for (North Korea's) Internet outage, including the possibility that they had ended up doing it to themselves,"" one U.S. official said.","The U.S. announces new sanctions against North Korea .
The sanctions come in the wake of a cyberattack against Sony, attributed to North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has canceled his travel for the remainder of the year as he battles cancer, one of his foundations said Tuesday. Tutu, 83, has battled prostate cancer for years. In a Twitter post Tuesday, he thanked supporters ""for the well wishes and concern."" ""You may know I canceled my trip to Rome for the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates due to a reaction to a new treatment for my prostate and strengthening my bones,"" Tutu said in a statement posted to his Facebook page. ""It is benign and these issues are par for the course."" The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation first announced the news Tuesday. It wasn't clear if or when the South African icon might resume traveling. His daughter and that foundation's executive director, Mpho Tutu, said the changed plans don't mean there is a crisis, adding that her father is simply at home while his body adjusts to new medication. An Anglican priest ordained in 1961, Tutu earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end apartheid in his native South Africa. He went on to play a key role in that nation's transition from the apartheid era, including serving as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at the direction of then-South African President Nelson Mandela. He has remained active well into his 80s, including with the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation and other organizations.","NEW: ""These issues are par for the course,"" Desmond Tutu says on Facebook .

"This important leader handles the debt crisis with grace, navigating expertly between austerity and growth. The leader's opponents grumble, more out of jealousy than genuine opposition, and loyal supporters hail the leader as a hero. The leader's popularity soars; re-election is not in question. Meanwhile, unemployment is at an all-time low, and the leader's nation is looking like its own island of prosperity, a beacon to a suffering continent. For President Barack Obama, this is a daydream. For German Chancellor Angela Merkel, this is life. Funny how the most admired leader of the Western world right now, the clearest example we have of consistent success during trying times, is a woman. The pictures in the news, day after day, tell the story: House Speaker John Boehner looks like he hasn't slept in weeks. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell looks like he swallowed a lemon. Sen. Ted Cruz looks bizarrely smug while the world crumbles around him, and Obama can only shake his head and loosen his collar. The only Washington type who was smiling on the front page of the newspaper this week was Janet Yellen, newly nominated by Obama to be the chair of the Federal Reserve, and anointed by one observer as the most powerful woman in world history. Oh, and there was one other person smiling in Washington: Christine Lagarde, chief of the International Monetary Fund, who was in the U.S. capital for the organization's annual meeting and who said just about the only sensible thing anyone in town has said all week on the debt ceiling crisis: ""I hope that in a few weeks' time, we will look back and say, 'What a waste of time that was.' "" This has not been a shining week for the patriarchy. The men in suits dither, posture, plan negotiation sessions and then cancel them, and employ copious military metaphors -- ""wage battle,"" ""refuse to surrender"" -- to no effect. Increasingly they become associated in the minds of the American people with verbs normally used to describe toddlers, such as ""tantrum"" or ""throw a fit."" Competence, meanwhile belongs to the women, particularly in the usually macho world of global finance. Over in Europe, Merkel was re-elected on the basis of her deft handling of the eurozone crisis, and in the United States, monetary policy was entrusted to Yellen. Making the victory extra sweet for women, she was chosen instead of Lawrence Summers, who will forever be remembered for saying women aren't that good at math. And this moment of female triumph extends beyond mere competence to unfathomable bravery. The hero of the moment -- the person who has been shot at, nearly killed and is still not afraid to talk -- is a heroine: 16-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who was nominated for a Nobel Prize and who told Jon Stewart this week that if she were faced with a Taliban gunman such as the one who shot her last year she would, once again, explain to him how important education is for girls. (In response Stewart asked if he could adopt her.) Perhaps this will be remembered as the week when everything shifted, when we realized that leaving groups of men in charge of global decisions and of facing down terrorists is not a good idea, and we'd better calmly hand the reins over to the women. Don't laugh. It happened in Iceland. Lagarde described the transfer of power recently on a panel at the Clinton Global Initiative. She explained how women brought Iceland out of its recession. After the economy crashed, ""the banks, the funds, the government -- everything was taken over by women,"" she told The Wall Street Journal. ""So when it's messy, you get the women in. But when the mess is sorted,"" she added, ""keep the women.""","Hanna Rosin: A leader guiding a nation to prosperity? Obama? No, Angela Merkel in Germany .

"A billionaire's foundation announced Thursday a one-off $1 million award to South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu for ""his lifelong commitment to speaking truth to power."" The foundation, which promotes good governance in the continent, was established by Sudan-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim. An anti-apartheid leader and Nobel laureate, Tutu is an outspoken critic on issues affecting the continent and beyond. ""Tutu is and has throughout his life been one of Africa's great voices for justice, freedom, democracy and responsible, responsive government,"" the Mo Ibrahim Foundation said in a statement. ""In everything he stands for, says and does, he displays a consistent determination to give a voice to the voiceless and to speak the uncomfortable truth."" Last month, Tutu reiterated his calls that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and former U.S. President George W. Bush should be ""made to answer"" at the International Criminal Court for initiating the 2003 Iraq War. At the time, the two leaders cited Iraq's ambitions to develop weapons of mass destruction as reasons for the war. No significant caches of chemical or biological weapons were found after the invasion. Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, and later chaired South Africa's reconciliation commission to examine apartheid-era crimes. The London-based foundation also awards an annual $5 million prize to a former African head of state who practices good governance. Only a handful of leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, have won the good governance award since it was launched in 2007. The foundation did not award the prize on certain years, saying there were no qualified candidates.","Tutu has been outspoken on issues affecting the African continent and beyond .

"(CNN) -- An armed Christian organization, Right Wing Extreme, will protect a church that is planning to host an ""International Burn a Quran Day"" on September 11, the church's pastor said Tuesday. The Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, says it is hosting the event to remember 9/11 victims and to take a stand against Islam. With promotions on its website and Facebook page, the nondenominational church invites Christians to burn the Muslim holy book. Dove's Facebook page, set up for the September event, has nearly 6,000 fans. The initiative has also drawn critics. Dove World Outreach Center Pastor Terry Jones has accepted the support of Right Wing Extreme, which he said offered to come to the church with between 500 and 2,000 men on September 11. He described the organization as an armed civilian militia group. ""There is a need for this protection. It is absolutely necessary in light of the death and terror threats we have received,"" Jones said in an e-mail to CNN. ""We have met with the FBI who have warned us of the threats they have seen, not only against us but against other targets in Florida. We have personally received threats by phone and many by mail,"" he said. No one from Right Wing Extreme was immediately available to comment on Tuesday. But in a statement sent to CNN by the Dove World Outreach Center, Right Wing Extreme founder Shannon Carson said: ""We fully support Dove World Outreach Center and its efforts to put an end to the notion that Islam is a peaceful religion. Islam is a violent cult with the goal of world domination."" Muslims and many other Christians, including some evangelicals, are fighting the church's plan to burn the Quran. Religious leaders in Gainesville have planned an event billed as a ""Gathering for Peace, Understanding and Hope"" on September 10, in response to the church's proposal. The Islamic advocacy group Council on American-Islamic Relations has called on Muslims and others to host ""Share the Quran"" dinners to educate the public. In a statement, the group said it would give out 100,000 copies of the Quran to local, state and national leaders. Separately, Jones has proposed a meeting with Abdul Rauf, the imam at the center of the controversial proposal to build a mosque and Islamic center near New York's ground zero. The meeting would be meant to negotiate a ""peaceful resolution,"" said a statement from Dove World Outreach Center on Tuesday.","The Right Wing Extreme is described as an armed Christian organization .

"SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters)  -- The main runway at Brazil's busiest airport reopened Friday, 10 days after a passenger jet skidded off its rain-slicked surface and crashed, killing almost 200 people in the country's worst aviation disaster. At least 12 people also were killed on the ground when the Tam Airlines plane rammed into a cargo terminal. Authorities opened the recently repaved runway at Sao Paulo's Congonhas Airport even though it has not yet been entirely grooved to drain rainwater and prevent planes from slipping when they touch down. Landings will be restricted in wet weather until the surface is completely grooved, which could take weeks. In the meantime, flights arriving in heavy rains will touch down on the backup runway at Congonhas or be diverted to the city's Guarulhos International Airport. The main runway at Sao Paulo's Congonhas was reopened after being inspected by new Defense Minister Nelson Jobim, who was appointed Wednesday to overhaul Brazil's ailing aviation sector. The defense ministry and the air force oversee airports and air traffic in Brazil. The runway, one of the shortest in the country, has been at the center of a fierce debate over air safety since an Airbus A320 carrying 187 people crashed in a botched landing attempt on July 17. The plane, flown by Brazilian carrier TAM Linhas Aereas, barreled off the landing strip in the rain and rammed into a cargo terminal and gas station, bursting into flames. Everyone on board and at least 12 more on the ground were killed in the accident. Authorities are investigating if the runway, which is known for being slippery, was unsafe for landing in the rain. Investigators also are trying to determine if possible pilot error and mechanical problems contributed to the crash. Air travel in Brazil descended further into chaos after the accident, the second major aviation disaster in the country in 10 months. In September, 154 people were killed when a Boeing 737 clipped wings in midair with a private jet and crashed in the Amazon jungle. The closure of the main runway at Congonhas after the TAM crash forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights and caused a ripple effect of delays around the country. Since then, revolts at ticket counters have become routine and some airlines have even urged passengers to travel by bus. Air travel was slowly starting to return to normal Friday, with fewer delays and cancellations around the country, according to Brazil's airports authority Infraero. At Congonhas, however, 40 percent of all flights were canceled Friday morning before the runway reopened. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"In the areas surrounding the southwest Sri Lankan town of Aluthgama, an idyllic coastal settlement popular with tourists, Muslims and Buddhists have lived side by side peacefully for generations. But a wave of deadly communal violence that followed a rally Sunday by hardline Buddhist nationalist monks has changed that. ""The house I owned was burnt down. My family has nowhere to go,"" Muhsin Shihab, a father of eight children, told CNN Tuesday. His family, which has been sheltering at a local mosque since being displaced by the rioting, hadn't eaten for a day and a half, he said. The rally, organized by the far-right Buddhist group Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force), was called in response to an alleged altercation in the area between a group of young Muslims and a Buddhist monk and his driver on an important Buddhist religious holiday days earlier. Addressing the crowd of thousands Sunday, the BBS's leader, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, gave an inflammatory speech. Video footage from the event shows the orange-robed monk using derogatory terms for Muslims and, to approving roars from the crowd, vowing that if any Muslim laid a hand on a member of the Sinhalese majority -- let alone a monk -- that would ""be the end"" of them. After the rally, Buddhist mobs marched through Muslim neighborhoods, torching and destroying dozens of homes and shops, witnesses told CNN. Following consecutive nights of violence, in which local medical staff say at least four people were killed and sixteen seriously injured, those made homeless by the rioting were sheltering in the town's main mosque Tuesday, shell-shocked and fearful of what may come next. 'A nightmare' Among them was Fasniya Fairooz, an 80-year-old grandmother of three, who was at home when the mob stormed into her house in Seenawatte, a local village comprised of Sinhalese and Muslims. ""We pleaded with the attackers not to harm us. They used abusive language,"" she said. ""They took the Holy Quran and burnt it outside... Then they looted the house."" Her family had nowhere to go, she said. Ahmed Rahamatulla, a father of four from Seenawatte, was also made homeless by the riots. ""I have lost all my belongings. My house was burnt down. All I own today are the clothes my children wear,"" he said. ""I don't know where to go from here. My children are all frightened and in a state of shock."" The surrounding area is in lockdown in the aftermath of the rioting, the country's worst communal violence in years. Soldiers on armored troop carriers watch over once bustling streets; shutters are drawn on the charred remains of arson-hit stores. In a nearby house, U.S. citizen Rameeza Nizar, 47, found herself unexpectedly stranded in her bedridden mother's home during a visit from Washington D.C. for a family event. ""Every night has been a nightmare,"" she told CNN. ""We have not slept for fear there would be attacks. We kept our lights switched off but remained together inside the house."" 'Cycle of fear' Ayoob Saja, a doctor at a local hospital and a Muslim, said his community was in a ""cycle of fear"" as a result of the violence, in which the vast majority of those treated for injuries were Muslims. He said three of the dead were Muslims, two of whom were fatally shot during the rampage on Sunday, and another who died of his injuries Tuesday. The fourth fatality was a Tamil who worked as a watchman on a Muslim-owned farm in the nearby town of Welipenna, and was attacked during continued violence on Monday night. Sixteen people had been seriously injured, he said, including a young man whose leg was amputated Wednesday, while hundreds of others sustained lesser injuries. More than 80 homes were also destroyed in the rioting, he said. While a heavy military presence has been brought in to enforce a curfew and prevent further violence, it has given little comfort to the community, he said. ""The armed forces are supporting the majority,"" he said, referring to the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese who account for about three-quarters of Sri Lanka's population. About 10% of the country is Muslim, according to the 2011 census. ""They are guarding the majority people who attack our people."" The group blamed for inciting the violence, the Bodu Bala Sena, has denied any responsibility. Contacted by CNN, Gnanasara said he was unavailable to comment. But Dilantha Vithanage, the BBS's chief executive, told CNN ""we categorically deny any involvement by our membership in reported attacks."" He said the earlier assault on the monk on a Buddhist holy day had upset people in the Sinhalese community. Referring to Gnanasara's speech, he said: ""It is true our priest spoke in strong words. He blessed the people after chanting verses. He preached to them to conduct themselves peacefully."" The allegations against BBS, he said, were ""an attempt to bring disrespect to Buddhist clergy and Buddhism."" Tacit political approval? Buddhist radicalism has been on the rise in Sri Lanka, much as in Myanmar, where a monk-led Buddhist nationalist movement has been blamed for drumming up deadly mob violence against minority Muslim groups. On Thursday, a prominent moderate Buddhist monk who had campaigned for interfaith harmony was found bound and dumped on a road on the outskirts of Colombo, after apparently having been abducted and assaulted, police said. The alleged victim, Wataraka Vijitha Thero, had previously been publicly threatened by Gnanasara during an interfaith press conference held with Muslim leaders in April, a police spokesman said. He was found with cuts to his body Thursday and had been hospitalized. Many in Sri Lanka, including President Mahinda Rajapaksa's own political allies within government, are critical of the authorities for allowing the communal violence to occur. Mangala Samaraweera, an opposition lawmaker for the southern Matara District, told CNN that he believed the Bodu Bala Sena has the tacit support of the Rajapaksa government, a view shared by many Sri Lankans. Rajapaksa has publicly denied any link. The Bodu Bala Sena has largely been able to operate with impunity, with previous attacks attributed to the organization going unpunished. Rauff Hakeem, Sri Lanka's Minister of Justice and the leader the country's largest Muslim political party, said in parliament that police had been asked to stop the rally but had failed to heed the request. He also blamed BBS for inciting the ""orgy of attacks against Muslims,"" and told CNN he was weighing his party's future in the government -- made up of an alliance of parties -- pending the official response to the violence. Mohamed Aslam, the local lawmaker for Hakeem's Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, also blamed police for allowing the rally to take place, and said he had nearly been shot in the aftermath. ""Muslims and Sinhalese in this area have been leading peaceful lives helping each other. This is the first time police have allowed such a meeting, where mobs were incited, to take place,"" he told CNN. ""The meeting on Sunday by the Bodu Bala Sena roused religious sentiments. Mobs went on the attack. The police looked the other way."" Police: We took precautions . But police Senior Superintendent Roshan Silva, in charge of the district where the violence took place, denied any police responsibility for the violence. ""We took all precautions. The allegation that we were inactive is false. We had deployed police all around."" Police said 55 arrests have been made over the violence, while probes by the criminal investigation department and Colombo crimes division look into larger questions around criminal culpability for allowing the rally to proceed. A group of more than 300 concerned Sri Lankans, including academics, lawyers and journalists, signed an open letter condemning the BBS's ""hate speech,"" saying they believed the violence was directly linked to the inflammatory comments by Gnanasara. ""We therefore call upon the authorities to take immediate steps to arrest and charge him for the deaths and destruction in the area,"" read the letter. Returning to the country after a G77 meeting of developing nations in Bolivia, Rajapaksa visited an affected Muslim town and vowed that an ""impartial inquiry would be held and those responsible punished."" He made no reference to the BBS. Many Muslim businesses in Sri Lanka's capital were shut Thursday in protest at the violence.","Muslims in Sri Lanka are fearful after a wave of deadly violence by Buddhist mobs Sunday .

"If you're having trouble getting pregnant or have suffered a miscarriage, some common household products may be partly to blame, new research suggests. This week, scientists at the annual conference of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine in Boston are presenting research linking chemical compounds in our environment to fertility issues. In several different studies, researchers met with healthy couples who were trying to have a baby and tested them for BPA and phthalates. BPA stands for Bisphenol A, a chemical used to make certain plastics and resins that are used in containers. BPA is also used in the coating of metal products, such as food cans, bottle tops and water supply lines, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Some studies have even found BPA in cash register receipts. Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and harder to break. They are used in products such as detergents, beauty products and children's toys. People are also exposed to phthalates by eating and drinking from containers containing them, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Previous studies -- primarily in rodents -- have linked BPA exposure to many health problems, including reproductive disorders, but at this point the FDA says that it has ""carefully assessed these studies and finds no convincing evidence to support that belief."" Phthalates have been linked to health issues such as male sexual development and attention-deficit disorder in children. ""It's not clear what effect, if any, phthalates have on health,"" the FDA says, noting that there is insufficient evidence of harmful effects to take regulatory action. BPA may reduce sperm count . More evidence may be on the way. One study presented at the conference looked at 501 couples who were trying to become pregnant. The couples in the study were interviewed and examined and provided urine samples to measure their BPA and phthalate levels. They also kept journals about intercourse, menstrual cycles and pregnancy tests. Researchers found that the men -- but not women -- with high phthalate concentrations experienced a 20% decline in fertility and took longer to get their partners pregnant than men with lower concentrations. Phthalates are known endocrine disruptors, meaning they interfere with our hormone systems, said American Society of Reproductive Medicine President Linda Giudice, who was not involved in the research. If a couple is having trouble getting pregnant, they should try to minimize the male's exposure to phthalates, Giudice says. ""Phthalates are anti-androgens, and other studies have shown that environmental levels of phthalates in infertile men correlate with increased rates of sperm DNA damage, low sperm counts and abnormal sperm,"" she said. In another smaller study presented at the conference, 114 women were asked to give blood samples four or five weeks into their pregnancies. The samples weren't tested for BPA until after the women gave birth to live babies or after they had a miscarriage if it occurred in the first trimester. Sixty-eight of the pregnancies ended in miscarriages. Researchers concluded that women who had high levels of BPA in their blood were at ""significantly increased risk of miscarriage compared to women with the lowest levels."" They believe that more research on how this chemical affects pregnancy is urgently needed. ""We expected BPA exposure to be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy (genetic defects in) miscarriages because of animal studies linking BPA exposure with chromosome abnormalities in eggs,"" study author Dr. Ruth Bunker Lathi said. ""(But) we found BPA was higher in both chromosomally normal and abnormal miscarriages."" BPA may be linked to childhood obesity . Lathi suggests that the BPA ""may be acting in other ways to cause miscarriages. We just don't know the mechanism at this time."" Researchers say they don't know why certain women in the study had higher BPA levels; they did not ask whether the women were doing specific things like leaving their plastic water bottles outside in the heat, something thought to increase BPA levels in the water dramatically. It's not routine to do BPA testing in patients who are struggling to carry a child to term, said Dr. Dorothy Mitchell-Leef, a fertility expert at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. But, she says, studies like this further highlight the impact the environment can have on fertility and miscarriage. ""It gives you one more thing to ask the patients about when you see unexplained miscarriages in patients."" Neither study showed an actual cause and effect. But Giudice says there are ways to minimize exposure to BPA if parents are worried. She advises against leaving plastic water bottles in the car, microwaving plastic containers, eating canned foods and touching paper receipts that contain BPA. The FDA also warns against putting very hot or boiling liquid in plastic containers made with BPA if you plan to consume the water. That's because BPA levels rise in food when containers or products made with the chemical are heated and come in contact with the food, according to the agency. For that reason, the FDA also no longer allows BPA in plastic used to make baby bottles and toddler cups.","Research on BPA, phthalates presented at reproductive medicine conference .

"After a slow start, Apple's iPhone has jumped to India's second largest smartphone supplier by pushing phones to Mom-and-Pop shops in the world's fastest growing smartphone market. Although Apple is still catching up to other smartphone makers like Samsung, analysts say Apple is finally taking India seriously. ""In Q4, Apple has turned out to be the number two player in India. And this means that they have done a significant shift in their positioning,"" said Venu Reddy, research director at IDC, the technology market research firm. ""Suddenly, everyone was throwing their Blackberries, Samsungs, Nokias and everyone was kind of changing to an i-Phone,"" said customer Akanshya Balram. Samsung remains India's strongest smartphone brand, with 38.8% of market share in terms of revenue, followed by Apple with 15.6%, Sony (9.4%) and Nokia (7.3%), according to IDC> . Apple's success has been attributed to its ability to adapt to India's smartphone distribution market, where most electronics are sold through small, family-owned shops.  Mobile phones in India are not subsidized by telecom operators, unlike other parts of the world. ""The reality of the Indian market in general is that the most of the electronics are bought at individual shops, maybe because of the nature of the buying behavior of the Indian market itself,"" said Gurvinder Singh, from Global Gadgets, an Apple dealer. Prior to Apple's change in strategy an i-Phone in India cost nearly 30% more than in the U.S., and customers has to wait as long as a year for delivery.","Apple's iPhone has become India's second largest smartphone supplier .

"For the second time since the U.S.-led effort to counter ISIS began, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, said he would not rule out asking the President to send U.S. ground troops into Iraq. ""I've never been limited in my ability to make a recommendation of any size or sort to the President of the United States,"" Dempsey told the House Armed Services Committee on Thursday, adding that he is always re-evaluating the situation in Iraq. Dempsey told the committee that he could envision scenarios in which a U.S. ground contingent would be necessary in Iraq, particularly if the coalition moves to retake Mosul or the western border with Syria. ""I'm not predicting at this point that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces,"" cautioned Dempsey, ""but we're certainly considering it."" Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, the committee's chairman, expressed concern about President Obama's consistent refusal to consider sending U.S. ground troops to the region. ""I will not support sending our military into harm's way with their arms tied behind their backs,"" McKeon said, adding he would block any congressional authorization that specifically barred sending ground forces. And while Dempsey said he would not rule out the need for U.S. ground troops in the future, he added: ""I just don't foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent."" Throughout the hearing, Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel described a mission in Iraq and Syria that will likely be long and fraught with setbacks. ""As a coalition, and as a nation, we must prepare for a long and difficult struggle,"" Hagel said. Echoing those sentiments, Dempsey advised Americans to ""take a long view"" of the conflict, even as the U.S. and its allies have gained ground. But members from both parties expressed serious concerns over the administration's strategy in Iraq and Syria. While McKeon and others are calling for more U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria, other members are expressing frustrations over the fact that the United States is potentially becoming involved in another protracted foreign war. ""It looks like we're going down the same road that [former Defense Secretary] Donald Rumsfeld told us we had to do,"" said Rep. Walter Jones, a Republican congressman from North Carolina who was visibly irritated. Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a veteran of the last Iraq war, expressed similar concerns. ""I'm wondering how we can be walking down the same path that we've walked down over the last decade or more and hope for a different outcome,"" she said. Committee members also called on the administration to seek a new Authorization for Use of Military Force, essentially getting Congress' approval to continue U.S. military actions in the region. President Obama initially said he did not require such authorization, but has since indicated he would work with Congress to secure approval. Asked about it in the hearing, Hagel said he did not yet know what specific authorizations the White House would be requesting, but insisted the President would engage members of Congress on the issue. Throughout the hearing, Hagel and Dempsey reiterated that military action alone will not defeat ISIS, and that a political solution will need to come together in Iraq and Syria. But the secretary of defense stopped short of saying the United States would seek the removal of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, despite CNN's reporting on Wednesday that the administration was considering a change in strategy on that front. ""Yes, it is a longer-term part of this to find a stable government and leaders in Syria to be able to bring some stability to that country"" even as the U.S. focuses on ISIS in the immediate term, Hagel said. The Obama administration has insisted that the operation to fight ISIS would rely on building partner capacity on the ground, training and equipping moderate Syrian rebels and supporting the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. But for some committee members, this assurance brought further concerns about whether the United States could rely on those partner groups to take on ISIS. The U.S. has not begun to vet members of the moderate Syrian opposition, some of whom are more preoccupied with toppling al-Assad than taking on ISIS. And the Iraqi Security Forces, already U.S.-trained once before at great cost, initially fled in large numbers as ISIS advanced into northern Iraq. ""Men and women will not fight if they do not have confidence in their leaders,"" Hagel said of the earlier breakdown. But the secretary tried to assure committee members that the new Iraqi government, under Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, would make the changes necessary to strengthen those forces, and both officials said the future of the conflict, on the whole, looks bright. Still, Dempsey said the campaign to defeat ISIS will inevitably follow a pattern of ""three steps forward, two steps back."" ""And at every step forward or back,"" he added, ""we'll debate about the size of the step.""","Joint Chiefs chairman speaks to a House committee .

"The captain of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise returned home to Maine on Saturday after an absence of more than three months that included time in one of Europe's oldest prisons. ""I'm going to shovel out a path to the woodpile and get a fire going,"" Peter Willcox said in a phone interview shorty after arriving at his house on Islesboro Island. ""That's the first thing on my list."" Willcox, 60, who joined the environmental activist group in 1981, was among 28 protesters and two journalists aboard the Greenpeace vessel who were arrested by Russian authorities and thrown in jail in September. The 70-foot Greenpeace vessel was on a mission to protest a rig owned by Russian company Gazprom when a helicopter swooped down and paratroopers stormed the ship and arrested everyone on board. They were held in a prison in Murmansk for six weeks and then the remainder of the time in St. Petersburg, including a stint at Kresty prison, which dates back to the late 1800s. The charges: piracy, with a potential sentence of 10 to 15 years in prison. While the charges were later reduced to ""hooliganism,"" they were still looking at a penalty of up to seven years in jail. ""If it wasn't the conditions that were so bad for the first six weeks in jail, it was the uncertainty of being charged with piracy,"" Willcox said. ""That was the thing that caused the anxiety, the stress and the nervousness."" Initally, the jailed activists, who became known as the Arctic 30, spent 23 of 24 hours every day in small, cold cells. They were allowed one hour a day of solitary exercise in a ""concrete box"" slightly larger than their cells. ""You could go for a months without seeing the sunshine and we did,"" said Willcox, who was the captain of the Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior when it was bombed by French agents in Auckland, New Zealand in 1985, killing one crew member. At Kresty, Willcox said he shared a cell with a 40-something Russian charged with dealing drugs. He was isolated from his crew. The two men played chess. His cellmate also would cook and share meals with him. ""He cooked me some wonderful dinners,"" Willcox said. ""He had a real grocery store in our cell. His family would bring him food. Greenpeace would bring me food. He has an immersion heater which he put in a coffee bowl of water with vegetables and make a good soup."" Willcox also spent time reading Harry Potter books delivered by Greenpeace. The ordeal ended last week, with a sweeping amnesty program by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The amnesty law freed business executive Mikhail Khodorkovsky and two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot, who were jailed for a performance critical of Putin. ""The reason we're out ... is that there was such an outpouring of support for us all over over the world, from people like Paul McCartney and Nobel laureates and senators,"" Willcox said. ""We'd still be in jail if we hadn't had that kind of support."" Another big reason: In less than two months the world attention will be on Russia's Sochi Olympics. ""I'm quite convinced the government didn't want is in jail during the Olympics,"" Willcox said. ""That would have been a huge mistake. There would have demonstrations at the Olympics which they didn't want. It just wasn't worth the trouble to keep us."" Willcox said he remains committed to Greenpeace and its environmental cause. He said he does so mostly for his two daughters, ages 18 and 22. In February he will embark on another Arctic Sunrise mission in the United States. ""If somebody says that people in Russia and people around the world are much more aware of the dangers of drilling for oil anywhere, and especially in the Arctic, I'd say, 'OK, I can do two months for that,'"" Willcox said. ""What I couldn't do for that is 10 to 15 years... To me the alternative of turning the world over to the oil companies is not a viable option.""","Greenpeace vessel captain among 30 activists released by Russian authorities .
