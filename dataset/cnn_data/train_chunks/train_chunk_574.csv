For months celebrity women wanting to shine on the red carpet have been flashing a sliver of bosom. But the side boob's days could be numbered as more and more A-listers switch to another revealing trend: the 'bum slip'. Unlike the classic builder's bum, a bum slip occurs when a pair of too-short shorts or a micro skirt is worn, with the result that the lower part of the derriere is on show. Revealing: Kate Moss shows how the 'bum slip' is done in a sheer sequinned catsuit during a Paris party . Once a sartorial no-no, the bum slip is swiftly overtaking the side boob as the red carpet flash of choice, with everyone from Rihanna to Miley Cyrus getting in on the act. Ever the early adopter, Kate Moss was one of the first to be seen flashing her rear in public when she attended Carine Roitfeld's party at the Hotel Shangri-La during Paris Fashion Week. The 39-year-old mother of one arrived at the soir√©e sporting a bizarre black net catsuit and tuxedo jacket combo by Saint Laurent, which covered her top half but left her backside exposed. Her catwalk colleagues have also given the revealing look their seal of approval with Marc Jacobs sending Cara Delevingne down the catwalk at Louis Vuitton wearing a skimpy pair of pink silk shorts - with just a coat to spare her blushes. In Los Angeles, Miley Cyrus was spotted running errands in a pair of Daisy Dukes that left absolutely nothing to the imagination, while Eva Longoria appeared on the red carpet in a dress with a gargantuan bow in place of a skirt that barely covered her behind. Fashionable: Cara Delevingne shows of shorts guaranteed to provide a bum slip during the Louis Vuitton show . What will Liam say! Miley Cyrus does the bum slip in a pair of ultra short Daisy Dukes . Red carpet ready? Eva Longoria's bottom-scraping 'dress' has a large bow instead of a skirt . Although the bum slip hasn't been doing the red carpet round for long, it has made more regular appearances on stage. Madonna, Rihanna and Lady Gaga all have form on the derriere flashing front, with Rihanna's micro shorts and Gaga's carnivalesque costumes leaving little covered up. Both have been known to tackle the trend offstage, as has Britney Spears, whose passion for teeny tiny denim shorts has left her rear on show on more than one occasion. Even Rihanna's friend Rita Ora has tapped into the trend, although on some occasions - most noticeably at the BRIT Awards - she's come slightly too close for comfort to the traditional builder's bum. While pregnancy has curtailed Kim Kardashian's more risque fashion choices, the star hasn't given up on flashing the flesh, although in her case, it was more inadvertent than intentional. Photographed heading to the gym in a pair of too-tight leggings, Kim's version of the bum slip was more full moon than sexy glimpse.

The killer of Anuj Bidve, shot dead at point-blank range on Boxing Day, allegedly laughed as the Indian student collapsed with a gun wound to his head. Detectives investigating the murder of Mr Bidve have spoken to witnesses who heard the killer ‚Äòlaugh sarcastically‚Äô after pulling out a small handgun and shooting him in the head. Police in Salford, Greater Manchester, believe the killing may have had a ‚Äòhate‚Äô motive but detectives are also investigating whether the killer and his suspected accomplices had tried to ‚Äòchat up‚Äô two Asian girls in 23-year-old Mr Bidve‚Äôs group. Horrific: The killer of Anuj Bidve, shot dead at point-blank range on Boxing Day, allegedly laughed as the Indian student collapsed with a gun wound to his head . Officers believe that they became enraged after having their advances rejected when they propositioned the young women. A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‚ÄòIt appears two young women who were with Mr Bidve had been eating at a nearby Subway restaurant on the night, when they were both accosted by two men. A brief conversation ensued and it appears the men had tried to chat them up. ‚ÄòThe girls, though, rejected their advances and walked back to join their group, who were standing outside a McDonald‚Äôs restaurant along with Mr Bidve. ‚ÄòThe girls said they felt scared by the men‚Äôs attentions earlier and then they realised that the men had followed them over. They say that one of the men appeared to be drunk. ‚ÄòThe men followed the girls back to their group and then suddenly asked them for a light, which the girls declined. One of the men asked for the time, which one of the girls gave to them. ‚ÄòAt this point, the killer, who had been standing with his hands in his pockets, suddenly pulled out a silver pistol and placed it to the temple of Mr Bidve and pulled the trigger. ‚ÄòAs Mr Bidve slumped to the floor dying, the men allegedly laughed sarcastically and then ran off.‚Äô Murder: Police in Salford believe the killing may have had a 'hate' motive but detectives are also investigating whether the killer and his suspected accomplices had tried to 'chat up' two Asian girls in 23-year-old Anuj Bidve's group . Five men have been arrested by Greater Manchester police since the incident occurred in Salford at 1.30am on Boxing Day. Three of these were youths aged 16 and 17 and have been released on bail. Two others, aged 20 and 19, both¬† from Ordsall, Salford, are still being questioned. Police are also investigating claims that the killers had made a deliberate decision that night to commit a murder but chose Mr Bidve randomly; he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Officers suspect the killer may have carried out the shooting to elevate his status within the criminal fraternity and claim ‚Äòbragging rights‚Äô. The source added: ‚ÄòMembers of the Salford criminal fraternity have been appalled by the seemingly pointless nature of Mr Bidve‚Äôs shooting.‚Äô Police have offered a ¬£50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Det Chief Supt Mary Doyle, leading the murder inquiry, said: ‚ÄòIt is an extremely unusual, savage and motiveless attack, an absolutely horrific crime, which is why we are taking the step of issuing the reward a bit earlier than we normally would. Sad: Flowers are left at the scene where Anuj Bidve was shot in Salford, Greater Manchester . ‚ÄòWe absolutely understand the need¬† to take whoever is responsible for this off the streets. That‚Äôs the reason we are issuing it at such an early stage.‚Äô Mr Bidve, an electronics student at Lancaster University, was killed after he and a group of friends strayed into a deprived area of Salford on their way to queue for the Boxing Day sales in the city centre during the early hours of the morning. Chief Supt Kevin Mulligan said detectives were not ruling out the possibility that the shooting might have been racially motivated. Throughout the week, locals left tributes to Mr Bidve at the scene in Ordsall, an area known for high crime levels. The killing has disgusted members of the community in the tough inner-city suburb, which has found itself the subject of worldwide condemnation on news and social networking sites. A note addressed to Mr Bidve and attached to a small bouquet of flowers said: ‚ÄòEvil and mindless people took your life away for nothing. ‚ÄòWe are local residents who are so¬† saddened and sickened at this senseless act. We don‚Äôt think living here will ever be the same.‚Äô",Detectives are also investigating claims that the killers had made a deliberate decision to commit a murder and chose Anuj Bidve randomly .
"By . Helen Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 12:28 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 1 March 2013 . Workers preparing a multi-million pound science centre have uncovered the remains of a Victorian club, where Friedrich Engels was a member. A team digging at the Booth Street East site of the ¬£61 million National Graphene Institute in Manchester have discovered the foundations of the Albert Club - which entertained the great and good across the city. Engels is known to have become a member in 1842, when he was sent to Manchester to manage his father's textile factory. Appalled by poverty and slum conditions, he went on to write the Communist Manifesto with his friend Karl Marx. Professor Kostya Novoselov, co-discoverer of Graphene, in the cellar of a former gentleman's club discovered by archaeologists in Manchester . The red square marks the site of the discovery at Booth Street, Manchester. Archaeologists knew the Albert Club had been there but were stunned by how much they found . Friedrich Engels' time in Manchester inspired his future work . Archaeologists carrying out preparation . work uncovered a row of cellars from 1830s terraced houses and the . remains of the club, named after Prince Albert and frequented by . middle-class Germans. The team say they have always . known the location of the gentleman's club underneath the site, . previously known as Lawson Street. But they were surprised by the surviving elements they were able to find, including fragments of ornate stone columns. The Government-funded centre will be the new home to Sir Andre Geim and Sir Kostya Noveselov, the Manchester University academics who won the Nobel Prize for their work with graphene in 2004. It will be built on land opposite the Manchester Aquatics centre. Professor Novoselov has salvaged an intact sink which he hopes to use in the new building. He said he was immensely proud that the centre would be built on the Industrial Revolution foundations. He said: 'We have been very careful to record these remnants of the Industrial Revolution and we will look to keep some artefacts for use in the new building or elsewhere. A team digging at Booth Street in Manchester City Centre found remnants from the site of the Albert Club . The dig uncovered steps and tiles from the 19th century club as well as cellars from 1830s terraced houses . Archaeologists also unearthed the cobbled streets of the area, formerly known as Lawson Street . 'It is genuinely exciting to start work on such a significant research institute on such an important site.' The archaeological team unearthed the cobbled streets as part of the building process for the new 7,600 sq m building. Scientists hope the institute will put Britain at the forefront of research into the new material. Diana Hampson, the university's director of estates, said: 'We have been advised that the remains we have uncovered are not hugely significant in archaeological terms, but are fascinating nonetheless.' Engels, left, and Karl Marx, right, were the founding fathers of Marxism and close friends until Marx's death . Engels' two-year spell in Manchester proved to be hugely influential in his work. Before the move, he had begun to read the work of philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and published articles about the poor conditions and pay for factory workers. He was sent to manage the Ermen and Engels Victoria Mill in 1842 when he was 22 by his parents. They thought the experience might drum his communist tendencies out of him - but were proved wrong. On the back of his stint in Manchester and Salford, he wrote The Conditions of the Working Class in England in 1844, describing the appalling conditions of work and pay for the working class in the area and describing his thoughts on the emergence of socialism. Engels met Karl Marx on his way to Britain and their working relationship began in 1844 after meeting again in Paris. Their Communist Manifesto, published in 1848, was their third work together and is the second best-selling book of all time behind the Bible. After Marx's death, Engels continued to critique capitalism. He also published his late friend's Capital II and Capital III and became hugely influential on emerging socialists. Engels died in London in 1895 and his ashes were scattered off Beachy Head, East Sussex. Archaeologist Graham Mottershead showed Professor Novoselov the cobbled remains of Lawson Street . Manchester University's director of estates said their findings were not significant in archaeology terms but were still fascinating .","Archaeologists in Manchester discovered the foundations of the Albert Club .

A pretty blonde thief casually slings a handbag over her shoulder as she brazenly breaks into a car - not knowing the vehicle is rigged with secret cameras. The woman is one of dozens of thieves caught red-handed stealing computers and sat navs in a police sting operation. West Midlands Police has released a video of criminals being caught in the act by their 'capture car', which they parked in Birmingham city centre. Another clip shows a man pull his jacket sleeve over his hand before sneaking into an unlocked car and taking a laptop bag from the passenger seat. Scroll down to watch video . Smile for the camera: This woman was caught stealing from West Midlands Police's 'capture car' in Birmingham city centre . The footage will be shown on BBC1 tomorrow morning in the latest 'Caught Red Handed' Unknown to the thief, the computer was fitted with a tracking device which meant officers were able to catch the thief who was subsequently jailed for eight weeks. PC Simon Williams, of West Midlands Police, said: 'It's not the wisest criminal move to break into a police car, but that's exactly what many unwitting criminals are doing. 'We're making thieves think twice before breaking into cars. We want them to fear that their actions may be caught on camera and provide us with irrefutable evidence. 'Thefts from motor vehicles are usually carried out in a matter of seconds with often no witnesses or CCTV footage. 'But the capture cars enable us to trap thieves red-handed with many being arrested at the scene or shortly after thanks to the camera images.' Caught: A man in a hooded top also falls prey to the police operation . The would-be thief is joined by another man, who squeezes in from behind him . The 'capture car' is intended to make criminlas think twice when they see a car with valuables inside . The footage will be shown on BBC1 at 11am tomorrow in the latest 'Caught Red Handed' programme. The show - which is presented by Dominic Littlewood - showcases the clever tactics West Midlands Police are trapping offenders and cutting crime. PC Williams added: 'The capture cars are proving successful and helping us cut vehicle crime in the West Midlands. Despite the bright daylight, this man takes the opportunity to grab a sat nav from the police vehicle . A police officer said: 'The capture cars are proving successful and helping us cut vehicle crime in the West Midlands' 'We've seen a year-on-year reduction in thefts from vehicles since they were introduced and so far this year it's down almost eight per cent with 1,325 fewer victims since April 2012 compared to the same period last year.' Other West Midlands Police 'stings' featured include the use of covert cameras built into traffic lights to catch illegal street racers, forensic marking to trace metal thieves and 'capture houses' acting as bait to lure burglars. The force also released a video of three bungling burglars who were captured on CCTV taking more than five minutes to break into a house - before one gets stuck trying to climb through a window and falls over.

Investigating officer DC John Jinks, from Wolverhampton CID, said: 'First and foremost I want to hear from anyone who recognises the men in these images, you can quite clearly see the face of one of the individuals and I'm sure someone will know who he is. Access: The first thief manages to get a window open and prepares to climb through it into the property . Success: After the first thief climbs through the window, his accomplices get ready to follow him . 'As the footage shows this burglary took some time and someone may have seen the men in the area on the day of the break-in. 'I'd also like to hear from anyone who may have seen the blue or grey Audi fleeing the scene at lunchtime on 28 February or anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Pope Road area of the Scotlands on the same day.'

On the run: Jessica Carde, 58, is on the lam as authorities try to arrest her for her 12 outstanding felonies . A woman pretending to be a millionaire in search of a new home could not have been further from the truth and now she faces a dozen felony charges. Jessica Carde, 58, is on the run after Seattle police have charged her with a series of theft charges stemming from her lavish mansion-hopping scheme. She would suggest lease-purchase . agreements, where the interested party pays small sums to the homeowner . over time until they eventually purchase the home outright. Carde . would never get passed a few payments before alleging that her identity . had been stolen and the great lines of credit that she had previously . boasted about disappeared as a result. Her alleged crime spree goes back for years, as she and her husband lost their $650,000 home in a foreclosure in 2006. Since then, The Seattle Post Intelligencer reports that she has been living in a series of luxury homes throughout Washington state. There are at least three instances where . she convinced homeowners who were looking to sell their mansions that . she was well-off and extremely interested in eventually purchasing the . properties. Home sweet home: Jessica Carde, 58, allegedly lived in this $1.5million home in North Bend, Washington for 18 months . When tensions rose following the disappearing illusion of wealth, she allegedly turned to the authorities and made false police reports when the homeowners threatened to evict her. In one case she claimed the male owner said he would burn the house down around her, and in another she was allegedly threatened with imminent death. Fast forward four years and several home stays later, she decided to look for individual men willing to lend her money. Multiple targets: As well as hopping from home to home, including this one in Kirkland, she also convinced wealthy individuals and banks to give her loans of hundreds of thousands of dollars . In earlier cases, she came into meetings with homeowners armed with letters that said she was pre-qualified for a mortgage. Now she printed up new business cards that showed her wide-range of talents. Hiding: This picture of Carde, clearly taken years ago, was listed under one of her aliases . She claimed to be an 'international speaker, trainer and consultant, personal/professional/executive life coach, neurobiofeedback technician/brain wave specialist, mediation specialist, health educator and instructor.' Not only would she convince wealthy . homeowners to let her live in their mansions with the expectation that . she would eventually buy it from her, but she even convinced an ailing . stroke victim to allow her to test out 'brain wires' on him in order to . 'cure' his ailments. Police reports do not state how she met one elderly benefactor, but somehow she convinced him to lend her $142,100. The unidentified man suffered a stroke . in 2010, and given her ficitious background as a brain wave specialist, . she convinced the man's wife to allow her to use her talents on him. 'She . said she could cure (him) with ‚Äòbrain wires‚Äô and convinced his wife ‚Ä¶ . to let her try. Carde placed electrodes on (his) head to ‚Äòblast the . clot‚Äô away,' investigator Steven Sherman told the court. Under construction: This North Bend home was another target of hers, though she also tried non-real estate rouses like when she used 'brain wires' to help 'shock' a blood clot in a stroke victim's brain . Carde tried to obtain a power of attorney letter to have control of the man's finances but his family interjected. She then told police that the man's wife was trying to kill him, and Carde was subsequently banned from the facility where he was being treated. Police have now formally charged Carde with four counts of first degree theft, three charges of mortgage fraud, two of securities fraud, two of second-degree theft and one of attempted first-degree theft.","Jessica Carde, 58, is on the run after spending years defrauding homeowners in Washington state .

With just days to go until the Supreme Court hears arguments that could pave the way for federal recognition of same-sex marriages, a new survey has revealed that public support for gay marriage is higher than ever. According to the new poll, 58 percent of Americans now believe it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to get married; compared to 36 percent who say it should remain illegal. These latest findings show a dramatic change in public attitudes compared to just ten years ago, when public attitudes were almost an exact mirror image. In 2003, 37 percent favored gay nuptials, and 55 percent opposed them. A new poll has revealed a dramatic turn around in support for gay marriage over the last ten years with 58 percent of the population now in favor . Gay Marriage advocates cheer during a rally moments before hearing the news of the Proposition 8 over-ruling outside the Ninth Circuit Courthouse in San Francisco last month . The poll, carried out for ABC News, shows support for gay marriage has grown sharply from a low of 32 percent in a 2004 survey, to a narrow majority for the first time only two years ago, and now a significant majority for the first time. Views on basic social issues traditionally move slowly, but the results of this survey - and a Pew Forum poll from last month - show a remarkable transformation in public attitudes. The results show large advances across a range of age groups and politics persuasions. Amongst adults younger than 30, the ABC poll found that gay . marriage is supported by 81 percent of those polled, compared . with 44 percent of seniors. Both groups have seen a ten point . increase since March 2011 and 20 points since 2004. Republicans (34 per cent) continue to . lag behind Democrats (72 percent) and independents (62 percent), yet . Republican support is up 18 points since 2004. Support amongst . conservatives has more than tripled in the past nine years and stands at . 22 percent. Over the past 20 years there has been a major changes in people's options about homosexuality and the majority of Americans now believe it is 'just the way people are' rather than something they choose . Amongst religious groups support is . following a similar upward trend, among Catholics support now stands at 59 percent . (up 19 points), Protestants at 70 percent (up 25 points) and . evangelicals at 31 percent (up 24 points). The ABC research also found Americans voting almost 2-l (64-33 . percent) that gay marriage 'should be decided for all . states on the basis of the U.S. Constitution' rather than by each state . making its own law on the issue. The¬†Pew Forum released similar findings last month, including a major shift in . views over the past ten years - with people polling in favor of gay . marriage becoming the preferred choice in recent years. The Pew research also found support for gay marriage trending upwards across all age groups with . millennials the most in favor and older respondents less inclined to embrace change. The same research also found evangelicals polling the least in favor of gay marriage when it came to polling based on religious persuasion. Father and son: Republican senator Rob Portman revealed last week that he had changed his tough stance on gay marriage after his son Will, left, revealed he was gay . Across the board support: New research has shown significantly growing support for gay marriage - even amongst groups including over 65s, conservatives and evangelicals . Pew also polled on regional . differences and found people in New England states such as Connecticut and New . Hampshire most in favor of gay marriage and South Central states such as . Texas and Louisiana, the least in favor of change. The results mirror a change in tone from a number of senior political figures in the past 12 months. On Monday Hillary Clinton expressed her support for same-sex marriage, something President Obama and Vice President Biden did last year. Within the Republican party, respected Ohio senator Rob Portman announced last Thursday that he had reversed his stance against gay marriage after his 21-year-old son, Will, came out to him and his wife. Portman said the discovery that his son was gay had given him a 'new perspective' and understanding of why equal opportunities matter, although House Speaker John Boehner told 'This Week' on Sunday that he ‚Äòcan‚Äôt imagine‚Äô his conservative views on gay marriage will ever shift. Democratic politicians to have publicly spoken out in favor of gay marriage include Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton . Research by the Pew Forum shows that attitudes to gay marriage have changed significantly over the past ten years . Gay marriage today is legal in . nine states and the District of Columbia, and civil unions are legal in . eight more states (and were approved last week by the state Legislature . in a ninth, Colorado). Thirty-one states ban gay marriage by . constitutional amendment. The . Supreme Court will hear arguments later this month in two separate . cases that could pave the way for federal recognition of same-sex . marriages, while also overturning state restrictions that deny same-sex . couples the right to wed. Supporters . of marriage equality argue that denying same-sex couples the right to . marry violates the Constitution‚Äôs guarantee of equal protection under . the law. The Supreme Court will hear the cases on March 26 and 27 and is expected to issue its opinions in June. Research carried out by the Pew Forum shows regional variations across the country on attitudes to gay marriage .","58 percent of American now believe it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to get married, compared to 36 percent against it .

A new survey has revealed the worst of the snail-pace journeys in Britain are in London, while Manchester, Merseyside and Birmingham also have some of the slowest-moving roads. Jamaica Road in Southwark, south London, was found to have the worst jams in the survey by GPS vehicle tracking supplier RAM Tracking. Congestion: Jamaica Road in south London has the worst traffic jams in Britain . Those travelling along this route in Southwark averaged just 0.08 miles an hour between 8am and 9am in . February 2013, the survey showed. The next-worst congested route was the B221 Bedford Road in Clapham, south London, where traffic managed 0.13mph.

A dog owner stapled his pet's face together with a staple gun after using the animal for badger bating. Comet, believed to be about three-years-old, was dumped outside a vets when his owner realised they couldn't treat his horrific wounds. Staff at Hull Animal Welfare Trust's Sunnydene Shelter in South Cave, East Yorkshire, were appalled when they saw Comet's face which had been torn by the badger. Road to recovery: Amy Bryan with Comet whose face was stapled together by his cruel owner . Amy Bryan, 32, manager of the shelter, said: 'Comet must have gone through excruciating pain and suffering when the staples were stuck to his face. 'The stapler that was used would have been the type that you find on your desk at work. 'There were at least ten staples on his mouth and up to his jawline.' The badger managed to tear off the entire bottom of Comet‚Äôs face and he was left with wounds right up to his eyes. Ms Bryan said: 'None of us at this centre have ever seen this kind of cruelty happen to an animal before.' Comet, who was injured in Lancashire, has been a resident at the shelter since last November. Ms Bryan said: 'When his wound started to break down, the owners figured out they couldn‚Äôt fix his face after all and just cruelly dumped him outside a vets. 'Comet came to us with no collar and no paperwork documenting the past owners, so we haven‚Äôt been able to bring them to justice for such a horrific crime. 'What the owners did was illegal and it‚Äôs hard to describe the pain Comet will have been put under.' Cruel: Comet's owner tried to repair his face with a staple gun before dumping him outside a veterinary clinic . Comet still suffers from slight numbness in his jaw from his injuries but is now eating as usual. Ms Bryan said: 'The vets in Lancashire have done a wonderful job in their initial treatment for him. 'We then provided more treatment for Comet when he arrived in our shelter.' Now looking for a new home, Ms Bryan explained Comet needs a loving carer who has experience in handling lurchers. 'Comet needs an experienced handler, someone with no small animals or children because Comet has been forcibly trained to grab hold of anything smaller than him,' she said. 'It‚Äôs such a shame as he‚Äôs very affectionate with people and walks well on a lead like any other dog. 'Someone with experience in handling this breed would be helpful as the expertise would be invaluable. Needs a home: Comet is recovering from his ordeal and hopes a new owner will come forward . 'One man who helps trains Lurchers to calm their behaviour said to me that the more the badger fights back, the more the dog is urged to go and attack. 'But above all, he‚Äôs a very big, strong dog and we found him to be a lovely companion.' The charity, formed 30 years ago, charges ¬£125 for a dog and ¬£70 for a cat.

Winter mornings spent shivering and scraping the ice from your windscreen could soon go out of the window. Scientists have developed a coating for glass which keeps it clear ‚Äì no matter what Mother Nature throws at it. Created by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it repels rain but absorbs moisture from the environment rather than allowing it to gather as condensation. Scroll down for video . The team tested coatings by chilling glass to -20C, then leaving them at room temperature. The new coating (right) remained frost free and outperformed current anti-frost coatings (left) and untreated glass (middle) The coating is a 'zwitter-wettable surface' which absorbs molecular moisture from the environment but repels rain. This . means that, in effect, rain will bounce off the surface but dampness in . the air will be absorbed rather than allowed to gather as condensation . on the surface. Engineers Michael Rubner and Robert . Cohen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: ‚ÄòIt resists . both fogging and frosting which could have uses ranging from automobile . windshields to camera lenses.‚Äô Its . application could also work for spectacles or any kind of glass that is . susceptible to getting steamed up in certain conditions, they said. Currently . the best water-repellent coatings are good for . maintaining visibility through the windscreen in the driving rain. But . they do not prevent the glass from getting misty because of the . condensation that builds up in wet weather, the researchers said. However, . the latest version developed is called a 'zwitter-wettable surface' which absorbs molecular moisture from the environment but repels rain. This . means that, in effect, rain will bounce off the surface but dampness in . the air will be absorbed rather than allowed to gather as condensation . on the surface. Zwitter, Rubner said, is a German word for hybrid, used in a number of chemistry terms to describe something that carries two opposite properties at once. Frosty start: Scientists in the U.S. say they have developed a coating for windscreens that will keep it clear no matter what the conditions . In this case, it describes a surface . that has the ability to behave as both hydrophobic (to water droplets) and hydrophilic (to gas-phase water molecules). The surface is made by a process . called layer-by-layer deposition. In this case, alternating layers of . two different polymers ‚Äî poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(acrylic acid) ‚Äî . are deposited on a glass surface. 'The magic of what we do is nanoscale . processing,' Rubner explains: producing the layers so as to control . their properties almost down to the level of individual molecules. This production process appears relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out on large scales. 'These are common polymers,' Rubner says. 'They‚Äôre well-known and cheap, but brought together in a unique way.' To test the effectiveness of this material, and that of many other alternatives, the team devised a set of extreme tests. For example, they kept samples of the . material at minus 20 degrees Celsius for an hour, then exposed them to a . very humid environment. Development: Scraping frost from your car windscreen on cold mornings may become a thing of the past . While untreated glass, or glass . treated with conventional hydrophilic or hydrophobic coatings, quickly . develop a layer of frost following such treatment, glass with the new . treatment remains clear. However, it still appears to be hydrophobic in the presence of large water droplets. They believe it could be used in . everything from the inside of car windshields and ski goggles to the inside of . supermarket refrigerator cases and double glazing. Joseph Schlenoff, a professor of . polymer science at Florida State University who was not involved in this . work, says, 'Everyone knows how inconvenient, or even dangerous, it is . to have a cold window or lens fog up when water condenses on it. 'The MIT . group has devised a practical and effective method of combatting the . fogging problem using a new ultrathin polymer film.'","Scientists in the U.S. have developed a coating to keep windscreens clear .

The boss: England's manager Roy Hodgson . The operation kept him out until December, but after making 13 successive starts for Spurs, Parker is feeling good again. And he is starting to train his sights on the greatest show on earth in Brazil next year. 'Now I am amongst it again, the fire rumbles in my belly to get there for Brazil,' said Parker. 'I have not had many massive injuries in my career but the ones you do have give you that hunger again. 'I need to take things one step at a time but, now I am in the squad, if I get my chance I need to take it.' Midway through his first major tournament last summer, Parker did outline a theory that it could be his last. Still only 32, it seemed an extreme assessment given his status as England‚Äôs most natural defensive midfielder. Yet part of Parker‚Äôs thinking may have been formulated by the knowledge his troublesome Achilles injury, which flared up towards the end of last season, was going to need sorting out. And, as the former West Ham man is acutely aware, nothing can be taken for granted in the recovery stages from such significant surgery. 'I didn‚Äôt really have any pain during Euro 2012 but there was a slight problem with my Achilles during the summer and in the end I needed to have an operation,' said Parker. 'And if you ask any player when they have been out for some time, doubts do cross your mind about when you are going to come back. 'There are long days when you are feeling unfit and everything seems a struggle. Then negative thoughts do set in. 'But once you are out of pain and on the road back towards playing again, your focus changes.' Although Parker has not featured for his country since that disappointing penalty shoot-out defeat by Italy in Kiev last June, the experience of being in Poland and Ukraine has fuelled a passion to be part of another major tournament with England. 'I had a fantastic time at the Euros,' he said. 'It was a great experience for me and it did explode at quite a late age but I would love to be involved in a World Cup squad. 'A lot can happen between now and then. If I can stay fit and maintain my form hopefully I will have a chance.'","Watch video of youngsters at the senior squad's training .

But one Facebook site, Swansea Uni Confessions, has been slammed by the university and its student union. In a joint statement, registrar Raymond Ciborowski and students union president Tom Upton said: 'We are seriously concerned about the nature and content of these pages. 'Irresponsible use of social media can damage their future employment prospects as companies are increasingly searching for information on job applicants.' Undergraduates use the Facebook pages to post tales of what they get up to after moving away from home. Most of the confessions are anonymous as students e-mail their stories to an unknown administrator who then posts them on the internet for everyone to see. But concerns have been raised over what these shady administrators might do with students information after the messages have been sent.

Under the spotlight: Greg Snelgrove gives a running commentary on his work on Twitter but there's concern he's giving too much away . A police force has launched a review of its staff's use of Twitter after a top official was accused of leaking sensitive details on security operations. Greg Snelgrove, whose police job at Hampshire Police is to plan for emergency situations such as a terror attack, gives a running commentary of his work on the social networking site. But there is concern the official - who is also a part-time Prince William lookalike - has been publicising secret information that could be helpful to would-be terrorists. On May 1 Mr Snelgrove, 25, tweeted about 'attending Exercise Emerald Prism today at the South East Counter terrorism Unit (SECTU)'. The following day he tweeted that he 'is off to RAF Lyneham to observe Exercise Emerald Prism and how we would respond to an extended hostage/siege scenario.' This exercise, its codenames, locations and descriptions were not in the public domain before Mr Snelgrove's tweets, according to industry expert Alan Turnbull. Another tweet discovered by Mr Turnbull posted by the head of contingency planning at Hampshire police related to 'Exercise Crossley Star.' Mr Snelgrove tweeted that is was to take place at the Health Protection Agency's Porton Down laboratories in Wiltshire. He said: 'At HPA Porton Down for the Exercise Crossley Star structured debrief. We will be discussing the lessons identified and how we can improve.' On the same campus is the former chemical weapons establishment and now research centre for bio-terrorism countermeasures. Too much? Mr Snelgrove tweeted this picture of a police operation of an overturned lorry to his followers . Review: This is another picture of an operation he posted online although Hampshire Police say he hasn't given away any secret information although the force said it was reviewing its guidelines on the use of Twitter . A spokesman for Hampshire police . insisted Mr Snelgrove hadn't given away secret information but confirmed . the force was now reviewing its guidelines on Twitter. Mr . Turnbull, a media research consultant, said: 'I am not suggesting that . the codewords are classified in the strictest sense. But they do allow . people to join the dots and piece together the jigsaw with other . exercises that might be classified. 'This . could lead to delicate information falling into the wrong hands. With . regard to the tweet about Exercise Emerald Prism there was no other . mention of it across the whole internet. Mr Snelgrove tweets about a trip to RAF Lyneham to look at how police would respond to a hostage situation . Critics say Mr Snelgrove 'got caught up in in the vanity thing on Twitter' and warned about how public Twitter is . Prince William look-a-like Mr Snelgrove said the criticism was 'sensationalist and unfounded' 'I really can't see that the relevant authorities would have wanted these terms bandied about in the public domain and you can't get more public than a Twitter feed. I think Mr Snelgrove is a bit young and naive and has got caught up in the vanity thing on Twitter. 'Transparency in public office is one thing, but this is quite another.' Mr Snelgrove, who has a Master's degree in crisis and disaster management, tweeted in response to Mr Turnbull's online blog on the matter, that it was 'sensationalist and unfounded.'

A wife-from-hell was slapped with a long ASBO after she kept her neighbours awake for three years because she was constantly nagging her husband. Julie Griffiths, 43, breached a noise abatement order a staggering 47 times in three months this year and was warned she could face jail if she does not calm down, a court heard. It came after residents living near her ¬£75,000 mid-terraced home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, were put through hell as she constantly 'screamed' at her 'sweet-natured' husband Norman, 63. ASBO: Noisy Julie Griffiths outside her home where she shouted at her husband so much it kept the neighbours up for three years . Mrs Griffiths was first served the notice in 1999 but she was fined ¬£500 when she breached it again in 2010. Stoke-on-Trent Magistrates Court heard her behaviour persisted over the next two years and environmental health officers installed monitoring equipment in a neighbour's home this July. Yesterday Griffiths pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the requirements of a noise abatement notice. Staffordshire Magistrates Court imposed a five-year ASBO which prohibits her from engaging in behaviour which causes or is likely to cause a nuisance, disturbance, harassment or alarm to her neighbours. She was warned she could go to jail for five years if she breaches the antisocial order, fined ¬£500 and told to pay ¬£250 costs and a ¬£15 victim surcharge. Lisa Hall, prosecuting for the Borough Council, said it was 'by far the worst' noise case an environmental health officer had ever had to deal with. She added that the noise abatement notice was breached 47 times between July 4 and October 22 this year. Steve Lee, defending, said Griffiths, a factory worker, became over-tired after working 12-hour shifts on four consecutive days and sometimes had to 'let off steam' to her husband of 23 years. Hellish: Residents of this street in Stoke have spoken of just how noisy Mrs Griffiths is and how patient her husband Norman must be . He added: 'She accepts her voice got so loud it would have disturbed the neighbours. 'She doesn't mean to do it. She comes across as an emotional woman and vents frustration by shouting and screaming. 'She does not go round committing violence, it is simply shouting within the confines of her own home. 'She realises now that she has to keep it down.' The five-year ASBO means Griffiths must not: create noise audible to neighbouring properties, shout, scream or bang on internal doors, or contact or communicate with her neighbours. After the case Councillor Tony Kearon, said: 'This is a great result for the council and, in particular, for Mrs Griffiths' neighbours who have suffered this woman's appalling behaviour at first hand over a very long period. 'Our message is clear - we are here to support our communities. 'If you are experiencing problems, come to us for help. We will not tolerate anti-social behaviour.' A council spokesman added: 'Many of the incidents concerned Griffiths screaming at her husband on a regular basis.' Neighbours yesterday said living next door to Griffiths had 'been hell.' One, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone in the street is sick to the back teeth of her. 'Everyone just feels so sorry for her husband Norman who is the sweetest man you could ever meet. 'He must have the patience of a saint.'","Julie Griffiths breached a noise abatement order 47 times in three months this year just by 'screaming' at her partner Norman .

With a just a small tarpaulin tent for shelter and half a dozen sleep-deprived protesters, they are guarding half a dozen 300 to 400-year-old oak trees. Tunneler Simon Medhurst, who is not a Defender but has joined the protest, said: 'I've chosen this spot because it will give me 30 seconds at least to get in and bolt the door if the bailiffs come. 'Once inside, I reckon I've got enough supplies to last a month. Angry: Simon Medhurst is sitting tight in his makeshift camp which is made from layers of wood and canvas . Daniel Hooper, alias Swampy, was known for his environmental campaigning antics in the 1990s.

Medhurst said: 'I try to dig an oval-shaped hole which will hopefully support itself, it was perfected by the Vietnamese in the Vietnam War, and I'm willing to risk my life' 'I've got bottles of water, tinned food, torch batteries, books, a wee bottle and some plastic bags for you know what...' The 54-year-old activist from Kent, worked for many years as an RAF photographer on various assignments. However, his life-long love of nature has seen him on the frontline of some of the country's most high profile environmental protests. 'I was with Swampy in Manchester in 97 and was at Newbury and Fairmile', he said.

'This is the second Battle of Hastings and we're not going to give in.' But supporters of the road, including East Sussex County Council and local business leaders, say it is vital to the regeneration of the most deprived economy in the South East. Council leader Peter Jones has said it will enable the building of up to 2,000 new homes, business park space of 50,000 square metres and create more than 3,000 jobs, as well as bring economic benefits worth ¬£1 billion.

Firefighters and other first responders are putting themselves at a serious risk for injury or even death when responding to hybrid and electric car crashes, an industry panel revealed this week. The danger comes with the increased size of those vehicles‚Äô battery packs and becomes potentially deadly for those dealing with wrecked vehicles. Members of SAE International, formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers, said in a report that hybrid electric cars must be installed with industry-wide safety measures and warnings so rescue workers know ahead of time what they‚Äôre dealing with. Protection: SAE International said that there must be industry-wide changes in labelling hybrid and electric vehicles in order to protect first responders (file photo) Danger: Hybrid and electric cars are more dangerous after severe crashes because of the risk of electrocution from the battery . Todd Mackintosh, the chairman of the SAE technical committee that led the report, said that it is imperative to develop technology that will help emergency workers as well as the cars‚Äô passengers. ‚ÄòAs electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers, it‚Äôs an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident,‚Äô he said in a release. Included in SAE‚Äôs suggestions were switches to switch battery power off, badges on the side and rear of the car identifying that it is a hybrid, as well as lettering on the dashboard. Each method would be consistent on all makes and models of hybrid cars, and be visible from 50 feet away ‚Äì helpful, too, to tow-truck operators who must haul the car away. ‚ÄòThink of it as a cheat-sheet for first responders,‚Äô Mr Mackintosh said. System: SAE recommends that all hybrid and electric vehicles are clearly labeled, visible to emergency workers from 50 feet away . According to USA Today, the influx of hybrid cars on the market within the last decade has led firefighters to fear that they may not be able to quickly identify which cars are fuel-powered alone and which are hybrid. ‚ÄòIf badging is visible from 50 feet, visible on all sides and standardized, that can be nothing but a plus for us,‚Äô Buckley Heath, a training officer for the Overland Park, Kansas Fire Department told the paper. They note that while SAE‚Äôs recommendations are not mandatory to carry out, auto makers often follow the organization‚Äôs advice. Last December, the National Alternative Fuels Training Consortium (NAFTC) debuted their first responder training program for electric and hybrid cars. With it, emergency personnel are trained in best practices for electric vehicle accidents, and are taught how to identify electric vehicles from regular fuel-powered ones.","SAE International said in a report that hybrid and electric cars need industry-wide identification that first responders can use .

This October in the bar's stall at the St Bartholomew's Pathology Museum, you will be able to sample a Charred Remains - the Bloody Mary with the cheeky porky streak. Combined with vodka, Jack Daniels, tabasco, Worcester sauce, black food colouring, paprika, pepper and lemon, the Charred Remains is one drink on a menu created by madcap mixologist James Dance. Dance - who runs the Loading gaming bar in Falmouth, Cornwall - will be whipping up rounds of the drink alongside other macabre whistle-wetters all inspired by death and destruction. Besides the Charred Remains you will find gorily delectable beverages including the Stomach Contents (flavoured vodka, bits of chocolate and Skittles), the Fat (Kahlua, caramel rum, hazelnut syrup and white rum topped with hard white chocolate), the Sanitiser (lychee liqueur, cherry brandy, grenadine, vodka and white rum), the test tube of Urine (whiskey, brandy and limoncello) and the Stool Sample (a mixture of cocoa, coffee liqueur, vodka, and cream liqueurs, strawberry syrup and fudge pieces, all served inside a plastic bag). Speaking to Emerald Street, Dance said: 'These cocktails are creative ‚Äì it's good fun to make them and I like having a side line to running the bar. 'Yes, they're supposed to be show stopping but they also taste good. Although I don't put them on our bar menu!'

A man who went to his GP with a stomach upset has told how doctors removed part of his bowel after wrongly diagnosing cancer. James McLeish was left having to wear a colostomy bag and was not even told of the disastrous cancer mistake until he returned to hospital for a check-up. A surgeon told him: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve got some good news for you. You haven‚Äôt got cancer after all.‚Äô Suffered: Widower James McLeish, 69, endured 'wholly unnecessary' surgery to remove part of his bowel after he was wrongly told by doctors that he had cancer . When the retired bus driver, who had previously enjoyed good health, expressed his astonishment, the consultant said: ‚ÄòBetter safe than sorry.‚Äô The Mail on Sunday has seen a confidential report which exposes a catalogue of incompetence and failure of leadership at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, where Mr McLeish was treated. In one of the most glaring mistakes, the phrase ‚Äòno dysplasia‚Äô ‚Äì referring to an absence of abnormal cells on an ulcer found in Mr McLeish‚Äôs body ‚Äì was read at a case conference as ‚Äòdysplasia‚Äô. The omission of the word ‚Äòno‚Äô led doctors to believe cancer was likely and on that basis they went ahead with the operation. The document also reveals that: . Mr McLeish is to receive ¬£60,000 compensation from Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust after his negligence claim was settled out of court. The sequence of events began when the 69-year-old widower, from Havant, went to his GP after a bout of diarrhoea. He was referred to the Queen Alexandra where he underwent a series of tests and was told that a tumour had been found in his colon. In November 2011 surgeons removed part of his bowel and he spent two weeks in hospital recovering from the operation, which left him needing to use a colostomy bag. He moved in with his son and, when he eventually returned home, became a virtual recluse, too embarrassed to see friends and family. Mr McLeish said: ‚ÄòI changed my lifestyle and didn‚Äôt see anyone. I would not leave the house as the bag would tend to burst on me. I had to change it at home which made me very sick and it was very inconvenient. I was in good health until all this happened.‚Äô Glaring errors: The Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth have agreed to pay Mr McLeish ¬£60,000 after his negligence claim was settled out of court . He had another operation to repair the colon and remove the colostomy bag but this still left him with major problems with everyday life. ‚ÄòI completely lost my appetite and over a stone in weight. Physically and psychologically I did not feel like myself,‚Äô he said. It was only when he returned to the Queen Alexandra for a routine check-up that he was told his suffering had been entirely unnecessary because the cancer diagnosis had been wrong. Trust chief executive Ursula Ward has now written to him, apologising for the substandard care. Mr McLeish‚Äôs solicitor, Paul Crook, of law firm Ross Aldridge, said: ‚ÄòAs a result of an appalling clinical error Mr McLeish was subjected to extremely invasive and wholly unnecessary surgery. 'While no amount of money will turn the clock back, the settlement does in part recompense him for all the unnecessary pain and suffering he has endured and will continue to live with.‚Äô Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‚ÄòPatients deserve to feel confident that their prescribed course of treatment is clinically right. ‚ÄòTrusts need to ensure their procedures prevent avoidable surgery which can have devastating long-terms impacts on the quality of patients‚Äô lives.‚Äô","James McLeish was diagnosed with a tumour after stomach upset complaint .

When he was given a metal detector for Christmas, seven-year-old Sonny Carter hoped to find buried treasure. He tried it out on Boxing Day ‚Äì and within 15 minutes the machine began bleeping. Sonny found a heavy metal object caked in mud, which he dug up and took home. But as his father Jem Carter, 37, rinsed it in the sink, he realised it looked like an unexploded bomb. The family alerted police and a bomb disposal team raced to their home in King‚Äôs Lynn, Norfolk. They examined the 11.5lb device and said it was an RAF practice bomb from the Second World War ‚Äì which luckily did not contain explosives. Amazing discovery: Sonny Carter, seven, was out walking with his brother Marley, nine, and their parents when he found a 10lb bomb with his new metal detector . Sonny's relieved mother, Tracey Wood, said today that, despite the drama, she was impressed that her son's National Geographic present had worked so well. She said: 'We are dumbfounded that he discovered this on his first go. 'We are going to go out again to see if he can find something Roman. It has made our Christmas. 'It was caked in mud and Jem just thought it was a lump of metal and took it home. 'Sonny did become a little nervous with the arrival of the emergency services.' The child had been enjoying a Boxing Day walk on Roydon Common for around 15 minutes with his parents and brother Marley, nine, when his metal detector started beeping. Buried treasure: Sonny's father Jem became suspicious while rinsing off the muddy object (pictured) and contacted a relative who had served in the army during WWII and confirmed that it was a bomb . He dug up the treasure, but couldn't make out what it was - so he hurriedly bundled up the muddy object and took it home to wash it. Concerned Mr Carter contacted his partner's father, Steve Wood, after uncovering the pointed end. The grandfather, who had served more than 20 years in the RAF armoury, advised him to call 999 and place it in a bucket of cold water. This was a precaution in case it was a German phosphorous bomb, which would ignite if dry. Dangerous moment: A bomb disposal squad was dispatched to the family home and the mud-caked capsule was taken away . Bomb disposal experts from RAF Wittering in Cambridgeshire rushed to the family home and identified the item as a 10lb British practice bomb head. The bomb head still contained internal wiring and was taken away for disposal. It is believed to have been used in practice World War II bomb runs. Luckily, the 10lb bomb head did not contain any explosive material. Miss Wood, 39, a nurse at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, added: 'Kids always love looking for treasure so we thought it would be a fun random present for his stocking. 'When it started buzzing we all thought it would be some two pence pieces or something like that - I never thought it would be anything this serious. 'It was all very exciting, the kids and Jem started digging and then our crazy dog started digging too. 'It was a big muddy lump when it came to the surface so we stupidly thought lets take it home. 'We feel a bit silly now we know it could have potentially been dangerous but it's not often we go exploring and end up with a bomb in a bucket of water at the end of the garden. 'I should imagine there was a few curtains twitching on our road on Boxing Day. 'There was the police and bomb disposal outside our house - the neighbours must have thought we were mad.' The torpedo-shaped bomb was of no danger to the public but was deposed of. Practice bombs were used in the first and second world war to allow military to practice without causing the same excess of damage as they would with a regular bomb. Training pilots would also use the 10lb practice bombs as they were cheaper than the ¬£1000-worth of bomb used in military attack. RAF Wittering spokesman Flight Lieutenant Donald Earl has advised people to call police and not move suspicious items. He said: 'We find a lot of bombs in Afghanistan with metal detectors but we don't tend to find them in the UK. 'We would urge members of the public to leave suspicious items in situ.'","Sonny Carter found the 10lb capsule while out for a Boxing Day walk .

Metropolitan Police constable Kevin Hughes, pictured in November, has been sacked from the force for gross misconduct . A police officer who said that a black man looked like a monkey has been sacked, Scotland Yard said today. Metropolitan Police constable Kevin Hughes, who was based at Newham, was cleared of racially-aggravated offences in November, but has now been dismissed for gross misconduct, the force said. Hughes and fellow constable David Hair were both cleared of using threatening words or behaviour to cause alarm and distress and of racially-aggravated harassment at Westminster Magistrates‚Äô Court in November. Hughes, of Brentwood, Essex, admitted saying a black man looked like a monkey, while Hair was said to have told a black woman colleague he thought she was going to 'rant' about overtime and not do any because she was 'going home to cook bananas'. The two officers were alleged to have . used abusive language about black men while they were on patrol. The . court hearing was told they referred to each other at ‚ÄòAuntie‚Äô and . ‚ÄòUncle‚Äô in a sing song ‚ÄòGoodness Gracious Me‚Äô accent. On other . occasions Hughes said black people were like chimpanzees or Neanderthals. In his defence Pc Hughes claimed he was merely discussing evolution. Chief magistrate Howard Riddle said that while Pc Hughes‚Äôs language was 'unacceptable and offensive', it did not amount to a criminal offence. And he said that while the insulting nature of Hair‚Äôs comment seemed obvious to many, he did not think it was to him. Hair was said to have been 'mortified' when Hughes suggested his comment could be taken as being racist. Hughes was dismissed for gross misconduct in relation to . authority, respect and courtesy and discreditable conduct after a hearing which ended yesterday. Hair . was given a final written warning. In a statement today, Scotland Yard said the officers‚Äô behaviour had been brought to the attention of senior management in March last year. The matter was referred to the police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which conducted an independent investigation, leading to the officers being charged. Commander Allan Gibson, from the Directorate of Professional Standards, said: 'As soon as the actions of these officers were brought to the attention of the Directorate of Professional Standards the matter was voluntarily referred to the IPCC. 'The Commissioner has made it quite clear that racism is not acceptable within the Met, this is a view supported by the majority of officers and staff, which has been demonstrated by those who were prepared to challenge PC Hughes. Pc David Hair, a colleague of Kevin Hughes, was given a final written warning in a misconduct hearing . 'The public have an absolute right to expect that officers serving with the MPS treat them and their colleagues with respect and courtesy and that they do not hold discriminatory opinions. 'Pc Hughes has now been dismissed from the Metropolitan Police Service.' The force said that although the case against Hair was found proven, the panel has taken into account the opinion of a witness that he did not intend to cause offence, and issued him with a final written warning. IPCC Commissioner Mike Franklin said: 'Pcs Hughes and Hair used offensive language and arguably many people will find their comments to be insulting and unacceptable. 'This situation is aggravated further by the fact the offensive remarks were made within a group of officers which suggests Hughes and Hair thought their comments were appropriate work place banter. 'Fortunately, their colleagues were not prepared to let the remarks go unchallenged and they had the courage to report the officers‚Äô comments as well as providing evidence at the criminal trial. 'To stand-up and report your peers in this way should not be underestimated and we acknowledge and thank those officers who had the fortitude to challenge the offensive remarks. 'It is vital the Metropolitan Police Service takes seriously reports of officers using racially offensive language. It can indicate a potential wider problem and can undermine the efforts being made to deliver the professional service the public deserves.'","Kevin Hughes said black people were like chimpanzees or Neanderthals .

A spokeswoman for the Colchester Animal Defenders, calling herself Liza Isa-Vegan, said: 'Children should not be exposed to this sort of thing - these pigs will be slaughtered and eaten and no animal should be used as food. 'There is no such thing as healthy . meat. The children should not be taught that meat is necessary or that . pigs are lesser beings than humans. 'Not . only are they teaching bad health - one in three 11-year-olds will be . obese by 2015 - but it is desensitizing children in the process. A spokeswoman for the Colchester Animal Defenders said: 'Children should not be exposed to this sort of thing - these pigs will be slaughtered and eaten and no animal should be used as food' The arrival of three Berkshire-Old Spot Gloucester cross pigs has attracted attention from animal rights groups. From left, Peasenhall Primary School headmistress Kath Cook is pictured with Beth Stephens, Schools Commisioner Dr Elizabeth Sidwell and Emma Haines from Cook With Me Kids . 'They should not be taught the lesson that we need animals for food because that is a lie.' Earlier this week, Dr Elizabeth Sidwell, Schools Commissioner for England and Wales, visited the school to give her support to the project, which is part of a campaign to teach children about the origins of food. The teacher in charge of the project, Sarah Brown said: 'It is important for children to learn the provenance of their food and animal welfare. 'We live in a rural area and the children are surrounded by fields that have animals in them that are being reared for consumption. 'We have had 100 per cent backing from parents - if we hadn't got that we would not be doing it. 'The children are all aware that the pigs are not pets - they have deliberately not been given names - but part of the food chain. 'They understand what is going to happen to them - that they will be sent to a butcher and enter the food chain - it has been thoroughly explained to them. 'All the children are from meat-eating . families - we don't have any vegetarians at the school and all this was . discussed before we started the project.' Experts . from the Suffolk Smallholder Society will visit the school regularly . until the pigs are sent for slaughter in the summer. The . children prepare and weigh out the food for the pigs every day and give . it to the piglets but are not allowed to handle them. They will also write journals and sketch the pigs as well as draw up marketing strategies - and even devise pork recipes. A petition against the school rearing the pigs has attracted more than 4,600 signatures from around the world. It claims the piglets are to be named Ham, Bacon and Pork, which the school denies. Teacher Sarah Brown says they have deliberately not been given names . Teachers say the pupils will learn that 'a broad and balanced diet may at times include meat for people are not vegetarians, vegans or follow a religious faith that prohibits the eating of some foods.' At weekends and during school holidays parents and teachers take over the husbandry. One villager said today: 'It is appalling that sick-minded strangers are making such horrible threats to the school. 'Mrs Cook and her team do a brilliant job and it shocking that they should be getting so much foul abuse.' Village butcher Mike Thickitt said: 'It's perfectly natural for children to learn about meat and where it comes from. 'When we were young a lot of people had chickens and pigs in their back garden and as children we always knew they were being kept for meat.' The school project is run in conjunction with community interest company Cook With Me Kids. Emma Haines, director of Cook With Me Kids, said:'It's very sad that people are failing to see what we are doing. 'We have organised trips to working farms from the school and the children know what happens to the animals - they know that the pigs will become bacon, sausages and ham.' A spokesman for Suffolk police said: . 'We have been made aware of the contact between the protesters and the . school and the farmer. 'We are in regular liaison with the school and the local community offering reassurance to both where required. The petition has attracted signatures from around the world, including Japan, the UK and the United States. One signatory said the experience could be traumatic for the children, while another said 'shame on you'. One commenter said children 'who are taught that animals have not (sic) rights will apply the rule to vulnerable humans' 'We have also been in contact with the animal rights demonstrators and continue to monitor the situation.' The farmer who supplied the pigs said today: 'It‚Äôs a great shame that these people are making such a fuss and being so unpleasant. 'No-one is being forced to eat meat and the children are simply learning about where the food they eat comes from. 'They came up to the farm with their teacher shortly after the litter were born to see the piglets that they were going to look after.' The online petition says: 'The children are being led to believe that it is necessary to kill animals for humans to survive. This is not true. 'Meat isn't necessary for human survival - not only are billions of animals subjected to a horrifying death in a slaughterhouse but livestock farming is destroying the planet and keeping food away from starving people. 'It would be much better for the children to grow vegetables and be taught about animal sentience. 'Pigs like all animals, experience joy, sadness, fear and pain, happiness and misery just the same as humans do - they are more intelligent than dogs and don't deserve to be used and abused for human taste preferences.'","Peasenhall Primary School in Suffolk targeted by campaigners, say staff .

Svetlana Lokhova is claiming sex discrimination, harassment, victimisation, and constructive dismissal against her former employers Sberbank UK . A City trader labelled 'Crazy Miss Cokehead' was singled out for dismissal by her Russian boss after she spurned his sexual advances, an employment tribunal was told. Svetlana Lokhova, 32, who is suing Sberbank for more than ¬£5million, claims her boss became 'irritated' after she rejected his sexual overtures and placed her on a firing list in revenge. And one colleague told her that the boss must have hired her 'because of her tits.' In a statement to Central London Employment Tribunal, Miss Lokhova said she had been shocked to discover that Timur Nasardinov, who had personally head-hunted her, singled her out to be dismissed as she had turned to him for support over bullying by other male colleagues. She said: 'On reflection, it seems to me that this may have been because, on or around December 1 2011, Timur made an inappropriate and unwanted sexual overture towards me at an after work dinner event, which I rejected. 'Having now read Timur's statement, it seems perhaps that Timur was irritated that I had rejected his advances and sought to punish me by means of placing my name on a list of people to be fired. 'This also seems to be supported by Ruben Vardanian's comment to me on January 22 2012 that Timur must have wanted ""extra services"" and that I must have been hired because of my ""tits"".' The tribunal heard how the Russian-born Cambridge graduate was subjected to a 'sustained and vicious campaign of harassment and discrimination' for being a woman. Male colleagues labelled her 'mad' and 'crazy' and told that she needed to have sex with Nigerian tribesmen to 'calm her down', it is claimed. Miss Lokhova, who took home ¬£750,000 a year in salary and bonuses, said the relentless bullying began before she even started work at the firm's London office because she had earlier blown the whistle on insider trading by a senior trader at the bank. She had initially quit her job as head of fixed income sales in February 2010 after being told by bosses that her complaint of insider trading was 'unacceptable'. But she was lured back to the bank's . London-based subsidiary, Troika Dialog UK, by Timur Nasardinov, who . guaranteed her an annual bonus of ¬£666,000 on top of her ¬£120,000 . salary. But once there she . claims she was subjected to a litany of degrading comments as part of a bid by her . line manager David Longmuir and chief executive officer Paolo Zaniboni . to oust her because of her whistleblowing. Miss . Lokhova, the daughter of a shipping broker, said: 'For example, my . manager and colleagues described me in sexist terms as ""Miss Cokehead"", . ""b****"", ""chemically dependent minigarch daughter"" and ""Miss Dodgy . Septum"" in communications made to senior people within Troika group and . to clients.' Svetlana Lokhova is suing her firm after claiming she was bullied and tormented by male colleagues . In one email her boss David Longmuir, who now accepts the drugs slurs were untrue, told a client 'we are all quaking here - awaiting arrival of Ms Cokehead in a puff of sulphurous smoke'. Senior analyst Mikhail Stiskin allegedly wrote an email to a co-worker where he said how he 'knew a few tribe leaders in Nigeria... proper alpha male... she needs to relax after the stressful period of the past months. These guys would help'. Miss Lokhova claims boss Paolo Zaniboni was among those who victimised her because she blew the whistle on insider dealing, which he denies . Miss Lokhova said she 'burst into tears' when she read the comments made about her. She said: 'I believe this comment is indicative of the bank's chauvinistic culture generally, and discriminatory treatment of me. 'The references to me being mentally unstable and a drug user were particularly hurtful for me because my mother suffers from mental illness and alcoholism. 'My whole life has been dedicated to trying to rise above the destructive behaviour that had afflicted her. 'To discover the extent of the sexist comments made against me is shocking."" Six months after she started at the London office, her name was on a 'firing list' for poor performance and she started a grievance process against the bank. She was signed off sick with stress before finally resigning in April last year. She is suing the bank for sex discrimination, harassment, victimisation and constructive dismissal. The bank strongly denies the allegations and claims that Miss Lokhova routinely lost her temper and lacked experience in equity sales. A document submitted to the tribunal, Naomi Ellenbogen QC, representing Troika, states: 'Aspects of the claimant's performance, namely her ability to work effectively and harmoniously with others, were of concern to her employer and colleagues.' It adds that Miss Lokhova had a 'rude and dismissive attitude towards colleagues, her unprofessional behaviour and her tendency to lose her temper and self control when things did not go her way'. Spokesman Paul Marriott said 'Sberbank CIB cannot comment on the specifics of a historical matter which is subject to the judgement of an employments tribunal.¬† However, the company is confident that it has acted appropriately and lawfully and will vigorously defend itself against all allegations made.' The hearing continues.","Svetlana Lokhova is suing Sberbank for more than ¬£5million .

Media pressure group Hacked Off made extraordinary threats against Labour in a bid to ‚Äòsabotage‚Äô cross-party talks on Press reform, it emerged last night. The group threatened to publish a statement in which victims of phone hacking would condemn Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman and Nick Clegg in the strongest terms for agreeing to a ‚Äòdirty deal‚Äô. The statement even suggested that David Cameron‚Äôs plans would make the Queen complicit in a ‚Äòstitch-up‚Äô. The Hacked Off campaign attempted to blackmail labour leader Ed Miliband while he was in talks about press regulation . The revelations came as the Coalition parties published rival plans for Press reform, which MPs will now vote on in a showdown in the Commons on Monday night. All three main parties will order their MPs to fall into line on Monday. But Labour sources said they were in talks with a group of about 20 Tory rebels who may be persuaded to defy Mr Cameron. A small group of Labour MPs could also rebel, but most Westminster observers believe the Parliamentary arithmetic is narrowly against the Prime Minister at this stage. A draft press release was shown to senior Labour figures on Tuesday ‚Äì just 24 hours after the three party leaders had been on the verge of a deal on bringing in a tough new system of Press regulation by Royal Charter. Hugh Grant (left) and J K Rowling (right) are both involved in the Hacked Off campaign . Sources close to the talks said Mr Miliband then tabled 20 new demands the following day, making a deal ‚Äòunworkable‚Äô.

A spokesman said: ‚ÄòThis draft press release was written as a worst case scenario and was never formally sent to the media. We had to be prepared for every eventuality.‚Äô Labour insisted it had not changed its position as a result of the intense lobbying by Hacked Off. A source said the fresh demands tabled by Mr Miliband had already been raised ‚Äòmany times‚Äô with officials.

They would also remove control from editors of the newspaper code of practice. Industry sources last night said the issue was a ‚Äòred line‚Äô which would see newspapers refuse to sign up to the deal. In other respects the proposals represent a climbdown by Mr Miliband, who initially backed Lord Justice Leveson‚Äôs call for media regulator Ofcom to oversee a new Press regulator whose role would be ‚Äòset out in statute‚Äô. The retreat will fuel suspicions that the Labour leader has been playing to the gallery by calling for the full implementation of Lord Justice Leveson‚Äôs plans in public, while privately conceding they were unworkable. A Tory source last night said the Prime Minister‚Äôs decision to pull the plug on cross party talks had ‚Äòflushed out‚Äô Mr Miliband.

Somewhere inside Jim and Joanne Bell‚Äôs neatly kept bungalow, you might find Mrs Bell relaxing in two pairs of socks and a woolly hat. She is wearing three knitted jumpers, sometimes a dressing gown as well, and beneath it all she is embracing a hot water bottle. In an armchair beside her is her husband, similarly dressed. Tonight, if he‚Äôs lucky, he may also be in possession of the Bell family‚Äôs secret weapon against these unseasonably chilly evenings: Bobby, the black miniature poodle, snuggled cosily on his lap. Wrapping up: Joanne and Jim Bell, pictured, took the drastic decision to turn off all the heating at their home in protest over rising energy costs . Cold outside: Mr and Mrs Bell at the their home, in Devon, with pet dogs Lucky and Bob . Saving money: For the last year the couple have not been using any heating in their home . Yes, it‚Äôs pretty darn cold here since . the Bells turned off the heating a year ago ‚Äì and it‚Äôs not going to get . much warmer. Because for the last 12 months, through one of the . nastiest, drawn-out winters for years, the couple have survived on the . deliciously warm feeling they get from knowing their money is no longer . going to a greedy, profit-obsessed energy company. Other more elderly and vulnerable . individuals have no choice but to turn up the gas, but in a courageously . defiant stand against spiralling bills, Mr Bell, 64, and his wife, 67, . have sacrificed the modern day comfort of central heating for the kind . of conditions their grannies took as the norm.

Money: Mr Bell said the couple had received a ¬£300 rebate from British Gas on their dual fuel bill in the last 12 months . Turned off: The couple have no intention of putting the heating back on, despite the freezing temperatures this winter . Protest: The Bells said their protest of principle on behalf of hard-up families all over Britain was 'a kick in the teeth' to energy giants who had hiked their prices over the winter . According to Mrs Bell, it took a . little while to convince her husband that abandoning central heating was . the right way to go. ‚ÄòWe had a bit of a face-off,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòI turned . it off, he turned it on, I turned it off.

British families are shelling out ¬£2,000 a year more than people in . other countries thanks to the high cost of transport, energy and . property costs, according to new research. Figures have shown that the cost of living in the UK is 11per cent . higher than the international average, and an incredible 18per cent . higher than it is in the United States. Among the biggest cost for British people is transport, which is a staggering 31per cent more than overseas thanks to high fuel duty, motoring costs and expensive public transport. Expensive: British families are paying more for fuel and property as research shows that the cost of living in the UK is 18per cent higher than in the US, and 11per cent higher than the rest of the world. Costly: Commuters such as those at Paddington Station in London are victim to some of the highest public transport prices in the world . The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) worked out how pricey life in the UK is after analysing data created by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Experts at the CEBR also came to the conclusion that if they government brought down prices to be in line with international averages over the next decade, it could boost the economy by 15per cent. As well as high transport costs, . British people also face paying 18per cent more for housing and . utilities, such as water and fuel, 14per cent more on recreation and . cultural activities, while restaurants and hotels are 12per cent more . expensive. However, the researchers . calculated that if prices of housing, commercial property, energy and . transport were brought down to average levels over the next decade, it . would save every UK household more than ¬£2,000 pounds a year. Economy: British people, such as these shoppers on Oxford Street, pay more for transport, recreation, restaurants and housing . Positive: Experts have calculated that if costs were brought inline with those overseas it would save British families ¬£2,000 a year (file picture) Of course these cost savings could not . be made overnight,' said CEBR chairman Douglas McWilliams at a lecture . at Gresham College in London last month. 'But . supposing that they were phased in over 10 years, a rough and ready . simulation suggests that they would be associated with a rise in GDP of . around 15per cent compared with what would otherwise have happened. 'Such a boost would offset much of the growth weakness which I currently expect to see in the UK over the coming years and would bring the rate of economic growth over this period to around the historic average of 2.5per cent.' Mr McWilliams said that car usage was heavily taxed in the UK and that public transport was among the highest in the world. He said that other high costs reflected the price of property. Although the OECD figures show that it is more expensive to live in Britain than it is in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy and France, the UK is still a bargain compared to Denmark. The cost of living in the Scandinavian country is 29per cent higher, and it is also pricier in Ireland, Canada and New Zealand. The analysis from the CEBR comes as the Government continues to try and boost growth. The . Treasury was believed to be blocking Liberal Democrat proposals for a . 'plan A plus' which would aim to boost the economy through . housebuilding. Last month . figures released showed that the economy shrank by 0.3per cent in the . final quarter of 2012 and had been flat for the rest of the year. A . forecast of just 0.9per cent has been forecast by the OECD for 2013, . and new figures set to be released on Wednesday were expected to deliver . a similarly downbeat assessment of the UK economy.

A businessman tried to carry out a ¬£42,000 insurance fraud by claiming his 'tatty and dull' Bentley was a different car which he had photographed during a test drive. Peter Webb, 56, paid just ¬£3,700 for what was described as a 'tatty and dull' Bentley Mark VI which he planned to use for his wedding chauffeur business. Ipswich Crown Court heard how he insured the car in February 2011 for ¬£42,000, only to report it stolen two months later from a garage near his home. Caught: A businessman tried to carry out a ¬£42,000 insurance fraud by putting fake number plates on a classic Bentley car while on a test drive. This image shows the vintage Bentley which Peter Webb used . Webb told his insurance company Grouparama Insurances that his valuation of the car was accurate as he had splashed out ¬£38,000 in cash on restoring it from scrap. When the insurers became suspicious and demanded to see the invoices, paperwork and pictures of the restoration work, he insisted it was all in the boot of the stolen car. Webb then tried to prove his story by taking a fully restored 1950s Bentley Mark VI for a test drive from heritage motor dealers P & A Wood in Great Easton near Dunmow, Essex. Unbeknown to staff at the showroom, he drove to a country lane where he fitted the immaculate Bentley with a different number plate showing the registration number of his car. Webb, of Ipswich, then took a photograph of the car at the roadside before removing the fake number plate and returning the Bentley to the unsuspecting dealer. He then submitted the photograph to his insurers along with another picture of the interior of a Bentley which he found on an internet advert. Scam: Peter Webb took these photographs which he gave to investigators looking into his claim . Prosecutor Michael Crimp said his scam was uncovered when insurance investigators went on to Google and found the car in Webb's pictures was really the other vehicle in pristine condition. A witness who carried out an MoT test on Webb's car in December 2010 described it as 'tatty and dull' and totally unlike the car in the photographs shown to the insurance company. Webb, 56, admitted making a fraudulent insurance claim with the intention of gaining ¬£42,000 and was fined ¬£10,000. He was also ordered to pay ¬£1,000 prosecution costs, a ¬£15 victim surcharge and ¬£1,323 to the insurance company to cover the costs of their investigation. Judge Rupert Overbury told him: 'You wanted to make sure you got as much from the insurance company as you possibly could. 'You inflated the car's value and obtained pictures by pretending to take the exact car for a test drive. 'Plainly you must have taken your number plates with you for that test drive and swapped them over and taken photographs.' Engine Size:¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 4 1‚ÅÑ2-litre .

The judge added that Webb had gained nothing from the scam as he had been caught out by the insurance company. Michael Latham, defending, said Webb had initially bought the car to use for weddings and chauffeuring. He said Webb's business interests had suffered as a result of the recession and he regretted his involvement in the fraud. Webb was arrested at work after Groupama Insurances referred the case to the City of London Police's Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department. He initially pleading not guilty, but later admitted the attempted fraud . Det Con Declan Malone, who led the City of London Police investigation, said: 'Webb thought he had a clever plan to claim a substantial five figure sum from his insurer with his story that his restored Bentley had been stolen. 'However, the insurers saw through his fraud and referred the case to us and we were quickly able to establish he had committed a crime. IFED will continue to bring insurance fraudsters to justice.' Andrew Pagett, the counter fraud manager at Groupama Insurances said: 'This is an excellent result for both us and IFED. 'Groupama Insurances' dedicated Fraud Team became suspicious of this claim at an early stage because of inconsistencies in the customer's story, compounded by the lack of supporting documentation confirming the existence of his vehicle. 'We are grateful to IFED for pursuing this case and are extremely satisfied with the outcome which demonstrates the insurance industry's commitment to fight fraud and protect innocent policyholders.' The Bentley Mark VI which was made between 1946 and 1952 was Britain's first post-war luxury car. Around 5,200 of the cars were made .

Pressure: Sir David Nicholson was in charge of the regional health authority responsible for Mid Staffs when 'the appalling and unnecessary suffering of people' took place - but will not resign . Civil servants 'neutered' the Francis report into 1,200 deaths at the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust to protect the Head of the NHS over his role in Britain‚Äôs worst-ever health scandal, an expert said today. Professor Brian Jarman, who was a key figure in highlighting sky-high death rates at Stafford, said the final version of the ¬£13million report was 'muted' and failed to mention criticisms of Sir David Nicholson given in evidence. Sir David, dubbed the man with no shame, is under huge pressure to leave his role after presiding over the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Many MPs, relatives of the 1,200 dead and health service professionals believe patient care will not improve under his leadership, but the NHS chief executive maintains there is no chance he will resign. Robert Francis QC's damning 1,782 page report shocked Britain after it found ‚Äòfailures at every level‚Äô which led to the scandal, while not a single nurse or doctor has been disciplined or struck-off. Patients at Stafford Hospital were left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases, given the wrong medication or sent home with life-threatening conditions. 'I feel the final report was muted. The 2010 report and the closing submissions to the Francis inquiry were much clearer with regards to the evidence,' Professor Jarman told the Daily Telegraph. 'You have to remember that the final version of these inquiries are written up by Department of Health officials. They neutered it. Although Professor Jarman admits it is . 'difficult to prove' Whitehall was seeking to protect Sir David . Nicholson, he added: 'I think it probably has the effect of protecting . him.' Professor Jarman claims that the report only briefly mentioned an allegation that Sir David told hospital regulators to ignore campaign group Cure the NHS, set up by family and friends of those who died at unnecessarily Stafford. Tomorrow Sir David will come under further pressure when he appears before MPs on the Health Select Committee. They are expected to ask him why he ignored warnings from relatives . about Mid Staffordshire a year before the scandal came to light. Fury: Relatives and campaigners who lost loved-ones blame Sir David Nicholson for not getting to grips with problems on his watch . The Francis report was put together with the help of civil servant Alan Robson, the inquiry's secretary.¬† Disagreeing with Professor Jarman, Peter Watkin Jones, Solicitor to the Inquiry, said, ‚ÄôTo suggest that the report was ‚Äúneutered‚Äù by ‚Äúmandarins‚Äù is wholly wrong. The Department of Health was not given a draft of the report and therefore did not ‚Äúwrite up‚Äù the final or any version of it. The decisions about what went into the report were the Chairman‚Äôs. Alan Robson was seconded from his job at the Department of Health and acted entirely independently of the Department as Secretary to the Inquiry.‚Äô A spokesman for Robert Francis QC said that Professor Jarman's allegations were 'unfounded concerns'. 'The report was written by the Chairman with the editorial support of his inquiry team,' the spokesman said. 'This team included the Secretary to the Inquiry who was seconded on a full time basis from the Department of Health to work for the inquiry, but who has acted throughout independently of the Department, and subject to the instructions and decisions of the Chairman. 'The Department of Health was not given any draft of the report and therefore did not ‚Äúwrite up‚Äù the final or any version of the report. The decisions about what went into the report were the Chairman‚Äôs.' Sir David has faced growing calls to resign since a report criticised him for his role in the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, where up to 1,200 died needlessly. Last Thursday, for the first time since the report was published three weeks ago, he met directors from the NHS Commissioning Board. Families of patients who suffered poor care at Mid Staffordshire had attended the meeting in the hope that Sir David would be given a vote of no-confidence. But they left the room when the chairman of the board, Professor Malcolm Grant, made it very clear that Sir David would be staying in his ¬£211,000-a-year post. Struggle: Sir David has faced calls to resign since a report implicated him in the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal - but experts say it was 'neutered' to 'protect him' Earlier, when Sir David was asked if there was any chance he would resign, he defiantly replied ‚Äòno‚Äô. Backing: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and other cabinet members continue to support Sir David in his job . Addressing the meeting later, he said: ‚ÄòAs many of you know I‚Äôm very passionate about improving services for patients. 'I‚Äôm very ambitious about the NHS and what that sometimes turns into is intolerance of poor performance which results in the kind of response ‚ÄúJust get it right‚Äù when actually we need to be more reflective, think about why people are doing the things they do. 'Patient safety is the top of the tree. We need zero tolerance of failures of patient safety.‚Äô Sir David was in charge of the regional body supposedly overseeing Mid Staffordshire but which failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care. As chief executive of the Department of Health, he is said to have dismissed warnings from relatives of patients who died, saying they were ‚Äòsimply lobbying.‚Äô A group of 20 members of Cure the NHS staged a silent protest outside the building in Manchester where the meeting was held. Some carried placards with the words ‚ÄòThe man with no shame‚Äô while others held up pictures of a gravestone with the words ‚ÄòToo many deaths, no accountability‚Äô. Julie Bailey, 51, who founded the group after her mother Bella died at the trust said: ‚ÄòOur long campaign for a public inquiry into what happened at Stafford Hospital will have been pointless if this man remains in charge of the NHS. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs part of the problem, and while he‚Äôs still there we have no faith that the health service will be led towards the caring culture it needs.‚Äô","Criticisms of Sir David Nicholson omitted from Francis report, expert says .

Assault: A nine-year-old boy was sexually abused by George Victor Hughes, 71, pictured, at a caravan park after the victim's mother refused to believe he was being assaulted and sent him back to his attacker . A nine-year-old boy was sexually abused by a pensioner at a caravan park after his mother refused to believe he was being assaulted and sent him back to his attacker. George Victor Hughes, 71, groomed and assaulted the boy at the caravan park where they both lived in Furness, Cumbria, on three occasions. The defendant, who is disabled due to childhood polio, befriended the young boy, taking him out in his special mobility vehicle and to the cinema. He showed him porn and sex toys he kept in his home. Miss Zoe Nield, prosecuting, told the . court Hughes' victim, who is now 58, had a violent, alcoholic father . and a mother who physically and sexually abused him. Miss . Nield said the victim's mum would often lock him out of their caravan . and, on the night of the first incident, told him to go and stay in the . defendant's caravan. When he got into bed Hughes got in with him and . performed a sex act on him. When . the boy went home and told his mother, she said he was making it up and . tried to send him back, resulting in him sleeping under her caravan. When he tried to tell her again the following day, she said he was . exaggerating. Miss Nield . then told the court about two more occasions when, despite his . protestations, the victim was sent back to Hughes' caravan and similar . incidents occurred, although the second occasion involved an act of a . more serious nature. In each case, the defendant had given the victim Babycham. The court heard how the victim had . struggled throughout his life as a result, and finally went to the . police after receiving counselling. Hughes, of Barrow, appeared for sentencing yesterday after admitting three charges of indecent assault following the incidents between March 1964 and February 1966. Sentencing Hughes to four years in . prison at  Barrow Crown Court , Judge Beverley Lunt told Hughes: 'There is only one victim here . who merits sympathy and it's not you. Jailed: Hughes was sentenced to four years in prison at Barrow Crown Court, pictured . 'The offences took place a very long time ago - 48 years - he's had to live with that every day. 'You, meanwhile, have been leading a life with a reputation as a decent man, which is wholly undeserved.' Miss Nield also shared police intelligence suggesting Hughes showed a 'concerning interest' in children as recently as 2007, when he was said to have watched youngsters play in various Barrow parks and offered them money to push him in his wheelchair. Last summer, he was banned from a cinema after asking an 11-year-old girl to shake his hand. Mr Gareth James, defending, said Hughes admitted his guilt at the first opportunity, he added, and argued his age and disability meant he posed little threat to children now.","George Victor Hughes, 71, groomed and .

Quiz show king: David St John, 64, has appeared on 28 television quiz shows over 31 years . For more than 30 years, no one has questioned his passion for entering TV quiz shows. In fact, David St John claims to be Britain‚Äôs most prolific contestant. The trivia-mad 64-year-old has racked up 27 appearances on game shows including 15 to 1, Eggheads, The Chase and The Weakest Link. He first put his grey matter ‚Äì and his seemingly unchanging hairstyle ‚Äì to the test on TV in 1982 on Sale Of The Century, and won two motorcycles. It was the beginning of an obsession that has seen the married father of two from Cannock, Staffordshire, crowned champion on nine different shows. He even travelled to Australia to take part in an Ashes-style clash of Sale Of The Century champions in 1986, where team mates included future Egghead Daphne Fowler. Over the decades, Mr St John, a professional comedy entertainer, reckons he has won about ¬£5,000 in cash, holidays and other prizes. His latest appearance was last week on Face The Clock, hosted by impressionist Rory Bremner, although he lost. ‚ÄòI love taking part in any TV quiz show and to win is a bonus,‚Äô he says. ‚ÄòIf I lose then it makes me more determined to win the next one.‚Äô He has sometimes been a victim of his success. ‚ÄòI did get voted off the Weakest Link quite quickly as some of the other contestants recognised me and saw me as a threat. That was probably the worst experience. But that‚Äôs the nature of the game.‚Äô In 1990 Mr St John competed on Gyles Brandreth‚Äôs quiz and talent show Star Quality. But his favourite appearance was on Wipeout in 1998, when he got to meet his comedy hero Bob Monkhouse.

A schoolgirl is lucky to be alive after being hit by a car then dragged along the road under a bus in a horrifying incident captured on CCTV. The 12-year-old, who cannot be named, was left with a fractured skull and broken collarbone as she rushed to cross Rochester Road in Gravesend, Kent. But incredibly police say she is awake and talking, but must spend a few more weeks recovering in Kings College Hospital in London. Safety campaigners say the video should . serve as a warning to others, as the girl ran across traffic through a . gap between parked cars. Frightening: In the top left of the screen the schoolgirl is seen sprinting across the road in front of a car . Strike: The student's blurred body is shown as it is hit by the vehicle and thrown up into the air . Tossed: A split-second later she is then thrown sideways into the road towards oncoming traffic . Horror: Moments later a bus drives into the picture and the schoolgirl goes under its wheels . The video was from a local business and released to the press, capturing her crossing Rochester Road in Gravesend towards a parade of shops when she was knocked into the path of the Arriva 480 bus during the busy school run. A schoolboy is seen dashing out of K's Convenience Store, where the footage is shot, and desperately trying to find the girl who became wedged under the bus and dragged along for about five metres. Emergency services were called to Rochester Road - between Empress Road and Old Road East - at 8.15am last Wednesday. Firefighters used air bags to release . the young girl before she was rushed to casualty. Journey: Before the bus driver can stop he drives on and the girl's frame can be seen clearly under its front wheels . Scene: A boy runs out of a shop and peers under the bus looking for the girl who remains under its wheels and her school bag lies on the road now behind the vehicle . Remarkable: Motorists stopped their cars and got out to help and luckily the child survived - but safety campaigners have warned people to cross safely . Kevin Clinton, head of road safety for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'In very busy areas like this, it is really important for everyone to be concentrating and to be patient. Pedestrians should take their time and find a safe place to cross the road. 'It is even more important for drivers to be aware that pedestrians, especially children, may well make mistakes and drivers need to anticipate that and in particular, watch their speed.'

Tragic: A coroner has called for tighter restrictions over the sale of helium after the suicide of schoolboy Grant Li (pictured) A coroner has called for tighter restrictions over the sale of helium after a straight-A student was free to buy canisters on the high street so he could kill himself. Grant Li, 16, a pupil at Manchester Grammar School, was found dead in his bedroom by his mother having told her the gas was for an end of term party. Grant had two GCSE exams left to sit, both in Mandarin, when he was . found dead on June 1 last year. It was later confirmed he achieved nine . A* grades and one A. He had bought helium canisters from a supermarket two months earlier. He was described by teachers as a model pupil, but had suffered from acute eczema and was under GCSE exam stress, an inquest into his death was told. Finding his cause of death was suicide, Graham Jackson, Manchester's deputy coroner, said he would write to Home Secretary Theresa May to call for greater regulations over the sale of 'party pack' helium canisters and urge changes are made to their size and control valves - a call supported by Grant's family. There are currently no age restrictions on buying helium canisters. He ruled it would never be known why the 16-year-old took his own life. The inquest heard his suicide was the fifth death involving helium in Greater Manchester in four years. Last week, an inquest heard of the death of 22-year-old Manchester Metropolitan University student Vivek Ajit Shah at a house in Rusholme, also using helium. The hard drives of both his laptop and PC were found to have been wiped, indicating that he may have carried out internet-based research, the inquest at Manchester Coroner's Court was told. Grant's mother, hotelier Yan Li, 48, described him as an intelligent and conscientious student, but revealed his eczema flared up during his revision. Bright: Grant Li was a student at the prestigious Manchester Grammar School (pictured) but had suffered exam stress in the run up to his death . She said she took him to buy balloons in April ahead of a period of study leave. Mrs Li said: 'He was very hard working. He concentrated on his studies. I was pleased with his progress and he has always been a very clever boy. He said he wanted to get some helium balloons. He said that because it was the end of school term, he had to buy them and take them to school because they wanted balloons and it was his responsibility to get them.' Similar: An inquest in Manchester last week found that student Vivek Shah, 22, had also used helium to kill himself . The inquest heard no balloons were bought, just the cannisters. Mrs Li said she had no doubts about his intentions with regard to them and added: 'I did not notice any change in his behaviour, only on the very, very last night before his death.' The inquest heard Grant had an evening meal with his family on May 31, but was found dead in his bedroom the following afternoon. Nick Sharples, Grant's form tutor, described him as an excellent student. He said: 'A book of condolence was opened after his death. From the comments everyone talked about what a nice lad Grant was.' Mr Jackson recorded a verdict of suicide. He said: 'It may be down to the problems he faced with eczema and exams, but that is pure supposition. 'We will never know. Grant was a young lad and the world was waiting for him. 'I am satisfied that he was supported by a loving and caring family. It is sad to say but who knows what he might have achieved in life? 'I intend to write to the Home Secretary to see if there is any way of introducing some regulation in the sale of these gas cannisters and urge regulations are introduced for control valves. 'I will also request that consideration is given to reducing the size or the volume of cylinders for hire or sale.'Mrs Li supported the call to government. She said : 'I back what the coroner has said. I would also like to see tighter restrictions on the internet with regards to research about suicide in these circumstances.'","Grant Li,16, told his mother the gas was for an end of term party .

Trial: Catholic priest William Finnegan as he leaves Bradford Crown Court, after being found guilty of sexual assault of a 17-year-old girl . A Catholic priest who had been secretly married for more than a decade was today warned he may go to jail for sexually assaulting a teenage girl on Easter Sunday last year. William Finnegan, 59, known to his parishioners as Father Bill, denied forcefully kissing the 17-year-old and touching her bottom, but was found guilty by jurors at Bradford Crown Court. It took the jury almost a day of . deliberating before returning a verdict of guilty, prompting gasps and . cries from Finnegan's supporters in the public gallery, where the young . victim was also sitting. Recorder of Bradford Judge Roger Thomas QC told Finnegan 'there's a lot . of thought to be given' about the sentence he will receive, which could . include an immediate prison term. Judge Thomas said: 'This case, albeit sexual assault of the least type, does have to it factors of another type. 'What the ultimate sentence will be, I have an entirely open mind about . but that ranges from immediate imprisonment to other arrangements of a . community nature.' Sensationally he reveled during the trial he broke his vows by marrying one of his parishioners in a civil ceremony abroad and then continued to do his job. Far from being a celibate priest, Finnegan was enjoying an . active sex life with his wife, the jury heard. The revelation was made by Finnegan‚Äôs barrister as part of his defence case during the trial at Bradford Crown Court. Shock: Finnegan (left) revealed in his trial he secretly married Beverley Dawson (right) despite being a priest . Judge Roger Thomas, QC, asked Finnegan before he gave evidence: ‚ÄòYour public announcement of this today is news to everyone?‚Äô Scandal: A supporter puts his arm around Finnegan after he is told he faces jail . The defendant replied: ‚ÄòIt is, and I will be dealt with.‚Äô Finnegan was parish priest at St Clare‚Äôs Roman Catholic Church in . Fagley, Bradford, when the assault happened on Easter Sunday . last year. He denied sexually assaulting the teenager by touching her bottom and forcefully kissing her. Jeremy Hill-Baker, defending, told the jury: ‚ÄòYou may be thinking that . he is only human, that Father Bill, as a Catholic priest, has taken a . vow of celibacy, condemning himself to a single and lonely life filled . with perhaps an underlying sexual frustration because, let‚Äôs face it, it . is not a natural state for a human to be in. ‚ÄòIt would be understandable for you to be thinking, ‚ÄúWell, perhaps it just got the best of him with that 17-year-old‚Äù.‚Äô Mr Hill-Baker then dropped the bombshell that Finnegan married Mrs Dawson, a mother of two, in Cyprus in September 1999. Mr Hill-Baker told the jury: ‚ÄòNo, you didn‚Äôt mishear me.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòSo . deeply in love was he that he was prepared to ignore the Catholic .

Apprentice winner Stella English was today accused of 'running to the teacher' when she complained to Lord Sugar that more than ¬£1.4million from one of his businesses still had to be invoiced, a tribunal heard today. The multi-millionaire is being sued for constructive dismissal by Ms English, 34, who won series six of the BBC1 show in 2010. Ms . English was given a ¬£100,000 role with Lord Sugar's IT division Viglen . as her prize but resigned in May 2011 and complained that her role there . was that of an 'overpaid lackey', something her former boss strongly . denied. The mum-of-two previously told the East . London tribunal how relationships at the company soured after she told . her boss Bordan Tkachuk that ¬£1.4 million had not been invoiced. Giving evidence this morning, Mr Tkachuk accused the 34-year-old of setting 'false alarm bells ringing' when she told Lord Sugar there was a problem. Legal battle: Stella English, pictured arriving for the fourth day of the tribunal today,¬† is claiming constructive dismissal by Sir Alan Sugar (pictured yesterday), who has called her 'suspicious' and 'untrusting' Evidence: Viglen chief executive Bordan Tkachuk (pictured right in The . Apprentice) accused her of 'running to the teacher' by complaining to Lord . Sugar about unpaid invoices . 'Stella didn't understand . this was work in progress so to come out and say there is missing money, . then that is ridiculous without discussing it with me first,' he said. 'Numbers are all over place and it is normal there are outstanding amounts of money. It is not a revelation. 'After the claimant went to Lord Sugar it was like she had set false alarm bells ringing. 'It's like running to a school teacher claiming something that isn't true.' Previously she said when she emailed . the Viglen MD asking if she could discuss these matters with him, he . sent her a scathing reply, copying in everyone else in the office. Straight talk: Miss English told the tribunal that Alan Sugar dismissed her as a: 'Nice girl, don't do a lot' Stella wept earlier in the week as she . said he wrote to her: ""I don't know what you're doing but this ain't . how things work around here.' The senior executive also denied telling former Ms English that there was no job for her. Bordan Tkachuk told the East London . Tribunal Service: 'I do not understand why I would say ""there is no job"" because obviously there is a potential job for one of the two . candidates. 'I did not say there was no role. For the five previous contestants there was a job for them.' Mr Tkachuk also denied that Lord Sugar made the comment 'Nice girl. Don't do a lot' about Ms English when he asked what he thought of her during a meeting between them. He told the tribunal: 'I don't remember him saying that but the inference might have been that.' He recalled that she was 'a nice girl but probably had a lot to learn'. Mr Tkachuk denied that he had shown 'bullying behaviour' towards Ms English, of Whitstable, Kent, or that he did not get on with her saying 'I had no problem at all with her.' He described her as 'naive' about how procurement works. Row: Lord Alan Sugar (pictured yesterday) said that his former employee's claims were 'blunt lies' and accused her of trying to extract money from him . Lord Sugar met his former employee Stella English (second from left, front row) on the series that was aired in 2010 - but now she is suing him . Her resignation from Viglen caught him 'a bit unawares and it was a bit of a surprise', he told the tribunal. The reason behind it seemed to be that she did not like working in IT having come from a banking background, he suggested. He took her to lunch to discuss the situation away from the office as she was 'clearly a little bit emotional about it,' he stated. Mr Tkachuk said: 'She explained that she did not feel that the IT industry or the company location was for her. She was not happy with working in the industry - it was a different culture. 'It was an amicable meeting. We got on well. We were there for a couple of hours or so. There was certainly no animosity to myself or the company.' He said he was surprised because she was in a 'potentially well-paid' role in a 'learning job' where she could make progress. Lord Sugar later gave her another role at internet set-top box company YouView after she resigned from Viglen in May 2011. Ms English claims that Lord Sugar told her he would not be renewing her contract during an unscheduled meeting on September 28, 2011. The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday.","Series 6 winner is suing Lord Sugar for constructive dismissal .

Hidden: Files on celebrities accused of sex crimes, like Jimmy Savile, were likely hidden from most police officers, it emerged today . Hundreds of files on celebrities, politicians and other VIPs accused of sex attacks and abuse were so heavily protected by senior police that investigating officers could not access them, it emerged today. Information on high profile suspects was marked as 'secret' or 'restricted' and only available to a small number of officers - a system which may have helped prolific offenders like Jimmy Savile and MP Cyril Smith escape prosecution. The approach to sensitive files was designed to stop officers from leaking information to the media, experts say. The issue of detectives being unable to access relevant intelligence was highlighted in a report on the effectiveness of the Police National Database (PND) in the wake of the Savile scandal. It came after complaints about Savile made to different police forces across the country while the TV presenter was still alive were not able to be shared by detectives. Metropolitan Police Commander Peter Spindler confirmed that famous people were protected by high levels of confidentiality built into intelligence systems. 'Any high-profile or sensitive case will be restricted on our systems because we are not going to let 50,000 people (Met officers and staff) across London read sensitive material about celebrities, politicians or other high-profile people,' he told The Times. 'We have had some officers and staff who were prepared to leak information to the media for payment and the mechanism to prevent that was to restrict access to that information.' But police believe their new PND, launched in 2011, will help prevent similar errors in the future. The system allows sensitive material to be located but accessed only with the right clearance. Claims: Former MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith was another high profile abuser believed to have been protected by police . Speaking after the report was published last week Chief Constable Mike Barton, the Association of Chief Police Officer's lead on intelligence, said the current system is capable of being interrogated by any trained officer across the UK to 'identify suspects, offenders and patterns of behaviour'. The National Association of People Abused in Childhood said that police had put the protection of celebrities before children. But spokesman John Bird added that he believes police are striving to 'get it right in future'. The first national shared database for police in England and Wales was set up in 2003, while a later system in 2006 allowed officers to search for intelligence but restricted access to sensitive records.","Hundreds of documents on famous suspects marked 'secret' or 'restricted'

A chef was killed by a single punch in a takeaway when he intervened in a trivial dispute over cheesy chips, a court heard today. Ricky Guest-Binns, 44, suffered a fatal bleed to the brain after he was felled by a blow to the side of his head from roofer Allan Glenny, 24, at the shop in Blackpool. Glenny had complained to staff they had not melted cheese properly on a portion of chips he had ordered for his girlfriend and then exchanged words with several customers. Brutal: Allan Glenny, 24, left, hit chef Ricky Guest-Binns, 44, with such force it caused devastating fatal brain injuries following the row over chips . His victim is thought to have been ushering him out of the premises in the early hours of May 5 when Glenny turned around and swung a punch at him. Glenny was today jailed at Preston Crown Court for three years and four months after admitting manslaughter at a previous hearing. The court was told the defendant hit another man in similar fashion moments later outside the Chicken Express takeaway in Caunce Street. His second victim, Daniel Rourke, was part of a group who were attempting to capture Glenny on their mobile phone cameras after he made off following the attack on Mr Guest-Binns. The defendant was given an extra two months in prison for the admitted common assault of Mr Rourke. Glenny, of Blackpool, handed himself into police the same day of the incidents and admitted he was the culprit. He confessed he drank 'quite a lot of lager', together with a number of spirits and also consumed a small amount of cocaine. Joseph Allman, prosecuting, said Glenny told police: 'I have ruined my life and some family over one punch. A few words have been exchanged and it‚Äôs just Blackpool, Friday night.' Mr Allman said: 'It is the prosecution‚Äôs case that Mr Guest-Binns did not do anything that could have provoked the assault upon him. 'It is appalling this incident should have happened over whether cheese had been melted on the defendant‚Äôs chips.' He said the facts of the case had been pieced together from CCTV footage which captured the attack shortly before 1am and from various witness statements. Caged: Glenny was jailed at Preston Crown Court, pictured, for three years and four months after admitting manslaughter at a previous hearing . One customer said he recalled the . victim reacting to Glenny‚Äôs complaint by telling him he should not talk . in the manner he did to the shop worker. Glenny . was also said to have been involved in an exchange of words with a . separate group of four young men including Mr Rourke who accused him of . holding up the queue. The defendant dropped some of his food as he went to leave the premises and was then approached by Mr Guest-Binns who was said to have told him 'just get out, go home'. Glenny said he thought the chef was part of the other group of men and was scared that he was going to be assaulted so he punched him. Mr Guest-Binns fell backwards and was immediately dazed and distressed from the blow, said Mr Allman. 'A number of people in the takeaway tried to perform CPR on Mr Guest-Binns but sadly by the time the paramedics arrived there was no sign of life,' he continued. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. A pathologist later stated the blow that led to his death was of 'moderate force'. The prosecutor said the victim‚Äôs mother, Valerie Guest-Binns, on hearing of her son‚Äôs death said 'she could not believe what she was being told and simply felt numb'. She said he would be 'sadly missed' by the family - none of whom were in court today. Julie Taylor, defending, handed over a number of testimonials to the judge from Glenny‚Äôs family, friends and employer. She said: 'They all have a common theme which is underlining his good character and their disbelief that this could have happened. 'Clearly the events in the early hours of May 5 were a tragedy for two families. A tragedy to a much lesser degree for the defendant and his family. 'He was a quiet, law-abiding young man, no doubt with hopes and dreams for the future. 'The most difficult thing is that this defendant fears for his future and that he has one and Mr Guest-Binns does not because of his actions. He is a young man wracked with guilt. He plays over the early hours of May 5 over and over again and wishes he could turn back time.' Passing sentence, Judge Pamela Badley said: 'I want to stress that no sentence can properly reflect the loss of life.' Following sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Andrea Barrow said: 'This was such a tragic and unnecessary loss of life which goes to highlight the potential dangers of drinking far too much alcohol and being oblivious to the consequences of your actions. 'Our thoughts remain with the family today and hope that this result today will bring them some closure and help them, in some small way, to cope with their tragic loss although nothing anyone can do will ever bring Ricky back.'","Victim Ricky Guest-Binns, 44, suffered a fatal bleed to his brain after receiving the devastating blow .

Living in a state of permanent sexual arousal might not sound like such a bad deal for many of us, but for Amanda Gryce, 22, it's no laughing matter. The 22-year-old says her life is being ruined by constant multiple orgasms which can be triggered by just about anything imaginable, including loud music, car journeys and even ringing mobile phones. And it can happen absolutely anywhere - . when she's with her friends and even while she's at work as a sales . associate in a baby products shop. Embarrassing: For Amanda Gryce, 22, having 50 orgasms a day is no laughing matter . Torture: Amanda has suffered from the condition since she was eight and says it has ruined her life . The reason for the daily onslaught of orgasms is a rare condition known as Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome or PSAS, which first manifested when Gryce was just eight years old. And although PSAS is rare, it can have a devastating effect on the handful of people who suffer from the condition . Last year, 39-year-old Gretchen Molannen, from Florida, committed suicide after battling the condition for 16 years. The news was particularly difficult to take for Amanda, also from Florida, who sometimes has to masturbate up to 15 times in one day to get relief. She said: 'It is not pleasurable: you could say it has become a torture. This condition controls your life completely and it is like living a nightmare.' Something kinda ooh: Amanda has to adopt special positions to control her many orgasms . Passion killer: According to Amanda, her condition intimidates would-be boyfriends . Young: Amanda was just eight years old when the condition first began to manifest itself . 'I can have 50 orgasms in one day and five or ten within an hour of each other. It happens when I'm with my friends or out in public and it's very embarrassing. 'It kills me inside. I just have to put on a smile and pretend that nothing's wrong. 'Orgasms are supposed to be a good feeling but I've had them every day for so long now that I'm living with constant fear and shame.' She added: 'At my lowest points, I have thought about suicide but I had to reassure myself that I would never resort to something like that and that it wasn't going to happen to me.' Amanda first began suffering from the condition when she was just eight and by the age of 13 she was battling the intense feelings as she sat in her classroom during lessons. But, raised Catholic and told in Sunday school that sexual thoughts and masturbation was a sin, she was too scared to confide in anyone. Tough: Almost anything can give Amanda an orgasm including car or plane travel and ringing mobile phones . Cry for help: The condition can take a terrible toll on sufferers with some even committing suicide to escape . She said: 'As a child I had no idea what was happening to me - I thought I was just sex-obsessed. I had to masturbate to relieve my condition and I felt guilty every time I did it.' It wasn't until 2008 that she heard about PSAS while listening to the radio but despite contacting four different doctors for help, found that none had ever heard of the condition. Since then she has tried to move on with her life and, at 20, even lost her virginity after years of fearing sex would make her condition worse. But she admits she has not been able to have a steady relationship - because men either take advantage or are intimidated. She said: 'When I lost my virginity I was left emotional and disappointed. It didn't make me feel better. The guy that I was with seemed sympathetic at first but then used my condition to get more sex. 'I've been with a few guys since but it's difficult- I've found some guys are even intimidated. 'Thankfully I've had the courage to tell my family and they have all been very understand and supportive.' She added: 'I get people say I'm making it up and that I'm really a nymphomaniac but I don't let it faze me. 'I just now hope that there will one day be more understanding of this condition and my story will give just one other person the courage to get support.'","Amanda Gryce, 22, suffers from Persistent Sexual Arousal Syndrome .

Commander Derek Rae, commanding officer of HMS Enterprise, said: 'These features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the Red Sea flooded millennia ago. Submarine canyons are steep-sided valleys cut into the sea floor.

Turbidity currents are dense, . sediment-laden currents which flow downslope when an unstable mass of . sediment that has been rapidly deposited on the upper slope fails, . perhaps triggered by earthquakes. 'Some may be far younger and still in the process of being created by underwater currents driven by the winds and tidal streams as they flow through this area of the Red Sea, carving their way through the soft sediment and being diverted by harder bed rock.

One of Britain's most senior policemen today warned a new generation of 'Jimmy Saviles' could thrive as the UK's legal system puts too much pressure on rape victims. Sir Peter Fahy said the UK's courts had become 'adversarial' towards men and women who suffer sexual abuse and 'exploited weaknesses in their behaviour' to blame them for their ordeals . The 53-year-old Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police also said children's homes would have to be turned into prisons and carers to become wardens to stop runaway girls going missing and falling into the hands of grooming sex gangs. It came as Jimmy Savile‚Äôs decades of abuse could have been stopped nearly 50 years ago, a damning inquiry revealed today. Documents show potentially vital intelligence about his sex crimes was buried in 1964 because he was a celebrity. The earliest known allegation against the DJ was discovered in a Scotland Yard Paedophile Unit ledger dating back to that year. Scroll down for video . Abuse: DJ Jimmy Savile presenting Top of the Pops in 1976, more than a decade after the first reports of his predatory behaviour . This afternoon Sir Peter Fahy suggested a new police national HQ should be created to deal with paedophiles operating across the country - and thereby dodge issues over police force boundaries. Sir Peter, himself a father of four, highlighted the case of violionist Frances Andrade, 48, who committed suicide after being cross examined over her sex abuse ordeal at the hands of her former teacher at the Chethams School of Music in Manchester. Struggle: Sir Peter Fahy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police has warned of a new wave of 'Jimmy Savilles' as the UK's legal system put too much pressure on rape victims . 'Police forces have significantly improved the way that victims are treated but the fact is many, many victims do not come forward or if they do are reluctant to support a prosecution,' he said. 'This highlights another issue in the way our adversarial court system treats victims. Whatever other evidence is collected prosecutions for sexual offences rely hugely on the evidence of the victim. 'In a case of burglary the victim will not be blamed for leaving the front door unlocked. In sexual offences the behaviour of the victim, whether they had been drinking, any weaknesses of character how they were dressed may well be picked over at great length in the court room. 'This pressure on the victim and the way any weakness will be exploited means that prosecutors and police officers are cautious in taking cases to court'. Sir Peter said the various investigations into the failures to to catch Saville did not address 'fundamental underlying issues' and instead looked to blame individual members of staff. He added: 'Sexual predators will inevitably pick on vulnerable victims who often have other problems in their lives and suffer from low self-esteem'. 'We can continue to criticise individual members of staff (social workers) for individual failings but this ignores the complexity of these issues and the way that our system of criminal justice affects the victims of sexual offences.' Today's report linked Savile with young girls at a Surrey children‚Äôs home but police failed to act on the information. Two later allegations ‚Äì from a woman who said Savile sexually assaulted her at Top of the Pops and an anonymous letter branding him a paedophile ‚Äì were also buried in police files. These were classified as ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô or marked ‚Äòrestricted‚Äô by the Metropolitan Police and so weren‚Äôt readily available to other forces and hindered the chances of Savile facing charges before his death in 2011. Shame: Scotland Yard had been told about Savile's sex crimes in 1964 but it was buried . Failure by police to ‚Äòjoin the dots‚Äô meant that the potential for further investigation and a prosecution of Savile was missed, Her Majesty‚Äôs Inspectorate of Constabulary found in its report Mistakes were Made. Forces across Britain come under fire for ignoring Savile‚Äôs victims and in a shocking warning, HMIC said there was a ‚Äòdistinct possibility‚Äô that police could fail to prevent a similar Savile scandal. The Met launched Operation Yewtree into the allegations against Savile last October following an ITV documentary exposing him. Around 450 people came forward making specific claims, with 214 recorded as crimes ‚Äì including 32 rapes. Accusations: The 1964 allegation linked Jimmy Savile with young girls at a children's home in Surrey, but no action was taken at the time . Disgraced: Around 450 individuals have contacted police with allegations against Savile since the launch of Operation Yewtree . But when HMIC asked the 43 police forces in England and Wales to scour their records just five allegations and two pieces of intelligence were recorded against the disgraced star during his lifetime. Of the five allegations, one victim contacted the Met in 2003, three went to Surrey police in 2007 and one to the Sussex force in 2008. Police intelligence was limited to the 1964 ledger entry and the record of an anonymous letter that the Met received in 1998 naming Savile as a paedophile. The 2003 report came from a woman who said she had been assaulted by Savile in 1973, when she was 15, at a recording of Top of the Pops. She said Savile put his hand over her bottom and when she objected he replied: ‚ÄòI thought that‚Äôs what you came here for.‚Äô The Met Police didn‚Äôt interview Savile and marked the record ‚Äòrestricted,‚Äô said HMIC, seemingly because of Savile‚Äôs celebrity status. The classification was to have ‚Äòa profound effect,‚Äô said the HMIC, because it rendered the 2003 report ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô to Surrey police when they carried out checks in 2007 after the three claims made to them. The 1998 letter was marked ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô because of Savile‚Äôs celebrity status and because it contained allegations of blackmail and paedophilia. It claimed that Savile had changed his phone number in Leeds because a rent boy was trying to blackmail him. HMIC said that had Surrey police known about the letter and the 2003 complaint, their investigation would have been pursued more vigorously. Intelligence on the letter was passed to police in Leeds but HMIC said it did not have authority to investigate the relationship between West Yorkshire Police and Savile. The force has referred the issue of Savile‚Äôs contact with one of its former inspectors ‚Äì over claims he ‚Äòacted on behalf‚Äô of Savile while the DJ was being investigated for sex crimes ‚Äì to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. HM Inspector of Constabulary Drusilla Sharpling said: ‚ÄòThe findings in this report are of deep concern, and clearly there were mistakes in how the police handled the allegations made against Savile during his lifetime. 'However, an equally profound problem is that victims felt unable to come forward and report crimes of sexual abuse. It is imperative that all those charged with protecting these victims do more to encourage reporting.‚Äô Alan Collins, a solicitor from law firm Pannone who is representing more than 40 of Savile‚Äôs victims, said: ‚ÄòIts contents demonstrate that the police knew as far back as 1964 that there were allegations that Savile was a child abuser. ‚ÄòOver the subsequent years further opportunities to investigate Savile were lost, and this was because of the inability to join-up the dots. Consequently Savile was able to carry on regardless duping the country and the price was paid by his many victims.‚Äô","Sir Peter Fahy says that too many victims are blamed for their ordeals .

A Welsh photographer has been told he cannot bring his new bride to the UK and may be forced to leave the country after the Home Office said he is not a British citizen. Craig Colville was born in St Asaph in North Wales to British parents but the UK Border Agency has denied his new wife Crystal Levy permission to stay in the country, claiming that he 'does not hold settled status'. Mr Colville, who even has a twin brother whose citizenship has never been disputed, is now facing leaving Britain over the blunder. Officials admitted that the bizarre claim was a 'clerical error', but insisted that Mr Colville‚Äôs new wife would have to leave the country in any case because she does not make enough money to stay. Couple: But Craig Colville and Crystal Levy could be separated after the bride was told she must leave Britain . Mrs Colville has been ordered to return to her native Canada, and Mr Colville may have to leave the UK in order to be with her. The 31-year-old was born in St Asaph in North Wales and was raised in the area, later moving across the Border with England to Chester. He met his future wife in 2006 when they were working on a cruise ship together, and after a long-distance relationship she moved to Britain on a temporary visa in 2010. The couple married in Llangollen in July last year, and 29-year-old Mrs Colville applied to the Home Office to become a permanent resident of the UK. However, UKBA officials turned down the application, claiming that Mr Colville 'does not hold settled status, is not a British citizen and is not a person with refugee leave/humanitarian protection'. The letter to the couple came despite the fact that the Welshman sent in his passport to support his wife's application. Identical: But Craig Colville, right, was mistakenly told he was not a British citizen even though his twin brother Scott, left, is, as both were born and raised in North Wales . Mr Colville said: 'My wife and I are extremely upset by how poorly the Home Office has treated our case. It should have been very straightforward as I am a British citizen.' The couple were told they had to launch an official appeal to get the decision overturned - but the appeal was turned down because a UKBA worker mistakenly told them they had 10 working days to send it in when in fact they only had 10 days. 'When we called to query this we were told the only thing we could do was to lodge an official appeal against the decision not to allow us to appeal,' Mr Colville said. 'It's getting beyond a joke now, I dread to think how much this is going to cost the taxpayer to sort out.' He added: 'Every bit of paperwork they've sent has been incorrect.' Mrs Colville has been told that if her . appeal is unsuccessful she 'must leave the United Kingdom as soon as . possible' when her present visa runs out. The letter from UKBA adds: 'If you do not leave the United Kingdom voluntarily, you will be removed to Canada.' Cutting the cake: A Home Office blunder initially stopped the couple from appealing against the decision . Mr Colville said: 'I do not have the right to live or work in Canada and my worst fear is that we would be separated again, ruining everything we have worked towards.' His twin brother Scott has never had any problems with his citizenship or right to live in Britain. Two of Mrs Colville's grandparents were British, meaning that she could have applied for UK citizenship in her own right if she had known about the problems. A UKBA spokesman said: 'The original paperwork sent to Ms Levy contained a clerical error regarding her husband‚Äôs nationality and we have written to her this week to clarify the situation. 'We are clear her husband is a UK national and the error did not affect our decision to refuse Ms Levy‚Äôs application for further leave to remain, which was made because she did not meet the necessary financial requirements.' The couple contacted their local MP, Stephen Mosley, and he agreed to write to UKBA in support of the citizenship application. Together: The pair met when they were both working on a cruise ship in 2006 . The only extended period of time Mr Colville has spent outside the country came when he worked on a cruise ship where Mrs Colville was also employed. 'We were in next-door cabins,' he said. The first time I saw her I thought: 'She looks like fun. She also looks trouble!' 'We got chatting at crew parties when we were stationed in Alaska for three months - it was an interesting place for a romance to blossom.' He said the couple's wedding last summer had been 'beautiful', adding: 'We'd like to start a family and build a decent way of life, but that's pretty much impossible under the current circumstances.' Mrs Colville said she shared her husband's frustration at the UKBA's blunders: 'I know they have a backlog of cases, but these mistakes were avoidable and we did nothing wrong. 'But nobody is reading the paperwork any more. And when I asked for an appointment to speak to someone face to face I was told that wasn't possible. 'We are just hoping everything will work out right.' Partners of British citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the UK Border Agency. They must prove that they and their other half are both over 18, that their relationship is 'genuine and subsisting', that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under UK law, and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the UK. UKBA also requires proof that would-be British citizens have met their partner in person, that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under UK law, and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down. Financial requirements: Barman Justin Tutt has been told he is not earning enough to keep his South African children with him in the UK following the sudden death of their mother . Finally the applicant must show that they meet UKBA's list of 'suitability requirements', along with its English language requirement, and - crucially for Crystal Colville - its financial requirement. This states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a British citizen must have an income of at least ¬£18,600. If the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country, the minimum income goes up to ¬£22,400. Each additional child requires an additional income of ¬£2,400. The UKBA states on its website that applicants can meet the financial requirement from the employment or self-employment of their sponsor, as well as through their own employment. Cash savings are also taken into account when applications are being considered, along with any benefits or pension payments the applicant or their sponsor receive in the UK. Last month barman Justin Tutt, 29, told how he was facing having his two children taken into care 8,500 miles away after being told he was not earning enough to keep them in the UK. Mr Tutt brought his son Seth, eight and five-year-old daughter Leigh to live in England with him following the sudden death of their mother in their native South Africa. But despite Mr Tutt holding a British passport and having another son born in the UK, under new immigration rules cracking down on asylum seekers claiming benefits, Seth and Leigh cannot stay here as they must be living in a family earning at least ¬£22,500 a year. Because Mr Tutt brings home only ¬£120 a week and his fiancee is on maternity leave, the youngsters will be deported in March and are likely to be taken into care. New rules governing the applications of the partners of British citizens came in on July 8 2012. Would-be British citizens who applied before that date were required to prove that they and their sponsor had adequate means to support themselves without relying on state handouts, but no specific minimum income level was set.","Craig Colville, 31, lives in Chester and married Crystal, a Canadian woman .

When confronted over why he failed to act, Mr Clegg also took a swipe at the press, saying they should stop being 'self appointed detectives' and let the experts investigate.

A woman who suffers from 'severe vertigo' has won a legal battle with a council after she refused to move into the 16th-floor flat it offered her. The Court of Appeal said the decision of a Westminster City Council official who concluded the flat 16 floors up was 'suitable' for the woman was 'perverse'. The woman, who was not identified in a written Court of Appeal judgement published today, had suffered a panic attack and collapsed when visiting the property in Maida Vale, central London, judges were told. 'Perverse': The woman, who suffers with 'severe' vertigo, was offered a flat on the 16th floor of a council-owned block . Three judges had been told, at a hearing in London, that the woman's husband took legal action against the authority after failing to persuade staff to offer a flat on the ground or first floor. An official who dealt with the case had thought that the woman, who objected to the offer from Westminster City Council, would settle 'in time', the court heard. But judges were told that the woman had 'severe vertigo' and had suffered a panic attack and collapsed when visiting the flat. The official had not given 'proper weight' to medical evidence, they said. The woman's husband had appealed after a county court judge ruled in the council's favour.

Barclays paid 428 bankers more than ¬£1 million in 2012, despite suffering a torrid year in which the bank's chief executive Bob Diamond and its chairman Marcus Agius were forced to resign after Barclays was fined ¬£290million for rigging Libor interest rates. The number of staff paid over ¬£1 million was down from 473 in 2011, according to new disclosures in its annual report released on Friday. Barclays said five staff were paid over ¬£5million last year, down from 17 people in 2011. A further 50 were paid between ¬£2.5million and ¬£5million in 2012, and 373 staff were paid between ¬£1million and ¬£2.5million.

While more than 400 workers picked up . more than ¬£1 million, there were more than 71,500 staff who received . less than ¬£25,000 last year.

He said last month he would . forgo his bonus in the wake of the Libor rate fixing scandal and subsequent fine. Jenkins had previously been the head of retail and business banking.

This is the moment a newspaper photographer trying to take a snap of heavy fog that had blanketed a bridge captured a couple's suicide leap. The photographer had been standing on a viewing platform ready to take a snap of the fog shrouded bridge across the Wuhan Yangtze River in Wuhan, at Hubei province in central China. He said: 'The mist was so thick on the bridge so large that it looked as if the bridge was standing on and disappeared into air. Like a bridge into nothingness. Pictured: A person jumps off the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge in Hubei province . 'To be honest I didn't even see the first person jump because I was concentrating so much on the camera settings and I didn't realise at first that I had snapped the man jumping to his death . 'It was only then after snapping the photograph that I heard someone shout that somebody had jumped. I heard him hit the water below and then seconds later a woman climbed onto the bridge and jumped as well. 'I was totally paralysed - there was no way I could get anywhere near her, I still had my hand on the camera and I tensed and shot off another few frames entirely by accident - but ended up photographing the woman as well.' Police identified the man from some of the possessions he left at the top and said he was a 20-year-old migrant worker named as Liu Han, and believed that the girl who has not yet been identified was his lover. It is not known why the pair had made a pact to throw themselves to their deaths. The . boy's uncle contacted by telephone said that he knew the young man was . struggling to make a living and he can only assume that it was money . that was the problem - as without an income it would have been difficult . for him to settle down with the young woman. Police who searched the river after . seeing the photographic evidence that the pair jumped failed to find . either of the bodies and after dark the search was called off. A police spokesman added: 'That is a 40 metre drop - it is extremely unlikely that either of them are still alive.' Suicide . rates among young people are high in China, where a person tries to . kill themselves every two minutes, the government says. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, China's suicide rate is 22.23 people out of every 100,000. About . 287,000 people kill themselves in the country of 1.3 billion every . year, while about two million try to commit suicide annually. The disease control centre said suicide is the biggest killer among Chinese aged 15 to 34. Falling: The young couple jumped into the Yangtze River from the bridge one after another in the haze yesterday . Extreme pressure to perform well at school and to find employment were the main reasons behind the high rate of suicide among China's youths, media said. The suicide rate in rural areas is three times higher than in urban centres and accounts for 75 per cent of China's suicide total, it said. According to the Guangzhou Daily, the number of suicides in China has risen sharply during the reform and open period, when the nation's economy has boomed and tall buildings and structures like buildings have been built. Many spots such as the Wuhan Yangtze bridge have been dubbed a 'lovers' leap' after the number of couple who have committed suicide there. In 2009, the British medical journal The Lancet identified Lithuania, Finland, Latvia, Hungary, China, Japan and Kazakhstan as all having exceptionally high rates of suicide, 20 per 100,000 people or higher.

Relatives of Omagh bomb victims tonight vowed to relentlessly pursue the ¬£1.6 million in damages that the men found liable for the attack have been ordered to pay. Their pledge came after two republicans were ruled responsible for the 1998 atrocity at the close of a landmark civil case in Belfast High Court. The families insisted they had also not given up on securing a criminal conviction for the dissident republican outrage that claimed the lives of 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins. Colm Murphy and Seamus Daly, both from the Republic of Ireland, had faced a retrial after they successfully appealed against a finding of liability made against them and two other republicans at the end of the original civil case four years ago. Trial: Colm Murphy (left) and Seamus Murphy (right) were ruled as being among the men responsible for the Real IRA attack . But their second trial delivered the same outcome in the same court, with judge Mr Justice John Gillen today ruling the men were responsible for the Real IRA attack. Between them, Murphy, Daly, Real IRA chief Michael McKevitt and republican Liam Campbell owe the 12 bereaved relatives who took the case ¬£1.6 million. However, the decade-long civil action, which could still be subject to another appeal, is estimated to have cost the taxpayer many millions more in legal aid and court bills. Stanley McCombe, whose wife Anne was killed, said the families were determined to make the four men pay up. 'When you go before a court and you are fined for whatever you do, you pay your fine, you pay your debt to society, whatever you do, so why should these people get away, why should these people live in the lap of luxury?' he said outside court. Michael Gallagher (left), who lost his son Aidan, and Stanley McComb who lost his wife Ann, in the Omagh bomb attack, stand outside Belfast High Court where Murphy and Daly were found liable for the bombing following a landmark civil action taken by relatives of some of the victims . Michael Gallagher, whose 21-year-old son Aiden died in the blast, said retrieving the damages would send a signal to terrorists contemplating similar acts of violence. 'We feel that the judgment that we were granted here in 2009 would be a very hollow judgment if the law wasn‚Äôt seen to be carried through and that the people that we were given a judgment against weren‚Äôt pursued, that will be pursued of course,' he said. 'That would be the deterrent for others not to pursue terrorism.' Mr Gallagher said the families‚Äô campaign for a full cross-border public inquiry into the bombing would go on and he urged the police on both sides of the border to examine the High Court judgment for evidential opportunities. No one has been successfully criminally convicted of the attack. 'We have not given up on criminal conviction,' he said. The devastation caused by the bomb explosion in Market Street, Omagh, Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland . 'That‚Äôs really what we wanted in the first place and sadly it was left up to the families to get a result and to hold people to account for this crime.' Not all the Omagh victims‚Äô families supported the High Court action, with some claiming it was a waste of time that would not deliver a prison sentence. At the conclusion of the original civil case, the families‚Äô groundbreaking action had already cost them an estimated ¬£2 million, with more than ¬£750,000 provided in the form of 'special status' legal aid granted by the Government. They were supported in their efforts to raise funds for the court case by former US president Bill Clinton, former Northern Ireland secretaries Peter Mandelson and Sir Patrick Mayhew, as well as musician Bob Geldof and boxing champion Barry McGuigan. Mr Gallagher predicted the overall cost of the action, factoring in legal aid on both sides and the added costs of the appeal and retrial, was 'tens of millions'. 'Certainly I want to know the total cost of this trial and all the subsequent appeals and trials,' he said. 'We think it is scandalous that so much money, it has cost so much money to get justice for the families. 'Every time we meet politicians and ask for a public inquiry they always cite the fact it‚Äôs going to cost too much money and take too long, well this process has now taken 11 years and has cost tens of millions of pounds.' Murphy, a builder and publican from Dundalk, Co Louth, and Daly, a bricklayer from Cullaville, Co Monaghan, were found liable along with McKevitt and Campbell in the initial civil judgment in 2009. McKevitt, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence in the Irish Republic for directing terrorism, and Campbell, who recently successfully fought extradition proceedings to Lithuania on arms smuggling charges, failed in their bids to overturn the Omagh civil judgment. They are now seeking to have their case heard in the European Court of Human Rights. Murphy and Daly‚Äôs appeals were upheld but both men were ordered to face another trial. The retrial started in January and finished last month, with Mr Justice Gillen delivering his reserved judgment today. Neither defendant was in court for the judgment. Both men also declined to give evidence during the trial.","Colm Murphy, Seamus Daly, Real IRA chief Michael McKevitt and republican Liam Campbell owe the 12 bereaved relatives who took the case ¬£1.6 million .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:58 EST, 5 August 2011 . A father who had a four-year sexual relationship with his daughter after she traced him through the internet has been jailed for 10 months. Andrew Butler, 47, was tracked down by 25-year-old daughter Nicola Yates through the family tracing website Genes Reunited. She was sentenced to 26 weeks imprisonment suspended for two years - in what was the second time the pair had been charged with incest. Affair: Office worker Nicola Yates, 26, tracked down real father Andrew Butler, 46 and began a sexual relationship . Birmingham Crown Court heard how the pair, who had not seen each other since 1992, discovered two decades later they had been living just streets apart in the city. When they met again for the first time, Yates, who was 20 at the time, enjoyed a 'highly charged, emotional reunion' with her father. Relatives were later horrified to discover the young woman and Butler had become illicit lovers. The daughter and father were arrested in September last year after her family alerted police. Yates, from Castle Vale, Birmingham, and Butler, from Yardley, Birmingham, both admitted having sex with an adult relative. Incredibly, the couple had admitted the same charge four years ago and were both punished for the offence - but reignited their affair for a second time afterwards. On the first occasion, Yates was given a community order for 18 months . On the first occasion, Yates was given a community order for 18 months and Butler received four months jail. But in 2008 the pair started up their affair again, to the horror of relatives who thought Yates had put her incestuous relationship behind her. Her family's worst nightmare returned when Yates announced she had a 'new boyfriend' but was reluctant to introduce him to her family. Around the same time fun-loving Yates updated her social networking sites, revealing a string of intimate facts about herself including that her favourite pastime was 'sex, sex, and more sex'. When Yates's sister Natalie, now 19, discovered sexual phone pictures of the pair, she showed them to their mother, who is said to have exclaimed in horror: 'That's my ex-husband!' Sentencing the pair at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge James Burbidge QC said: 'I accept from everything that I have read about you both that you appear to have a relationship with genuine affection but it was an illicit relationship. 'It is a relationship regarded as abhorrent by society in general for understandable reasons.' He said Butler was a manipulative individual and accepted that Yates was immature and vulnerable. Yates and Butler both admitted having sex with an adult relative after appearing at Birmingham Crown Court, pictured, earlier this month . Genetic Sexual Attraction (GSA) is a . term that describes the phenomenon of sexual attraction between close . relatives, such as siblings, first and second cousins or a parent and . offspring who first meet as adults. It is not the same as incest, though this is what it is called if a sexual relationship is then entered into. The term GSA was coined 30 years . ago by American Barbara Gonyo. She wrote a book about the lust she felt . for the adult son she had given up for adoption 26 years earlier. She . never acted on her feelings. GSA is rare between people raised . together in early childhood due to a reverse sexual imprinting known as . the Westermarck effect, which desensitizes them to sexual attraction. Experts believe that this effect evolved to prevent inbreeding. Aggravating features included the harm it had done to the families involved, and that they had had a child which was aborted. Yates's mother and Butler had married in 1985 but had divorced in 1992 and after that Butler had no contact with Yates. When officers went to Butler's house they found a phone containing text messages between them which was 'evidence of a sexual relationship which had taken place'. Police also recovered a laptop with sexually explicit pictures of them both as well as cards and a love letter. Rob Cowley, defending Butler, said: 'This was not a relationship that involved any element of coercion, manipulation or abuse of position of authority. 'It was a sexual relationship enthusiastically participated in by both parties.' Liz De'Oliveira, defending Yates, added: 'It was a very close and loving relationship but at some point it has overstepped the boundary and has become a sexual relationship.' Incest remains one of society's last taboos and is an unthinkable concept to most people. Yet . research by the British Medical Journal showed that half of those . separated from relatives at a young age experience strong sexual . feelings when they are reunited. Psychiatrists . believe the natural repulsion brothers and sisters feel for one another . as children acts as an inhibitor to committing incest. But those who miss out on this time can develop powerful, obsessive feelings for their sibling in adulthood.","Andrew Butler, 47, jailed for 10 months .

"PUBLISHED: . 17:12 EST, 9 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:39 EST, 21 November 2012 . A remorseful teenager was sentenced Friday to life in prison with no chance for parole for his role in a deadly plot to lure men desperate for work with phony Craigslist job offers. 'I thought it was something horrible,' a grim-faced Brogan Rafferty, 17, told Judge Lynne Callahan before he was sentenced. If his life has been hell since the killings last year, 'They must be living in it,' said Rafferty, gesturing with his cuffed hands at victims' relatives who crowded the court. He said they also were victims of his crimes. Convicted: . Brogan Rafferty was sentenced to life without parole for his role in the Craigslist murders . Rafferty told the judge, who will preside at the January trial of alleged triggerman Richard Beasley, 53, that his mentor is evil and deceitful and said he wished he had taken the opportunity to flee and stop the killings. 'There were many options I couldn't see at the time,' said Rafferty, who remained composed during the sentencing, watching with a slight frown as relatives of the victims addressed the court. 'You know nothing of remorse, you know nothing of shame,' Barb Dailey, sister of Timothy Kern, told Rafferty in an eye-to-eye confrontation just steps apart. Without true repentance, 'You will be destroyed,' she told Rafferty, who nodded slightly. Lori Hildreth, sister of the lone survivor, Scott Davis, 49, read a statement from him as Rafferty's mother sobbed. 'It was only by the grace of God that I survived,' Davis' statement said. 'You took from me a chance to have a normal life.' Remorse: Rafferty told the judge that he wished he had stopped the killings . Davis' statement reminded Rafferty . that they shared a meal before he was wounded and said Rafferty had a . chance to 'stop what was about to happen.' The judge, acknowledging the high . emotions in court, said she had considered Rafferty's age, broken-home . childhood and lack of any prior record, but said it was outweighed by . 'executions' that were cold, calculated and methodical. 'You had the opportunity to stop the deaths,' she said. Rafferty's defense attorney, John . Alexander, said the prosecution had offered as recently as Monday to . recommend a sentence of 30 years to life in return for his testimony . against Beasley. The prosecution said that was a framework for . discussion, not an offer. Rafferty is willing to testify . against Beasley, according to Alexander, who said that 'if it weren't . for Richard Beasley, Brogan wouldn't be sitting here' in court. Accused Craigslist killer Beasley could face the death penalty if convicted at his separate trial in January . Victims: As well as Ralph Geiger, David Pauley (left) was found buried in . a shallow grave last year. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (right) Rafferty was convicted of aggravated murder and attempted murder in the deaths of three men and wounding of a fourth. The sentencing was delayed from . Monday amid talks on a deal for leniency in return for Rafferty's . testimony. Rafferty was looking to avoid a life sentence without hope of . parole. The jury rejected the defense claim that Rafferty feared for himself and his family if he didn't cooperate with Beasley. Beasley, described as the teen's spiritual mentor, has pleaded not guilty and faces a Jan. 7 trial. Prosecutors say the victims, all down in their luck and with few family . ties that might highlight their disappearance, were lured with phony . offers of farmhand jobs on Craigslist last year. One man was killed near Akron and the others were shot at a southeast Ohio farm during bogus job interviews. Prosecutors say robbery was the motive. Rafferty, a high school student from . Stow near Akron, was tried as an adult but didn't face a possible death . penalty because he is a juvenile. Lured: The attacks took place after men responded to the same advert offering work on a 688-acre cattle farm . Beasley, an ex-convict and self-styled street minister from Akron, could face the death penalty if convicted. The surviving victim testified as the . prosecution's star witness. Davis identified Rafferty as Beasley's . accomplice and told the jury a harrowing story. Davis, who was looking to move close . to his family in the Canton area, said he was walking across what turned . out to be a bogus job site when he heard a gun cock and turned and . found himself face to face with a handgun. He said he pushed the weapon . aside, was shot in the arm and fled through the woods. During Rafferty's trial, Alexander . painted Beasley as the mastermind and said that the first killing came . without warning for Rafferty. The three murdered men were Ralph . Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Kern, 47, . of Massillon. Authorities say they were targeted because they were . older, single, out-of-work men with backgrounds that made it unlikely . their disappearances would be noticed right away.","Rafferty's sentence includes no chance of parole .

Magistrate Wayne Middleton was shown enjoying downhill grass skiing during his appearance on Channel 4'S Coach Trip in 2011 . North Somerset Magistrates Court heard Middleton had began claiming disability living allowance and incapacity benefits in 2003 after being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term condition that causes pain all over his body. But the DWP claims the former zoo volunteer  failed to inform them that the condition had improved and continued claiming handouts for six years between 2005 and 2011. The court was told Middleton became so accomplished at salsa dancing he trained as an instructor and taught at least two 45 minute classes each week. Salsa instructor Wayne Middleton leaves North Somerset Magistrates court where he is being tried for benefit fraud . Giving evidence today, he insisted he was still entitled to disability benefits. He insisted: 'I have to do something with my life, you just can't sit and do nothing. 'You don't know what it is like to live in pain your whole life, my pain is never going to go away.

Middleton told a court today: 'I have to do something with my life, you can't just sit and do nothing' The court heard an investigation into Middleton, from Stanton Drew, Bristol, began after investigators received an anonymous tip off. Middleton, who takes 39 tablets for his condition, told magistrates his doctor recommended he take up salsa dancing as a hobby. In 2008 he helped set up a Salsa Bristol, dance company to teach others after training as an instructor. Middleton told the court: 'The hospital I was going to helped set a goal for me and that was to learn to salsa dance. We were encouraged to do exercise. 'I have nothing to hide whatsoever, my condition is very real. 'I knew I would never be able to be a dancer so I decided to learn to teach.

Middleton was caught showing off his moves on stage when he visited Pontins, in Somerset, for a national salsa conference. Magistrates were also told that Middleton also undertook a volunteer role at Bristol Zoo to help feed birds one day a week in 2005 - while claiming benefits. In 2009, Middleton successfully applied for the position of magistrate at Bristol Magistrates Court, overseeing and determining the outcome in hundreds of cases. He told the court: 'My condition hadn't improved from 1999 and 2003 but it allowed me to fulfill my responsibility as a magistrate. 'Sitting as a magistrate was fantastic, it was one of the proudest achievements of my life.' And two years later, in 2011, Middleton signed up for Channel Four show Coach Trip, which required participants to undergo strenuous activities. He was filmed abseiling down a 150ft tower, stilt walking, salsa dancing and tumbling head over heels while grass skiing on the trip to Poland and Slovakia. Middleton added: 'I had reservations to taking part, they knew my condition. 'I didn't say no to somethings, especially the grass skiing, because I really wanted to do it.' He insisted that he had informed the job centre of his activities but failed to notify them that Salsa Bristol was making money. Middleton denies two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain payment between 2005 and 2011. The trial continues.

"By . Hugo Duncan . PUBLISHED: . 19:40 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:47 EST, 21 March 2013 . George Osborne yesterday handed the Bank of England sweeping new powers to kick-start the economy ‚Äì following talks with its new Canadian governor. In a shake-up of monetary policy, the Chancellor said the central bank should focus on boosting jobs and growth and not just controlling inflation. But the change of direction has fuelled fears Britain faces a prolonged period of record low interest rates and above-target inflation in a crushing blow to savers and pensioners. Campaigners accused the Chancellor of ‚Äòa disgraceful betrayal of Britain‚Äôs savers‚Äô. New powers: Chancellor George Osborne's Budget statement outlined plans to hand new powers to the Bank of England to kick-start the economy . The move, outlined in the Budget, has been signed off by Mark Carney, who takes over as governor from Sir Mervyn King in July. It is hoped his arrival will herald a new¬† pro-growth era at the Bank following two decades of relentlessly targeting inflation. The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 and pumped billions of emergency cash into the economy through quantitative easing in a desperate bid to stimulate growth. But Britain remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century. Mr Osborne said the Bank will still have a 2 per cent inflation target ‚Äì but added it was no longer enough to spur the economy. ‚ÄòAs we have seen over the last five years, low and stable inflation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for prosperity,‚Äô he said. The Chancellor said the new remit gives the rate-setting monetary policy committee greater flexibility to support the economy rather than just target inflation. It paves the way for the Bank to let inflation remain above the 2 per cent target for some time if the economy is not strong enough to withstand interest rate rises. He also said the Bank ‚Äòmay wish‚Äô to follow the route taken in the US where the Federal Reserve issues ‚Äòguidance‚Äô on the future path of interest rates. He added: ‚ÄòThis can help the economy because it gives families planning their futures, and businesses wondering whether to invest, more confidence that interest rates will stay lower for longer.‚Äô New governor: The move outlined in the Chancellor's Budget statement yesterday was signed off by the incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney . Mr Osborne said the Bank will provide a report on how this might work in August.Richard Barwell, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said explicit promises to keep rates low risked stoking inflation. He added: ‚ÄòMy concern is the man on the street will believe an unconditional promise has been made to keep rates low and the small print ‚Äì that everything depends on inflation remaining under control ‚Äì will get lost in the translation.‚Äô Simon Rose, of campaign group Save Our Savers, said: ‚ÄòThe Chancellor has thrown savers to the wolves. The Chancellor‚Äôs announcement will lead to even lower savings rates and still higher inflation, with appalling effects for those relying on savings income.‚Äô Analysis by Alex Brummer . Challenge: When new Bank of England governor Mark Carney walks into the inner sanctum of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street in July, he will face a colossal task . Now we know why the Chancellor felt . it was worth making Mark Carney, the incoming Governor of the Bank of . England, the highest-paid head of a central bank anywhere in the Western . world. When the 48-year-old Canadian marches . past the pink-clad doormen into the inner sanctum of the Old Lady of . Threadneedle Street in July, he will face a colossal task. Carney is being asked by the . government to do for Britain what his counterpart at the Federal Reserve . Board in Washington, Ben Bernanke, has done for America. In the U.S., . unemployment has been brought down and growth rekindled. In the face of enormous problems in . the public finances in Britain, Carney is being asked to kick-start the . economy and free our government from the perils of slump and debt. To assist him, the Bank is being given . the power to use what the Chancellor yesterday called ‚Äòunconventional . monetary instruments‚Äô to conduct the biggest monetary experiment of . modern times. The new Governor will have carte . blanche to keep interest rates low and to print money ‚Äî a process known . as ‚Äòquantitative easing‚Äô ‚Äî for as long as it takes, until such time as . the British economy has spluttered fully back to life. In theory, the . more money in circulation, the more cash there is for businesses to . invest and consumers to spend. Yet there is an enormous risk that . this strategy of flooding the country with billions in newly printed . money could provoke a full-blown sterling crisis. This happens when . international investors and speculators lose faith in the pound and sell . it on the foreign exchange markets, leading to an uncontrolled fall in . the value of sterling. The other danger is that the flood of . money into the economy could lead to higher prices, which in turn might . unleash a surge in inflation far in excess of that already squeezing . British households. Speculation that the UK is about to . embark on a grand monetary experiment has already knocked the pound down . by 8 per cent against the dollar and 7 per cent against the euro (at . least until this week‚Äôs Cyprus crisis) since the start of the year. Carte Blanche: As the new Bank of England governor, Carney is being asked to do for Britain what his counterpart at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington has done for the U.S. The scale and speed of the fall in . sterling provides a sharp reminder of how the best-laid government plans . can be blown out of the water if financial markets start to believe . that the currency is being weakened. In preparing his Budget, George . Osborne found himself with very little room for manoeuvre. His . underlying strategy of placing the public sector on short rations to . stimulate recovery has so far not worked as well as he had hoped. A combination of factors, including . the worsening crisis in the eurozone and the tighter regulation of banks . ‚Äî which has made it harder for them to lend to business and households ‚Äî . has meant a longer and more sustained period of downturn than anyone . envisaged. Indeed, irony of ironies, the . independent Office for Budget Responsibility ‚Äî Osborne‚Äôs own creation ‚Äî . has delivered him another crushing blow by halving the growth forecast . for this year from 1.2 per cent (the figure it came up with as recently . as the autumn statement in December) to just 0.6 per cent. That means Britain‚Äôs debt burden ‚Äî the . accumulation of years of feckless New Labour borrowing ‚Äî will not start . to fall until 2017-18, a year later than previously promised. By definition a ‚Äòneutral‚Äô Budget ‚Äî . which does not place any more cash in people‚Äôs pockets ‚Äî of the kind . Osborne delivered yesterday cannot by itself deliver economic expansion. This‚Äôs why Carney is being asked to . pick up the ball and run with it at the Bank of England. The Chancellor . may have reiterated his commitment to holding inflation at 2 per cent, . but he is also asking the Bank to do far more than it already is. Downturn: In preparing his Budget, Mr Osborne found himself with very little room for manoeuvre . He is setting the Bank‚Äôs Monetary . Policy Committee the awesome task of pitching interest rates for set . periods of time at levels that will encourage higher growth and lower . unemployment, while pegging back inflation. This is precisely what has been done . in the U.S., where the central bank has promised to keep interest rates . at low levels and persist with radical policies such as printing more . dollars until normality has returned to the financial system in the wake . of the 2008 meltdown. It is not yet clear what . ‚Äòunconventional‚Äô methods Carney will use. But there are plenty of hints . buried in the Budget documents. Among those listed are further rounds of . printing money beyond the ¬£375‚Äâbillion already undertaken. Another strong possibility is to . supercharge the ‚ÄòFunding for Lending‚Äô scheme, which has rekindled the . housing market by using the Government‚Äôs ability to borrow more cheaply . to lower the cost of mortgages and business loans. Carney might also consider the use of . official ‚Äònegative interest‚Äô rates, which means that banks are required . to pay an interest rate penalty for keeping their cash reserves safe at . the Bank of England. (At present they prefer to keep them in this safe . haven rather than lend to other banks that are less stable.) By thus charging a fee to the banks for not lending out their excess cash, Carney would hope to force them to lend more. One big downside of printing more . money and keeping interest rates low is that, yet again, savers with . money on deposit will see their returns savaged, and the hard-won . rewards of thrift undermined. Yet Osborne, Carney and the Government . will see this as a price worth paying if the avalanche of new cash can . resuscitate an economy operating well below its capacity. In his native Canada, Carney ‚Äî the . central banker with the George Clooney looks ‚Äî is lauded for having . steered one of the world‚Äôs richest countries successfully through the . great recession of recent years. In Britain he faces a much tougher . task in the shape of an unwieldy financial sector and a eurozone trading . partner going through its own banking and monetary crisis. Admittedly, the UK economy he inherits . is not in quite such bad shape as the Opposition parties and much of . the media would have you believe. It is growing, if only just, and the . capacity to create new private sector jobs ‚Äî more than 470,000 in the . past year alone ‚Äî is remarkable. If the Bank of England can lubricate . the machine sufficiently to boost expansion prospects, Carney could be . remembered as the monetary wizard who defied the odds¬† and saved George . Osborne‚Äôs bacon. But if the eurozone implodes, . inflation takes off and interest rates are forced higher, then the . consequences could be dramatic, with house prices falling and ordinary . families left with huge mortgage debts they can‚Äôt repay. That is . George‚Äôs gamble.","Chancellor handed new powers to Bank of England in bid to boost growth .

Christmas shoppers failed to give stores a much-needed boost, according to figures published today. High street sales fell last month compared with December 2011, and even online retailers saw a decline in sales, despite a surge in the final days before Christmas as bargain hunters snapped up deals. Some of the biggest chains, including Marks & Spencer and Morrisons, are expected to reveal worrying trading figures in the next few days. Festive cheer: Many anxious high street retailers started their sales before Christmas in an attempt to tempt shoppers through the doors, but this failed to make up for weak spending earlier in the festive season . Many anxious high street retailers started their sales before Christmas in an attempt to tempt shoppers through the doors, but this failed to make up for weak spending earlier in the festive season. Overall consumer spending was down by 1.7 per cent last month compared with December 2011, according to figures released by card company Visa. Its UK Expenditure Index, compiled by financial information firm Markit, found that high street spending was down by 2 per cent last month compared with December 2011. Website spending fell by 0.4 per cent over the same period, while mail and telephone-order sales showed the steepest year-on-year decline, tumbling by 3.8 per cent. The study is based on spending on Visa cards and the figures are then adjusted to reflect all consumer spending. Steve Perry, commercial director at Visa Europe, said: ‚ÄòConsumer spending rallied towards the end of December with week-on-week growth of 12 per cent in the week before Christmas as consumers made the most of the final shopping weekend. Difficult times: Morrisons, which is the UK's fourth biggest supermarket chain, is among those feared to have done badly over Christmas as it was squeezed by bigger rivals and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl . ‚ÄòOnline spending as a proportion of overall spending stood at 12.5 per cent during this final week, up considerably on 2011, indicating consumers‚Äô increasing preference for online purchases.‚Äô Shares in Marks & Spencer, which is seen as a high street bellwether, have tumbled as fears grow about its performance. Retail analysts have predicted that clothing sales in October could be down by 9 per cent compared with the previous year, when its results are revealed on Thursday.

Its trading update for the six weeks to the end of December is likely to show like-for-like sales fell by more than 2 per cent on a year ago. But Tesco and Sainsbury‚Äôs, which also publish their figures this week, are expected to show a modest increase in sales compared with Christmas 2011. The figures are expected to get worse in the coming months as rising energy bills put family budgets under further pressure.

Motorists are being hit with parking fines every 4.6 seconds as the number of penalties issued to drivers soars, research reveals. A total of 6.8million parking tickets were handed out by¬† councils last year ‚Äì up from 6.5million in 2010. But a quarter of parking tickets are disputed, with 39 per cent of challenges succeeding. The rise comes despite a 5 per cent fall in the number of traffic wardens from 3,882 in 2010 to 3,693 last year. The findings come from Freedom of Information requests to 71 councils by the insurer Swiftcover.com. The figures showed parking fines rose from 6,585,411 in 2010 to 6,831,666 last year ‚Äì a 3.7 per cent increase of 246,255, ‚Äòequivalent to one every 4.6 seconds‚Äô, according to the report. The 131,378 fines handed out every week last year generated at least ¬£234million for councils. Across London, a total of 4,124,561 fines were issued last year ‚Äì up 3.6 per cent on the¬† previous year. Outside the capital, Liverpool (146,503), Manchester (138,558) and Birmingham (132,684) city councils issued the highest number of fines. This is based on a minimum fine after early payment discount of ¬£25 outside of London and ¬£40 in the capital. Further research found that 51 per cent of motorists turn¬† their backs on their local high streets because of the difficulties posed by parking. On average, 74,257 fines were handed out by each local council last year, compared to 72,367 in 2010. But the report says that as fines soared, the number of local council traffic wardens of ‚ÄòCivil Enforcement Officers‚Äô fell from 3,882 in 2010 to 3,693 in 2011 ‚Äì a drop of around 5 per cent. The busiest traffic wardens were found in Liverpool, handing out an average of 2,616 parking fines each in 2011. They were followed by those in Coventry (2,220) and Worcester (2,125). That's the ticket: A total of 4,124,561 tickets where handed out in London last year up 3.6 per cent on the previous year . The lowest proportion of fines were in Sunderland where each traffic warden handed out just 296 fines on average. But higher numbers of fines also led to an increase in disputes by motorists. In 2010 some 1,677,043 parking ticket disputes were lodged with local councils and Transport for London. In 2011 that figure rose to 1,758,571 ‚Äì or 146,547 each month. However, the success rate of these challenges has fallen - from 47 per cent (780,710 tickets overturned) in 2010 to 39 per cent (683,218 tickets overturned) in 2011. Success rates in disputed cases vary dramatically by local council. They range from as little as 11 per cent in the City of Bradford, to 72 per cent in Chichester. More than third (36 per cent) of Manchester motorists who disputed a ticket were successful, while 41 per cent of appeals were upheld in Birmingham. Further research by swiftcover.com revealed that parking in their nearest town or city centre has become more difficult for two thirds (66 per cent) of motorists. Battle: While 39 per cent of motorists that challenged fines last year were successful, that success rate was down from 47 per cent in the year prior . It is forcing more than half (51 per cent) of shoppers to turn their backs on their local high-street. And six out of ten (61 per cent) of 17 to 24 year olds do not now shop in their local town, . Robin Reames, chief claims officer at swiftcover.com, said: ‚ÄòShortage of parking has become a huge issue in towns and cities across the UK in the past five to ten years. However, this doesn‚Äôt excuse illegal parking. Although it might be an easy option to park on a double yellow for a short time, it‚Äôs potentially dangerous as well as being illegal, and can result in a fine. ‚ÄòFurthermore, if your illegally parked car is a hazard and a moving vehicle crashed in to it, an insurer could in theory request up to a third of the bill from the at fault motorist.‚Äô Insurers are entitled to request for up to a third of the cost of an accident if the policyholder is proven to have parked illegally and in a hazardous way, although the firm insists this is ‚Äòextremely rate.‚Äô","Total fines rose by 3.7 per cent last year .

Shoppers are being being charged over the odds because of the fees Visa charges to process cross-border credit card transactions, the European Union claimed today. EU regulators have sent a complaint to the company, which issues about 41 per cent of all payment cards in Europe, saying its charges harm competition between banks. Retailers pay a fee to to their bank every time a card is used to pay for a product. The bank then pays Visa for the transaction to be processed. The EU Competition Commission said the company's cross-border consumer credit card fees in Europe breach EU rules and leave retailers paying too much to get payments processed. Visa Europe, the largest card network in the 27-country European Union, cut its debit card fees in December 2010 to settle a competition probe by the European Commission into that part of its business. However it has held out against doing the same for its credit card fees. The commission said its charge sheet or 'statement of objections' sent to Visa Europe also covers domestic credit card fees in eight EU countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. 'Visa's MIFs (multilateral interchange fees) harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase consumer prices,' the EU watchdog said in a statement. Visa Europe, which is owned and operated by more than 3,700 European member banks, said it regretted the Commission's decision.

One of Bryan Ferry's sons avoided jail yesterday after being caught carrying¬† a knife for a second time. Merlin Ferry, 22, had told police to go away and 'investigate real crime' when he was found with the weapon. Officers stopped the student in his uninsured Saab and were searching for drugs when they arrested him for carrying the knife. He told the officers: 'You can unarrest me now. Merlin Ferry, pictured outside Isleworth Crown Court, has been warned he will face jail if caught carrying a knife again . And he continued to show no remorse . yesterday, complaining about being forced to get up early to travel to . court from his Shropshire home. The Marlborough-educated student . received a community order after the judge delivered a stern lecture on . the¬† dangers of knife crime. The sentence comes just two years . after a case was dropped when he was stopped while carrying a Gurkha . knife. His lawyer successfully argued that weapon ‚Äì known as a Kukri¬† ‚Äì . was part of a fancy dress outfit he was wearing to a student party. Ferry, who is studying in Barcelona, . was subjected to a lengthy dressing down yesterday at Isleworth Crown . Court, in West London. Judge Paul Dugdale told him that . coming from a privileged background does not mean the 'normal rules' do . not apply to him, and warned him of the dangers of carrying a knife . 'You could walk down the corridor here . at Isleworth and go into a courtroom and hear a case where someone had . their face opened by a knife and were scarred for life. Ferry's brother Otis was one of the pro-hunt protesters, pictured in white T-shirts, who pushed into the House of Commons in 2004 during a fox hunt debate . 'That was caused by somebody who had a knife, problems arose, things happened and it ended up being used. 'You know of the number of deaths and . murders in London that are caused because people have knives in their . pockets and somebody is left dead: that is why there are a large number . of people calling for a minimum of one year's custody for somebody . caught with a knife.' The judge said many would have . expected that the 'penny would have dropped' after the first knife . incident. He added: 'Those that have the chance to make a success of . their lives without the normal hardship of life are very lucky.

Dale Cregan, who killed PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone in September, is on trial for the murders of David and Mark Short . One-eyed killer Dale Cregan told a psychiatrist that he fantasised about stabbing a father, smashing his head with a hammer and cutting his head off, a court heard. Cregan, 29, is on trial for the murders of father and son David and Mark Short in August and May last year, which he denies. He went on to kill PCs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone in an ambush in Hattersley, Greater Manchester, in September. In one interview Cregan allegedly . admitted all four killings and told the psychiatrist he had 'the best sleep of my life' after killing David Short, 46, with his 'calling card' of a hand . grenade. Cregan also said he was a drug dealer who earned up to ¬£20,000 a week, he was paranoid that the Short family were trying to kill him and he had 'fantasies' about murdering David Short. Cregan is accused of shooting David Short before tossing a hand grenade at him, blowing his body apart at his home in Clayton, east Manchester, just months after shooting dead his son Mark Short, 23, in an attack on the Cotton Tree Pub in Droylsden, Manchester, on May 25 last year. After months on the run, Cregan lured PC Hughes, 23, and PC Bone, 32, with a bogus burglary report before he opened fire on the unarmed and unsuspecting officers and threw a hand grenade at the stricken victims. Dr James Collins, a consultant forensic psychiatrist, told Preston Crown Court he interviewed Cregan three times in January this year ahead of the trial. He said Cregan told him David Short had threatened to rape his sister and his son, and he was worried the Short family would also harm his other family. Dr Collins, quoting Cregan from notes he . made of the interviews, said: '""I used to get visions of them killing my . son, perhaps by a stray bullet. I was also worried about my mother and . brother. 'Since I lost my eye it‚Äôs been worse. 'I thought if I killed David Short I thought all these thoughts would go away. 'I did feel better after killing him. I felt better for a couple of days but all the thoughts came back. 'The paranoia was so bad I used to just sit in the house on my own. 'David Short was the biggest threat. I felt quite good about myself when I killed him""' Nicholas Clarke QC, prosecuting, asked Dr Collins: 'Did you specifically ask him about the offences he is charged with?' A consultant forensic psychiatrist told the court that Cregan told him David Short (left, with son Mark) had threatened to rape his sister and his son and he was worried the Short family would also harm his other family . Dr Collins replied: 'He told me that he killed two police officers and David Short and he also killed Mark Short. 'He told me he had been thinking of . killing David Short for five years in a general sense but more . particularly in some detail for some weeks.' Cregan . told the psychiatrist that on the day Mark Short was murdered, he had . been to the gym then went on to drink 10 bottles of Peroni in a pub and . took some cocaine. He . described going into the Cotton Tree Pub and shooting John Short, . Michael Belcher, also a member of the Short family, and Mark Short - but . David Short was in the toilet when he entered the pub. Mark Short was blasted in the neck and died in his father‚Äôs arms. Cregan told Dr Collins: 'David Short had previously told me if I killed him, Mark and John would kill me. 'I was not really bothered about the others. I just wanted to kill David Short. 'The night I shot David Short I had the best sleep of my life.' Cregan has already admitted the killings of PC Fiona Bone, left, and PC Nicola Hughes, right, in September 2012 . Cregan added: 'I had thoughts of killing David Short since he threatened to rape my sister. 'I couldn‚Äôt get him out of my head. It was on my mind constantly, I could not put the thoughts away. 'I thought if I kill him, maybe I will get a rest. 'When I was having my fantasies I used to think about stabbing him repeatedly, smashing his head with a hammer and cutting his head off. What Dale Cregan told psychiatrist Dr James Collins . 'I shot David Short point-blank in the head, three times, but I would have preferred it if I would‚Äôve used a knife. 'I felt calm before killing David Short but, after, a big relief rushed through my body. 'If I‚Äôd had time, I would have cut his head off and arms and legs. I would‚Äôve gone and got a knife from the kitchen and used that. 'The thoughts were such, I knew I would have to do it. 'However, after I killed Mark Short, he said he would rape my son, he said he would set him on fire. 'He threatened my whole family. He told me ""The gloves are off"". 'So I was always going to kill him. 'It was not an urge - it was because what it was doing to me if I didn‚Äôt do it.' Cregan told the psychiatrist that, as a youngster, he would have fist fights with the nephews of David Short, who came into his neighbourhood and tried to bully people. He said he would not let them bully him and he also developed a 'bad fetish' for knives. He said he spent 18 months with his sister in Tenerife and, when he returned, began to own guns because he was interested in them, not because he needed them while drug dealing, and he went on to own around 10 firearms including machine guns. Mark Short was killed at the Cotton Tree pub in May last year . Cregan said he began dealing cocaine at the age of 22, making ¬£20,000 a week. He would get drugs from Holland and would only deal with a couple of people he knew to distribute them. He also acquired hand grenades from Holland, the court heard. Cregan said the problem with the Short family was not a turf war over drugs because 'as far as he knew' they did not deal drugs. The jury heard that Cregan denied involvement in an incident when David Short was knocked off his motorbike and had his throat cut. But he did admit confronting him in an earlier incident and firing a gun five times at his enemy - but the weapon was loaded with blank cartridges. Cregan denies that any of his co-defendants were involved in the alleged murders. What Dale Cregan told psychiatrist Dr James Collins . He denies the Short murders and the attempted murder of the three others injured in the pub attack along with causing an explosion and the attempted murder of Sharon Hark in a separate attack minutes after the murder of David Short. Leon Atkinson, 35, from Ashton-under-Lyne, is alleged to have first ordered the attack on the Shorts after his mother was slapped by one of their family. He denies the murder of Mark Short and the attempted murder of the three others in the pub at the time, along with Luke Livesey, 27, from Hattersley, Damian Gorman, 38, from Glossop, Ryan Hadfield, 28, from Droylsden, and Matthew James, 33, from Clayton, who all deny the same charges. Anthony Wilkinson, 33, from Beswick, Manchester, denies the murder of David Short, the attempted murder of Sharon Hark, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and causing an explosion. Jermaine Ward, 24, and Francis Dixon, 37, from Stalybridge, both deny the murder of David Short, the attempted murder of Sharon Hark and one count of causing an explosion. Mohammed Ali, 32, from Chadderton, denies assisting an offender. The trial continues.

Families where both parents work will be given ¬£1,200 a year per child from 2015 to help with nursery fees, the Government confirmed in the Budget. But the policy has been called 'nanny subsidies for the well-heeled' as mothers who choose to stay at home to look after their children will receive nothing. The childcare tax break is only for parents who both go out to work and earn a joint income of up to ¬£300,000. Scroll down for video . Blow to middle class mothers: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne delivering his Budget to the House of Commons . Working parents will be able to claim back 20 per cent of their nursery, childminder or nanny costs up to a total of ¬£1,200 per child. Many middle-class single-earner families on ¬£50,000 have already had their child benefit taken away. Describing . the scheme as 'a slap in the face for two million stay at home mothers' Lynne Burnham of the campaign group Mothers at Home Matter said it was . 'completely incongruous' to offer tax breaks to working families on . nearly ¬£300,000 while taking child benefit from single-earner families . on just ¬£50,000. Others . expressed frustration that the Government had failed to introduce a . married couples' tax break ‚Äì something which was promised in the . Conservative manifesto. Ministers said they hoped the new scheme would encourage low and middle income earners to work full-time. They claimed many women are put off going back to work after having children because of the costs of childcare. But . campaigners have described the scheme as 'a slap in the face' for stay . at home mothers. The new childcare subsidies have also come under fire . for delaying assistance until autumn 2015. George . Osborne insisted the policy would help 2.5 million families, including . those whose employers are not part of the existing childcare voucher . scheme. Paul and Carmen Stokes with daughter Brooke, four months old, from Harston, Cambridgeshire . New parents Paul Stokes and his wife Carmen have welcomed the new child care tax break. The benefit, worth ¬£1,200 per child per year, will enable Mrs Stokes to return to work full-time rather than part-time. Mrs Stokes is currently on maternity leave after having Brooke, who is four months old, but she is keen to get back to her job. The 34-year-old works as a manager¬† of a community safety team for Suffolk Council and earns ¬£46,000 a year. Her husband also earns ¬£46,000 a year as a service manager of a sports department for Suffolk Council. Although the couple normally earn a combined income of nearly ¬£100,000 a year, they are still entitled to receive child benefit of ¬£81 a month. And now with the added benefit of¬† subsidised childcare, the couple will be even better off. Mr Stokes says: 'One of our biggest worries is childcare so any relief is great. 'Carmen is currently on maternity leave, but is supposed to be going back to full-time work in November, which means she would have taken a year off if we can afford it.' Mr Stokes says that if the ¬£1,200 a year tax break had been introduced sooner than the proposed 2015 date, his wife probably would have returned to work sooner. Instead she will spend the next few months being a full-time mother to her young son. Mr Stokes said he thought the new scheme would probably encourage some people to not take their full maternity allowance on a lower pay. He also said it will help his wife work full-time in two years time when Brooke is two-and-a-half and the scheme is introduced. He added: 'The extra money means the difference between going back part-time and going back full-time. 'It would take the pressure off for us.' As public sector workers, both Mr Stokes and his wife have had a pay freeze for the last two years which is to be extended for another two years. The couple have savings in ISAs with Chelsea Financial Services. 'To the working parents struggling with the costs of childcare and the mother wondering whether it makes financial sense to get a job, we offer this: tax free childcare,' Mr Osborne said. But others pointed out that those with children older than five,¬† or families with stay-at-home parents, usually mothers - will miss out, meaning 860,000 families with children will not benefit. Earlier this week a government briefing document, claiming that mothers who stayed at home did not need as much financial support as those who work, was published on the Treasury's website. The document, which was later removed, . fuelled claims that the new childcare scheme is discriminating against . the traditional family. To lift Britain out of the economic mire, the Chancellor's 2013 Budget unveiled measures aimed at restoring the ‚ÄòAspiration Nation‚Äô of the Tory 1980s. They included: . The most eye-catching measure was the ‚Äòhelp to buy‚Äô scheme for those struggling to find mortgage deposits. It will mean ¬£3.5billion becoming available for shared equity loans worth 20 per cent of the value of a new build house worth up to ¬£600,000. Other measures included a new flat-rate state pension worth ¬£144 a week and a ¬£72,000 cap on elderly care bills. Automatic pay rises for public sector workers paid simply for time served will be scrapped, with only the armed forces exempted. Public sector workers will also have to pay more in national insurance contributions. Simon Bower and his wife Caroline, from Sheffield, with their two children . Simon Bower believes he and his wife Caroline, a stay at home mother-of-two, have been penalised for having 'traditional Tory values'. They lost out on around ¬£2,000 a year in child benefit because Mr Bower's business was bringing him in over ¬£50,000 a year. Now they have now been left empty-handed, while parents who both go out to work are handed tax breaks worth up to ¬£1,200 a year towards the cost of their childcare. Mr Bower, 43, who owns a coffee roasters called Pollards in Sheffield, said: 'Last year we lost child benefit and we didn't mind as we believed we are all in this together. 'But now I'm on ¬£50,000 as the sole earner and my family get nothing back from the Government, unlike two people earning who would be thousands of pounds better off. Osborne said this is a . Budget for hard workers. But a stay at home mum, who I believe is doing the most important job, presumably is not classed as a hard worker. 'It would seem we are no longer in it together.' Mrs Bower, 39, gave up her job as an assistant head teacher to look after their two children, Emily, six, and two-year-old Naomi, full-time. Yesterday the Centre for Policy Studies, the think tank started by Iain Duncan Smith, criticised the Government for¬† undermining the traditional family by restricting help to dual income households. Spokesman Kathy Gyngell said: 'Introducing a transferable tax allowance would have gone some way to rectifying the state's punitive treatment of marriage and one-earner families. 'But channelling the hard earned taxes of one-earner families into nanny subsidies for the well-heeled, politicians and their working wives that represent the Coalition have made matters profoundly worse.' Dan Boucher, from the social charity CARE, said the Government's help to two-income families 'will simply exacerbate the unfairness already experienced by single-earner households within the tax system'. He added: 'For one-earner households earning just over the average wage it is even more¬† critical that the Government honours its commitment to¬† support them through transferable allowances, as promised in the Coalition Agreement.' Tory MP Nick de Bois said: 'I can see why families with one parent who stays at home doing a really important job would be disappointed, but I hope they will take some comfort from other measures in the Budget to help hard-working parents.' He added: 'I hope with the remaining two Budgets in this parliament we get to see a return to the tax system supporting transferable allowances between married couples.' Nick Pearce, director of the centre-right IPPR think tank said: 'The new tax relief scheme will also be broadly regressive, giving more to families on higher incomes than those lower down the income distribution. 'It will leave the distribution of government funding for childcare with a U-shape: households on low incomes will qualify for tax credits and the better-off will qualify for tax reliefs, with less going to families in the middle.' As part of the reforms, the¬† Government is phasing out the current childcare voucher scheme, which offers tax breaks for working parents to help with the costs of after-school care for the under-15s.","Families react to Budget plan for ¬£1,200 a year help with nursery fees .

And in a scandal which has been compared to that of Mid Staffordshire, recent data shows a total of 500 people may have needlessly died in the last four years. Yesterday, politicians reacted with fury at the payout, saying it was cheating taxpayers and ‚Äòrewarding failure‚Äô. Mr Halsall stepped down in February 2012 but still receives his salary of ¬£150,000 a year, which will only be cut off in October this year. It is understood the payments, which equate to ¬£225,000 overall, were viewed as a severance package. Local Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: ‚ÄòThe level of this package will shock people ‚Äì ¬£225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over.‚Äô After Mr Halsall stepped down, he agreed to go on ‚Äòsecondment‚Äô for 12 months. As part of the deal, he is also entitled to his existing benefits, his lease car and the costs of career management advice up to the value of ¬£5,000. He will also be paid during a six-month notice period. He was gagged from talking about¬† it and the trust has until now refused requests to reveal the scale of the payout. MPs suggested they chose to release the information on Budget day in an attempt to ‚Äòbury‚Äô the news. During Mr Halsall‚Äôs tenure at the trust, it was criticised on several occasions by watchdogs including the Care Quality Commission and the Commons health select committee. Police are investigating deaths at Furness General Hospital, in Barrow, one of its two main maternity units. A total of 30 families are reported to be taking legal action against the trust over mother and baby deaths and cases of cerebral palsy. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron said: 'The level of this package will shock people ¬£225,000 is too much for the failure that he presided over' Managers have been accused of covering up patient deaths as they chased the prize of foundation trust status. Morecambe Bay became a foundation trust in 2010 despite warnings from the regional director of the NHS regulator that patients‚Äô lives were in danger. In 2011 it had the highest mortality rate of any trust in England. A new report into the CQC‚Äôs regulation of the trust, due to be published this month, is expected to find that it had failed to take adequate action to protect patients. John Cowdall, chairman of the trust, said the arrangement with Mr Halsall ‚Äòavoided the potential for a long drawn out dispute that would have been expensive and time consuming‚Äô. The deal involved going on secondment to NHS Confederation as an associate director. The national body represents all those organisations which provide health services and speaks on their behalf. It is understood he took the role on condition that he would be paid his salary of ¬£150,000 a year by the trust up to October 5, 2013.","Tony Halsall left NHS post in disgrace last year .

"By . Arthur Martin . UPDATED: . 07:29 EST, 12 August 2011 . After days of being pelted with bricks and petrol bombs, this was payback time. Armed with crowbars and battering rams, officers from Scotland Yard carried out more than 100 dawn raids on riot suspects yesterday. Those suspected of turning parts of London into a ‚Äòwar zone‚Äô were woken up when¬† riot officers broke down their doors at¬† around 7am. Ram raid: This police officer takes a mighty swing at a suspect's door in Westminster, splintering it apart as officers go in . Police, open up: Officers rush through the doorway of the flat in Pimlico where looted goods were suspected of being held . He means business: A riot officer with steely stare carrying a battering ram strides down the street, and right, bashing down a suspect's front door . Huge numbers of stolen good were recovered ‚Äì it was as if the looters were getting a taste of their own medicine. About 100 suspects, looking timid and sheepish, offered little resistance as they were handcuffed and bundled into the back of police vans. Their meek expressions were in stark contrast to those of the snarling rioters, faces covered by hoodies and scarves, who set fire to homes and businesses across the capital this week. The Met, which was criticised for failing to be robust during the violence, said it wants to put ‚Äòfear‚Äô into the hearts of rioters. Nowhere to run: This suspect is led away in handcuffs from an address in Pimlico, south London . Firm grip: A youngster is dragged along by his shoulders by the two officers from the Westminster Burglary Squad . One senior officer said: ‚ÄòWe are going¬† to come and get them, every single one of them.‚Äô A total of 120 officers took part in the operation, the first raids against looters and troublemakers who brought terror to London. Among those arrested was a 16-year-old, an alleged member of the notorious GAS gang, who is suspected of violent disorder. He was dragged from his bed by officers in his home in Lambeth as part of Operation Withern. GAS, which stands for Guns and Shanks, has a violent reputation and its members¬† are alleged to have been behind the murder of 15-year-old Zac Olumegbon, a rival gang member who was killed outside his school in Norwood, South London, last year. Take him away: A suspected looter is paraded through the street and . bundled into a police van after his home in Brixton was raided . Led away: This suspect was escorted from a flat in Pimlico to a waiting police van . During yesterday‚Äôs co-ordinated raids, officers recovered a vast array of clothes and expensive electrical goods, including iPods and plasma TVs, which they believe were stolen during the disorder. Designer clothes worth thousands of pounds were recovered from one flat alone. A total of ¬£1,600 in cash and ¬£5,000 worth¬† of property was recovered during raids¬† in Pimlico. One 18-year-old man screamed at officers as he was bundled into a police van in handcuffs after more than ¬£1,000 worth of clothing was found in his flat. New Nike Air Jordan trainers, along with Hugo Boss jackets, jeans, belts and bags were taken away from his flat. Police believe the goods were stolen during the violence in Sloane Square ‚Äì home to the Peter Jones department store ‚Äì on Monday. Up to ¬£1million-worth of damage was caused in that area alone. Bounty: Police officers show off goods recovered from the raid, including a pair of Nike shoes and Hugo Boss clothing including jeans, shirts and a coat . Pricey: One of the items taken was this Hugo Boss t-shirt, while this bag by the label costs ¬£285 . Recovered: A police officer carries bags of goods down a stairwell on the Pimlico estate . Superintendent Nick Sedgemore, who led yesterday‚Äôs raids in¬† Lambeth, said the police were¬† fighting back. He said: ‚ÄòWe are going to come and get them, every single one of them, and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. ‚ÄòWe are not worrying about criminalising a section of society. We are not here to be liked, we are here to be respected. ‚ÄòWe have had enough. We are putting a bit of fear into it. We will be harsh but fair.‚Äô Senior officers say they will be targeting ‚Äòthousands‚Äô of people and more than 1,500 arrests ‚Äì 1,150 in London ‚Äì have been made since the unrest began on Saturday, with more than 371 charged. Police also revealed they have identified one of the two suspects who robbed Malaysian student Ashraf Rossli as he stood dazed and injured on the street. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Kavanagh, who has led the Met‚Äôs operation, said: ‚ÄòI have a message for him: ‚ÄúWe know who you are and we are coming for you‚Äù.‚Äô Mr Kavanagh said the Met would . maintain 16,000 police on the streets at least for the next few days . despite the ‚Äòhuge toll‚Äô on the force. ‚ÄòWe will keep the numbers¬† out there for as long as is necessary but we cannot keep it up forever,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI . was out on patrol last night and the community was overwhelmingly . supportive, people were tooting their horns and giving the¬† thumbs up. ‚ÄòThere was a sense that London is a different place and we have to build on that.‚Äô","Suspects' homes raided at 7am by officers from Scotland Yard .

Pig farmers say they are being forced out of business leaving British bacon under threat, it has emerged. One hundred pig producers say they could be forced to shut down their pig units by Christmas because they can't afford to feed their animals. The problem is poor crop growing weather around the world which is pushing up the cost of pig feed. Worry: Ten per cent of pig producers say they . could be forced to shut down their pig units by Christmas because they . can't afford to feed their animals . In a double whammy many small and medium sized producers are also being crippled as supermarkets continue to source cheaper pork from abroad. The problems mean 1.5million rashers of bacon a week and 2.3million sausages a week could disappear from supermarket shelves. Plus the cost British bacon, sausages and other pork products is expected to rise. Last month bacon was voted Britain's favourite food according to the top 100 Foods Index. Standards: Imported sausages and bacon are not . produced to the same welfare standards as in Britain . British pig farmers, who are recognised as world leaders in high welfare pig farming, are now urging shoppers to 'Buy British' in a bid to rectify the situation. Shoppers can look for the 'Red Tractor' logo found on British-produced products to make sure they are supporting the nation's farmers. Although . imported sausages and bacon will still be available these are not . produced to the same welfare standards as in Britain. National Pig Association general manager Dr Zoe Davies said: 'If supermarkets see a surge in demand . for British product, they may be persuaded to pay our farmers the few . extra pennies a kilo more they need to cover their soaring feed bills. 'So we are asking shoppers, who have . always been incredibly loyal in the past, to please be extra careful to . look for the British Red Tractor logo on bacon, sausages, and pork.' The cost of key ingredients used in pig . feed, like wheat and soya, has increased by more than 25 per cent in the . past few weeks. This is . due to massive droughts in the United States, South America and the . Black Sea Region which have severely affected crop yields. Rivalry between supermarkets means they are reluctant to pay farmers more to cover their extra costs of production. The problems follow protests by dairy farmers last month who were furious when middle-men tried to cut the price they pay for milk to 25p a litre. Favourite: 1.5million rashers of bacon a week and 2.3million sausages a week could disappear from supermarket shelves . Thousands blocked dairies and distribution centres in Somerset, Shropshire and Worcestershire to prevent deliveries to shops, claiming the price cut would put them out of business. The row was triggered when dairy firms Arla Foods, Dairy Crest and Robert Wiseman threatened a cut of up to 2p in wholesale prices on August 1, following a 2p cut in April, to compensate for falls in the price of cream on global markets. Farmers said the shortfall would force them out of business, as the selling price would be lower than the cost of producing a pint.","Ten per cent of British pig farmers could be out of business by Christmas .

Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller . has attacked Google's 'fragmented' Android software and its biggest . adopter, Samsung hours before the Korean firm unveils its . latest flagship smartphone. The marketing chief's rare attack on a . rival comes as Samsung prepares to launch the Galaxy S4 in New York tonight. The two firms are locked in a bitter battle for smartphone domination after Samsung overtook Apple in 2012 in overall sales. The tech giants are also facing off in courts around the world in a series of patent disputes. Phil Schiller, senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple. has attacked Google Inc's 'fragmented' Android software and its biggest adopter, Samsung Electronics . Samsung will take the wraps off its . Galaxy S4, after a broad marketing campaign that has helped drive . pre-launch speculation and hype to Apple-like proportions. The launch -- . the first time Samsung has chosen to host a global Galaxy debut in the . United States -- is deemed critical to propelling Samsung deeper into . Apple's home turf. Schiller's remarks also came a day . after Android architect Andy Rubin stepped down, after having built the free, . open-source software into the platform of choice for mobile phone . manufacturers around the world. Samsung had 30.3 percent of the . smartphone market in 2012, up from 19 percent a year earlier. Apple's . share was 19.1 percent last year, up from 18.8 percent in 2011. However, Schiller said he believes the iPhone offers a better experience. 'Android is often given as a free replacement for a feature phone and the experience isn't as good as an iPhone,' he told the Wall Street Journal. He said one of Androids biggest problems was the amount of time it takes to set up. 'When you take an Android device out of . the box, you have to sign up to nine accounts with different vendors to . get the experience iOS comes with,' he said. 'They don't work seamlessly . together.' Schiller . told Reuters that Google's own research showed the vast majority of . Android users were stuck on older versions of the software, and that . Samsung's new phone itself may debut with a year-old operating system . that will need updating. 'With their own data, only 16 percent of . Android users are on year-old version of the operating system,' he . said. 'Over 50 percent are still on software that is two-years-old. A . really big difference.' Schiller said fragmentation, or the host of customized versions of Android in the marketplace, poses a problem for consumers. Is his bark worse than his bite? Apple's Phil Schiller has launched an unprecedented attack of arch rivals Samsung, claiming its users are running out of date software . Every version of Android's operating . system update has to be tested to ensure a good fit for a multiplicity . of handset makers before it can be widely released by the handset . makers, which slows updates. That's because some manufacturers, such as . Amazon.com Inc, employ heavily customized versions. 'And that extends to the news we are . hearing this week that the Samsung Galaxy S4 is being rumored to ship . with an OS that is nearly a year old,' he said. 'Customers will have to . wait to get an update.' Schiller pointed to multiple research . from third parties that showed that people who have iOS devices actually . use them more than people who own Android devices, and more than half . of iOS users are using the latest version of the software. Apple remains the most valuable . technology company today, with a $137.1 billion cash pile, or the . equivalent of just under the gross domestic product of Hungary. But Samsung knocked Apple off its perch . atop the global smartphone arena in 2012, and continues to chip away at . its market share with a combination of aggressive marketing, rapid . technology adoption and boundary-pushing designs. That onslaught, coupled with growing . uncertainty about whether the U.S. giant can sustain growth in coming . years, has contributed to a 30 percent decline in Apple's stock since . its September peak. Samsung had 30.3 percent of the . smartphone market in 2012, up from 19 percent a year earlier. Apple's . share was 19.1 percent last year, up from 18.8 percent in 2011. That rapid ascendancy was made possible . partly by Android, the software Google Inc launched just a few years ago . but is now the world's most-used smartphone platform. IDC expects . shipments of Android tablets to exceed those of the iPad in 2013. Apple's iPhone 5 (left) is locked in battle with the Samsung Galaxy S3 (right) which is set to see a new version unveiled tonight . He also said that Apple's internal . research shows four times as many consumers are switching to iOS from . Android than the other way. 'At Apple we know that it's not just . enough to have products pumped out in large numbers,' he said. 'You have . to love and use them. 'There is a lot of data showing a big disparity . there.' Google declined to comment. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment.","Outburst comes as Samsung prepares to launch latest version of its Galaxy handset tonight .

A jury has recommended the death penalty for a self-styled street preacher convicted of killing three down-and-out men lured by bogus Craigslist job offers despite his mother's tearful plea for leniency. The same Ohio jury that first convicted Richard Beasley made its recommendation after hearing from his mother and other witnesses who testified of the 53-year-old having had a rough childhood that included physical and sexual abuse. Victims' relatives hugged as the jury's recommendation was announced with his sentencing set for Tuesday. Beasley hung his head without moving on Wednesday, and his mother sobbed. Mother's tears: Carol Beasley, left, visibly wept in court on Wednesday after the jury recommended the death penalty for her son, Richard Beasley, who remained seated with his head bowed . Emotional reaction: Family members of the victims, including Jack Kern, right, his wife, Ellen, center, and daughter, Barbara, left, listen as the jury recommended the death penalty . Hiding: Convicted killer Richard Beasley, 53, hid his head, left, while listening to a jury's recommendation for the death penalty read while the victims' families hugged behind him on Wednesday . Beasley was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to lure men with offers of farmhand jobs in southeast Ohio and to rob them. Three men were killed, and a fourth who was wounded testified at Beasley's trial. Jack Kern, whose 47-year-old son, Timothy Kern, was killed, alternately cried and smiled over the jury's recommendation. 'They made the right decision,' he said outside court. 'They knew what they had in their heart and what they had to do. They did it for us.' The jurors left without commenting. Beasley's co-defendant, who was 16 at the time of the crimes, was too young to face the death penalty. Brogan Rafferty was sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole on his conviction last year. Carried away: Defense attorney Lawrence J. Whitney, right, accompanied Beasley as he was wheeled away by a law enforcement officer following the jury's recommendation . Family's comfort: Jack Kern, right, embraces his daughter, Barbara, whose brother was one of three men lured by bogus Craigslist job offers to their death . Vindication: The son of Jack Kern, second from left, was one of the victims Beasley killed after he applied to one of his fake Craigslist ads . In closing arguments, both sides . highlighted Rafferty's life sentence in contrast to a possible death . sentence for Beasley. The defense said that issue should factor into the . jury's deliberations, but the prosecution said it wasn't an issue . because Rafferty's age, by law, had ruled out death as an option. The . jury received Beasley's case after hearing two hours of testimony from . witnesses, including Beasley's tearful mother, who were called to . portray him sympathetically and press for leniency. Carol . Beasley testified that her son had a troubled childhood and had . suffered physical abuse by his stepfather. She also said she learned . within the past year that her son had been sexually abused by . neighborhood youngsters. Victims: In addition to Ralph Geiger, David Pauley (left) was found buried in a shallow grave in 2011. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (right) Partner in crime: Beasley's co-defendant Brogan Rafferty, seen, who was 16 at the time of the crimes, was too young to face the death penalty for his part in the murders . 'I always felt there was much more than he told me,' she said. As she testified, Beasley slumped . forward, his chin on his chest and his right hand covering his eyes. He . uses a wheelchair because of back pain. The . defense also called a psychologist, John Fabian, who testified that . Beasley suffers from depression, alcohol abuse, low self-esteem and a . feeling of isolation, all possible results of a troubled, abusive . childhood. Prosecutor . Jonathan Baumoel had urged jurors to consider the 'enormous' weight of . Beasley's crimes as they considered his punishment. Mother's plea: Beasley's mother, Carol Beasley, seen during an earlier court hearing, made her final plea for her son on Wednesday while explaining him having been sexually and physically abused growing up . Plot: Beasley, seen during an earlier court appearance, was convicted of luring several men with offers of farmhand jobs in southeast Ohio and to rob them . One of Beasley's victims was killed near Akron, and the others were shot at a southeast Ohio farm during bogus job interviews. The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Kern, of Massillon. All were down-and-out men looking for a fresh start in life, the prosecution said repeatedly during the trial. The survivor, Scott Davis, now 49, testified that he heard the click of a gun as he walked in front of Beasley at the reputed job site. Davis, who was shot in an arm, knocked the weapon aside, fled into the woods and tipped police. Beasley, who returned to Ohio from Texas in 2004 after serving several years in prison on a burglary conviction, testified that he met with Davis and Davis had pulled a gun in retaliation for Beasley serving as a police informant in a motorcycle gang investigation.","Richard Beasley, 53, to be sentenced on Tuesday for the death of three men and attempted murder of a fourth .

Dr Daniela Kostadinova, head of the hospital where the victim was taken in critical condition, said on Wednesday morning, in the northern village of Sitovo, a 40-year-old unemployed man doused himself with petrol and tried to commit suicide. The doctor told Bulgarian National radio the man could no longer afford to even buy bread for his one child and that he 'could not stand it anymore.' Of the five other Bulgarian men who have set themselves on fire since February 19 for similar reasons, three of them have died and two remain in critical condition. Economic growth has slowed to 0.8 percent, while unemployment has jumped to 12 percent this year. Six years after joining the EU, Bulgaria remains its poorest member. Ordinary people find it hard to make ends meet, struggling to share their tiny salary for food, utility bills and other expenses. Many have accused public officials of corruption. The dire economic situation plus the country‚Äôs status within the European Union has led many to predict that many will head to the UK when travel restrictions end next year. Earlier this week, it was predicted that the number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants who will head here from next January will be 12,700.

A gang of robbers dubbed the ‚ÄòMillionaire Muggers‚Äô who stalked some of Britain‚Äôs richest people were starting jail sentences last night. Detectives believe the trio raked in at least ¬£2million in cash, designer watches and jewellery. They claimed at least 40 victims after researching their movements online. Among them were Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone, former newspaper chairman Lord Stevens and BAA boss Sir Nigel Rudd. Violent attack: F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone was left with a black eye after the thieves stole ¬£200,000 of valuables from his home . Guilty: (From left) Gulam Gani, Nicholas Lewis and Shaun Wallace were sentenced to 53 years between them at court today for their involvement in four audacious robberies . Mr Ecclestone, 82, was seriously . injured after he was mugged of jewellery worth ¬£200,000 in front of his . Brazilian girlfriend Fabiana Flosi in November 2010. He needed hospital . treatment after he was punched and kicked to the ground by the robbers, . who had waited outside his Knightsbridge home. Gulam Gani, 47, Nicholas Lewis, 34, . and Shaun Wallace, 30, were convicted of conspiracy to rob after a . three-week trial at Southwark Crown Court. Ringleader Gani, of White City, west . London, grinned as he was jailed for 18 years, father-of-three Lewis, of . Romford, Essex, was jailed for 20 years and Wallace, of west London, . received a 15-year term. Hard-hitting: Ecclestone's injured face became the centrepiece of an advert for luxury Swiss watch Hublot, which was taken from him during the mugging . They were not prosecuted for the attack on Mr Ecclestone because of a lack of evidence. They also escaped prosecution for . robbing Lord Stevens, former chairman of United Newspapers, by ambushing . him as he arrived at his Chelsea flat. The gang drove around London‚Äôs West . End, Chelsea and Belgravia in stolen high-end cars with false plates . looking for lone women and wealthy elderly people to rob. At one point they escaped from a car chase by ramming a stolen Mercedes through two police roadblocks. Famous targets: BAA chairman Sir Nigel Rudd, left, and his wife were confronted at knifepoint at their house, while Mr Ecclestone, right, was targeted at his Knightsbridge penthouse . Exclusive areas: Sir Nigel and his wife were followed from a restaurant to their ¬£7million home in Belgravia (stock image) while Mr Ecclestone was attacked at his Knightsbridge penthouse . They were finally tracked down after a . six-month multi-million pound surveillance operation, which collected . DNA evidence left at crimes and in vehicles. Exonerated: Jewellery store owner Radcliffe Benjemin was found innocent of any involvement with the gang . Sir Nigel Rudd, 63, was ambushed on his doorstep after being followed home from a luxury restaurant. He had a knife held to his stomach as his 64-year-old wife, Lesley, was forced to open a safe. The gang made off with jewellery worth ¬£84,000 and holiday luggage containing thousands of euros. Bankers Elizabeth Kaye, Jennifer Boschetto and Rosemary Foyle were targeted after they were followed home. Mrs Kaye, 46, was robbed of possessions worth ¬£50,000, including a ¬£25,000 diamond ring, after she was tailed from her office. Days later the gang attacked Mrs Boschetto, 59, after she took a taxi home from a Mayfair restaurant. Two men grabbed her from behind and ripped her wedding and engagement rings from her fingers. They also took her earrings, necklace, bracelet and handbag ‚Äì worth ¬£12,000. Her husband Ronald, 61, an investment . banker, said his wife, who is known by her middle name Linda, ‚Äòstill . bears the mental scars‚Äô from the attack. He added: ‚ÄòShe has undergone . hand reconstruction surgery and is set to have another operation. Linda . is now more wary when she goes out. ‚ÄòShe looks around her and she always . asks the taxi driver to wait until she is in the front door before they . drive off.‚Äô Mrs Foyle was followed home while driving her ‚Äòostentatious‚Äô Bentley from an Indian restaurant in Chelsea. Expensive taste: The gang have been dubbed the 'Rolex Robbers' after targeting wealthy home owners for their jewellery in the West End of London . She was robbed of valuables worth ¬£21,000 as she took plants from the boot of her car outside her home. Barbara Walker had a ¬£75,000 ring . torn from her finger while she was walking along in October last year. She managed to scratch the men and DNA taken from her nail clippings . identified one of the suspects. The jury heard that Gani and Lewis had previously been jailed for similar violent robberies.

A potential cause of miscarriages has been identified by scientists - a breakthrough that could lead to the development of new drugs that prevent them. Laboratory tests showed women who had lost three or more babies had high levels of a molecule known as IL-33 in their womb cells. In the future. medicine to target the protein could be given to pregnant women who are particularly vulnerable. Tests found that women who had suffered successive miscarriages had high levels of a certain molecule in their womb cells . The researchers said the molecule controls whether embryos are accepted by the womb. But women who had suffered multiple miscarriages continued to secrete it for an extra ten days, they found. The receptivity of the womb was not being controlled properly in these women, according to the findings published in the journal PLOS ONE. Dr Madhuri Salker, of Imperial College London, said: 'Our study suggests in women who have had successive miscarriages, the mechanisms that control whether the womb can accept and support an embryo don't work properly. 'This might mean they can become pregnant with poor quality embryos or the embryo implants in an unsupportive environment, which would seriously compromise the chances of a successful pregnancy.' Healthy embryo: A prolonged window of fertility increases the risk of abnormal embryos implanting . The study also looked at the effects of these molecular signals on fertility in mice. The researchers treated the uteruses of the mice with chemicals secreted by cells from the human womb lining. They found chemicals produced by cells from women with repeated miscarriages extended the time during which mice could become pregnant, but also made miscarriages more likely. The researchers conclude a prolonged window of fertility increases the risk of abnormal embryos implanting. In addition, it is associated with inflammation in the lining of the womb, which compromises the development of healthy embryos. Study co-author Professor Jan Brosens, of the University of Warwick, said: 'The molecular signals we identified are known to be involved in a range of diseases including Alzheimer's, asthma and heart disease. 'Our findings suggest targeting these molecules might also be a promising strategy for developing treatments that would prevent miscarriages in women who are especially vulnerable.' At the start of pregnancy, the fertilised embryo must embed itself in the lining of the womb which is only receptive for a few days in each menstrual cycle, ensuring they can only implant at the right stage of development. Currently, scientists know only a few details about the biological processes that control when an embryo can be implanted. Cells secrete IL-33 during the receptive phase which influences the activityof nearby cells. Normally, the effects are shortlived, which helps to ensure women can only conceive during a narrow window.","Tests showed women who had successive miscarriages had high levels of a molecule known as IL-33 .

The Russian owner of The Independent launched an attack on Government plans to restrict Press freedom, just days after his newspaper gave full support to the proposals. Alexander Lebedev, who also owns the London Evening Standard, said: ‚ÄòThe restrictions of the freedom of the press in Britain ‚Äì I would think that would be a very wrong decision. Absolutely. ‚ÄòThere are better ways to rectify the wrong things that have been done during the hacking affair.‚Äô Alexander Lebedev warned that press regulation would be a bad thing for the British media . Earlier this week, The Independent‚Äôs editor Chris Blackhurst was the only national newspaper editor to back the Royal Charter scheme for Press regulation. He said: ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt perfect but neither is it terrible. I don‚Äôt see anything in it that will threaten the sort of journalism we produce at The Independent.‚Äô But by Thursday the newspaper was expressing serious doubts, its leader column talking of ‚Äòpotentially critical flaws‚Äô in the proposals. The Independent editor Chris Blackhurst expressed support for the Royal Charter earlier this week . Meanwhile the veteran Labour-supporting magazine Tribune yesterday became the latest well-known periodical to reject the Charter, saying ‚Äòwe will not be signing up to any new procedure for imposing state licensing of¬† the Press‚Äô. Education Secretary Michael Gove also joined the chorus of criticism, saying the clampdown on the Press in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal is having a ‚Äòchilling effect‚Äô on free speech. In a sign of growing Tory unease, Mr Gove also said he was ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô about the controversial deal stitched up by the three main party leaders last Sunday to introduce a new Press regulator. And he warned that the arrests of dozens of journalists, public officials and whistleblowers posed a serious potential threat to free speech. His intervention came as pressure group Hacked Off announced an embarrassing climbdown over aspects of the Government‚Äôs Royal Charter on Press regulation, which it helped draw up. The group, whose directors include the actor Hugh Grant, called for changes to remove a ‚Äòglitch‚Äô in the proposals that would leave thousands of internet bloggers facing the threat of ruinous damages. It came just days after prominent Hacked Off supporter Max Mosley said the Government should be able to ‚Äòcut off the wires‚Äô of Internet publications that erred. Speaking to BBC‚Äôs Question Time, Mr Gove, a former senior journalist at the Times, contrasted the clampdown on the Press with the lack of arrests in the wake of other scandals, such as the banking collapse or the deaths of up to 1,200 patients at Mid Staffordshire Hospital. Hacked Off, led by Hugh Grant (pictured) have called for a change in the charter to exclude small bloggers . Kate and Gerry McCann have also been prominent campaigners for restrictions on the press . He said David Cameron had secured the ‚Äòbest deal available‚Äô, given Labour and the Liberal Democrats had ganged up to back new Press laws. But he indicated he remained deeply uneasy about the threat to free speech. He said: ‚ÄòThe free Press is one of the historic strengths of this country. Sometimes it is raucous and, as a politician, you can sometimes be on the receiving end ‚Äì so you should. ‚ÄòA free Press should hold people to account. That is why I am uncomfortable about politicians themselves deciding how the Press should be regulated. My view is a minority in the Commons.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòWe have had scores of journalists arrested ‚Äì I suspect some will face their day in court. The Independent expressed support for the royal charter when most national newspapers didn't . ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how many people responsible for some of the banking scandals which cause so much misery to so many have been arrested. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve seen no arrests when there have been other scandals from Mid Staffs and elsewhere where people have suffered. ‚ÄòWe are in danger ‚Äì with a newspaper industry which is suffering commercially ‚Äì of driving to the margins the organs of free speech. ‚ÄòFrankly it is more important that politicians fear proper scrutiny than that the Press fear politicians scrutinising them.‚Äô Nick Clegg yesterday appealed to the newspaper industry not to boycott the scheme, adding: ‚ÄòI hope when tempers cool a bit and the dust settles, people will see it‚Äôs the middle way.‚Äô Thousands of internet bloggers have come together under the umbrella campaign Blog Off, calling for small publications to be excluded from the proposals. It even has the backing of Labour‚Äôs deputy chairman Tom Watson, who has led the campaign for Press regulation. Tory peer Lord Lucas last night tabled an amendment to the Crime and Courts Bill which would remove individual Internet bloggers and most small publishers from the provisions of the Royal Charter. The Government has not yet indicated whether it will support the change. Meanwhile former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown will today accuse Mr Cameron of making a colossal ‚Äòstrategic blunder‚Äô in pulling out of talks on the creation of a new Press regulator.","Alexander Lebedev said that a Royal Charter would be the 'wrong decision'

Almost 600 cyclists were knocked off their bikes trying to swerve around a car door in 2011, up from around 400 in 2009. Safety campaigners called for better education for drivers to look in their mirrors before stepping out into the road. The number of cyclists injured by open car doors has soared by 25 per cent in two years . Transport minister Stephen Hammond told MailOnline motorists had to ‚Äòtake care‚Äô when opening their door to make sure cyclists are not trying to overtake them. In 2011, a total of 595 cyclists were injured on Britain‚Äôs roads after either hitting or trying to swerve around an open door. Of the total, one cyclist died while 92 suffered ‚Äòserious injuries‚Äô. Just two years earlier, 55 suffered serious injuries while 413 received injures described as ‚Äòslight‚Äô. No-one was killed. Details of the numbers of cyclists injured, by severity, in reported personal injury road accidents in Great Britain, as a result of hitting an open door of a vehicle, or as a result of a vehicle door being opened or closed negligently were released in Parliament. In 2011, a total of 595 cyclists were injured on Britain¬øs roads after either hitting or trying to swerve around an open door, of which one cyclist died while 92 suffered 'serious injuries' Labour MP Barry Sheerman, chairman of Parliamentary Advisory Council on Transport Safety (PACTS) who obtained the figures, said drivers had to get used to an explosion in the popularity of cycling. He said: ‚ÄòCycling is very popular. It has come back again. All over the world, and certainly western Europe, it is fashionable again to cycle. Labour MP Barry Sheerman said drivers should have more training to spot cyclists in their mirrors . ‚ÄòIt is true there are more cyclists but there are people who are not trained enough to look in their mirrors. ‚ÄòIt is an education challenge, we have got to raise awareness. It is much more likely that there is a quiet cyclist coming past you.‚Äô PACTS is to launch a transport safety commission which will take evidence on how to reduce cut injuries and deaths on Britain‚Äôs roads. Mr Sheerman added: ‚ÄòThere are worries about these figures. The number of serious injuries is up to more than 90 - a serious injury means you never walk without pain again.‚Äô The number of people cycling to work is up 17 per cent, a report said last week. The popularity of commuting by bike has increased by 760,000 in England and Wales in the past ten years, a detailed analysis by Halfords of the latest census statistics revealed. It reflects the huge interest in cycling promoted by the likes of Tour de France winner and Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins and fellow racers such as golden girls Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott. Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‚ÄòCycling is good for your health and helps to reduce congestion so it‚Äôs great that more people are travelling on two wheels.¬† It is vital that drivers take care to look out for cyclists, whether they are in a parking space or on the move, as well as leaving them plenty of room on the road. ‚ÄòThe Government is investing an extra ¬£107 million in cycling infrastructure, including ¬£35 million to tackle dangerous junctions. ‚ÄòWe also launched our THINK!

Hundreds of flowers drift silently across the surface of the sea, but these aren't your average petals they in fact elaborate ice formations in the Arctic Circle. The beautiful selection of snaps were shot last year by University of Washington graduate student Jeff Bowman and his professor Jody Deming as the pair worked on a project combining oceanography, microbiology, and planetary sciences in the central Arctic Ocean. The pair focused their study on the awe-inspiring frost flowers, a strange phenomenon where frost grows from imperfections in the surface ice amid extreme sub-zero temperatures. Beautiful: Hundreds of frost flowers in the central Arctic Ocean . Other-worldly: The photographs of ice were taken last year by University of Washington graduate student Jeff Bowman and his professor Jody Deming while they worked on a study combining oceanography, microbiology, and planetary sciences . Breathtaking: Frost flowers are a strange phenomenon where frost grows from imperfections in the surface ice amid extreme sub-zero temperatures nearing -22C or -7.6F, forming spiky structures that have been found to house microorganisms . Science: The pair were in the central Arctic Ocean examining frost flowers as part of the Integrated Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program . Freezing conditions: Jeff Bowman braves icy temperatures in the Arctic sea to carry out experiments on frost flowers and ice cores . Cold: Graduate student Jeff Bowman handles a perfectly formed block of ice . The flowers typically form in temperatures nearing -22C or -7.6F and their spiky structures have been known to house micro-organisms. Similar to a coral reef, each flower is in essence a temporary ecosystem, with the bacteria found much more dense than in the frozen water below it. The pair's research was part of the Integrated Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) program. The research offers clues as to the limits of life in extreme temperatures which will be useful when we search on other ice-covered planets and moons for possible extraterrestrial life. The flowers were found to produce chemicals such as formaldehyde which could give clues about the origin of life on Earth. Although frost flower blooms are frequently observed in both polar oceans, little is understood about the physical, chemical and biological nature of the structures. To investigate their microbiology Bowman and Deming learned to grow frost flowers in a freezer lab at the University of Washington before moving their study into the field, collecting frost flowers during several challenging expeditions. Bowman and Deming are building a special chamber to grow frost flowers under ultra-clean conditions. Digging deep: The scientists had to clear inches of snow to reach the sheets of ice to take samples . Tough terrain: The team used specialist vehicles to safely negotiate across the ice and snow .

Jack Johnstone suffers from a severe form of Cystic Fibrosis (CF), which has recently led him to be hospitalised once a month, due to life-threatening infections caused by a build up of mucus on his chest . But thanks to the donation of a ¬£3,000 bed by manufacturers six-year-old Jack's condition is better than ever . Jack's parents Tina and Kevin, 33, from Preston, Lancashire, were told that their son's chest had 'significantly deteriorated' due to the number of infections he'd had . His lung capacity only reached a maximum of 59 per cent, leaving him breathless and at risk of lethal infections. But thanks to the donation of the ¬£3,000 bed, Jack's condition is better than ever. In just one month of sleeping in the bed, his lung capacity has already increased by eight per cent. It works by vibrating at different levels on different areas of Jack's back to loosen the sticky fluid and cause him to cough it up, in turn saving his life. Mrs Johnstone, 38, said: 'Jack has never coughed up any mucus in the whole of his life. 'But since he has had the bed, he's started clearing it from his chest. It's amazing, it's actually saving his life.' The youngster is forced to spend two weeks in hospital every three months to provide him with life-saving treatment, and his condition is reviewed on each visit to hospital, with his medication altered to ensure he is able to have the best quality of life possible. The little boy is a keen fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis trust and had been trying to raise enough money to buy the bed himself. Doctors told the couple that Jack's quality of life and life expectancy had been reduced . But, after hearing of his condition through his fundraising efforts, manufacturers Niagara donated one of their beds for free. Mrs Johnstone, a care home manager, said: 'We were trying to raise the money to buy one of the beds for Jack, so it was amazing when they said they wanted to give us one. 'They were touched by Jack after seeing his story. It's wonderful.' The bed uses Cyclo-Therapy as a form of massage therapy to help people with breathing problems. It uses a 3-way vibration that rotates and gently pulsates out from the centre in a whirlpool motion. Manufacturers say for respiratory problems such as Cystic Fibrosis, these gentle vibrations help to mobilise any mucus, giving CF sufferers a better chance of expelling it from the lungs and helping with chest clearance. Jack has created a number of videos where he talks about his treatment and how he is feeling, to help other children in his position. As a keen fundraiser, he has already stumped up ¬£4,000 with the help of his family to support the Cystic Fibrosis trust. His mother said: 'It's so refreshing to see someone so young who is so poorly, wanting to help others. 'We help him as much as we can, but it's Jack who is the driving force behind raising money and awareness. 'He just wants to help other children by telling them what he has been through and showing them how much they have to live for. 'It's been a difficult few years for us all.'

'He demonstrated the shake and it was violent,' said officials, who added that Fox said he had been heavily drinking before shaking his infant son to death.

An autopsy was inconclusive and Fox was never charged with any crime - despite the strong suspicion of the Washington County Coroner. Indeed, after the death of his latest son, the coroner remembered Fox and contacted police. In addition, the Foxes pastor, Tim Estes admitted to¬†40/29 News in Arkansas that after the memorial service for the couple's first child, he felt uneasy about the circumstances. 'I have to tell you some alarm bells went off in my mind when the first baby was brought in. Something felt uneasy in my spirit,' said Estes.

Estes told 40/29 that Fox had been known to suffer from drug and anger issues and he had tried to help him as a youth. Neighbors also said that they sometimes heard the Foxes argue. Angela Robison who lived in the same Olivewood Apartments as the Foxes said she would hear him argue with his wife Tiffany - who is currently pregnant with twins.

Incredibly, having escaped punishment for the murder of his first son, Fox and Tiffany had an falling out around a year-ago and he begged his wife to let him come home.

"By . Jill Reilly . UPDATED: . 05:47 EST, 23 December 2011 . Bradley Manning did no harm to the U.S. military and should have the most serious charges against him dropped, his lawyer argued as he closed the case for the soldier‚Äôs defence. Manning's lawyer David Coombs accused prosecutors of overreaching in bringing 22 criminal charges against the 24-year-old. Private Manning is accused of downloading more than 700,000 classified or confidential files from the military's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, while serving in Iraq. No harm: Bradley Manning did no harm to the U.S. military and should have the most serious charges against him dropped, his lawyer argued as he closed the case for the soldier's defence . Leaving court: Aiding the enemy is an offence that could bring the death penalty but the prosecution has said it intends to seek life in prison for Manning . The lawyers made closing arguments at a hearing to determine whether intelligence analyst Manning should be court-martialed on charges including aiding the enemy. Coombs said the release of documents had caused no harm to national security and the government was trying ‚Äòto strong-arm a plea from my client.‚Äô ‚ÄòThe sky is not falling, the sky has not fallen and the sky will not fall‚Äô as a result of the document release, Coombs said before the case was adjourned yesterday. The courtroom at Fort Meade, northeast of Washington, was packed on Thursday for the closing arguments. Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, . attended, as did Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers about . the Vietnam War in the 1970s. Evidence: Bradley Manning, second from left, and his attorney, David Coombs, far left, listen as a member of the prosecution, Capt. Ashden Fein, centre, presents his closing arguments . Presiding officer Lt. Col. Paul Almanza now has until January 16 to recommend whether Manning should stand trial for aiding the enemy and 21 other charges. Aiding the enemy is an offence that could bring the death penalty but the prosecution has said it intends to seek life in prison for Manning. In response Manning‚Äôs lawyer asked the court to throw out charges of aiding the enemy and giving intelligence to the enemy, saying the intended audience for the information was the American people. Coombs said the prosecution needed a ‚Äòreality check‚Äô and focused his closing remarks on urging them to seek no more than 30 years in prison. Defence: Manning's lawyer David Coombs, pictured leaving court, said the prosecution needed a 'reality check' and focused his closing remarks on urging them to seek no more than 30 years in prison . Captain Ashden Fein, the lead prosecutor, argued that the document release had helped al Qaeda, and showed a video in which a recruiter for the militant group referred to Wikileaks and urged followers to ‚Äòtake advantage of the wide range of resources available today on the internet.‚Äô The prosecution has portrayed Manning as a trained and trusted analyst who knowingly committed criminal acts when he allegedly passed the documents to WikiLeaks. They have sought to link Manning to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, introducing logs of web chats that an investigator said appeared to show conversations in which the two discuss sending government documents. Lead prosecutor Fein said Manning ‚Äògave the enemies of the United States . unfettered access to these documents‚Äô and used a PowerPoint . presentation to underscore the training Manning had received on the . importance of protecting classified information. Packed court room: Assange's lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, attended the closing arguments as . did Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam . War in the 1970s . He said Manning even cautioned his colleagues in a briefing he conducted in 2008 about the common way in which leaks occur, including through the internet or journalists. Manning's lawyers have portrayed him as an emotionally troubled young man whose behavioral problems should have prompted his superiors to revoke his access to classified information. Witnesses said Manning sent an email to his sergeant expressing concern that confusion over his gender identity was seriously hurting his life, work and ability to think. According to testimony at the hearing, Manning had created a female alter-ego online, Breanna Manning. Coombs underscored Manning's emotional instability, saying he mainly ‚Äòstruggled in isolation‚Äô but showed warning signs that should have prompted the unit's leaders to take action. He went over excerpts of Manning's email to his sergeant discussing his gender identity issues. 'This is my problem. I've had signs of it for a long time. I thought a career in the military would get rid of it ... It is not going away ... and now the consequences of it are dire,' the email said. 'At this point it feels like I'm not really a person ... sorry.' Coombs also cited memos between Manning's supervisors discussing his increasing instability and the need for therapy. But in the end there was no effective action. 'It was the military's lack of response to that which also smacks in the face of justice,' Coombs said.","Defence argued prosecutors were overreaching in bringing 22 criminal charges against Manning .

A girl who was left scarred by a violent random attack on a night out could become the next Miss England after her boyfriend convinced her to enter a beauty pageant. Alexandra Homayoonpoor, 24, had her nose sliced almost in two in an unprovoked in Leeds on New Years' Eve. Despite initially feeling 'so ugly' she had to hide from her friends, she is now on course to become the next Miss England after being crowned Miss West Yorkshire. 'I was convinced to enter a beauty pageant after my the glassing left me with a scarred nose and I felt unattractive. It was to try and boost my confidence,' said Alexandra, who is known as Lexi. 'Even after surgery I have been left with a little notch on my nose, but I have come to live with it.' Bouncing back: Alexandra Homayoonpoor has made a remarkable recovery and has just been crowned Miss West Yorkshire, boosting her bid to become the next Miss England . Lexi, who works for a PR company in Otley, West Yorks says: 'The doctors have offered me reconstructive surgery, but I have declined because I am happy the way I am now.' Her nostril had to be surgically reattached after a group of men attacked her and her boyfriend in a bar on New Year's Eve. Lexi was glassed in the face on New Year's Eve 2010 in The Box pub, Headingley, Leeds, when a thug struck her with a broken glass. Scarred: Lexi suffered terrible injuries during a night out in 2010 . The then 21-year-old was left with a 4cm laceration to her nose and a nose stud she had been wearing was left embedded in the wound along with a piece of glass - which was stuck so deep it could only be detected by X-ray. Plastic surgeons worked for an hour to save her nose, reattaching her nostril with 12 stitches at Leeds General Infirmary. Lexi - who had never previously thought of being a beauty queen or modeling - felt too deformed to even see her closest friends for three months after her injury. But her then boyfriend Ben Johnson, 25, convinced her to pluck up courage and enter the local beauty pageant. 'I didn't win first time, but I really enjoyed the contest and I felt more glamorous. 'I'm too short to be a model - I'm 5' 5"" and you need to be at least 5' 7"" - but getting this far is a real honour.' Recalling the night of the attack, . Lexi, whose father is Iranian, said: 'This idiot in the pub swiped his . arm across a table of bottles and glasses and I was hit in the face. 'It . felt like I had been punched in the face. My arm was covered in cuts . from the glass and the next thing I knew my face was streaming with . blood. 'It was everywhere, and I was hysterical, screaming ""He's broken my nose, he's broken my nose! 'I . couldn't understand why there was so much blood. I knew I hadn't been . punched but there was so much blood, it was just gushing from my face. I . was covered in it. 'No one would tell me what had happened. People just kept saying, ""Don't worry, it'll heal, it'll heal"". 'It . was only after the paramedics took me to A&E that my dad came and . told me that my nose had been sliced open on one side, from the front . right the way to the back. Lexi says she turned to the beauty queen circuit in a bid to boost her self confidence after the attack . Alexandra Homayoonpoor's case is still open as the attackers who glassed her have still not been caught . 'They couldn't operate on me that night and I had to go back the next day to have an operation under general anaesthetic. 'They X-rayed me and said that there was a piece of glass still stuck in there, which they would have to remove and they had to cut out my nose stud which had become caught up in the flesh. 'No one knows exactly what happened, but the doctors said that because of the way it was cut a glass probably hit me straight in the face and smashed on impact."" Footage from CCTV cameras at the club where the incident happened was not clear enough to identify Alexandra's attackers, who were kicked out by management immediately afterwards. No one took their details and the police had no evidence to go on, meaning her case remains open. Alexandra said: 'I had always dreamed of entering the competition because I am basically just a little girl deep down who loves dressing up and feeling like a princess. 'Winning Miss West Yorkshire has not really sunk in yet. It was amazing, I was overwhelmed.' Lexi needed 12 stitches to repair the damage and to remove a shard of glass. The eventual winner of Miss England goes through to the Miss World competition, which has a cash prize of ¬£100,000.","Alexandra Homayoonpoor, 24, had her nostril sliced in two .

The police aren't renowned for their sense of humour, but someone at Surrey Police clearly had an attack of the funnies this morning when they took to Twitter. In an effort to warn motorists of the icy conditions, a flurry of tweets from the station's official Twitter feed, were sent out in the style of rap star Vanilla Ice's 1990 hit 'Ice Ice Baby'. The first tweet, sent out around 7am this morning read: 'Ice Ice Surrey. Alright stop, collaborate and listen, Ice is back and these roads are glistening.' The police giving a rap on Twitter, not the knuckles: Surrey Police shows it hasn't lost its cool by rapping about road safety . Ice cool: Vanilla Ice displays awards he won at American Music Awards in Los Angeles in 1991 . Shortly followed by: 'Slowly, cuz the streets are freezin', Don't forget to clear off the windscreen.' And finally: 'If ice is a problem, yo, you can solve it, check out this link while my DJ revolves it.' The link referred to in the final tweet sent readers through to a Surrey Police Road Safety website, offering advice on driving in wintery conditions. The image on the website is of a mangled car, leading some on Twitter to take offence at the police's lighthearted approach to a serious matter. Surrey Police defended its decision to treat a serious matter with a touch of humour. A police spokesman said: 'The #IceIceSurrey tweets were a light-hearted way of getting across a serious message about road safety during the cold weather this morning and we hope it raised a smile amongst our followers. 'We've had more than 2,000 re-tweets so far and if it gets more people thinking about how they drive in icy conditions then that's a great result.' Certain followers of the police's twitter feed weren't convinced however. Matt Baxter-Reynolds tweeted: 'mixed feelings about the use of Surrey Police's official twitter feed. Engagement: good. Appropriateness: ummm' Others criticised Surrey Police for being out of touch in the choosing of a song that is 22 years out of date. Not so funny: The link following the rap-style weather warnings led readers to this page on road safety. Some Twitter users felt the picture of the mangled wreck sat awkwardly alongside the jokey police tweets . #Unsure: Matt Baxter-Reynolds expressed uncertainty about the Surrey Police's use of humour when advising drivers how to stay safe on the roads . One said: 'This was a hit 22 years ago, so why the police think it's . relevant to Twitter users today shows they are a bit out of touch'. The general consensus on Twitter, however, was positive, with tweets congratulating Surrey Police on its novel approach to policing. One user referred to the use of police humour to broadcast a serious message as 'genius', while another said it 'casts the police in a new light'. #youfunnylot: Three of many tweets congratulating Surrey Police on their use of humour to broadcast their road safety message . Sadly, not all of the country's police forces are so tolerant of their officers showing their funny side on Twitter. Popular police officer PC . Andy Hall, 38, from Greater Manchester Police, was stopped . from using his force's social networking account this week after being accused of . posting too many humourous and bizarre comments. After being given responsibilty to write his messages on the social . networking site, dubbed 'Tweets from the Beat', to encourage more locals . to report crime, his bosses intervened when he started to stray beyond the realms of policing. Among his random postings were song lyrics, commentary on the X Factor and gags about former pop stars. The officer also used the account to highlight the inflated price of confectionery alongside the hashtag ¬£crimeupdate, including posts saying 'Cadburys Starbar 78p!!? Maltesers 80p!!!'PC Hall would give regular weather reports and . affectionately referred to his beat of Radcliffe, near Bury, Greater . Manchester, as 'Radders' Community outreach: PC Hall's tweets often featured song recommendations and weather updates . Despite followers referring to him as 'a legend' and his random tweets as 'brilliant', he was relieved of the duty when he inadvertently posted a lighthearted tweet just hours after a . fatal police pursuit in Radcliffe. Jack Christian, 22, and Lee Perris, . 23, died after their Volkswagen Polo crashed as they were fleeing a . police patrol on Sunday morning. Later that day, the message 'I will . find. I will hunt you down' was posted on the GMP Radcliffe account. The message, however, was in response to another Twitter user and unrelated to the . tragedy. Senior officers are thought to have spoken to PC Hall and he agreed to hand over his tweeting duties to colleague.","Surrey Police imitated rap star Vanilla Ice to deliver a series of tweets .

One of the four boys who have not been identified accused of gang raping a 14-year-old girl walks away from Rockland Family Court with his parents with a jacket over his head . In late August, the 15-year-old . girl gave evidence from another room in the family court because . prosecution psychologists had deemed it damaging for her to see the four . defendants who are currently free under house supervision.

She said that the 12-year-old boy specifically attempted to sexually assault her and that she bit him. 'I bit him very hard and he started bleeding,' said the girl to the court in her testimony in late August. The 13-year-old said that, on June 12, she heard the older girl screaming as the four boys attacked her during the morning. She . told the court that she and another girl who was also in the house but . not apparently attacked tried to break into the parent's bedroom by . ramming in the doors and picking the locks with a kitchen knife. She . added the boys were leaning against the doors on the other side, where . the older girl has testified the boys held her down and took turns . sodomising her. 'I heard her screaming, ‚ÄòStop, get off of me!‚Äô the younger girl testified in late August . 'I banged on the door. I tried even harder to push open the door.' Ramapo is on the border of New Jersey and New York state and is where the boys all lived and attended school .

Diana Dors' youngest son has revealed how he took drugs at the age five and glimpsed orgies by the age of 11 thanks to the party lifestyle of his world famous mother. Jason Dors-Lake, now 43, has written a tell-all book with Niema Ash where he reveals what it's like to grow up the child of a Hollywood legend. After two failed marriages, Diana had Jason with the love of her life, actor Alan Lake, who she met in her late thirties. Proud mother: Jason as a baby with Diana Dors . Family complete: Diana and Alan Lake at Jason's christening . Welcome to the world: Diana cuts the cake as friends and family gather at Jason's christening . She already had two sons from her second marriage, who lived with their father Richard Dawson, and a reputation for being an insatiable party animal. The sexual orgies she witnessed with her first husband Dennis Hamilton had become legendary. As Niema writes in Connecting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors: 'Dennis was a renowned host and . some of his parties were infamous, rivalling those of the later-day . notorious madam, Cynthia Payne.' She describes how at Dennis' parties, 'the guests, mostly male, were ushered into a dimly lit room. Wild times: The actress with her first husband Dennis Hamilton whose sex parties became infamous . Love of her life: Diana and Alan, her third husband, on their wedding day . 'Alcohol, erotic stimulants, willing starlets and exotic dancers . contributed to a sexually charged atmosphere. The music throbbed, the . dancing bordered on foreplay and inhibitions were suspended. 'As intimacy . developed into arousal, each couple was led to a special room and . allocated fifteen minutes, unaware that the room was fitted with two-way . mirrors and their performance was a source of entertainment for select . guests.' She said Diana found this 'lots of fun' and when she later married Alan, whose work included porn films, she didn't want this fun to stop. Niema writes that even the arrival of Jason, who she doted on, didn't sway her. 'Now with a new baby, unlimited motherhood had a second chance. But Diana was reluctant to renounce the parties, the clubs, the fun. She wanted to keep the good times rolling, especially as she could now share them with Alan,' she writes. Hollywood legends: Diana pictured with Doris Day . Beach babe: Diana as a teenager when her natural beauty began to be noticed by acting scouts . Beauty queen: The book describes how the 'seemingly unexceptional' girl from Swindon became a star . As a result, Diana and Alan's mansion, Orchard Manor in Sunningdale, Berkshire, became a regular haunt for wild parties. 'The parties resumed their ‚Äòtalk-of-the-town‚Äô reputation from the Dennis days, but featured a quality of risqu√©ness which left Dennis‚Äôs two-way mirrors back in the dark ages,' Niema writes. Elaborating on this point in an interview with MailOnline, Niema said the two-way mirrors had become a thing of the past thanks to new technology. She said: 'Jason recalls sex parties at the house where couples were invited to use the guest bedrooms where a camera was set up inside. A live feed then linked to a giant TV screen in the living room downstairs.' Niema said Jason remembers being as young as 11 when he first glimpsed such sexual liaisons taking place in his home. His introduction to drugs was even younger. 'At the tender age of five, Jason‚Äôs nursery education was supplemented by an introduction to the joys of recreational drugs,' Niema writes. Apple of her eye: Jason as a boy with his mother who continued her showbiz lifestyle after he was born . In the book she recounts an experience Jason shared when he was awoken from his bed as a five year old to hear a party taking place. He stumbled into a room to find his father's friends passing around what looked like 'a giant white jelly bean' that they cracked open to inhale a white smoke. The youngster insisted on trying the 'candy'. After initial reservations, the party decided to let Jason sniff it 'for fun' as long as he promised not to tell his mother. Today, he has no idea what he took but recalls 'laughing until his tummy ached' after inhaling it. The book goes on to relate how Jason then became accustomed to cannabis by the age of 11 as his alcoholic father, who Niema said seemed to see Jason more 'as his buddy than his son', decided it was 'better he does it among friends than strangers'. Day job: Diana pictured in the 1956 film Yield to the night . Blonde bombshell: The actress was often dubbed Britain's Marilyn Monroe . Despite his unusual upbringing, Jason said he has happy childhood memories of his time at Orchard Manor and he never doubted the love his doting mother and father. Niema said he was the 'apple of their eyes' and their love and admiration for him was 'overflowing'. Jason today: He keeps his mother's memory alive by selling memorabilia . But after growing up believing hosting sex and drug-fuelled parties was 'normal' behaviour for a family, it is perhaps no surprise he became an alcoholic and drug addict by this twenties. His acceleration off the rails came with the tragic loss of his parents when he was just 14 - Diana died of ovarian cancer when she was 53 and a heartbroken Alan shot himself five months later. Orphaned Jason went to live in the U.S. with his half brothers and the party lifestyle he had become accustomed to continued. He had a daughter when he was 22 and attempted suicide during one drug-induced episode. However, Niema said Jason now has his life back on track. Living in Kent, he has reestablished his relationship with his daughter and attends AA meetings. He also runs a small business selling Diana Dors merchandise to his mother's still numerous fans. The book on his mother, published by Purple Inc Press, describes how the 'seemingly unexceptional eight year old girl' from Swindon 'with unexceptional parents' became the 'UK's most famous film star, and, indeed, a living legend'. Her beauty and sex appeal were evident since she starred in her first beauty pageant and by the time she was a teenager, she was in demand as an actress. In the book, Jason shares many never before seen pictures of his parents, some of which you can view here.

The elderly should be encouraged to sacrifice part of their pension lump sum or to downsize their home to pay for their care, two Liberal Democrat ministers said yesterday. Norman Lamb, the Care and Support Minister, said people could enter into deals under which they receive a smaller payout on retirement. The rest would go towards an insurance scheme to cover their needs in old age, such as care home fees and home help costs. 'Sensitive territory': Lib Dem ministers put forward the suggestions as a means of helping to fund the cost of care homes and home help (FILE PHOTO) Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, suggested that the elderly could free up cash by moving into smaller homes. The comments, made to a Lords select committee inquiry into the effect of demographic change on public services, are¬† likely to infuriate pensioners‚Äô groups who say it is unfair that those who have paid taxes all their lives should not be guaranteed a decent income in old age. They come amid continued confusion over the future of elderly care funding. Ministers have accepted the principle of a cap on the amount someone would be expected to pay, as recommended by economist Andrew Dilnot. But they are yet to say the level at which the ceiling will be set. Mr Dilnot suggested a figure of around ¬£35,000. There are rumours the Government may set a figure of ¬£75,000. Mr Lamb told the committee that during talks with Mr Dilnot he had been told that the presence of a cap would give financial services companies the certainty to come forward with insurance products to reduce the cost still further. These could also fund ‚Äòtop-up‚Äô care, where people would be able to live in better quality care homes than their council will fund. Of his proposal, Mr Webb said: ‚ÄòI certainly think there is a lot more could be done on trading down, although this is incredibly sensitive territory.‚Äô Mr Webb told the committee that, with life expectancy rates rising, the era of people retiring in their late 50s was over. Confusion: Pensioners' groups say people who have paid taxes all their lives should be guaranteed a decent income in their old age . Last night Ros Altmann, director general of over-50s group Saga, said: ‚ÄòFor a lot of people, their home is not just an asset ‚Äìit is part of the family. And t hey want to pass it on to their children. For these people, trading down is not an option.‚Äô Iain Duncan Smith plans to slash winter fuel payments to pensioners living abroad. The Work and Pensions Secretary is considering imposing a ‚Äòtemperature test‚Äô that would see expatriate pensioners in countries with warmer average winter temperatures lose part ‚Äì or all ‚Äì of the cash. Last year, the taxpayer funded payments of ¬£12.8million to 74,685 expats in countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain. Figures obtained by the Daily Mail show that the cost has risen 13-fold in the past decade. The money has to be paid because EU directives say national governments must do nothing to stop freedom of movement in the community, or to discriminate on grounds of age. A source said: ‚ÄòClearly it is crazy that pensioners living in hot places in Europe should be receiving winter fuel payments.‚Äô","Ministers said OAPs should be encouraged to accept smaller pension payouts or move into smaller homes to help pay for their care .

A fast food lover who ate takeaways every night has gone from fat to fit after she embarked upon a healthy eating regime and took up regular exercise. Now she is so addicted to working out that she has become a competitive body builder. Lola Adeoye, from Grays, Essex, who weighed 15st, completely abandoned her former unhealthy lifestyle, transforming her body to become a muscular bodybuilder. And last year, after losing seven stone, 43-year-old Lola began regularly competing in bodybuilding competitions for the first time. After starting with spin classes, Lola became a dedicated gym bunny, concentrating on weight training and diet . Lola, 43, said: 'I can't believe how much my life has changed. I went from eating takeaways every night to attending spin classes six times a week. 'I feel so much healthier, and I absolutely love competing. 'It's strange because when you do the work you don't immediately see the change in your body. But then I won Most Improved in Miss Galaxy International - the UK's first ever beauty and fitness pageant - and it spurred me on.'

Lola was forced to take control of her weight after an appointment at her local hospital. Lola was forced to take control of her weight after an appointment at her local hospital . 'I'd been in and out of hospital with gallstones and found out that I was going to need surgery to remove them. 'I went to the doctor for a pre-surgery consultation when I was asked to jump on the scales. 'I hated weighing myself anyway, but when I saw that I weighed almost 15st I was humiliated. 'Then the the doctor looked up at me and said 'Never mind, we'll get you back to your fish and chips in no time.' 'It was so embarrassing but it was the motivation I need to sort myself out, I knew right then and there that things need to change!' Just four months after she began weights Lola's trainer suggested she enter a competition . Lola vowed to start using the gym membership that she'd had for years, and two weeks after her surgery she finally attended her first class.'I had originally signed up to a legs, bums and tums class, but when I turned up I was the only one there. 'The instructor thought it was pointless to do a class on my own so she took me along to a spin class that was going on at the same time. 'As soon as I got on the bike I loved it! The lively music and great energy in the room just had me hooked. 'The music definitely helps you forget the pain you're in too!' In the space of just five months Lola had lost four dress sizes, going down from a size 20 to a size 12. She was at the gym so much that she even began teaching classes there. But Lola found she struggled to shift any more weight on exercise alone, and began a strict regime of clean eating to lose even more. 'Clean eating is where you only eat complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, lean protein and about four litres of water every day. Proud Lola is now teaching her own classes to inspire others to follow in her footsteps . 'It really worked for me and I lost even more weight.' But unhappy with her now very slender frame, Lola began weight training to give more shape to her body. 'When I was a size six I was so scrawny and just didn't feel comfortable. I was too slim and scrawny and I couldn't find any clothes to fit me. 'I started weight training just to give me a few extra curves, but I ended up really enjoying it. 'It meant I could eat even more too. I still keep to the clean eating diet, but I eat about 3,000 calories which includes seven small meals and four protein shakes. 'When I look back on what I was like before and I don't know how I let myself get into such bad shape' 'Four months after I began weights my trainer suggested I should enter a competition. I love a challenge so I jumped at the chance. 'I entered my first competition but I was told I needed time to build up my myself - so I took a break and this year I was ready to compete regularly. 'I won my first title, Most Improved, at Miss Galaxy Universe in May this year. 'It was incredible to be rewarded for all my hard work! 'I was self-conscious about my muscles at first, I know some people might think it strange for a woman to be so muscular, but as soon as people started complimenting me on my hard work I wasn't bothered at all. 'I feel really proud of what I've managed to achieve.' Lola now hopes teaching her own classes will inspire others to follow in her footsteps. 'When I tell my students how big I was before they don't believe me. 'They can't recognise me in pictures and are shocked at how I lost so much. 'But I'm living proof that it can be done, and I get so proud when I see people who have used me as their inspiration. 'I look back on what my life was like before and I don't know how I let myself get into such bad shape. 'People used to shout at me from across the street, and I was just dismissed as a fat girl.

Scientists leading the project rejected the suggestion that the decision, which will mean higher costs, meant science had taken a back seat to political expediency. ‚ÄòWe were all aware of the political dimensions of this,‚Äô said Jon Womersley, Chair of the Board of Directors of the SKA organisation, but he added: ‚ÄòIt's a scientifically motivated way forward.‚Äô There is already infrastructure in South Africa and Australia, including radio telescope dishes that were built as precursors to the new array. They will now be incorporated into the SKA. The consortium estimates that the decision to split the project will add about 10 percent to the 350 million euro ($440 million) budget for the first phase of construction. When completed in 2024 the telescope will be made up of 3,000 dishes, each 15 metres wide, together with many more antennae, that together will give a receiver surface area of a square kilometre. ‚ÄòThis hugely important step for the project allows us to progress the design and prepare for the construction phase of the telescope,‚Äô said Michiel van Haarlem, Director General of the consortium. ‚ÄòThe SKA will transform our view of the universe; with it we will see back to the moments after the Big Bang and discover previously unexplored parts of the cosmos.‚Äô Artist's impression of some of the dishes that will work together to make up the Square Kilometre Array .

Ton Engbersen of IBM resarch says, 'If you take the current global daily Internet traffic and multiply it by two, you are in the range of the data set that the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope will be collecting every day.' Upon completion in 2024, the telescope will be used to explore evolving galaxies, dark matter and even the very origins of the universe dating back more than 13 billion years. IBM is to investigate using 3D 'stacks' of computer chips to achieve the enormous computing power required by the Square Kilometre Array. This extremely powerful survey telescope will have millions of antennas to collect radio signals, forming a collection area equivalent to one square kilometre but spanning a huge surface area - approximately the width of the continental United States. The SKA will be 50 times more sensitive than any former radio device and more than 10,000 times faster than today‚Äôs instruments. The SKA is expected to produce a few Exabytes of data per day for a single beam per one square kilometer. After processing this data the expectation is that per year between 300 and 1500 Petabytes of data need to be stored. In comparison, the approximately 15 Petabytes produced by the large hadron collider at CERN peryear of operation is approximately 10 to 100 times less than the envisioned capacity of SKA.

The directors of the Square Kilometre Array project are to meet in Amsterdam on 3 April to discuss the location of the huge telescope, scattered across 1,900 square miles of Earth's surface. It will start building in 2016. 'It will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future,' says Michiel van Haarlem, interim director general of the SKA project.'We know we are going to discover things.'

The discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City has offered gruesome evidence of the brutal rituals of the Aztecs. Archaeologists excavating the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, on the site of the modern-day Mexican capital, found the 500-year-old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city's Sacred Precinct. On such stones victims were offered up for ritual sacrifice by priests who split open their abdomen from belly to throat and then pulled out their still-beating hearts. Gruesome: The five skulls discovered by archaeologists beneath a sacrificial stone which have been pierced on the sides to be hung on a rack known as a tzompantli and displayed outside a temple . The find the largest cache of skulls yet discovered at the site and archaeologists say they were likely used in rituals associated with Mictlantecuhtli, the Aztec god of death. Forty-five of the skulls were discovered above the stone, and a further five, more-fragmented specimens were found below which had holes in both sides, suggesting they were once hung on a skull rack. Such racks, known as tzompantlis, were used to display the crania of sacrificed people near temples and other important locations. Other skulls had been modified in a way that suggested they were to be made into masks, but never completed. Brutal: A total os 50 skulls and 250 jaw bones were discovered as archaeologists excavated the old city of Tenochtitlan, on the site of modern day Mexico City . Offering: Archaeologists say the skulls were probably buried there during a period of building and renovation as a tribute to Mictlantecuhtli, the Aztec god of death . Rituals: Some of the skulls had been modified in a way that suggested they were to be made into masks, but never completed . Archaeologist Raul Barrera Rodriguez, head of the Urban Archaeology Programme of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), suggested the skulls were deposited in various offerings. 'The skulls were used by the ancient Aztecs as elements of consecration or closing of architectural spaces and rituals associated with the worship of Mictlantecuhtli, god of death, so perhaps it is a gift that served to close any prehispanic building,' he said. 'Some of the 45 skulls that were above the sacrificial stone, have been manipulated with the intention to prepare ""skull-masks"" that were never finished,' he added. These kinds of masks, common among the Aztecs, were representations of death god Mictlantecuhtli, archaeologist Ximena Chavez said. Finished versions would be adorned with green stone to simulate the eyes and accompanied with spiral necklaces, rattles and obsidian knives. The five skulls with holes are believed to have been buried between 1375 and 1427 and archaeologists consider them an offering of consecration to sacrificial stone they lay beneath . Some 250 jaw bones were also found . In the usual procedure of the ritual, sacrificial victims would be taken to the top of the temple where four priests would lay them down on a stone slab. The victim's abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest using a ceremonial flint knife to cut right through the diaphragm and split open the chest. The priest would grab the heart and tear it out, still beating. It would then be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honoured god, and the body thrown down the temple's stairs landing at a terrace at the base of the pyramid. For the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days. Historians believe that figure may be an exaggeration. The 45 skulls above the sacrificial . stone were discovered in mid-August as workers carried out . infrastructure work to create a lobby for the Archaeological Zone and . Templo Mayor Museum. Mexico City was once the site of Tenochtitland, the capital of the Aztec civilisation which dominated much of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th Centuries. The Aztecs were finally vanquished in 1521 by Spanish conquistadores led by Hernan Cortes, who were helped by a number of indigenous allies, perhaps uncomfortable with the constant human sacrifices, to overrun Tenochtitlan. Aztec culture is these days primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as Templo Mayor in Mexico City; indigenous bark paper codices; and eyewitness accounts of Spanish invaders. According to Mr Barrera Rodriguez, most of the skulls are from women and men who were between 20 and 35 years old when they died. They may have been dug up from other burial sites and reburied there, he added. He believes they were buried sometime between 1440 and 1469 as work was going on to build a new temple at the site. 'The skulls were found in good condition, as moisture conditions facilitated their preservation, but were fragmented by the weight of the floors and filled with earth above them, a good portion of them are complete,' said archaeologist Est√≠baliz Aguayo, who added that there may be attempts to restore them. The five skulls with holes are believed to have been buried earlier - between 1375 and 1427 - and archaeologists consider them an offering of consecration to sacrificial stone they lay beneath.","Experts believe they are an offering to Aztec death god Mictlantecuhtli .

""Oh then maybe there won't be enough painkillers for the poor who use the emergency rooms as their primary care doctor."" 'Number one, there's no evidence of that. Number two, supposing it is really true, so you didn't get enough painkillers and you did have to suffer a little bit. The other side of the coin is people are dying and there's nothing perfect ...There's nothing that you can possibly do where somebody isn't going to suffer, and it's always the same group (claiming), ""Everybody is heartless."" Come on, this is a very big problem.' Under the new city policy, most public hospital patients will no longer be able to get more than three days' worth of narcotic painkillers like Vicodin and Percocet. Long-acting painkillers, including . OxyContin, which is often used to ease chronic backache and arthritis, . as well as Fentanyl patches and methadone, will not be dispensed at all.

Bloomberg added on Thursday that lost, stolen or destroyed prescriptions will not be refilled under the plan to crack down on what he called a citywide and national epidemic of prescription drug abuse. On the radio show he said the initiative was also about preventing excess amounts of drugs being taken out of medicine cabinets and sold on the street or abused by teenagers and others who want to get high. 'We talk about drugs, heroin and crack and marijuana, this is one of the big outbursts ‚Äì and it's a lot worse around the country than it is here,' he said. 'It's kids and adults getting painkillers and using them for entertainment purposes, or whatever field of purposes, as opposed to what they are designed for. 'If you break a leg, you're going to be in pain, nothing wrong with getting something that reduces the pain. But if you get 20 days worth of pills and you only need them three days, there's 17 days sitting there. Invariably some of the kids are going to find them, or you're going to take them and get you addicted.' Three days: Under the new city policy, most public hospital patients will no longer be able to get more than three days' worth of narcotic painkillers like Vicodin, pictured in generic form, and Percocet . Bloomberg also claimed the over-prescription of painkillers in New York had contributed to an increase in violent crimes outside pharmacies as robbers tried to steal the drugs. 'You see there's a lot more hold-ups of pharmacies, people getting held up as they walk out of pharmacies,' he said in his radio slot. 'What are they all about? They're not trying to steal your shaving cream or toothpaste at the point of a gun. They want these drugs.' After Thursday's announcements, critics slammed the initiative claiming poor and uninsured patients who used the emergency room as their primary source of care could be worse off. 'Here is my problem with legislative medicine,' Dr Alex Rosenau, president-elect of the American College of Emergency Physicians and senior vice chairman of emergency medicine at Lehigh Valley Health Network in Eastern Pennsylvania told The New York Times. 'It prevents me from being a professional and using my judgment.' He suggested the glut of prescription drugs was probably coming to New York from pain clinics in states such as Florida and California rather than local emergency rooms. But Bloomberg insisted the abuse of prescription painkillers had 'increased alarmingly' with more than 250,000 New Yorkers over age 12 now addicted, and that tackling the 'very big problem' was the most important thing.","New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has launched a crackdown on prescription drugs being dispensed at the city's emergency rooms on Thursday .

Stepping up to the challenge: Lindsey Walker (pictured with average-sized Alexa Fargo on ladder for comparison) hopes to be awarded the world record so that other people in her situation will hear her story . A seven foot tall basketball player who spent the first 21 years of her life as 'Greg' has set her sights on the USA women‚Äôs basketball team for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Olympic hopeful Lindsey Walker, 26, is also hoping to gain the title of the world‚Äôs tallest transsexual. She built her successful basketball career as a man, with a future in the NBA a possibility. However, the exceptional basketball player from Cleveland, Ohio, believes she was playing the sport to cover her true feelings and decided to quit until recently when she took up the sport again as a woman. As a male basketball player, she had lots of groupies and lived the life of an all-American frat-boy. 'I did a lot of partying - a lot of frat parties,' explained Lindsey. 'I was so popular I could turn up at a party where I knew no one and everyone would be getting me drinks.' However, Lindsey believes that her lifestyle was just a way of trying to fit in. 'Basketball was one hell of a cover-up for me,' she said. Not one person had a clue. 'One day I snapped. In the middle of the season, in my third year of college, I quit basketball,' said Lindsey. 'I stopped playing; I stopped training and weight lifting. I've come a long way since then, it feels good.' Lindsey started seeing a gender therapist and a doctor who prescribed the hormone treatments that have changed her looks and her personality. 'I felt much calmer. Within six weeks I saw my body changing,' said Lindsey. 'I developed breasts in the way a girl would during puberty. 'My body hair decreased. My skin got really soft. I lost the sex drive I had as a man.' Today Lindsey has long brown hair, B-cup breasts and lives every day as the woman she feels she has always been on the inside. As a child she would dress in her mother's clothes, but when her parents punished her she decided to hide her feelings - that she was a girl born in a boy's body. Aiming high: Lindsey Walker has set her sights on the USA women's basketball team for the 2016 Rio Olympics . Happier: Lindsey Walker now feels more comfortable in her own skin and has started to play basketball again . Posed: Greg Walker, 25, is now called Lindsey and is set to become the world's tallest transvestite . 'But I never stopped wanting to play basketball professionally,' said Lindsey. 'I just hated that I was hiding my real self behind basketball and that athlete way of life. 'It became overwhelming for me and I did what I felt I had to do at the time.' There are some things the hormone injections can't change, however. Lindsey feels if she had started the transition before puberty, she would not have grown to be seven-feet tall. She plans on having surgery to feminise her facial bone structure and to change her male genitalia to female genitalia. 'I know there are others like me out there, who are very tall, and because of that they're afraid to come out,' she said. 'It . is harder for them to pass as a woman. I want those girls to see me, . that I'm seven-foot tall and I'm not afraid to be who I am. 'I feel like the record would convey that message better than my story alone.'

A 90-year-old body-building, World War Two veteran who was shot in the face during a home invasion is being sued by the alleged burglar for firing back. Former Greenbrae deputy sheriff Jay Leone is accused of 'negligently shooting' 31-year-old Samuel Cutrufelli three times and causing him 'great bodily injury' as the older man defended his own home. Filing his claim yesterday in California, Cutrufelli, who is currently being tried for two counts of attempted murder against Leone, said that the injuries caused led to his financial ruin, the loss of his his home and the eventual dissolution of his marriage. Scroll Down for Video . Samuel Cutrufelli (left) is suing Jay Leone (right) for negligently shooting him during an alleged home invasion carried out by Mr. Cutrufelli . Prosecution attorneys have said that during the incident at the beginning of the year, meth addict Cutrufelli entered Leone's home and placed a gun to his head before tying the older man up and rummaging through his house for valuables. The incident occurred at about 10.45 a.m. on January 3rd at Leone's Via La Cumbre home and was interrupted only when the 90-year-old convinced Cutrufelli that he needed to use the bathroom with a graphically obvious display. Using the ruse that he was an old man with no bowel control, Leone told police that he in fact wanted access to one of the five handguns that he kept in his bathroom. Jay Leone is seen here in hospital in January after being shot in the face during an alleged home invasion by Samuel Cutrufelli . Emerging from the bathroom armed, Leone was allegedly shot first by Cutrufelli above the jaw. Leone then returned fire, emptying the handgun of bullets, striking Cutrufelli three times in the abdomen. 'I said, 'F‚Äî- you, you son of a b**ch, now it's my turn,' testified Leone at the beginning of the trial earlier this month. Father-of-two Cutrufelli is then alleged to have wrestled the gun from Leone, placed the gun to the veteran's head and pulled the trigger - but no bullets remained in the gun. 'After trying to kill him once, he tried to kill him again,' prosecutor Dorothy Chou Proudfoot said in her opening statement reported The Marin Independent Journal. Leone informed the court that he had intentionally fired off all the bullets in his gun because he knew that he would lose control of the weapon. Jay Leone describes himself as a body-builder on his Facebook page and is a veteran of World War Two . 'He took the gun and put it to my head - click! And that was the end of that. He ran away.' said Leone. Cutrufelli was picked up by police a short distance from Leone's residence in his car, bleeding profusely and told officer's he had shot himself by mistake. Leone, reached at home Tuesday, told The Oakland Tribune he was unaware of the lawsuit. 'He's the one who busted my door in,' he said. 'I'll just counter-sue him then. That's what I'll need to do.' The bullet that struck Leone missed all vital organs and arteries and the body-building sheriff was unaware that he had been struck. Mr. Leone discovered he is being sued yesterday and replied that he would counter-sue Mr. Cutrufelli for shooting him in the face and attempting to rob his home . 'The .45 hit me right in the face here and went through the back of my head,' said Leone. 'I didn't feel a thing.' The defence attorney Sanford Troy has attempted to convince the jury this month that Cutrufelli was not in the house to kill Leone. Describing his client as a drug using methamphetamine user, Troy said the confrontation was a 'drug deal gone bad' and that Cutrufelli was actually trying to escape the scene when the heavily armed Leone shot at him. The lawyer did not directly link Leone with the alleged drug deal, but at the same time did not offer a full explanation of what the drug deal was meant to be. It is known that Leone had two tenants living in his home at the time of the assault.","Former deputy sheriff and war veteran Jay Leone shot 31-year-old alleged burglar Samuel Cutrufelli three times with one of the five handguns he kept in his bathroom .

The T-shirt, which is listed as an ‚Äòonline exclusive‚Äô on the company‚Äôs website, jokes that Gaddafi, Hitler and Hussein are in the ‚Äòworld's most notorious rap group‚Äô along with Idi Amin and Kim Jong-Il. In stock: Urban Outfitters - which is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but has 24 stores across the UK - is selling the white t-shirt for ¬£32 and it features the black heading 'D.W.A. - Dictators with Attitude' The T-shirts appear to have been based . on the 'N.W.A.' slogan of 'N****z Wit Attitudes', an Eighties and Nineties US rap . quintet known as 'the world's most dangerous group'. The firm, which has more than 130 stores worldwide, offers ‚Äòa lifestyle-specific shopping experience for the educated, urban-minded individual in the 18 to 30-year-old range‚Äô, according to its website. The 'new in' T-shirt, available in small, medium, large or extra-large, is offered by Urban Outfitters for delivery within four working days for ¬£4 - or customers can pay ¬£10 for the next working day. The retailer's decision to stock the T-shirt was attacked by Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust. She told MailOnline: 'These T-shirts are in incredibly poor taste, and offensive to all victims and survivors who have suffered from oppression, tyranny and genocide.' Thor Halvorssen, CEO of Human Rights Foundation, added: ‚ÄòWe are not surprised about the new line by Urban Outfitters putting dictators in a comical light. There is plenty of room for humour in the fight against dictatorship. ‚ÄòSadly, this line of apparel struggles with one key aspect of parody: it needs to be funny. This isn't. It's just silly. 'It appears to be their trademark at Urban Outfitters to create offensive products that make light of the untold suffering of millions of people. ‚ÄòThat said, the creative staff and owners of Urban Outfitters have a right, in a free society, to peddle their wares, no matter how offensive or how silly.

Those who watched the Prince of Wales embellish his credentials as the defender of the countryside in a special edition of Countryfile on BBC1 at the weekend will have been impressed by his love of all things rural. They will have noted his fervour as he spoke of the importance of protecting the countryside for future generations. But his¬†words sounded rather hollow this week to some country folk living near the Prince‚Äôs experimental new town of¬† Poundbury¬†in¬†the most beautiful part of Dorset. Hard-y words: The royal proposal to build on the field near author Thomas Hardy's home, owned by The Prince of Wales, pictured yesterday during his visit to Jordan, has outraged Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes . For royal aides are evaluating the prospect of building another small town¬†on a vast cornfield. However, this isn‚Äôt just any old cornfield. It is the one that forms a spectacular valley at the centre of Thomas Hardy country and is overlooked by the author‚Äôs former home, Max Gate, now owned by the National Trust. It is also the very same field Hardy describes in lyrical¬†detail in many of his novels. The proposal has outraged Downton Abbey creator Lord Julian Fellowes, who lives nearby and is president of the Thomas Hardy Society. He tells me: ‚ÄòI am absolutely sure that the Prince of Wales, of all people, would be horrified. ‚ÄòThe Prince loves the countryside like nobody else. Everyone has been jumping up and down about this locally. It‚Äôs the most beautiful swooping cornfield, which goes down into a dip and then up to a wood on the far side. I just don‚Äôt believe Charles has been made aware of any of this.‚Äô Royal build: The suggested village to be build on the field in 'Thomas Hardy country' will be similar to nearby Poundbury, designed by the Prince of Wales . The valley is jointly owned by the Prince and a local landowner who, I understand, has no wish to see the land developed. But Charles‚Äôs Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 66 acres of the 103-acre site, is about to employ experts to look at the feasibility of building up to 1,000 houses ‚Äî a proposal bound to provoke fierce local opposition. It comes after West Dorset District Council informed the Duchy it wants to include the area in its draft housing plan. ‚ÄòThe council has put forward a proposal to develop this land and¬†we are undertaking a feasibility assessment,‚Äô says a Duchy spokeswoman. ‚ÄòIt is our duty to assist.‚Äô That assistance, of course, could potentially earn Prince Charles around ¬£50‚Äâmillion. Crime writer Minette Walters, who lives nearby, says: ‚ÄòThey want to stick something half the size of Poundbury in front of Max Gate. Hardy‚Äôs house will disappear from view.‚Äô Surrounded by his family, including daughter Holly, 31, it should¬† have been the jolliest of occasions for Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson as they celebrated publication of his remarkable mother Eve‚Äôs memoir, Mum‚Äôs The Word. But what was on the tycoon‚Äôs mind was the reputation of the Duchess of Cambridge, someone he considers to be a¬†friend. Branson had remained silent throughout the furore when Booker prize-winning author Hilary Mantel described Kate as¬† a ‚Äòshop window mannequin‚Äô with no personality, whose only purpose was to breed. White knight: Sir Richard Branson, pictured with daughter Holly and wife Joan at Monday's book launch, came to the defence of the Duchess of Cambridge . No bad word: Kate is 'well-informed and intelligent' But when the panel game show presenter and comedienne Sandi Toksvig¬† accused the Duchess of having no opinions, Sir Richard felt this was the last straw. ‚ÄòMiss Toksvig is so wrong,‚Äô he tells me. ‚ÄòI know Kate, and this is not the person I know. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve been on family holidays together. 'I can say with conviction that she is well-informed, very intelligent and wonderful company.‚Äô Speaking at the women-only Grace Belgravia club, Sir Richard adds: ‚ÄòKate certainly has strong opinions about a whole range of subjects. ‚ÄòBut because she is a member of the Royal Family, she simply cannot express these opinions. ‚ÄòShe certainly doesn‚Äôt deserve this criticism. It is just inaccurate. ‚ÄòAnd coming from a comedienne? Please!‚Äô ITV bosses are despairing over viewing figures for Daybreak relaunched six months ago. Hosted by Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones, it is attracting around 700,000, less than half the audience of rival BBC Breakfast and way short of the one million target they set. But might there be a solution close at hand? Refreshing change: Kate Garraway's stint on Daybreak brought figures up . For what has not been reported is that Daybreak did come close to a million viewers on one day during the February half-term week when Kate Garraway and John Stapleton stood in for Lorraine and Jones. It's true a strike by some BBC staff affected Breakfast Time. But it has sparked speculation that mother-of-two Kate, who already presents Daybreak on Fridays as well as standing in for Kelly during her holidays, will appear more often. The programme has floundered since replacing GMTV in 2010. Big money signings Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles have¬†come and gone, and at one stage ratings fell as low as¬†300,000. Broadcasting belle Kate, of course, is a veteran of 13 years of breakfast telly, while the excellent John Stapleton has been around longer than me. It is a debilitating illness that she likens to a hammer blow every 15 minutes to her knees, back, shoulders and hips. This is how singer and actress Toyah Willcox describes the ‚Äòpeculiar virus‚Äô she‚Äôs been suffering for the past three months. Her symptoms have been so painful that she has had to undergo daily physiotherapy at a sports injury centre. But despite her illness, she has just started a nationwide tour of a play, Hormonal Housewives. ‚ÄòBizarrely, I know four other people with the same symptoms ‚Äî they all live locally.‚Äô Her husband, rocker Robert Fripp, has also developed the virus. She tells fans on her blog: ‚ÄòWeight loss is the main concern.¬†I‚Äôve dropped about a stone and lost muscle tone.‚Äô Happily, she is improving, and adds: ‚ÄòThis is mainly due to the fact I went back to work and didn‚Äôt stay at home feeling sorry for myself.‚Äô Actor Sir Michael Caine, who is¬†80 tomorrow, tells his Twitter followers: ‚ÄòThank you for your kind birthday messages. Will blow the candles off.‚Äô¬† Fans will recall his famous line from the 1969 comedy film The Italian Job: ‚ÄòYou were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!‚Äô He's played some of the great theatrical roles, from Hamlet to Uncle Vanya. But veteran thespian Sir Derek Jacobi admits one opportunity has eluded him ‚Äî Coronation Street. Taking a break from filming ITV sitcom Vicious, in which he plays Sir Ian McKellen‚Äôs boyfriend, Jacobi, 74, says: ‚ÄòI‚Äôd love to do Corrie. Ian has been on it and I‚Äôm so jealous. ‚ÄòThey haven‚Äôt had anyone ¬†playing a professional actor yet, so maybe my character could have a room in Emily‚Äôs house while he‚Äôs doing a local gig.‚Äô Despite President Francois Hollande‚Äôs plans to impose draconian soak-the-rich taxes, actress Kristen Scott Thomas will not be deserting her beloved France. But The English Patient star ‚Äî in London yesterday to present a theatre gong at the Sky Arts South Bank Show Awards ‚Äî does retain a residual loyalty. ‚ÄòI was planning to cheer for France at the Six Nations game against England,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòBut then I heard God Save The Queen and I was on my feet.

Two drug addicts have been found guilty of murdering a transvestite and keeping his rotting body in a suitcase in a squalid flat for several weeks. Big Issue sellers Tracy Hurrell, 32, and David Hardman, 51, were convicted of Lionel Morl's murder after a month-long trial at Preston Crown Court. Police found Mr Morl's body decomposing in the suitcase in Hardman's flat in Manchester - after noticing foul smells during an unrelated visit to a property next door. Killers: Drug addicts David Hardman (left) and Tracy Hurrell (right) were convicted of Lionel Morl's murder . A post mortem found that the victim, who went by the name of Suzie and wore women's clothes, had been dead for several weeks after being violently attacked. A jury heard that Hurrell and Hardman ‚Äòpreyed‚Äô on Mr Morl, 49, to get money to feed their addictions to heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol. They then attacked and murdered him, stuffed him into the case and continued to collect his benefits cheques. The murder inquiry began on August 11 last year after Mr Morl‚Äôs body was discovered in grim circumstances. Disgusting: Mr Morl's decomposing body was found in a filthy bathroom in August last year . Police were called to Hardman‚Äôs neighbours on Victoria Street, Openshaw, to investigate a separate incident. But the smell coming from Hardman's flat next door was so awful that officers went to search it. They found the remains of Mr Morl, who lived in nearby Brade Close, in the suitcase on the bathroom floor. Photographs . taken inside the flat show how officers found many empty bottles of . alcohol inside, with filthy mugs and plates filling the sink. The . court heard that Hurrell had been living at Hardman‚Äôs flat until . October 2010, but had moved out before returning to Openshaw in May last . year. She moved in with Hardman but after a row she became homeless and befriended Mr Morl. Grim: Police found Mr Morl's body in a suitcase in Hardman's dirty flat in Manchester .

Mr Morl‚Äôs post office card - which he used to withdraw his fortnightly invalidity benefit of ¬£200 - went missing twice before he died, and continued to be used after the killing. Hurrell, of no fixed address, and Hardman, of Victoria Street, Openshaw, both denied murdering Mr Morl. They each initially blamed the other for his death. The jury took five-and-a-half hours to find them guilty of murder. The pair were also charged with perverting the course of justice by hiding Mr Morl‚Äôs body. Hardman admitted the charge, but Hurrell denied it and was found guilty after the trial. They are due to be sentenced next month.

Beaming boy: Blake McMillan has been born with a rare genetic condition which means he will forget how to walk, talk and even smile . With his happy face smiling back at you, it seems all the more cruel that even this simple pleasure will one day be taken away from baby Blake McMillan. The 11-month-old boy, from Longforgan, Perthshire, has been diagnosed with one of the rarest genetic diseases in the world - MeCP2 - believed to affect just 150 people worldwide. Closely linked to Rett Syndrome - the disease which claimed the life of Coleen Rooney's sister Rosie McLoughlin earlier this year - it will mean Blake will forget how to perform basic motor functions such as walking and talking as he gets older. Only discovered in 2005, the disease . which affects almost exclusively males occurs when a gene which controls . brain function is duplicated. Sufferers usually begin to experience seizures by the age of five which causes the brain to stop functioning properly. Most require round the clock care and at least half will die before the age of 25. Blake's . mother Jenny McMillan, a nurse, and her husband Paul, said they were . devastated when he was diagnosed with MeCP2 three weeks after he was . born on March 21 last year. Mrs McMillan, 36,said: 'As soon as Blake was born, I had a feeling something wasn't quite right. 'There wasn't one thing in particular . which set the alarm bells ringing - I think it was just my mum's . instinct. When we found out what was wrong with him, we were absolutely . devastated.' Hope: Paul and Jenny McMillan with baby Blake and daughter Faye, three, are raising money to try and find a cure for MeCP2 . Rare: Baby Blake was diagnosed with MeCP2 three weeks after he was born - the condition affects just 150 people worldwide . 'We don't know when exactly this will . all start happening, but we've been told Blake is likely to gradually . regress once the seizures start. 'It won't all happen straight away, but he is likely to lose most of his skills until he is like a small baby again. Sibling love: Faye McMillan, three, enjoys making Blake laugh by pulling faces at him . 'Thinking of what Blake is going to go . through fills me with panic. We have no way of knowing how bad the . seizures will be, but they could be so violent they give him a heart . attack. 'I worry he will suffer one in front of Faye, because that would absolutely terrify her. 'Most of all, I'm scared of being . robbed of my son. We're already falling in love with Blake's . personality. He spends so much time laughing at Faye. 'The thought of all of that being taken away from us and him not even being able to smile is almost too much to bear.' The couple are battling to raise ¬£1.2 . million to fund trials in the US and the UK which may be able to help . Blake continue his favourite pastime - laughing as his three-year-old . sister Faye pulls faces. 'It is a lot of money but I . couldn't go to my grave knowing that I didn't do absolutely everything . in my power to help Blake,' said Mrs McMillan. 'We all love him so much no matter what but we want him to have some quality of life. 'As it stands, I'll have to care for him 24 hours a day and he'll still be wearing nappies, even when he's in his twenties. 'People might think a cure is a long . way off but I believe if we can raise this money we could see . significant developments in Blake's lifetime.' Jenny . and construction company director Paul, 32, have joined forces with . other families affected by MeCP2 duplication syndrome across the world . to raise money for similar trials involving their son's condition. Professor Kevin Foust, from the . department of neuroscience at Ohio State University, said that he and . his fellow experts are optimistic MeCP2 duplication syndrome could soon . be treated. Recent experiments carried out on mice . indicate the symptoms of Rett Syndrome could be reversed by adjusting . protein levels in the body. He said: 'The data from Rett Syndrome is very encouraging that a viable treatment for MeCP2 deficiency can be found. 'The current models for how MeCP2 is causing disease would apply to both Rett syndrome and the duplication syndrome. 'However the model needs to be validated. But if it holds up, there is a reasonable expectation that treatments for duplication syndrome can be developed also.'

"By . Alison Boshoff . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:08 EST, 9 March 2013 . Kate Moss walking for Marc Jacobs at the Louis Vuitton show during Pars fashion week . Nothing was said at the time ‚Äî this is, after all the world of fashion, and Kate Moss expects to be sucked up to at every opportunity. But, at the cocktail party of Carine Roitfeld, former editor of French Vogue, in the Hotel Salomon de Rothschild in Paris on Tuesday night, some were taken aback when Miss Moss turned up in a tiny bodysuit, sprinkled with diamante stones that was completely sheer. The look bore little relation to the event‚Äôs prescribed ‚Äòsmokey eye and black tie‚Äô dress code ‚Äî instead it was the sort of look-at-me number you might expect to see on an ageing pop star such as Cher. And from the back, the famous Moss derriere ‚Äî which rather hung out of the back of her shorts ‚Äî looked deflated, crinkled and every one of its 39 years. It was not what we‚Äôd expect from the fashion icon, who has been working as a model for 25 years. A rare style misstep, or a sign that Moss, desperate to keep up with models half her age, is losing her gloss? Fashion critics derided her choice of outfit, while online commentators were cruel about the model‚Äôs figure, remarking on her ‚Äòshort .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. pony legs‚Äô and ‚Äòrough‚Äô appearance. ‚ÄòKate Moss is well known for her couldn‚Äôt-care-less meets attention-seeking attitude, but this all-over ten-denier style statement spelled nothing but desperation,‚Äô said Aisling O‚ÄôConnor, the fashion editor of the website Bohomoth.com. All this comes at a time when 20-year-old Cara Delevingne has exploded onto the fashion scene with her onesie-wearing, face-pulling quirkiness. Cara has everything that Kate used to have, and is clearly getting all of the attention that goes with it. Who could blame Kate if she did feel a tad rattled by a new arrival threatening her crown when she‚Äôs not yet ready to surrender it? The fact is that Miss Delevingne, a private schoolgirl from Chelsea, is very much on the up, having just posed for her first Vogue cover. And while Cara was mobbed by excitable fashion students and fans outside the fashion shows all week in Paris, Kate glumly and quietly glided from the Le Meurice hotel to her car and on to the shows with much less fuss and attention. Cara walked in seven shows including Lanvin, Jean Paul Gaultier, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent and was the undisputed hit of the week ‚Äî indeed, she‚Äôs racked up an astonishing 25 shows this year. Fresh face: Cara Delevingne has exploded onto the fashion scene and just posed for her first Vogue cover . Kate, meanwhile, only walked for her old friend Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton (alongside Cara) where she closed the show. Indeed, it must surely grate that one of the most high-profile advertising contracts which Kate once fronted ‚Äî posing for Burberry ‚Äî has gone to Cara Delevingne. On close inspection, Kate Moss appears to be exerting less of a draw over the fashion world. While she remains the UK‚Äôs highest earning model by some way, it‚Äôs said that her annual earnings have dropped by at least ¬£3‚Äâmillion and continue to spiral downwards. The most recent estimate in June last year by Forbes, the American business magazine, said that she had earned ¬£6.3‚Äâmillion in the previous 12 months, compared with a 2010/11 figure of ¬£8.9‚Äâmillion. On top of this apparent dip in income Moss has, in recent months, also seen the lucrative contracts she once held go to younger models, including the glamorous Dior Addict campaign she fronted from 2011 to 2012. Rising Dutch star Daphne Groeneveld ‚Äî who looks like an impossibly fresh Brigitte Bardot ‚Äî now fronts the Dior Addict campaign that rolled out in June last year. Groeneveld is 18. She . was also replaced as the ‚Äòface‚Äô of the Spanish clothing chain Mango in . December after a three-year association. Australian supermodel Miranda . Kerr, 29, fronted Mango‚Äôs most recent campaign instead of her. Moss‚Äôs . perfume campaign for YSL‚Äôs Parisienne ended in 2011. The scent is now . being represented by Marine Vacth, a 22-year-old French actress and . model. Her campaign for the . lingerie firm Agent Provocateur has also run its course, with the firm . using young British model Alice Dellal, who was then succeeded by Rosie . Huntington-Whiteley. Now actress Penelope Cruz and her sister Monica . front the brand. On the up: Cara Delevingne starred at Paris Fashion Week . Likewise, her Dior Opium adverts are a distant memory ‚Äî the brand is now represented by English actress Emily Blunt. Adverts for Calvin Klein jeans, which Kate did in 2005, currently feature Finnish model Suvi Koponen, who is a younger, blonder, leggier Moss doppelganger. Of course, this is the nature of the fast-moving fashion and beauty industry, as brands seek to associate themselves with the biggest name of the moment. And that‚Äôs not to say that Kate Moss isn‚Äôt working any more, and many in the fashion world are very loyal to her. She has a campaign for Givenchy, thanks to her friendship with creative director Ricardo Tisci, and also another for Versace this year (the fashion house has a decades-long relationship with her). When approached by the Mail, her agency Storm was quick to point out her five magazine covers so far this year and the fact her ¬£50 coffee table book, of which more later, has been a sell out. It must be said that the shoots and campaigns she is doing are, quite frankly, bordering on sleazy. Her current campaign for Vivienne Westwood ‚Äî shot by Juergen Teller ‚Äî is a crude photograph of Kate in a short skirt looking as if she is straddling a pole. Yet again, another picture in the same flesh-exposing, attention-seeking league. She starred in a wearyingly ‚Äòprovocative‚Äô cover shoot for the February issue of V magazine, which featured her striking quasi-lesbian poses with the singer Rihanna. She is even said to be in talks to pose as a cover girl for Playboy‚Äôs 60th anniversary edition. But while her shoots are becoming increasingly gratuitous, Kate‚Äôs taste for fast living seems to have waned with age. She has settled into a slightly suburban version of her old London life in a ¬£8.5‚Äâ‚Äâmillion home in Highgate, North London, with her rocker husband Jamie Hince and daughter Lila, 11, whose father is style commentator and publisher Jefferson Hack. The hedonistic days when she was a leading light of the Primrose Hill posse are a distant memory. The excesses of her on-and-off romance with heroin addict Pete Doherty are also far behind her. Now she likes to spend her time walking her Staffordshire terrier Archie and popping to her local pub, The Flask in Highgate. Perhaps in an attempt to cling on to her career, she has started taking care of herself more. Her new home has a Turkish steam room in the basement and she is a fan of expensive facial treatments. There have even been reports of her trying Jivamukti Yoga, although Kate, naturally blessed with a slim physique, has never had much patience with exercise. Meanwhile, perhaps aware that her moment has passed, Kate seems to be trying to reinvent herself as an icon of fashion history. In November last year, she brought out a coffee table book titled simply Kate Moss ‚Äî a ‚Äòdiary in pictures‚Äô of her modelling career. It is a thick tome costing an eye-watering ¬£50. She says nothing about drugs, about her Primrose Hill years, or about Pete Doherty. To the untutored eye, however, the book looks more soft porn than high fashion and seems another thinly-disguised attempt to hold onto the number one supermodel slot. She is naked in around half the pictures: naked on a beach, naked on a rug, naked except for a spiked helmet and so on. Moss told one interviewer that her daughter opened the book and exclaimed: ‚ÄòOh Mummy!‚Äô in dismay. She says she has promised Lila there will be fewer revealing shots in any subsequent volumes. What an excruciating conversation to have with an 11-year-old. But then, as she proved in Paris this week, there are only so many surefire ways to get everybody‚Äôs attention. And even though she is growing older, she hasn‚Äôt quite grown out of them just yet.","Turned up at French Vogue cocktail party in completely sheer bodysuit .

A Connecticut town has launched the country's first violent video game return program in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Officials and residents in Southington, which is 30 miles from where the killings unfolded in Newtown, will hold the event on January 12 for families to swap games for gift certificates donated by the Greater Southington Chamber of Commerce. 'We're concerned about our kids getting desensitized,' said John Meyers, executive director of the local YMCA, NBC reported. 'Desensitized to violence and desensitized to other risky . behavior.' Scroll down for video . Fears: A Connecticut town will hold a violent game exchange after Adam Lanza, who was said to be obsessed with Call of Duty (pictured), shot dead his mother, six teachers and 20 children last month . The event could be the first of many throughout the country after increased scrutiny over what leads mass murderers, such as Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, to commit such heinous crimes. The 20-year-old gunman was said to 'obsessed' with the violent war game Call of Duty, which features assault weapons similar to the Bushmaster AR-15, one of three guns he used to slaughter his mother, six elementary school staff members and 20 children on December 14. Other mass killers, including Anders Breivik in Norway in July 2011 and Mohamed Mera in Toulouse, France in March 2012, reportedly played the game in preparation for their killing sprees. Following the Sandy Hook shooting, . US Senator Jay Rockefeller introduced a bill to commission the . National Academy of Sciences to investigate the psychological effects of . violent games on children. Intervention: Group member John Meyers said he worries people are becoming desensitized to violence . Violent video games can alter the brain in just one week and make players more aggressive, researchers say. An . Indiana University School of Medicine study found key areas in the . brain suffer reduced activity and leave it physically altered. The findings fuelled the debate over the impact violent games have on regular players and links to anti-social behaviour. They . also came as a British teacher said children as young as four were . hitting classmates as they re-enact scenes from violent 18-rated . computer games. Alison Sherratt, a reception class . teacher at Riddlesden St Mary's Church of England Primary in Keighley, . West Yorkshire, outlined her concerns at the Association of Teachers and . Lecturers conference earlier this year. She . claimed youngsters were struggling to separate reality from their . experiences in the virtual world and copied the scenes at school. She . said pupils regularly discussed playing games such as the Call Of Duty . series, set in various war zones, and Grand Theft Auto ‚Äì where players . carry out robberies, muggings, killings, drug deals and beat up . prostitutes. Her . warning came after news that 14-year-old Daniel Bartlam killed his . mother with a claw hammer after watching a wide range of violent video . games, films and TV storylines. 'Major corporations, including the video game . industry, make billions on marketing and selling violent content to . children,' he said in a statement. 'They have a responsibility to protect our children. If they do . not, you can count on the Congress to take a more aggressive role.' The National Rifle Association also said the 'callous, corrupt' video game industry was to blame for the Sandy Hook killings, referring to games like Grand Theft Auto and . Mortal Kombat. In Southington, the event has been organised by SouthingtonSOS, which stands for . Southington Offers Service and which is comprised of town, school and emergency . officials as well as local business owners. They will be holding the return event from 9am to noon at the Southington Drive-In on January 12. 'If we have one violent video game . returned, we're going to be applauding,' Dr. Joseph Erardi, . Southington's school superintendent added at a press conference. 'This isn't about quantity. It's . about making a difference, one student, one parent, one family, one . community at a time.' The violent games, CDs and films handed in will be collected for 'appropriate permanent disposal'. Members . of the group said they do not intend to suggest video games caused the . shooting, but said 'there is ample evidence that violent video games, . along with violent . media of all kinds... has contributed to . increasing aggressiveness, fear, anxiety and is desensitizing our . children to acts of violence including bullying'. And even video game lovers have said that the violence has gone too far. At . last year's E3 ‚Äì the Electronic Entertainment Expo, the industry's . largest U.S. gathering ‚Äì some attendees were stunned by the intensity of . violence on display. Killer: Adam Lanza shot dead his mother before gunning down six staff and 20 children at Sandy Hook . Anders Breivik (left) said he played Call of . Duty in preparation for his mass killings on the island of Utoya while . Mohamed Merah's (right) wife said he also played the game before . attacking a school in Toulouse . 'The ultraviolence has to stop,' designer Warren Spector told the GamesIndustry website after the event. 'I . do believe that we are fetishizing violence, and now in some cases . actually combining it with an adolescent approach to sexuality. I just . think it's in bad taste. Ultimately I think it will cause us trouble.' 'The violence of these games can be off-putting,' Brian Crecente, news editor for the gaming website Polygon, agreed. But he said, like movies and TV, the video-game industry is under pressure to keep the blood and gore because violent games sell well. Missed: Mourners look at a memorial in Newtown, Connecticut for the young victims and their teachers . Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, where gunman James Holmes killed 12 people in a screening of the latest Batman film in July, said such realistic games may tip the mentally ill over the edge. 'There might well be some direct connection between people who have some mental instability and when they go over the edge ‚Äì they transport themselves, they become part of one of those video games,' he said. In response to criticisms, Hal Halpin, president of the nonprofit Entertainment Consumers Association, said: 'I'd simply and respectfully point to the lack of evidence to support any causal link.'

Tragic: Aaron Burgess, 14, drowned at the weir on the River Avon between Bath and Bristol in July last year . A 14-year-old boy drowned in a river after being 'egged on' to slide down a weir by a group of older boys, an inquest heard. Aaron Burgess, from Saltford, had been swimming in the River Avon between Bath and Bristol with two friends when the tragedy took place. The trio came across some older boys who encouraged them to slide down the steep wall into the river. But Aaron, who was not a strong swimmer, failed to resurface after sliding in. Detective Sergeant Marc Hathway, who . collated witness statements, told Flax Bourton Coroner's Court: 'I don't know if it was . the first time Aaron went down the sluice but he was egged on, and may . have been encouraged, by other people who told him to have a go. 'I don't . think they saw it as a risk. Aaron said he would go first and he was very quickly followed by his two friends, Jesse and Joe. 'He immediately got into difficulties, he surfaced but then seemed to go under on at least two other occasions. 'He spat out mouthfuls of water and shouted for help from his friends, he seemed to be trying to keep his head above the water. 'His friends told him to roll onto his back to keep afloat and Jesse swam over and told him to grab his arm. 'But Aaron was panicking by this stage and grabbed Jesse around the neck and was pulling him under. 'Jesse felt he was going to drown so he had to make the awful decision to leave Aaron and swim to the side for help.' Dangerous: The inquest heard how the weir did not have any life-saving measures and that Aaron's friends were unable to save him . Despite best friend Connor and passer-by . Joe Stevens attempting to rescue the schoolboy with a dinghy, Aaron . slipped under the water for a final time and never resurfaced. The inquest heard how temperatures peaked at 25 degrees C on the day of the tragedy on July 24 last year. Giving evidence, Mr Stevens said: 'We were . about five or 10 metres away from him and he then went under the water . for the last time and the didn't come back up. 'We stayed and waited for four to five minutes hoping he might pop up and we could rescue him, but he didn't.' Aaron's body was recovered six . hours later by police divers who found him resting on boulders on the . river bed only a few metres from where he went under. Aaron's father Jamie Burgess condemned health and safety standards at the weir and said more needed to be done to prevent against future accidents. Heartbreak: Mountains of floral tributes were left near the lock where Aaron drowned . The inquest heard the Canals and River Trust (CRT) legally hold health and safety responsibility for the lock and part of the weir, and had not put any life saving equipment at the site because they deemed it 'not necessary'. Tony Stammers, the Health and Safety Officer for the trust, said: 'Signs and life rings were deemed not necessary because principally the safety of those using the river for navigation is our concern, and it was not needed. 'Our responsibility is not for the health and safety of the general public outside the lock area, this is privately owned land and their responsibility.' Coroner Maria Voisin recorded a verdict of accidental death and said there was nothing his friends could have done to save the youngster. Egged on: The inquest heard that Aaron and his friends had been sliding down the weir into the weir after being encouraged by older boys . She added that she would use Rule 43, which allows coroners to suggest actions that should be taken to prevent further deaths, to order a report by the Canals and River Trust into further health and safety measures. Speaking after the inquest Mr Burgess, 39, said he was devastated by his son's death and had warned him from walking over the weir and swimming in the river. He said: 'Obviously I am still devastated because I have lost my son. 'I . had warned Aaron, he was not a strong swimmer. We had done a lot of . fishing and I told him not to go in there but kids will be kids and they . do those things, you can't stop them and you can't keep an eye on them . 24/7.' The father-of-three . also condemned the health and safety of the weir, claiming the Canal and . River Trust had not done enough to keep the area safe. 'I . feel health and safety issues need to be addressed. I think they could . put a piece of fence to deter anyone from walking on the weir', he said. 'I don't think the CRT has done enough, in my eyes I think they have tried to shove the blame on to somebody else. 'I think they could have done a little bit more, especially given the saving of somebody else only six weeks earlier.' Since Aaron's death three life rings have now been placed at the scene, two provided by family and friends, and one by the CRT, alongside a sign warning people not to swim in the river.","Aaron Burgess, 14, was swimming in River Avon in July last year .

Children who cannot prove their religious faith will be denied free bus travel by a council in North Wales. Flintshire Council will demand evidence from pupils such as a note from a Catholic priest or a baptism certificate to qualify for free transport to a faith school, if it is not their nearest. The plans, thought to be the first of their kind in the country, have been blasted by parents as 'discrimination'. Children who cannot prove their faith will not be eligible for free travel under plans by Flintshire Council (file photo). Under pressure to save money due to government funding cuts, the authority has defended the move as 'fair, equitable and sustainable transport policy' and say it will save up to ¬£100,000 a year. Other councils across the country have decided to scrap free travel to faith school entirely. But in Flintshire the council has decided to single out only pupils who are at a faith school but whose admission 'is not based on faith grounds'. One worried mother said she feared her 10-year-old daughter would not be able to join her older sister at St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School, in Flint. 'I would not be able to afford to pay for the bus every day, so it could end up with my daughters going to different high schools, which isn't ideal,' said the mother, whose children both went to a faith primary school. 'My children have not been christened, through my choice not theirs, but the school faith is all they have ever known. 'Just because a child has a baptism certificate it does not mean they are any more active believers than those who haven't. 'It is prejudiced to ask parents of non-baptised children to pay for their transport.' Some parents whose pupils attend St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School in Flint have blasted the plans as 'discrimination' Canon Joe Stuart of Connah's Quay Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church said his faith was about being inclusive. 'Education in this country is free. You can't penalise people according to their faith by imposing a financial penalty if they have been accepted to the faith school but don't share the belief. This is being exclusive.' Should the plans get the green light, schools affected would include St Richard Gwyn Catholic High School in Flint, St Mary's Catholic Primary School in Flint and St David's RC Primary School in Mold. It is not known how many non-religious pupils attend faith schools, but of the 2009 year seven admissions to St Richard Gwyn, more than half came from non-Catholic primary schools. A consultation, which runs until April 12, says under the new transport police free transport will 'no longer be provided for pupils whose admission is not based on faith grounds.' The measures would affect new admissions from September, 2014. A council statement said: 'Like all councils, Flintshire County Council is under considerable pressure to make savings on its public spending. 'As a result, the council has had to look at every aspect of its work, especially where it is not compulsory for us to provide services and to consider how they can be delivered more efficiently.' The policy review on the council's website states: 'The proposed changes are intended to produce a fair, equitable and sustainable transport policy. 'A public consultation is being carried out on two discretionary aspects of the policy, namely post-16 transport and transport to denominational schools. 'The council is proposing that for new admissions from September 2014, free transport to denominational (faith) schools is no longer provided for pupils whose admission is not based on faith grounds. 'Consultation with individual schools will take place to confirm the admission criteria under which pupils are admitted, and suitable evidence of adherence to the faith of the school such as a baptismal certificate or a letter from a priest may be requested'","Flintshire Council will demand note from priest or baptism certificate .

A compound belonging the leader of one of America's largest polygamous sects is to be sold at auction. Warren Jeffs's 6.1 acre property in Hildale could fetch up to $2.65million when it goes up for sale on April 25. Jeffs, who is still thought to lead the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS), is in prison in Texas, having been jailed for life after convictions for child sex abuse and bigamy. For sale: Tall walls, fences and 'no access' signs surround Warren Jeffs's compound in Hildale, Utah, which is to be sold in an auction . The sale has been instigated to raise money for a legal settlement involving the FLDS. Willie Jessop, a former spokesman of the FLDS sued a group of the sect's leaders, including Jeffs and his brother Lyle Jeffs, and was eventually awarded a $30million default judgement. Mr Jessop alleged that the FLDS members broke into his business premises, stealing a range of property including computers and hard drives. He also claimed to have been blackmailed, said he had been excommunicated and claimed that he had been forced to lie for Warren Jeffs. When the sect leaders failed to respond, a fifth district judge awarded the default settlement, with the auction contributing to the sum. Jessop, who was once a staunch defender of Jeffs, left after the church after the child sex abuse allegations against the sect's leader surfaced. Mr Jessop could make a bid for the property himself, according to his attorney Mark James, who siad that could use part of the legal settlement to bid for it. Settlement: The compound is being sold as part of $30m legal settlement involving Willie Jessop, who alleges FLDS members broke into his property and stole computers and other property . Home: The town of Hildale, with the compound pictured among the buildings in the foreground . The property, which will be auctioned on the steps of the Washington County Courthouse in St. George, was built in 2010 and 2011 in polygamous Utah town twinned with Colorado City, Arizona. It is believed to have been built while Jeffs was awaiting trial, with his wives and family apparently moving in after his release from custody. The property is surrounded by 12ft walls, with three brick properties visible inside. It is located next to a number of FLDS buildings, including the FLDS clinic. A 1,700-acre centre, owned by the church, the . Yearning for Zion Ranch, was pictured last year after most of its 700 residents had fled. According to local tax records, the total value of the land is appraised at more than $33 million. Prosecutors have also alleged that FLDS leaders financed the . property through money laundering. The sect bought the land for about . $1.1 million in 2003, according to an affidavit.

Arizona's attorney general Tom Horne last month announced a criminal probe of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office, which serves as a small police force in the twin polygamous towns Hildale and Colorado City. During . a news conference held in Phoenix, Mr Horne also announced that a . 26-year-old woman had been granted temporary custody of her six children . and had fled the town of Colorado City, the home base of the FLDS. He said she was forced by by its jailed leader Warren Jeffs to . marry her brother-in-law at the age of 14, and had since been virtually . held captive in the town on the Utah-Arizona border, along with many . other women who want to leave. 'What they do is say, ""Everybody watch her so she won't run away"". Then she can't leave,' Horne said. 'Women who wanted to escape have been forcibly held by the marshals against their will.' Attorneys for the two towns and the Marshal's Office adamantly denied the charges, calling Horne's words 'inflammatory'. 'I . can't speak for the FLDS but the bottom line is the Marshal's Office . absolutely does not hold people against their will,' said lawyer Blake . Hamilton.

Arizona, ought not be making those statements unless he has evidence of . it. 'It's just absolutely not true,' Hamilton said. The church does not have a spokesperson to speak on its behalf. Horne . fought last year for a bill in the Arizona Legislature aimed at . abolishing the Marshal's Office in Colorado City, and replacing law . enforcement there with deputies from the Mohave County Sheriff's Office. It . failed to pass, so he allocated funds to provide for limited patrols by . deputies but says the money will soon run out, and he is again asking . the Legislature to take up the bill.

Horne was joined at the press . conference by Flora Jessop, a vocal critic of the FLDS who fled the . church in 1986. She was flanked by her sister, Ruby Jessop, and the . woman's six young children. Flora . Jessop said her sister, who did not speak Tuesday, had been held . captive by the FLDS for years, undergoing sexual and mental abuse at the . hands of her husband while not being allowed to leave with her kids. Ruby . Jessop finally fled last year, and recently won temporary custody of . her children who were being held 'hostage' by the sect, Flora Jessop . said. 'It's a good day for freedom,' she said. The FLDS Church teaches that a man having multiple wives is ordained by God and is a requirement for a man to receive the highest form of salvation. It is generally believed in the church that a man should have a minimum of three wives to fulfill this requirement. Wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands. The church has come under fire over allegations of sexual and mental abuse of wives and underage polygamous marriages. There are said to be over 30,000 people practising polygamy in Utah, Idaho, Montana and Arizona, even though it is illegal. Mohave . County Sheriff Tom Sheahan said his agency also is involved in a . criminal investigation of the FLDS and the Marshal's Office. He described authorities there as 'security guards for the FLDS church.'. 'They are corrupt and work only for the FLDS and Warren Jeffs,' Sheahan said. He said it's a dangerous situation . for his deputies to be patrolling Colorado City without the cooperation . of local law enforcement from the Marshal's Office. 'They are not our allies,' Sheahan said. 'I wouldn't trust them as backup for our deputies.' Another attorney who represents Colorado City called the allegations outlandish, and said the Marshal's Office works well with Mohave County deputies. 'The Marshal's Office welcomes the presence of the sheriff's deputies because it provides them with backup,' said lawyer Jeff Matura. 'The more police service, the better protection for everyone.' Last year, the U.S. Justice Department sued Colorado City and Hildale, claiming discrimination against residents who are not FLDS members. Arizona also has a similar ongoing civil lawsuit against Colorado City. The criminal probe announced Tuesday by Horne and Sheahan mirrors the one that landed Jeffs in prison. After receiving a complaint of child abuse, Texas authorities in 2008 raided the FLDS' Yearning for Zion Ranch. The move led to a chaotic roundup of 400 children living at the secretive location in what became one of the largest custody cases in U.S. history. All of the children were eventually returned but 11 men - including Jeffs and other high-ranking FLDS lieutenants - were arrested on charges of sexual assault or bigamy and later convicted.

A former Idaho executive accused of slapping a baby on an airplane was on his way to take his son off life support and was 'upset and grieving' at the time of the incident, his attorney has revealed. Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, of Hayden, pleaded not guilty to federal assault charges on Wednesday after allegedly striking the 19-month-old boy in the face last February, court documents filed in Atlanta show. Hundley's lawyer said he had been traveling to Atlanta to decide whether to remove his son from life support after being told just 24 hours earlier that he had overdosed on insulin. Scroll down for video . Attack: Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, is accused of first racially abusing, then physically assaulting this 19-month old boy, Jonah Bennett, after he started crying on a flight . Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land . Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up' Hundley's son was 'in a coma for . life,' attorney Marcia Shein said in a statement. 'On the flight, he was . in distress, upset and grieving,' she said. The boy's mother, Jessica Bennett of . Minneapolis who is white, was seated with her adopted black son, Jonah, . when she says Hundley struck her child after using a racial slur . directed at them. 'Shut that . n****r baby up,' he allegedly told the mother while their Delta . Airlines flight was descending from Minneapolis into Atlanta. Shein . said he did use a racial slur when the child started crying because of . ear pressure, but she denied that Hundley struck the boy. In media interviews, the child's mother has said Hundley was belligerent and seemed intoxicated during the flight. 'I said, ""What did you just say?"" And . he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to . my ear and he said it directly into my ear,' She told ABC News. It was then she said that Hundley lifted and . swung his hand at her child. Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers' Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby' 'When I looked at Jonah‚Äôs face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death,' she said. She says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since. Hundley . was fired from his executive position at AGC Aerospace & Defense . after the alleged slapping incident, his attorney said. The . Oklahoma City-based military technology company issued a statement . describing the executive's behavior as 'offensive and disturbing.' Hundley's son, whose age was not given, died the day after the flight, Shein said. Fired: Hundley was an executive at AGC Aerospace & Defense before he was fired after the incident for what his company called disturbing allegations . Hundley 'has paid a terrible price for his hurtful words,' his lawyer said. The assault charge carries a $100,000 fine and a maximum penalty of a year in jail. The task of proving his innocence may . be difficult for Hundley, according to Bennett family attorney John . Thompson, who told ABC that there were numerous witnesses who saw him . strike Jonah - including a federal air marshal. The 60-year-old previously also denied using racial language. He claims . that he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.' Hundley previously said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a . hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft. However, . Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated. The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around . wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight. Bennett says Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.' Agent Cheney added that Bennett . received help from other passengers on the Delta flight.

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 05:28 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:20 EST, 21 March 2013 . A sapphire ring found in a Yorkshire field by a metal detecting enthusiast may have been owned by royalty in the 5th and 6th centuries, experts said today. Archaeologists say that nothing like the Escrick Ring from that period has ever been found in the UK before. The expert group, convened by the Yorkshire Museum in York, believes the ring could have royal connections. Lucky: Michael Greenhorn found the 1500-year-old ring in a field near Escrick, south of York . Curator of archaeology at the museum Natalie McCaul said: 'What this workshop has shown is that this sapphire ring is even more special than we had previously thought. 'Nothing like it has been found in this country from the 5th or 6th century.' The ring was found by metal detectorist Michael Greenhorn, from York and District Metal Detecting Club, in 2009 as he searched a field near the village of Escrick, south of York. Ancient: The ring is now believed to have belonged to royalty in the 5th and 6th centuries . It measures around 2.5cm across and is intricately made of gold, prestige glass and a large sapphire. The initial assessment of its origin was that it was likely to be Anglo-Saxon or Viking, from the 10th or 11th century. 5th Century England was a tumultuous period with invasions from across Europe making it likely that the ring came from the continent. Experts believe it may have then been given to someone from the ruling classes in England at some point in the 5th Century, probably in the early Anglo-Saxon period. The end of Roman rule in England in 410 was followed by invasions from the Celts, Scots, Saxons, Picts and further Roman uprisings. The failing economy of the country led to civil war, widespread famine and changes in leadership across the century. Corrupt leadership, more civil turmoil, public forgetfulness and individual apathy following the Battle at Badon, circa 500AD, meant that England was ripe for the Saxon picking. The Anglo-Saxon rule of Briton lasted for a further 500 years until the Norman Conquest in 1066. Now the expert group has dated it to a much earlier period. They have also suggested the ring was made in Europe, possibly France, and that it would have belonged to a king, leader or consort - not a bishop which was a previous theory. The wear on the ring also suggests that it could have been a brooch first, which was later made into a ring. 'It has been fantastic to hear the thoughts of some of the world's leading experts and their suggestions will allow us to now go away and try and fit the ring into a historical timeframe,' Miss McCaul said. 'The general thought was that it was probably made on the continent and perhaps traded or gifted it to somebody in the ruling classes in England. It was probably around the start of the Anglo-Saxon period. 'Hopefully this will lead us to finding out more about the ring and possibly even who might have owned it.' The workshop was attended by more than 30 experts from across the UK and included a day of talks, presentations and discussion, the museum said. The expert group concluded the sapphire in the ring was probably cut earlier, possibly during the Roman period, but the ring itself was specially made around the sapphire. And, by looking at the wear on the ring they decided it was worn for at least 50 years before it was lost. The . gold hoop that forms the ring also looks slightly different to the main . part of the ring, with suggestions being made that it was turned into a . ring later, possibly from a brooch or mount. A . museum spokesman said another theory suggested during the meeting was . that the ring was from a later period, perhaps the 8th or 9th centuries, . but was inspired by earlier styles in both jewellery and perhaps . surviving stonework in Yorkshire dating from the 5th or 6th centuries. Research: The Yorkshire Museum have raised ¬£35,000 to buy the ring and conduct more studies . He said further research was underway, in particular a search for any further archaeology or historical information which can link the ring to 5th or 6th centuries. This will be conducted initially by researchers from the University of Durham. The Yorkshire Museum has raised ¬£35,000 to buy the ring. This has been made possible with grants of ¬£10,000 from the Art Fund, ¬£10,000 from the MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, ¬£10,000 from the Headley Trust and ¬£1,000 from the York Philosophical Society.","Ring was found by metal detectorist in a field near Escrick, Yorkshire .

An antiques dealer duped unsuspecting collectors by forging the signatures in books of famous writers like Sir Winston Churchill and Robert Louis Stevenson, a court heard today. Allan Formhalls found the books and magazines in car boot sales and a recycling centre, added the signature and then sold them on eBay as the real thing, Southampton Crown Court heard. He made thousands of pounds defrauding collectors from as far afield as Texas in the US after also lying about the provenance of the items, the court was told. Duped: Allan Formhalls found books and magazines and faked the signatures of Winston Churchill (left) to sell them on to unsuspecting collectors, a court heard. The signature of Elizabeth I (right) was found in his home. Police found the forged signatures of Oliver Cromwell, Elizabeth I and Marie Antoinette among others when his home was searched, prosecutors said. The 66-year-old is accused of selling 68 items bearing Churchill‚Äôs alleged false signature at a cost of ¬£10,000 to one collector, Kim Taylor-Smith. He claimed in emails they came from the home of famous Second World War fighter ace Squadron Leader Neville Duke, who lived near him in Milford-on-sea, Hampshire, and was a friend of Churchill who had died in 2007, Simon Edwards, prosecuting, told the jury. Formhalls, who denies 15 counts of fraud from 2009 to 2011, told Mr Taylor-Smith and others that he got the books from the house of Sqn Ldr Duke via an 'old couple' who used to clean for him. 'What we say is that the defendant acquired books by famous authors, he forged a signature inside the book, usually that of the author or authoress, and sold them as the genuine article - it‚Äôs as simple as that,' Mr Edwards told the jury. 'You will hear that in some instances . he invented stories to tell the hapless buyer to boost what is known in . the trade as the provenance, or history, of the book. 'The . buyers were fooled into thinking what they were buying was the real . thing signed by the authors or authoress and, needless to say, the price . they paid for the books was enhanced by the presence of the author‚Äôs . signature in the book.' Historic: Oliver Cromwell's (St Ives statue, . left) and Robert Louis Stevenson's (right) forged signatures also on . appeared on documents found in Mr Formhalls' home, Southampton Crown Court was told . In . November 2010, Mr Taylor-Smith, who had been 'hooked' by Formhalls‚Äôs . email explanations and merchandise, had some of his items examined by an . expert in Churchill books called Pom Harrington. 'A number of items were left with him overnight. He called Mr Taylor-Smith the next day with the ghastly news that each and every Churchill signature was a fake,' Mr Edwards told the court. Mr Taylor-Smith immediately called Formhalls for a refund and was told the 'old couple' he had got the books from had moved and he was trying to track them down. Mr Taylor-Smith then received an email in February 2011 from Formhalls‚Äôs son saying his father was very ill and would not be in contact with the old couple. The jury heard that others including Texan Basel Boatright bought Churchill books with alleged fake signatures for around ¬£2,500 during 2009 and 2010 all purporting to be from the home of Sqn Ldr Duke. Formhalls also offered for sale bound volumes of the Christian Science Monitor, apparently signed by Churchill. Another . alleged victim, Corinna Honan, bought autographed copies of Island . Nights‚Äô Entertainments and Ballads by Robert Louis Stevenson for about . ¬£300. She then paid him for . more signed books by Joseph Conrad, Douglas Grant and Pablo Picasso for . a further ¬£967. All were fake signatures, Mr Edwards said. After Formhalls was arrested in February last year his home was searched. 'The . search revealed a huge amount of material including a number of . autograph books and papers containing forged signatures ranging from . Winston Churchill to JRR Tolkien and Elizabeth I to Marie Antoinette,' Mr Edwards said. 'There . were books with forged signatures of the authors Aldous Huxley, Robert . Louis Stevenson, CS Lewis, Virginia Woolf and George Orwell. None were . genuine, needless to say. Another one: Marie Antoinette's forged signature was also on some of the documents in his home, the court heard. Above is actress Kirsten Dunst in her role as the French queen in the 2005 movie . 'There was a calligraphy pen and a bottle of chestnut brown ink found among the papers and books,' the barrister told the jury. Formhalls had got the Christian Science Monitor from the Efford Recycling Centre in Lymington, Hampshire, before Christmas 2010 and it did not have any Churchill signature on it, the court heard. 'When they were later discovered at Mr Formhalls‚Äôs home during the police search they had miraculously acquired the apparent signature of Winston Churchill,' Mr Edwards said. When interviewed, Formhalls told officers he got the books from Wimborne and Matchams car boot sales in Dorset and he denied being responsible for the signatures. He said a couple called Rita and Terry would buy items for him and sell them on, and the jury would hear evidence that Formhalls specifically asked them to find books by Churchill printed when he was alive. 'This, of course, was necessary: if they were published after his death then they could not bear his genuine signature could they?' Mr Edwards said. 'He said he was not an expert on books and advertised them as signed, as opposed to signed by. He believed them to be genuine but he did not advertise them for sale as such or guarantee them as such,' the barrister went on. He then told police he got the Churchill books from the old couple called Ann and Alan, who had cleaned for Sqn Ldr Duke. In later prepared statements he called the old couple Pat and Alex, the court heard. The trial is expected to last 12 days.

Appearance: Coronation Street Actor Michael Le Vell arrives at Manchester Crown Court today to face 19 child sex charges . During today's preliminary hearing, which lasted about 10 minutes, Le Vell, wearing a dark pinstripe suit, white shirt and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name. Six members of his family sat in the public gallery of the packed courtroom. Le Vell has not yet entered a plea but has stated publicly that he is innocent and will fight the allegations through the courts. Prosecutor Eleanor Laws told Judge Michael Henshell that a plea hearing will take place on May 17 followed by a two to three-week trial starting on September 2. Alisdair Williamson, defending, asked for an earlier trial date, saying: 'Mr Turner has had this hanging over his head for 18 months.' But Judge Henshell said the September date should be fixed and granted the actor bail until the plea hearing, at the same court, in May. Asked by the judge if he understood, Le Vell nodded and said 'Thank you', before leaving the dock.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:17 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:12 EST, 21 March 2013 . The historic vote on whether Scotland should break away from the rest of the UK will be held on September 2014, it was announced today. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond fired the starting gun on what will be a tightly-fought over the merits of independence. It is thought he will use the 700th anniversary of the Scottish win at the Battle of Bannockburn to bolster patriotic fever. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond told MSPs in Edinburgh that this historic vote will be held on 18 September 2018 . By holding the vote in 2014, Mr Salmond hopes to use the 700th anniversary of the the Battle of Bannockburn to bolster patriotic fever . Mr Salmond, the Scottish National Party leader, declared that would be the 'historic day when the people will decide Scotland's future'. Signalling that there were 547 days until polling day, he told MSPs: 'I believe it will be the day we take responsibility for our country, when we are able to speak with our own voice, choose our own direction and contribute in our own distinct way.' Leaving the United Kingdom and becoming a separate country would give Scotland a 'new, more modern relationship with the other nations of the UK"" that would be a ""true partnership of equals'. He adding: 'I believe on September 18 the people of Scotland will vote Yes to create a better country than we have now, one we can pass on with pride to the next generation.' The vote is taking place after the SNP won an unprecedented majority in Holyrood in the 2011 election. Former chancellor Alistair Darling (second left) said pressure would mount on Mr Salmond to spell out what independence would mean. He is leading the Better Together campaign against independence, with (left to right) Scottish Labour Party Leader Johann Lamont, Scottish Conservative Party Leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie . Mr Salmond said: 'Next year the choice facing the people is one of two futures. A No vote . means a future of governments we didn't vote for, imposing cuts and . policies we didn't support. 'A Yes vote means a future where we can be . absolutely certain, 100 per cent certain, that the people of Scotland will get . the government they vote for.' Former chancellor Ken Clarke today warned pro-independence campaigners not to bank on a North Sea oil boom. Speaking in Edinburgh, the Conservative minister told Alex Salmond not to ‚Äòbet the ranch‚Äô on figures ‚Äòpulled from the air‚Äô. His comments followed the release of figures which showed North Sea oil and gas tax revenues will drop from ¬£34 billion to ¬£33 billion between 2012-13 and 2017-18. The change appears to leave an ¬£8.5 billion gap between the OBR's revised figure and the Scottish Government's least optimistic estimate. Mr Clarke, the UK Minister without Portfolio, said: ‚ÄòI don't find them very convincing. Nobody believes that (oil) is an answer to our economic problems. ‚ÄòIf we were to have an independent Scotland, it is not the case that it would not somehow have to face up to the consequences of economic crisis.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòThe main thing I pick up is concern among my political friends in Europe. The average Spaniard and the average Belgian is far from excited about the prospect of having a referendum of this kind,‚Äô Mr Clarke said. Mr Salmond announced the date to Holyrood as the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill was published. He has already put forward legislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to take part in the crucial vote. In January the elections watchdog . today threw out an attempt by Alex Salmond to skew the question in the . Scottish independence referendum to coax people into voting Yes. The Scottish Government wanted to ask voters: 'Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country? Yes/No.' But . the independent Electoral Commission has demanded 'more neutral . wording' and insisted voters have a clearer idea about what severing . ties with the rest of the UK will mean for Scotland. The question voters will be asked in next year's vote will be: 'Should Scotland be an independent country? Yes/No.' Former . chancellor Alistair Darling, the chairman of the cross-party Better . Together group campaigning to keep Scotland in the UK, said there were . still unanswered questions about independence. He said: ‚ÄòI think most people in Scotland are desperately anxious to know the facts here, to know what the details are. ‚ÄòOf course I'm ready and I'm willing to put forward a powerful case for why Scotland is stronger and better as part of the UK. ‚ÄòWhat is singularly lacking on the other side though is anything remotely resembling a compelling case for making a complete break, it really is buying a one-way ticket to a deeply uncertain destination.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòThis is the biggest single decision we will make and that is why I strongly believe we need the details from the other side, from the Nationalists. They have failed to provide that so far. ""It's all very well to produce the date after this long and unnecessary delay, but we now need to get the details so we can get stuck into a serious debate."" Earlier Blair Jenkins, the chief executive of the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, said the announcement of the date was ‚Äòanother important landmark day that brings us closer to the referendum‚Äô. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""For those of us who believe the best future for Scotland is as an independent country it's a very significant day. ""It makes the referendum much more imminent and gives an added reality to it. We move from the stage where a lot of the debate about independence has been at a theoretical level, a process level. I think people are engaging more and more with the issues.‚Äô The Electoral Commission also recommended the main Yes and No campaigns be allowed to spend up to ¬£1.5million each in the run up to the big vote. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, right, secured a landmark deal with Prime Minister David Cameron last year to hold the referendum in 2014 . Better off in: The Scottish Social Attitudes survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want Scotland to be independent, the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999 . Pro-independence campaigners suffered a major blow in January when a major survey revealed support for Mr Salmond‚Äôs dream of going it alone was now at its lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999. Experts claim increased publicity for the SNP‚Äôs campaign to leave the UK has meant more people are now fearful of what independence might mean. Just 23 per cent of people want Scotland to leave the UK, the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey for 2012 revealed. It shows a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported independence. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are ‚Äòquite‚Äô or ‚Äòvery‚Äô worried about independence, up from 46 per cent in 2011.","First Minister names the date for the landmark referendum .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 09:51 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:05 EST, 21 March 2013 . A celebrated painter accused of being a paedophile today claimed that artists who use children in their work are subjected to a 'witch-hunt' and there is 'no shame' in pictures of nude children. Graham Ovenden, who told police he had a 'major reputation' for having 'some of the best portraits of children in the last 200 years', is accused of sexually abusing children over the past 40 years. The 70-year-old painter and photographer, whose work has hung in a Tate gallery and some of the world's greatest museums, told Truro Crown Court there was 'no shame' in the 'state of grace', saying he had a 'moral obligation' to capture images of nudity. Allegations: Acclaimed artist Graham Ovenden, 70, is accused of abusing children who posed as models for him in the 1970s and '80s, a court heard . Giving evidence from the witness stand today, Ovenden talked the jury through some of his paintings - including those featuring nudes and children in states of partial dress. Referring to one of his subjects, an alleged victim in the case, he said: '[She] was a beautiful child - not only as she was, as you see her in front of a camera, but also as a person. 'I think it is important that someone pays homage to that and place her in a state of grace. I think holding those things, by photography or painting, is a moral obligation.' Referencing poet William Blake, Ovenden described the 'state of grace' as 'a thing of wondrous beauty'. In one of several references to Christianity in court today, Ovenden said: 'Imagine Adam and Eve before the serpent - there's no shame. 'We're not born with trousers, skirts, shirts and shoes. One of the great qualities of art is to go back to the great point, the Garden of Eden.' Court appearance: The Cornish artist's work includes nude and semi-nude portraits of young girls . Ovenden told the court how he had photographed children, in the presence of others, including the alleged victim's relatives. He testified: 'I have to say the absolute witch-hunt which is going on at the moment - and the idea of a child naked is something to be frowned upon - is absolutely abhorrent.' Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife had previously described how the four alleged victims posed for Ovenden. They made formal complaints to police in the late 2000s and he was arrested in 2008. Witnesses giving evidence during the trial described how Ovenden would take his alleged victims into his studio and make them wear Victorian-style clothing which he would then remove. He would also cover their eyes before abusing them, they told the court. Asked by his counsel, Christopher Quinlan QC, whether he found children sexually interesting, Ovenden replied simply: 'No.' He also denied abusing the alleged victims, and said a blindfold used in one of his works had a religious significance. Ovenden told the court: 'I want to keep it simple - it is the fact that when in the Catholic Church we come to confirmation, your eyes are blindfolded. 'Then the blindfold is removed to show the revelation of Christ through light.' He told the court he fixed the blindfold on his subject himself, sometimes adding a small amount of double-sided tape to keep it in position as required. He said the Victorian clothing was part of a box of costumes which were 'very popular with the children'. 'I gave them freedom to just take them out of the box,' he said. Mr Quinlan also asked Ovenden about a time when he was visited by two police officers after he submitted a series of negatives - including some of a child as the subject - to be developed by Kodak. Ovenden told the court he subsequently received a letter of apology from the police for their involvement. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Graham Ovenden allegedly abused multiple children over four decades .

Rangers have launched an investigation into the conduct of Francisco Sandaza after the striker was tricked by a Glasgow taxi driver into admitting he only moved to Ibrox for the money. In a phone conversation, which was recorded for 23 minutes, Sandaza revealed details of his salary to a cabbie named Tommy, who was posing as a Los Angeles-based agent. The taxi driver is a known prankster, who has duped footballers before. The Spaniard also complains at the standard of football in Division Three claiming: 'I didn‚Äôt sign for the level, I signed for the money. I‚Äôll get another contract after Rangers.' Scroll down to listen to the full recording... Bad call: Francisco Sandaza has been tricked by a Celtic supporter posing as an agent working in Los Angeles . Born in Toledo, Spain in 1984, Sandaza started out with Valencia . reserves before signing for his hometown club. He moved to Dundee United . in 2008 and scored 10 goals (five of them against the Old Firm) in his . first season. Groin and hernia problems hampered his progress and he signed for Brighton in 2010 after an unsuccessful trial at Swansea. He was released after one season and signed a one-year deal with St . Johnstone. Twelve goals in 17 appearances tempted Rangers to make a . pre-contract offer but he turned them down before the club went into . administration. Sandaza left Perth after a season and signed for Rangers last summer as a free agent. Rangers have since revealed that manager Ally McCoist held talks with Sandaza and are looking into the matter. 'The club is aware of this issue and is investigating the matter, a statement read. 'Ally McCoist has spoken with the player and Rangers Chief Executive Charles Green is consulting with the club's advisers. 'The club regards this as an extremely serious matter and will comment further at the appropriate time.' Celtic supporter Tommy - who has never revealed his surname - was pretending to be middle-man Jack McGonigle, has previously tricked disgraced former Rangers owner Craig Whyte and ex-SFA chief executive David Taylor, now a senior UEFA official. Sandaza tells the prankster he is on ¬£4,500 a week for the first season of his four-year deal, which goes up to ¬£10,000 in the final year. By that time the Ibrox club would expect to be back in the top flight of Scottish football. The 28-year-old striker, who believed 'McGonigle' was approaching him about a move to Major League Soccer in the United States, admitted he would quit Ibrox for a better deal but insists he does not want the club to know about the conversation. He says: 'Do not do it officially through the club. Send me the contract first. I don‚Äôt want trouble if Rangers find out about this.' Sandaza signed for Rangers from St Johnstone last summer.

A Manhattan socialite and former 1970s TV actress is refusing to leave a $25 million estate in Southampton, New York that belonged to her late shipping-magnate husband and which is due to be sold on Friday. Tara Tyson Kulukundis has locked herself inside the stunning beachfront property and is refusing to leave - even though a new buyer is set to purchase the property this week. Her husband was M. Michael Kulukundis, a Greek shipping fortune heir who died in 2010 at the age of 76. His will provided for his widow financially, but didn't leave his properties to her. Former TV actress Tara Tyson Kulukundis, pictured in 2011 with son Christopher, is refusing to leave her former husband's home in Southampton, New York . The stunning property in Southampton, New York includes an Olympic-size swimming pool and two waterfall spas . At the time of his death, the properties had a total value of $70 million and included another Southampton home, an apartment at Fifth Avenue's Pierre Hotel and a five-story townhouse on East 67th Street which has since been sold. The executors of her hubby's estate filled a court order in Manhattan on Monday in a bid to force her out of the five-bedroom, five-bathroom mansion at 320 Murray Place. They claim that for the past six weeks she has ‚Äòlocked herself in‚Äô and blocked movers, cleaners and real estate agents from entering - thus jeopardizing the proposed sale. The property is the latest to be sold to raise funds to pay off the estate's $30.5 million mortgage debt and to support Tara Tyson Kulukundis' ‚Äòextravagant lifestyle,‚Äô the filing states. Tara Tyson Kulukundis had this portrait taken by Andy Warhol in the 1970s . Kulukundis, then going by the name of Tara Tyson, appeared in a 1978 episode of Charlie's Angels . When Kulukundis died, his widow and their four children Eric, Manuel, Cassandra, and Christopher got shares in a trust worth an estimated $50 million in assets. Using her stage name of Tara Tyson, she was a jobbing actress back in the 1970s featuring in episodes of hit TV shows Charlie‚Äôs Angels and Starsky and Hutch. She also performed in the Off-Broadway plays ‚ÄòForeplay‚Äô and ‚ÄòPorno Stars at Home,‚Äô according to IMDB.com, and was photographed by Andy Warhol. On March 7, eldest son Eric Kulukundis, 44, moved his belongings out of the property and attempted to persuade his mom to do the same. ‚ÄòMrs. Kulukundis appears to be very resistant to the idea of moving out, and Eric is reluctant to do things which upset her,‚Äô his attorney wrote to the executors, according to the court papers. He has also had his own troubles in Southampton. On March 1 he turned himself in to local police after crashing and abandoning a vehicle in Sagaponack days earlier, reports Southamptonpatch. The Southampton estate at 320 Murray Place has five-bedrooms and five-bathrooms . The pool/guest house abuts the dune and has a roof deck with unimpeded views of the ocean . He has been charged with aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the second degree, a misdemeanor, and leaving the scene of an accident with property damage and being an unlicensed driver, both traffic infractions, as well as a number of vehicle and traffic infractions. His right to drive had already been suspended due to unpaid fines. The stunning property is spread over 4.3 acres with approx. 300 ft. directly facing the ocean. It also has an Olympic-size swimming pool and two waterfall spas. The executors are concerned that should Friday's deal collapse, mortgage payments of $2,174 a day will quickly add to the debts, along with additional charges of $20,000 a month, reports DNAinfo. Socialite: Tara Tyson Kulukundis, together with Grace Jones, attend An Evening with Taika Waititi in New York City last year . The estate currently pays for a gardener, chauffeur, two housekeepers and other staff at the Southampton home and Pierre residence. This isn‚Äôt the first time that the executors of her husband‚Äôs will and Mrs. Kulukundis have clashed. It took a court order last October for real estate agents Sotheby's International Realty to gain entry to the property. Not long after she changed the locks.

"By . Helen Lawson . PUBLISHED: . 12:39 EST, 21 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:46 EST, 21 March 2013 . A minister who opened his church to Muslim worshippers told today how he has been hit by a barrage of abuse by internet users. St John's Episcopal Church became the first church in the UK to share their building with Muslims after Rev Isaac Poobalan saw members of a neighbouring mosque praying outside in the snow because of a lack of space. Hundred of Muslims now pray in the Aberdeen Church's main hall and chapel every week, but the news has not been well received by some, who have taken to the church's Facebook page to attack the decision. Rev Poobalan, right, said he would not be true to his faith if he did not offer to help his neighbours with their overcrowding problem . One user said that the church was 'sharing Christ's table with Satan' before others another predicted a 'flood' of Muslims moving to Aberdeen to convert the church into a mosque and said Rev Poobalan needed to be given the 'boot' before it was too late. Another posted: 'I would leave this so called ""church"". Allah is Satan, and no God. They (the church) have nothing to say about persecuted Christians, but invite Satan in. 'We are dealing with evil people that bow down to Allah and lost their belief in Jesus a long time ago. Allah has no son.' The church's Facebook page was no longer available this afternoon. But today Rev Poobalan said he would not sever his relationship with the nearby Crown Street Mosque. He said: 'I keep seeing these Facebook comments coming up on my email account, but I will not back down. We have developed a relationship with the mosque and we will not be breaking that up. Sheikh Ahmed Megharbi, left, and Rev Isaac Poobalan, right, behind the altar at St John's Episcopal Church, Aberdeen, which is also being used as a place of worship for Muslims . 'These people have reacted spontaneously, but over time I hope they will change their minds. 'There . is a huge religious cultural gap between the two, and if it takes time . for them to be brought together then that's the way it is. 'With . our media culture these days one can easily make comments and respond . to things instantaneously, you just have to live with it.' One . user even criticised Rev Poobalan for being a Good Samaritan to just be . 'liked' and said there was nothing 'courageous' in his actions. Rev . Poobalan said: 'What governed my human response was the Christian . teaching 'love your neighbour as yourself' and that was honestly my . first thought, 'I have to help them as a neighbour'. 'Jesus Christ wasn't one who wanted to be liked and I don't expect people to like me or the Church for what we do. We don't go into this blindly, we go into this knowingly and we don't go around trying to please people. 'It was simply a gut feeling to let them in after seeing someone in the cold praying and I believe that prayer is never wrong. There is nothing wrong with making them comfortable.' St John's Episcopal Church in Aberdeen is believed to be the first in the UK to share with Muslims . Sheikh . Ahmed Megharbi of the Syed Shah Mustafa Jame Masjid mosque said: 'What . happens here is special and there should be no problem repeating this . across the country. 'The relationship is friendly and respectful.' St . John's is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the . Anglican Communion and distinct from the presbyterian Church of . Scotland. The Bishop of . Aberdeen and Orkney, the Right Rev Dr Robert Gillies said that this . relationship could be the start of a change in dynamics between the two . faiths. Dr Gillies said: 'It would be good to think we can change the world. Most of us most of the time feel we can‚Äôt so don‚Äôt bother. 'But sometimes, someone has a vision we can do something of global significance on a local scale. 'This is what is happening between St John‚Äôs and the mosque in its grounds. 'Everyone can do something locally and if more were to do so then something big might just begin to happen globally.' Sections of the church hall have been handed over to the mosque and the imam has led prayers in the chapel . Dr . Gillies said that the 'eyes of the world' were now focused on the two . faiths represented in the building on the city‚Äôs Crown Terrace. Although the Christian church regards Jesus as the son of God, the Muslim faith views him as a key prophet. Even with differences like these, there can be a mutual respect, said Dr Gillies. The relationship between the mosque and St John‚Äôs has developed over the past few years. On Christmas Eve 2010 both opened their doors for prayers, food and socialising. In 2011, the church and mosque teamed up to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA. Verses were read from both the Bible and the Koran to commemorate those who died. There have been cases of Christians allowing Muslims to pray in their churches in parts of America. In 2011, two Florida churches were criticised for opening their doors to Muslim groups. But Church leaders believe the move in Aberdeen is a first for the United Kingdom.","Internet users targeted St John's Episcopal Church in Aberdeen .

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 09:35 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:06 EST, 7 November 2012 . Apple have received a patent for a technology that could allow the police to disable protesters smartphones, it has emerged. The new technology would act as a 'kill switch' for smartphones, disabling any cameras on the devices and blocking their connection to mobile networks. Apple stresses that the function would be most likely used to prevent copyright theft, such as in cinemas, or to stop phone cameras being used in inappropriate places, like department store changing rooms. However, in the filing for U.S. Patent No. 8,254,902, the company adds that 'covert police or government operations may require complete ""blackout"" conditions'. Brutality exposed: This still from footage recorded on a phone, shows students from the UC Davis . being pepper sprayed as they stage a sit-down protest. A new Apple . patent could disable the phone cameras of protesters . 'Additionally,' it says, 'the wireless transmission of sensitive information to a remote source is one example of a threat to security. 'This sensitive information could be anything from classified government information to questions or answers to an examination administered in an academic setting.' That statement suggests that police . and other authorities could use the newly patented feature during . protests or political rallies to block transmission of video footage or . photographs from the scene. In . many highly publicised instances, such as during the Arab Spring . revolutions and even the West's own Occupy protests, pictures and . footage from smartphones have proved a crucial tool for citizen . journalists documenting police behaviour. In one highly publicised case, 21 . students from the University of California, Davis were awarded . settlements of $30,000 each after a police officer attacked them with . pepper spray as they staged a sit-down protest. Footage . of that incident was filmed on the smartphones of dozens of bystanders . and eventually broadcast around the world, leading to the suspension of . two officers involved and the resignation of their superior officer. Civil rights campaigners warn that the new technology could limit the ability of concerned citizens to gather evidence of such excessive behaviour by police and security forces. The furore over Apple's latest patent is not the first it has been accused of collusion with the authorities. The Cupertino-based company last month faced claims by hacktivist group AntiSec that it had passed a database of one million Apple users to the FBI. AntiSec made the accusation as it released the database online, after allegedly stealing the information from an FBI agent's laptop. AntiSec had claimed the data is just a piece of the more than 12 million unique identification numbers and personal information on the device owners that it got from a laptop used by an FBI agent. However, the FBI denied that it ever had that information and Apple also said it had not given the information to the FBI. 'The FBI has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization, Apple spokesperson Natalie Kerris told AllThingsD. The patent for 'Apparatus and methods for enforcement of policies upon a wireless device' was granted in late-August and would allow authorities to change 'one or more functional or operational aspects of a wireless device, such as upon the occurrence of a certain event'. This means that those with access to the technology could use it for 'preventing wireless devices from communicating with other wireless devices (such as in academic settings), and for forcing certain electronic devices to enter ""sleep mode"" when entering a sensitive area'. The patent filing makes clear that although Apple may implement the feature, any decision on whether to use it would be down to governments, businesses and network operators. The technology works via mobile . networks, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or GPS, and would send an encoded signal that . can selectively shut down features of smartphones within range . depending on what kind of policy needs to be enforced. Apple . claims the technology to shut down increasingly ubiquitous wireless . devices is necessary since they 'can often annoy, frustrate, and even . threaten people in sensitive venues'. However, civil rights campaigners . have already registered their concern that authorities could misuse the . technology. Nick Pickles, director of privacy and . civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'It‚Äôs been a . fact that modern phones are in reality tracking devices that let us make . calls, but the idea that awkward citizens might find their phone shut . down at the behest of a Government agency is a very worrying thought and . not one that fits with democratic principles. 'Only last year we had Chinese state media praising British politicians for considering a blackout of social media sites and as with the iPhone, this idea could have been made in China.' Jules Carey of Tuckers solicitors, who represented the family of Ian Tomlinson, the newspaper vendor who died after he was struck by a police officer at protests against the G20 in 2009, told MailOnline the technology could stop police being held to account for their actions. 'There is something very sinister about governments and the police having the power to block all communication and recording devices except their own,' he said. 'This is the sort of technology you might expect to see in China but not a western democracy. 'Time and again it is citizen journalism, little brother, which exposes the truth about altercations between citizens and the state. 'Mobile phone video recordings and photographs played a significant role in exposing the truth concerning the death of Ian Tomlinson and have regularly been used to expose violent or racist police officers. 'I struggle to think of any justification for the use of this technology in a democratic society and in some circumstances - such 7/7 - a phone shut down would have hampered the rescue effort and prevented vital evidence being preserved.' Blackout: Students protest against education cuts. The new technology would allow police and other agencies to shut off the camera functions of protesters' smartphones . Val Swain of the Network for Police Monitoring, a campaign group that monitors the activities of police in public order situations, said the technology had the potential to make policing even less transparent. 'Netpol and our partners use photographs and video a great deal to monitor and record police behaviour. We would certainly be very concerned at any attempts to limit the freedom to do this,' she told MailOnline. 'Texts, tweets, photos and videos are used a great deal by protesters, not only to tell each other what is going on, but also to tell the outside world. The disruption of this would be extremely serious. 'I would also be concerned at the potential for use of this technology by private companies, particularly those who are targeted by protests.¬† Might they be tempted to 'switch off' protesters phones to limit bad publicity? 'Policing in the UK is anything but transparent. The general public has little trust in the state authorities to ""come clean"" over the use of this sort of technology. 'This in itself makes people fearful and anxious.¬† What is needed is for the police to me much more open and honest about the way they police us generally, and particularly the way they police public protests.'","Technology would broadcast a signal to automatically shut down smartphone features, or even the entire phone .

A woman who called herself the 'Black Madam' will stand trial on murder charges for allegedly performing illegal buttocks-enhancing procedures on a London tourist who later died in her Philadelphia hotel. A judge upheld third-degree murder charges during a preliminary hearing today against Padge Gordon, who is also known as Padge Windslowe, 40. The ruling comes after a friend of the dancer testified today that she and 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi came to Philadelphia last year and had their buttocks enlarged. Windslowe's defense attorney argued that both girls knew his client was not a real doctor as they had visited her for the injections before. Pumping: Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, also known as the 'Black Madam,' stood trial today on allegations she administered illegal buttock-injections using silicone from Thailand and Krazy Glue . Theresa Gyamfi said the 'Black Madam' gave them silicone injections in their hotel room ‚Äî but then fled when . Aderotimi went into respiratory distress. A doctor testified that the industrial-grade, not medical grade, silicone went to Aderotimi's blood, liver, lungs and brain. She was rushed to a Delaware County . hospital in an ambulance, but died within hours of a pulmonary embolism, . according to the doctor. But defense lawyer Christopher Mannix . said he will challenge those medical conclusions at trial, along with . allegations his client performed the injections. The Philadelphia Inquirer said that . prosecutors told the court she painted herself out to be a medical . professional when she administered a series of injections to the two . women. This was¬† the second time the woman went to Windslowe, paying $1,800 to $2,300 a time to have their butts enlarged. Dead: Claudia Aderotimi believed a 'bigger booty' would help her to appear in more music videos, according to her distraught friends . Method: Windslowe is accused of injecting a substance she described as silicone into her client's buttocks and then sealing the wound with super glue (file photo) Windslowe's attorney, Christopher . Mannix, argued the silicone that killed Aderotimi had not been linked . conclusively to the silicone found at the injection site. He also said . the women knew Windslowe was not a medical professional, and that they . were getting an illegal procedure. The Black Madam has been jailed since . March when she was arrested on charges of administering a series of . injections to an exotic dancer in Philadelphia. That woman did not die but has since suffered from lingering health problems. It is alleged that Windslowe left the hotel room even after Miss Aderotimi complained of chest pains and breathing problems. Police charged Windslowe in July after a year-long investigation. Miss Aderotimi's friends said she believed a 'bigger booty' would help her dream to appear in more music videos. The aspiring dancer was dropped from one shoot because directors discovered she had been wearing padded trousers to help enlarge her bottom. Windslowe has also been charged with . injuring an exotic dancer who spent two weeks in the hospital after she . was injected with silicone and Krazy Glue in a similar procedure . Black Madam: Windslowe has been jailed since March, when she was arrested on charges of administering a series of injections to an exotic dancer in Philadelphia . Talent scout Tee Ali, who met the . Thames Valley University student when she filmed a video, told The Sun: . 'The problem was she didn't have no butt, and she wanted a butt. 'She went to audition for one video shoot wearing fake booty pants and she got all the attention. 'But when they found out it was fake she didn't get asked back.' They have also charged Windslowe with . injuring an exotic dancer who spent two weeks in the hospital after she . was injected with silicone and Krazy Glue in a similar procedure. Windslowe was arrested in February 2012 at what police called a 'pumping party' at a Philadelphia home. That . arrest was for assault and related charges in a separate incident that . authorities said left a client with severe lung problems from silicone . that entered her bloodstream and was later found in her lungs. Illegal . injections using substances including liquid silicone, paraffin and . petroleum jelly have been used to enlarge women's breasts, hips and . buttocks in other cases. It was believed that Windslowe used silicon from Thailand mixed with Krazy Glue for the injections, charging $1,000 a time. Authorities said they knew Windslowe had injected Aderotimi, but the Delaware County medical examiner's office was awaiting test results from the Food and Drug Administration before determining the cause of death. Philadelphia police believe she has performed at least 14 cosmetic surgeries, moving locations to avoid detection. The authorities said Windslowe would clean the site before injecting a substance she described as silicone into the client's buttocks. When the procedure was done, she would cover the wound with glue.

They've had it good for six weeks with some beautiful autumnal sunshine, but the future of Occupy Wall Street now hangs in the balance - as the weather turns and snow storms threaten the U.S. Protesters were waking up in their tents at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan this morning after a freezing cold night to the prospect of the first snowfall before Halloween in New York City since the Civil War. And following a day of rain on Thursday, their moods were further dampened today after the city's authorities took away the generators they were using to keep warm and power electronic devices. Chilly: Christopher Guerra, from San Francisco, California, is wrapped in a blanket to stay warm as he participates in the Occupy Wall Street protest at the Zuccotti Park encampment on Friday in New York . Wet: A man sits under an umbrella in Zuccotti Park at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in New York . Cold: Protesters in Zuccotti Park on Friday, when temperatures were hovering just below the 50F mark . An Occupy Wall Street spokesman said . this was 'a pretext to make the protest less sustainable and more . difficult for us', but authorities insisted they had to remove the . equipment for safety reasons. A blanket of cold air that brought the . first flurries of the season to Colorado on Wednesday is continuing to . spread south and east, bringing the lowest temperatures since spring. The expanding cold pocket yesterday brought snow to . parts of Pennsylvania, New York and New England, and a second storm . looks set to powder all the major east coast cities this . weekend. The unusually early snow is bad news . for those camping in city centres across the country, as critics speculate that the days of the Occupy movement may now be numbered. Not moving: Many of the protesters say they will not be leaving the camp in New York, but that remains to be seen as temperatures plunge this winter and the snow begins to fall . Gone: A generator is seen at the site of the Occupy Wall Street Protest at Zuccotti Park in New York on Thursday, before it was sezied by city fire department officials during an early Friday morning inspection .

Extreme: The future of the Occupy Wall Street movement hangs in the balance, as snow storms threaten cities across the US. Protesters . struggled to shield themselves from wind and rain at Zuccotti . Park on Thursday - their mood dampened further by the dismal . weather predictions. Around 30 Tennessee protesters were arrested in Nashville at the site where a few dozen have been encamped for about three weeks. Authorities began moving in after 3am this morning using a new state policy that set a curfew for the grounds near the state Capitol, where the protesters had been staying. But later this morning, a Davidson County Sheriff's Office spokesman said the arrested protesters were being released after a night court judge would not sign the warrants. Protester Steve Reiter, who works closely with the group's legal team, said he believed there were problems with how the protesters were taken into custody. He described their release as a victory for Occupy Nashville. Living outdoors is taking its toll. Lael Gillette, 27, an unemployed chef from Rockford, Illinois, has had only two hours of sleep in three days at the camp. 'I would rather there was another option,' he said. Protesters . have erected tents and tarpaulins over parts of the concrete park, but . appeared to be failing in their battle to keep warm and dry. Some demonstrators in New York avoided . the wet weather on Thursday by huddling in a local art gallery run by . Trinity Wall Street church with free internet access, reported the New . York Post. Meanwhile, the protests now have the support of David Duke - arguably America's most infamous white-power advocate and a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. 'I cheer the men and women on the streets condemning the international banks that hold America financially hostage,' he said in a video. Snowscene: The unusually early snow is bad news for those camping in city centres across the country. Resilient: 25 protesters slept at the Occupy Denver camp overnight on Wednesday even as the winter snow storm moved in. Several were taken to the hospital for hypothermia. Authorities will welcome the dramatic . weather forecast. Law enforcement officials in some cities such as Oakland, . California, have cleared out protests. 'I would rather there was another option' Lael Gillette, New York protester . But New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said there is little he can do . about the New York protest until the owners of the park where the camp is located, Brookfield .

Now observers will watch what happens as the mercury plunges. Stoic: A blanket of cold air, that brought the first flurries of the season to Colorado on Wednesday, is continuing to spread south and east, bringing the lowest temperatures since last spring. Camp Crazy: A snow-dusted protest sign sits under a tree at the 'Occupy Denver' camp . A dramatic drop in temperature across the southern plains is expected on Friday. Meanwhile, farther north on the East Coast, as much as six inches of snow will fall on higher ground. Occupy San Diego protesters were cleared out of their camp in an overnight raid. Early this morning, authorities in riot gear took over a site that has occupied a downtown area for three weeks. One . officer used a loudspeaker and told the group to leave the site. Protesters chanted in response: 'This is what democracy looks like'. But they were all directed out of the area several hours later, reported MSNBC. Police said their camp was illegal. Temperatures will plummet with some . areas of the north east such as Syracuse reaching lows of 27 at night. In major cities such as New York and Boston overnight temperatures . will remain in the 30s. The north east will experience a widespread freeze on Friday, forecasters said. Then another powerful storm . gathering momentum along the mid-Atlantic coast has the potential to . bring very early season snow to major cities such as New York, . Philadelphia and Boston on Saturday. Accuweather . meteorologist Elliot Abrams said: 'The amount of rain versus snow that falls . on various communities in the I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New . York and Boston Saturday will be a matter of a few degrees.' Snow this heavy this early is highly . unusual along and near I-95 in the Northeast. In Philadelphia, the . average date for the first accumulating snow is December 18. Downpour: Protesters take shelter at their Zuccotti Park camp in Manhattan in the face of a day-long deluge of rain. More bad weather is on its way . Weathered: Mayor Bloomberg has blamed the continuing protests on the warm early fall . Changing: Mike Esperson, 22, from Queens, New York, who woke up to find himself soaked from rain at the Occupy Wall Street protest camp, picks up free donated clothes at the Zuccotti Park comfort station .

Like summer, or fire, anything that‚Äôs . hot, you know what I'm saying? And it works' Ed, New York protester . Ed, a 56-year-old volunteer medic from Maine, told New York magazine, 'It‚Äôs a combination of being wet and cold that starts the hypothermia. We patrol at night looking for people shivering.' Trench . foot is also becoming a problem. Jeremy, a 25-year-old who has been . homeless for three years has come up with a homemade solution.

'And there‚Äôs . meditations that you can do to heat yourself up. Hot thoughts. Like . summer, or fire, anything that‚Äôs hot, you know what I'm saying? And it . works.' The expanding cold air brought snow to parts of Pennsylvania, New York and New England yesterday and a second storm has the potential to powder the major east coast cities at the weekend . Long haul: Zuni Tikka, 37 helps fortify her makeshift tent in Zuccotti Park as cold wet weather moves in. She has been part of Occupy Wall Street since the day it began on September 17th .

British taxpayers could be used to fund a group of Ethiopian paramilitaries who stand accused of murder, rape and torture. The Department for International Development will dole out up to ¬£15 million in foreign aid to train security forces in Ogaden, a Somali region within Ethiopia. But human rights groups have warned that the money could fall into the hands of a thuggish security force that has been accused of executions and other crimes. Official documents invite bids to train security forces as part of the five-year ¬øpeace building¬ø programme in the war torn country. A girl is pictured in front of a rusted old Russian tank lying in a field near Aksum, Ethiopia . A document calls for tenders to train security forces as part of the five-year ‚Äòpeace building‚Äô programme.¬† The Ethiopian government has relied on a violent ‚Äòspecial police‚Äô force to carry out its counter-insurgency in the area and there are fears that the UK is poised to engage with them. Officials even spell out to any interested parties the ‚Äòreputational risks of working alongside actors frequently cited in human rights violation allegations‚Äô. The ‚Äòspecial police‚Äô known as Liyu have been accused of carrying out executions, rape, torture and raizing villages to the ground. It is also claimed that they carried out a mock execution of a Swedish journalist jailed in Ethiopia in 2011. Campaigners warn human rights abuses committed by the special police in Ethiopia are widespread . The Department for International Development insisted that ‚Äònot a penny‚Äô of money would go to the force and that the tender was for NGOs and private companies to improve security. International Development Secretary Justine Greening also met with Ethiopia‚Äôs foreign minister to discuss human rights abuses on Thursday. Ethiopia receives more than any other country in foreign aid from British taxpayers, some ¬£390 million a year. It is seen as an ally against Islamic militancy in east Africa. DfID documents for the tender say the work will be for the ‚Äòsecurity and justice component‚Äô for Ethiopia‚Äôs Somali region‚Äô to ‚Äòbuild a more peaceful and inclusive Somali region‚Äô. It added: ‚ÄòThe primary recipients of the services will be DfID for the design element and for the implementation of the regional government of the . Somali Regional State, specifically state and non-state security and justice service providers.‚Äô ‚ÄòThe peace and development programme will be delivered in partnership with NGOs and UN organisations and no funding will go through the government of Ethiopia.‚Äô But a Human Rights Watch report warns of the abuses meted out by the Liyu police, who it describes as a ‚Äòforce of some 10,000 -14,000 young Somalis mostly recruited from within the conflict zone (aka the Ogaden sub-region) using recruitment methods similar to those of insurgent groups.‚Äô International Development Secretary Justine Greening has met met with Ethiopia¬øs foreign minister to discuss human rights abuses . ‚ÄòTraining is minimal and loyalty within the force closely linked to personalities in leadership positions, of whom the president is paramount. Human rights abuses committed by the special police are believed to be more widespread and severe than those committed during the military campaign. ‚ÄòHowever, having a Somali paramilitary force lead operations in the region is convenient for the federal government who have been able to frame the conflict as internal regional politics rather than a government-led crackdown.‚Äô Amnesty International‚Äôs Ethiopia researcher, Claire Beston, told the Guardian newspaper which unearthed the tender documents that any engagement with the paramilitaries was highly concerning. She said: ‚ÄòThere have been repeated allegations against the Liyu police of extrajudicial killings, rape, torture and other violations including destruction of villages and there is no doubt that the special police have become a significant source of fear in the region.‚Äô A DFID spokesman said: ‚ÄòNot a penny of British money will go to the Liyu police force.¬† Reforming the Special Police is critical for achieving a safe and secure Somali Region and, following a request from Human Rights Watch, we are discussing with UN partners how we might work together to improve the Police‚Äôs human rights record. He added: ‚ÄòThe peace and development programme will bring safety, security and justice, as well as healthcare, water and education, to hundreds of thousands of people in the Somali region of Ethiopia. The safety and justice part of this programme will boost personal safety and the quality and reach of justice services, particularly for women and girls.‚Äô","Department for International Development offers ¬£15million in aid to train security forces .

Google could be facing two major hurdles as regulators in France and the US are believed to be preparing to hit out at the search giant. The French data protection regulator, CNIL, will order the web giant to 'unravel'¬† data on users it pooled together from all of its products in March. In the US, it has been reported that staff members at the Federal Trade . Commission are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust . lawsuit against the search giant. A double pronged attack: Google is expected to be told to 'unravel' the information pools on its users - as the US Federal Trade Commission is believed to be considering launching a massive antitrust suit . According to The Guardian, the French request relates to Google mixing information about how users behave on most of the firm's services, including Gmail and YouTube, to create a 'master profile' for each individual. The move was originally designed to help tailor advertising to individuals' interests. When it was revealed, it was heavily criticised and prompted an investigation by CNIL on behalf of privacy watchdogs across Europe -¬† the findings of which are due to be announced tomorrow. Google said the move was aimed to 'streamline and simplify' its privacy policies. However, users were only given the options of either accepting the new privacy policy, or shutting down their Google accounts. CNIL is known as one of Europe's more . aggressive data protection authorities and is expected to order Google . to separate out the data again. Bradley Shears, a US-based lawyer, told the Guardian it could lead to global problems. 'The EU's decision may create a domino effect and lead regulators in the US and other parts of the world to impose similar restrictions on Google's ability to intermingle and monetise user data,' he told the paper. However, Google could argue that the changes it made were technically irreversible, potentially sparking a fresh battle with European regulators. The firm has been in negotiations with the European Commission for several months solutions to its alleged anti-competitive behaviour by promoting its own products ahead of rivals' in search results. The search giant has faced repeated questions over its privacy and competition policies . The news comes as Federal regulators in the US as believed to be moving closer to suing Google over allegations that the company has abused its dominance of Internet search to stifle competition and drive up online advertising prices. Several news outlets reported that staff members at the Federal Trade Commission are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust lawsuit against the search giant. A majority of the five FTC commissioners would have to approve a suit before legal action could proceed. The reports from The New York Times, Bloomberg News and Reuters cited unnamed people briefed on the FTC's investigation. FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan declined to comment. The agency has been investigating Google's business practices. The probe was triggered by complaints that Google Inc. has been highlighting its peripheral services in its influential search results and relegating offerings from its rivals to the back pages. The FTC also has been looking into whether Google has rigged its results in a way that has prodded websites to pay more to promote their services through Google's advertising network. In a statement Friday, Google said, 'We are happy to answer any questions that regulators have about our business.'

"By . Simon Walters . PUBLISHED: . 18:30 EST, 10 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 10 November 2012 . Celebrating: Baroness Sayeeda Warsi calls for Britons of all religions to join in each others' celebrations . Whoever chose Baroness Warsi‚Äôs study when she was moved to the Foreign Office in the Cabinet reshuffle two months ago must have had a keen sense of history. Of all the rooms they could have given her, they chose one in the part of the FO still known as the old India Office. It was from here that the British ruled India, including the Warsi family‚Äôs native Pakistan before it became independent. Her ministerial study is directly opposite the magnificent centrepiece of the India Office, the marble-floored Durbar Court with its three storeys of doric, ionic and corinthian columns. Built when Queen Victoria was on the throne, it was modelled on Indian durbars ‚Äì courts where native princes held receptions for visiting British dignitaries at the height of the Raj. When I started our interview at the India Office by admiring Durbar Court, Sayeeda Warsi winced at my clunking Estuary English ‚Äòder-baah‚Äô pronunciation of the word. ‚ÄòIt is drrr-ba,‚Äô she said, lending an exotic musical flourish to the prolonged ‚Äòdrrr‚Äô and clipped ‚Äòba‚Äô. I could almost hear sitars in the background. Born in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, the second of five daughters of Pakistani immigrants, she had a successful career in the law before being made a Tory peer. She defies all stereotypes. She is as Eastern and refined as the Durbar Court, yet as down-to-earth and homely as Yorkshire pudding. She calls herself a working-class Northern mum, yet sends her children to private school. Her accent is half Pakistani and half Yorkshire, and she is fiercely proud of both. After being appointed Britain‚Äôs first woman Muslim Cabinet Minister in 2010, Warsi came close to being humiliated when David Cameron moved her out of her job as Tory chairman in the September reshuffle. Unnamed Conservative MPs ran a whispering campaign against her, claiming she wasn‚Äôt up to it and had been given the post only because the Prime Minister was desperate to break up the serried ranks of white and overwhelmingly male Tory faces around the Cabinet table. Even more wounding, it was alleged . that her brash successor as chairman, Grant Shapps, ran a successful . campaign to grab the post from her. Certainly, . she has shed no tears over Shapps‚Äôs abrupt fall from grace following . bizarre disclosures that he used an alter ego, Michael Green, in a . parallel career as a downmarket internet entrepreneur. When I mentioned Shapps‚Äôs troubles, a beatific smile spread across her face. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs . had a real baptism of fire, it‚Äôs been awful,‚Äô she said, archly. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs . had the grief after a month that I had after a year.‚Äô Ouch. Fighting talk: Baroness Warsi in deep conversation with Mail On Sunday's political editor Simon Walters at the Foreign Office . Shapps isn‚Äôt the only one to discover how Warsi fights like a tigress. When Cameron asked her to move to a more junior role at the FO, she faced being stripped of her Cabinet place. Warsi had other ideas. She made three demands: a new title, that of Senior Minister of State, adding the ‚Äòsenior‚Äô to signal she was Foreign Secretary William Hague‚Äôs deputy, at least in name; the retention of her Cabinet seat; and the additional role of Minister for Faith and Communities, Whitehall jargon for Race Relations Minister. She got all three. Only . the canniest of politicians get to the top of ethnic politics in . Britain. Warsi is no exception. She is barely 5ft tall, yet her warmth . and presence more than fill her palatial office, with its towering 30ft . ceiling. With Conservative . support among black and Asian voters pathetically low, Cameron could . hardly risk having a woman ‚Äì and a Muslim to boot ‚Äì walking out on him. And . which white Tory could possibly tackle thorny issues, such as the . grooming of vulnerable young white girls by Pakistani men in Northern . towns like Rochdale, with her courage and credibility? More than 800,000 schoolchildren ‚Äì one¬† in eight ‚Äì do not¬† speak English as their mother tongue. Critics say schools‚Äô resources are being stretched as heads are forced to recruit foreign language assistants to help migrant children. Some 240 different languages are spoken in England‚Äôs schools including Punjabi, Baroness Warsi‚Äôs native Urdu, Bengali, Somali and Polish. In some schools, more than 50 languages are spoken. Taxpayers foot an annual ¬£140‚Äâmillion bill for translation services, including ¬£64,000 a day in the NHS ‚Äì a 17 per cent rise since 2007. NHS trusts translate pamphlets into 120 different languages. Many public bodies provide translations but the legal obligation to do so is not clear. The Human Rights Act only requires translations if someone is arrested or charged with a crime, while the Race Relations Act says all parts of the community should have access to services. ‚ÄòA small minority of Pakistani, Afghani and Bangladeshi men think Asian women are second-class citizens and white girls are third-class citizens,‚Äô Warsi told me. When we met last week, she had just arrived back from a whirlwind trip to Pakistan in her role as Foreign Office Minister for the region. But we have met to talk about her domestic ministerial role, that of Minister for Faith and the Communities. In a wide-ranging interview on the eve of a speech on integration, she insisted there was no contradiction between being a devout Muslim and celebrating Christmas. ‚ÄòBeing brought up ‚Äî before the politically correct brigade got going ‚Äî on harvest festivals, maypoles, Nativity plays, Christmas carols and the Lord‚Äôs Prayer, made me much more sure about my own identity,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt feel it was all watered down to the lowest common denominator.‚Äô Baroness Warsi fondly recalled how she and her four sisters persuaded their father, Safdar, and mother, Hafeeza, to celebrate Christmas ‚Äì mainly as an excuse to get presents from Santa Claus. ‚ÄòOur house was small and because Mum and Dad took out the chimney-breast, like everyone was doing in the North in those days, we thought Santa couldn‚Äôt come to our house ‚Äì so my sister left the back door unlocked. ‚ÄòHe still didn‚Äôt arrive! My dad said ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do Christmas,‚Äù so one of my sisters said to him, ‚ÄúDecember 25 is the birthday of Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan. He is really important.‚Äù‚Äâ‚Äô Warsi bursts into laughter at the memory. ‚ÄòWe introduced turkey, crackers, hats, a tree and tinsel. It became more and more Christmassy every year.‚Äô Did she do turkey with all the trimmings? ‚ÄòI have spiced turkey!‚Äô Warsi loves Christmas carols ‚Äì her . favourite is Good King Wenceslas. And while retaining her Muslim faith, . she has continued the Christmas tradition with her own children, . especially 14-year-old daughter Aamna. ‚ÄòEvery Christmas, she just had to be Mary,‚Äô she grins. In . her first Christmas as Conservative Party chairman, Warsi was horrified . to discover the proposed official chairman‚Äôs card had no mention of . Christianity ‚Äì so she binned it and replaced it with a ‚Äòproper . traditional card, with Merry Christmas on it‚Äô. She added defiantly: ‚ÄòIt took the confidence of a British Muslim to do that.‚Äô And she wants other ethnic minorities to follow her lead. ‚ÄòWhy not? White people celebrate Diwali and Eid. And we all enjoy Bonfire Night.‚Äô Embracing celebrations: Baroness Sayeda Warsi's daughter Aamna, now 14, celebrating Christmas aged 4 . She is equally determined to make more significant changes to improve integration, including getting rid of classroom assistants used to help children who cannot speak English. And Warsi says the proliferation of multilingual forms available for non-English speakers at hospitals, welfare offices and elsewhere merely encourages people not to bother to learn English and hinders their chances of integrating and getting good jobs. She takes the same no-nonsense approach to other issues, such as drugs. Wary of treading on ethnic toes, Home Secretary Theresa May has not responded to calls to ban the legal plant-based drug khat, which is used mainly by minorities. But not blunt Warsi. ‚ÄòI have been pushing the Home Secretary to get on with it. We cannot say, ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs Somalian and Ethiopian boys who take this, it‚Äôs part of their recreational activity, hey-ho, we will just let them take it.‚Äù We would not legitimise marijuana to please the Rasta community, so why do that with khat?‚Äô Are you listening, Theresa? With only six weeks to go before Christmas, I could not resist asking Warsi if she had drawn up her Christmas card list. Would she be sending one to Grant Shapps ‚Äì or Michael Green perhaps? ‚ÄòI‚Äôll send him a Christmas card addressed to the chairman of the Conservative Party,‚Äô she replied. And the twinkle in her eye could illuminate an entire Christmas tree. By Mail On Sunday Comment . What Baroness Warsi says is brave, creditable and straightforwardly good. Her suggestions would be wise whoever made them, but the fact that a British Muslim of Asian ancestry has said these things is important and heartening. For far too long our official and political classes have, in practice, supported a well-intentioned but disastrous multiculturalism which has encouraged some communities to turn in on themselves. No melting pot can function unless it is heated by the warmth of human contact ‚Äì above all, by¬† a shared language but also, as Sayeeda Warsi urges, by as much shared culture as possible. The idea that Muslims should celebrate Christmas is a particularly happy one ‚Äì as it happens, the birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary is recorded in the Koran. If we were less embarrassed about our own faith and culture, many of our newer citizens might well find it easier, not harder, to fit in.","Minister for Faith and Communities calls for Britons of all religions to join in festivities .

Fiji is to scrap the public holiday to mark The Queen‚Äôs birthday because the government there believes she is irrelevant. Officials on the former colony also said the move, which comes 25 years after the country was made a republic, was because the day off was a ‚Äòburden‚Äô for the country. The Queen‚Äôs likeness had already been removed from Fijian coins and has been replaced with images of local flora and fauna. Queen no more: Former colony Fiji has decided to scrap The Queen's birthday public holiday because the government believes it to be irrelevant . Fijians will now only have nine public holidays a year from 2013. The Queen‚Äôs birthday had been celebrated early in June as opposed to her real birthday on April 21 and was particularly valued by low paid workers as a chance to take a break and be with their families. Jone Usamate, a spokesman for the Labour Ministry in the capital, Suva, said: ‚ÄòThe Queen‚Äôs birthday‚Äôs importance disappeared from Fiji when we became a republic and now our status is an independent nation. Bankrolled: The Queen's head used to appear on Fijian notes and coins but was replaced last year with new designs featuring native flora and fauna . No importance: While The Queen drew huge patriotic crowds here for the Jubilee, in Fiji she holds no relevance since the country became a republic, officials say . ‚ÄòThere is a focus on more productivity and growth, so as a result the decision was made to cut down on the number of holidays in Fiji, as holidays can be a burden on business and government.‚Äô Unrest: Fiji has undergone a period of unrest and in 2006 the military led by now Fijian leader Voreqe Bainimarama ousted the government .

Fiji has undergone a period of unrest in recent years and in 2006 the military ousted the government which its commanders had installed in 2000 in the last such upheaval. In 2009 Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations, a move supported by Britain, because of its failure to hold elections, which it still has not done today.

"SITCOMS can't get over their first love . Cheryl Cole and Lauren Goodger revealed they will always love first partners . By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 05:03 EST, 8 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:46 EST, 8 October 2012 . A new group of women dubbed the SITCOMs (single in twenties, clinging on to memories) is becoming the fastest growing group looking for love online. They might be beautiful, have successful careers and seem like the perfect catch for any man - but they go quickly from one relationship to the next in the elusive search for The One. And the reason they can‚Äôt find the perfect partner is because they just cannot get over the big love of their lives. The new generation of women, known as SITCOMs, are looking for love online in a quest to find 'The One' The SITCOM tag is particularly pertinent because, observers say, these women's love lives resemble those that make up the meat of a television situation comedy. A new survey asked female and male members of a dating site the reasons why they haven‚Äôt found the right partner. The most popular answer was that the people they meet online do not match up to a previous lover. A total of 41 per cent of women and 39 percent of men polled said they still had feelings for an ex-lover and this made it difficult to commit to a new partner. Other commitments were cited as reasons love had not blossomed, with 24 per cent of women polled saying they were too busy at work, and a further 29 per cent saying they didn‚Äôt like meeting new people in bars and clubs. Sadly for almost a third or men and women a big reason for not finding new love was not having enough friends to help them mix with new people. Nikki Howarth, 26, is typical of the new generation of SITCOMs. Both Cheryl Cole and Lauren Goodger have spoken out about how they will always love their first partners . She‚Äôs blonde, glamorous and earns ¬£300,000 a year running her own party planning business, Eloquent Events, in Nottingham. Yet she has been dating online for a year on MissTravel.com and its sister site SeekingArrangement.com. She said: 'I was in a very serious relationship for a long time before I started dating online. 'It ended badly - he was cheating on me with another woman - but the truth is that I have not properly got over him. 'Every time I date a new man, I do compare them with my ex - both in the way they look and how we connect emotionally. Nikki Howarth, 26, is typical of the new generation of SITCOMs . 'I . am always looking for the same electricity that I shared with my ex and . I do tend to end relationships if they don‚Äôt live up to the one I had . before. 'Why settle for second best? I guess I am a classic SITCOM. 'All my girlfriends are the same - we all look back on past lovers and try to find someone who will match them. 'It is not the healthiest way to find love - but we just can‚Äôt help it.' Ex-Towie star Lauren Goodger, 25, split from the love of her life Mark Wright last year after a decade-long romance. Since then she has never been able to settle down with another man - most recently parting acrimoniously with her former TOWIE co-star Tom Pearce, 21.

Lucky in love: Elizabeth Green, the sister of Topshop tycoon Sir Philip, has written the autobiography of soul singer Oscar Davis after meeting him on a dating website .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:58 EST, 30 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:58 EST, 30 December 2012 . Holiday sales this year have been the weakest since 2008 as analysts fear that without a driving 'consumer engine' the economy may stagnate. The season's poor profits are expected to reverberate throughout the economy with stores saddled with excess merchandise, forcing them to slash prices and accept razor-thin profit margins. Demand will soften for goods up and down the supply chain, leading eventually to a decline in orders for factory goods and weaker manufacturing. Slowdown: Holiday spending has been at its lowest since 2008, financial analysts warned which could have a knock-on effect on the economy . However there are plenty of reasons to believe that these fears are overblown, some market-watchers argue. Auto sales are strong, as are some measures of consumer sentiment. Home values are rising, leaving fewer Americans on the brink of foreclosure and helping many feel more financially secure. Above all, they point out, there is nothing permanent about the 'fiscal cliff', a set of tax hikes and spending cuts that will automatically take effect at the beginning of 2013 if lawmakers are unable to reach a deal to avert it. When the fiscal issue is addressed and demand bounces back, beaten-down retail stocks may turn out to be this year's best after-Christmas bargain. 'There may be some caution ahead of the fiscal cliff' because of uncertainty about tax rates, 'but it's more of a road bump than any fundamental weakness,' says David Kelly, chief global strategist for JP Morgan Funds. He notes that a daily tracker of consumer sentiment, the Rasmussen Consumer Index, rose Friday to 98.9, the highest level measured since January 2008. Other measures of consumer sentiment appear weaker, but Kelly believes the Rasmussen data is more reliable because it is updated daily. Most other indices rely on monthly surveys. Black Friday revisited: Shoppers headed into the stores as early as 6am the day after Thanksgiving (pictured), and retailers were hoping for the same kind of turn out today . The fiscal cliff isn't the only reason consumers slowed down in November and December. Americans were buffeted by a series of events that made them more likely to stay home. Superstorm Sandy caused steep holiday sales declines in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic that made the national picture appear far weaker. The presidential election distracted people in November, the Newtown massacre in December. And the rising din about Washington's current budget impasse left many people unsure what their 2013 household budgets will look like. The outcome: Holiday sales of electronics, clothing, jewelry and home goods in the two months before Christmas increased just 0.7 percent compared with last year, according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks holiday spending across all payment methods. That's the weakest holiday performance since 2008, when sales dropped several percent as the cresting financial crisis pushed the economy into a deep recession. For many, the early results were a worrisome sign of things to come. Jeff Sica, president and chief investment officer of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown, New Jersey, called the retail sales result 'onerous' and 'a negative overhang on the market'. Devastating blow: The effects of Superstorm Sandy, seen here in Tom's River, New Jersey, had a knock-on effect on the U.S. economy . Still, the nation's largest retail trade group, the National Retail Federation, is sticking to its forecast that total sales for November and December will be up 4.1 per cent from last year. A clearer picture will emerge next week as retailers like Macy's and Target report monthly sales. That didn't keep investors from reacting hastily to the grim early data. Retail stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 5.4 per cent this month, while the broader index declined only 1 per cent. Computer and electronics retailers fared the worst, sinking 10.3 percent. Not so fast, says Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist with ING Investment Management in New York. She favors the consumer discretionary sector, represented in the S&P 500 by Home Depot, Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp. and Ford Motor Co., among others. 'The consumer has shown surprising resilience throughout this tepid recovery and we believe will continue to do so,' Cavanaugh says. The housing turnaround 'will further aid consumer and consumer confidence'. Sales of new homes rose in November to the fastest pace in two and a half years, the government said on Thursday. The National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index also rose last month to its highest level in two and a half years. Consumer spending is a critical indicator of economic activity. It accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy, so a true slowdown could have a painful ripple effect. That's especially true in the final two months of the year, which contribute as much as 40 per cent of annual sales for many retailers. Some analysts are warning that the pain for retailers has only just begun. Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst at NBG Productions, says revenue results and fourth-quarter earnings forecasts, due out early next month, pose another threat to retail stocks. Sozzi recommends betting against some weaker brands, including teen apparel chain Aeropostale. Assuming stocks continue to sink because of weak guidance and 'general market angst,' Sozzi said in a note to clients on Friday, 'the moment to potentially entertain this sector from a long perspective will be sometime before earnings season begins in mid-February'. According to Kelly and other market bulls, consumers haven't meaningfully slowed their spending. They're merely holding off as they wait for lawmakers to craft a deal that would prevent some of the scheduled tax increases. 'There's a difference between confidence and spending attitudes,' Kelly says. 'People are generally feeling more confident because home prices are going up.' Kelly and others believe that a deal on the fiscal cliff is all but inevitable - eventually. He acknowledges that the waiting could be painful for consumers, retailers and most other businesses, but says: 'If we don't get a fiscal cliff deal, then we'll wait and get a fiscal cliff deal.' Analysts who doubt that spending will bounce back quite so quickly argue that consumers are still paying down debt and have less interest in shopping sprees, in part because median incomes are falling. Despite the stronger housing market and other positive signs, 'they're going to take the opportunity to retrench, rather than buy stuff'. says Derrick Irwin, portfolio manager for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds. Peter Tchir, manager of the hedge fund TF Market Advisors, says consumers may be shopping less because economic turbulence has helped people reassess the value of what they consume. 'We've overconsumed for so long ... how much do you really need to add?' he says. 'To some extent, it's healthy for Americans to live within their means. But clearly, this week, it's not great for retail stocks.'","Superstorm Sandy caused steep declines in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic .

Many Venezuelans had hoped Chavez's body would be placed on permanent display like those of Vladimir Lenin, Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong. It was to have been put . on display at a military museum on a hill a mile from the presidential . palace, where it was to have been transferred on Friday.

Display: President Chavez's body was still lying in state at a military academy yesterday afternoon . Respects: A Venezuelan woman clasps a Hugo Chavez doll as she look down on the body of the late president lying in state . 'The decision, or really the proposal more than a decision, was made as a product of love.'

Colombian embalmer, Camilo . Jaramillo said: 'What I really thought was odd, and what raised a lot of questions, is that they were putting him on display in vigil. Indeed, the body was still on display yesterday at the military academy where it has lain in state for a week. The idea of placing Chavez on permanent display, las Maduro said when he announced it, was influenced by visiting leaders, said Maduro. He did not give names but Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia, Jose Mujica of Uruguay and Cristina Fernandez of Argentina all arrived in Venezuela the day after Chavez died. Maduro said that regardless of what authorities decided to do with the body 'we will have our comandante open so that our people can accompany him permanently.' 'His place of Christian rest will be a most beautiful place, it is already a most beautiful place,"" he added. However Mr Jaramillo, had one theory as to why the government had apparently changed its mind on embalming. In several videos recorded before his death, Chavez is seen saying he wishes to be buried in Sabaneta, his hometown. He didn't want to be embalmed,' said Mr Jaramillo. 'Perhaps they took into account some of his wishes.'","Many Venezuelans hoped Chavez's body would be put on permanent display .

South African Minister of health Aaron Motsoaledi revealed that 28 per cent of the country's schoolgirls were HIV positive . At least 28 per cent of South African schoolgirls are HIV postive compared to just 4 per cent of boys, it has been revealed. The country's health minister Aaron Motsoaledi claimed the statistic 'destroyed his soul' and said action needed to be taken against the 'sugar daddies' targetting young girls. Statistics show 94,000 schoolgirls fell pregnant across the country in 2011 with 77,000 having abortions at public facilities. According to Mr Motsoaledi many of the pregnant girls - who were aged betwen 10 and 14 - tested positive for HIV. Speaking at the National Council of Provinces Carolina, Mpumalanga, yesterday¬† said: 'It is clear that it is not young boys who are sleeping with these girls. 'It is old men. We must take a stand against sugar daddies because they are destroying our children' Out of the country's 52 districts, Mr Motsoaledi said the Gert Sibande district in Mpumalanga had the highest number of HIV-positive people and he said all the men living there should be circumcised to stop the spread of the disease. He added: 'There is also a high number of TB infections ... there is a lot of death and a lot of illness here. 'It is for this reason that we chose the district to be one of the 11 in the country where the National Health Insurance programme will be piloted.' Roughly 10.9 per cent of all South Africans have HIV or Aids according to South African's Human Sciences Research Council. Although the prevelance is higher in women. An earlier study found that in KwaZulu-Natal province 37 per cent of pregnant women were found to be carrying the virus. Last year an investigation in South Africa's rural Eastern Cape revealed how girls as young as 12 were being forced to 'marry' older HIV-positive men because of the myth that having sex with a virgin will cure them of the disease.",Health minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the statistic 'destroyed his soul'

A shadow has fallen over Middle Earth, battle lines have been drawn and a daunting quest to protect the good names of Gandalf and the Hobbits of the Shire is currently underway. But it isn't the dark forces of Sauron or the fiery breath of Smaug the dragon that threatens the peace of J.R.R. Tolkien's mystical land, but the hideous spectre of Lord of the Rings branded fruit machines. The Tolkien estate, which is fiercely protective of the late author's work, is up in arms following the appearance of the gambling machines in Las Vegas casinos. Wrangle: The Estate of J.R.R. Tolkien author of 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' Gollum is locked in a legal battle with Warner Bros, makers of The Lord Of The Rings and the Hobbit films over gambling machines . Threat: The Tolkien estate is unhappy about the appearance of Lord of the Rings-themed gambling machines in Las Vegas casinos . They claim the use of Tolkien's characters to promote gambling is a clear breach of contract and that it damages the good name of Tolkien and the reputation of the books. Last year just days before the November premier of the Hobbit, they sued Warner Bros, In Line Cinema and Saul Zaentz owner of MIddle Earth Enterprises (MeE) which owns worldwide rights to elents of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings for at least $80million (¬£53million) over alleged exploitative . merchandising. Prized: The Tolkien estate is fiercely protective of the late author's work . The lawsuit claims the production of Tolkien based gambling games 'has outraged Tolkien's devoted fan base, causing irreparable harm to Tolkien's legacy and reputation and the valuable goodwill generated by his works.' Tolkien's family contends their merchandising agreement with Warner Bothers extends only to tangible products such as . figurines and clothing and not to electronic rights. But now Warner Brothers have counter sued¬† claiming they have lost out on millions of dollars of revenue as a result of the Tolkien estate preventing from using the characters to the extent they might have wished. But the Tolkien Estate's legal team say this amounts to bullying and that they intend to dismiss Warner Bros's counterclaims. Their US attorney, Bonnie Eskenazi, said: 'The defendants‚Äô amended counterclaims are nothing more than an effort to sue the Tolkiens and HarperCollins for suing them. 'They are entirely without merit and are a classic example of studio ‚Äúbullying tactics.‚Äù 'The Tolkiens and HarperCollins filed this lawsuit in order to force Warner Bros and Zaentz to live within the boundaries of the contract to which they agreed. 'Warner Bros‚Äô and Zaentz‚Äôs amended counterclaims are simply an attempt to punish the Tolkiens and HarperCollins for having the nerve to stand up to the studios and tell them that they can‚Äôt take more rights than were granted to them by contract. Blockbuster: The first part of the Hobbit Trilogy has reportedly already grossed $1bn . 'Luckily, the law protects people like the Tolkiens and HarperCollins from these kinds of intimidation tactics.'The adaption of the Tolkien's novels to the big screen has proved an impressive money-spinner for the Hollywood studio. The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson, earned an estimated $6 billion from . movie tickets, DVDs and merchandise. Money: The Tolkien estate was seeking $80 million from Warner Bros., its New Line subsidiary and producer Saul Zaentz (pictured) And the adaption of Tolkien's first Middle Earth book The Hobbit appears to be set for equally impressive results with the first of that trilogy already pulling in an estimated $1billion. Film fans and critics have accused Warner of being greedy by stretching the Hobbit, which as a book is roughly half the size of a single Lord of the Rings volume, into three films. It is not the first time Warner Bros have become caught up in legal proceedings with the Tolkien estate. Tolkien's . heirs settled a lawsuit over the 'Lord of the Rings' movies for an . undisclosed amount in 2009, allowing production to proceed on 'The . Hobbit'. That lawsuit against New Line Cinema . claimed Tolkien's trust received only an upfront payment of $62,500 for . the three movies before production began but was due 7.5 per cent of the . gross receipts. And last year none other than Gandalf actor Sir Ian McKellen had to step in after MeE demanded a Southampton pub called the Hobbit changed its name. After Sir Ian accused MeE of 'unnecessary pettiness', the company offered the bar a nominal licensing fee to settle the row. Warner Bros has been unavailable for comment.","Warner Bros studio counter sue Tolkien estate following $80m claim .

Apple will be hoping its iPad mini can offer some Christmas cheer after the company's share of the market for tablet computers fell to 50 per cent in the third quarter . Apple still had a solid lead and shipped more iPads worldwide than a year earlier, according to Monday's study by IDC. But with no new tablets out in the third quarter, rival Android devices such as Samsung's Galaxy tablets and Google's Nexus 7 were able to close the gap. The firm also might have seen sales slow amid expectations of a smaller iPad. Tablet wars: Apple's tablet market share fell to 50 per cent in the third quarter - mostly because the company did not release in that three-month period, but could bounce back with the iPad mini . By the numbers: Apple had no new tablets out in the third quarter, and may have seen sales slow amid expectations of a smaller iPad . Apple could regain share in the holiday quarter with last Friday's release of new iPad devices, including the iPad Mini. Apple said on Monday that it sold 3 million iPads of all kinds through the weekend, double the 1.5 million iPads sold in the first three days after Apple launched the third-generation iPad in March and cut the price of the iPad 2. However, the company will face competition from new devices from Amazon, Google and others over the next few weeks. With big brother: The new iPad mini, left, is pictured with the fourth generation iPad - a new version of which features a faster processer . In the July-September period, Apple shipped 14 million devices, up 26 per cent from 11 million a year ago. Its market share fell from 60 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 as the overall tablet market grew by 50 per cent to nearly 28 million. Samsung's market share grew to 18 per cent, from about 7 per cent, as it more than quadrupled the number of tablets shipped to 5.1 million. The quarter saw the release of the Galaxy Note 10.1, a device built for use with a stylus. Amazon.com Inc. was in third with its Kindle Fire, which had a 9 per cent market share. Competition: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Kindle Fire HD 7"" and Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" which is one of the iPad's top competitors . Amazon didn't release a new version until late in the quarter, but it had nothing in the third quarter of 2011 because the Fire wasn't released until last November, after the quarter ended. Amazon managed a 9 per cent worldwide share even though the Fire was available only in the U.S. during the third quarter. No. 4 tablet maker AsusTek Computer Inc., which makes the Nexus 7 for Google Inc., saw its shipments more than triple to 2.4 million. It had a share of 8.6 per cent, up from 3.8 per cent. Future: Hugo Barra, director of product management of Google, shows off Google's new Nexus 7 tablet . 'Competitors are turning up the pressure on market leader Apple,' said Ryan Reith, a program manager for mobile devices at IDC. Amazon and Google will start shipping larger versions of its tablets this month. The Kindle Fire and Nexus 7 both have had screens measuring 7 inches diagonally. Google's Nexus 10 will be 10.1 inches, while Amazon's will be 8.9 inches. By comparison, the regular iPad is 9.7 inches. Samsung is making the larger Nexus tablet, while AsusTek will continue making the 7-inch one.

They call him Radioactive Man, the Japanese farmer who refused to leave his home town despite it being less than six miles away from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. Defiant Naoto Matsumura, 53, is the only remaining inhabitant of the town of Tomioka which was a thriving community of 16,000 people before the tsunami hit two years ago. The rice farmer disobeyed government orders to leave and has stayed on to feed the town's animals including his own 50 cows and two ostriches. Scroll down for video . Radioactive Man: Japanese farmer Naoto Matsumura, is still living in the Fukushima radiation zone two years after the nuclear disaster . Mr Matsumura is permanently exposed to up to 17 times the level of radiation that is considered safe. He put his health at further risk by eating food that had also been exposed to radiation, although he is now surviving on relief supplies delivered from outside and water that has been checked for radiation. When researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency conducted tests, Mr Matsumura was found to have the highest level of radiation in anyone they had tested. He told¬†Vice magazine: 'When I went down and let them look me over, they told me I was the ""champion"". 'But they also told me that I wouldn‚Äôt get sick for 30 or 40 years. I‚Äôll most likely be dead by then anyway, so I couldn‚Äôt care less.' Mr Matsumura is permanently exposed to up to 17 times the level of radiation that is considered safe . Mr Matsumura feeds a calf and pony at his farm in Tomioka, inside the nuclear exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima nuclear plant . A man apart: Mr Matsumura at his home in the town of Tomioka a once-thriving community of 16,000 people . Matsumara, who is a fifth generation rice-farmer, did leave the town for a short while to live with his parents in the south of the country, but after a few days he could not bear the thought of the animals left to fend for themselves so he returned. He added: 'I was scared at first because I knew the radiation had spread everywhere. 'The next thought in my head was that if I stayed too long, I‚Äôd end up with cancer or leukemia. But, the longer I was with the animals, the more I came to see that we were all still healthy and that we would be OK.' As well as the animals on his own farm Mr Matsumura now cares for dozens of former pet dogs and cats left behind when the town was evacuated. He explained: 'Our dogs didn‚Äôt get fed for the first few days. When I did eventually feed them, the neighbors‚Äô dogs started going crazy. 'I went over to check on them and found that they were all still tied up. Everyone in town left thinking they would be back home in a week or so, I guess. From then on, I fed all the cats and dogs every day. Mr Matsumura is the only resident to have stayed on in Tomioka less than six miles from the Fukushima nuclear plant . Companions: Mr Matsumura feeds his two ostriches. He went to live with . his parents for a short time but returned because he could not bear the . thought of the animals being left to fend for themselves . 'They couldn‚Äôt stand the wait, so they‚Äôd all gather around barking up a storm as soon as they heard my truck. Everywhere I went there was always barking. Like, ‚Äòwe‚Äôre thirsty‚Äô or, ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt have any food.‚Äô So I just kept making the rounds.' Among the animals he rescued was a dog that had been trapped inside a cattle barn for a year and a half. It had only survived by eating the flesh of cattle that had starved to death. When Mr Matsumura rescued it in the summer of 2012 most of its fur had fallen out. But thanks to Mr Matsumura's loving care it has made a remarkable recovery and most of its fur has now grown back. Mr Matsumura named him Kiseki, which means 'miracle' in English. Without any humans about many of the town's dogs and cats havegone feral and now live in the forest. Sadly hundreds of head of cattle were left to starve to death inside a nearby barn and despite Mr Matsumura's efforts many of the survivors are severely undernourished. Nevertheless he has pledged to stay on as long and care for them for as long as he can. He said: 'I was born and raised in this town,' he told us. 'When I die, it‚Äôs going to be in Tomioka.'","Naoto Matsumura is the only remaining inhabitant of the town of Tomioka .

Barclays executive Rich Ricci, who was given a ¬£6million bonus last month, got even richer yesterday after his horse Champagne Fever won the first race of the Cheltenham Festival. The multi-millionaire banker scooped ¬£68,340 prize money after his horse romped home in the William Hill Supreme Novices‚Äô Hurdle ahead of favourite My Tent or Yours. Champagne Fever is one of 11 horses the Barclays head of investment banking has competing in the festival, including the even more provocatively named Fatcatinthehat. The name is believed to be a mocking reference to a 2011 newspaper article about Mr Ricci headlined ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs the fat cat in the hat? The rich world of Rich Ricci.‚Äô Mr Ricci, who was not at Cheltenham yesterday but is expected later in the week, is a hugely divisive figure who helped run the Barclays investment bank while traders bragged about manipulating Libor interest rates, which led to the bank being fined ¬£290 million. Critics see him as the epitome of the aggressive ‚Äòcasino‚Äô culture under former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. Labour MP John Mann denounced the banker‚Äôs appearance at the Cheltenham Festival as an ‚Äòinsult‚Äô to every taxpayer and small business in the country.

The awards were dubbed ‚Äòunjustifiable‚Äô and poorly-timed, as Barclays tries to rebuild its reputation in the wake of the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal. Last December Mr Ricci spearheaded a review of ethics and operations at Barclays aimed at regaining trust after its reputation after the Libor PR catastrophe. As part of it, he imposed what he called a ‚Äòtabloid test‚Äô and wants to outlaw activities that would look bad if they appeared in the newspapers.

Ben Fogle said his wife Marina Hunt had to stop him from jumping out of the window after his drink was apparently spiked with LSD . Ben Fogle was taken to hospital suffering ‚Äòa full on psychotic episode‚Äô after his drink was apparently spiked with the drug LSD. Speaking last night, the TV star revealed his terrified wife and friends locked him in a room for his safety after he tried to jump out of a window until an ambulance came to take him. Fogle, wife Marina and their children were staying at a family friend‚Äôs house in Gloucestershire last Friday when he ‚Äòflipped‚Äô after returning from a country pub. He said: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like using the word, but I was acting like a stereotypical madman. I thought I was doomed, I thought I was going to die. ‚ÄòMy wife and friends kept trying to calm me down as I was threatening to hurt myself. I was 100 per cent out of my normal character.‚Äô He said he ‚Äòall was fine‚Äô when they returned to the house about midnight and estimated he had drunk no more than half a bottle of wine. But after going to settle son Ludo, three, back down, he realised something ‚Äòvery strange‚Äô was happening to him as he attended to Iona, one. He said: ‚ÄòI started feeling hypersensitive and I knew something was wrong. I picked my daughter up and she felt incredibly light, like a grain of rice. ‚ÄòI suddenly had this compulsion to jump through a window. I went back into the bedroom and asked my wife, ‚ÄúAre you feeling OK‚Äù. she said ‚Äúyeah, are you?‚Äù and I said, ‚ÄúLook at me‚Äù. ‚ÄòI was staring at her and then I just flipped and had a full on psychotic episode. I was ranting, marching up and down, hitting walls, trying to jump out of windows. My wife ran out and had to get my friends who had to restrain me.‚Äô They managed to ‚Äòcorral‚Äô him into the living room until a paramedic arrived. ‚ÄòIt was like having an out of body experience,‚Äô said Fogle, 39, who explained that he has never voluntarily taken recreational drugs. ‚ÄòIt was really upsetting because my wife had to see all of this. ‚ÄòThey . had to lock the doors and restrain me from hurting myself. I wanted to . throw myself on a glass table and through a window.‚Äô The couple were staying with friends when he 'flipped' after returning from a country pub. Tests ruled out the episode was due to neurological or psychological reasons . At one point he found himself doing a recreation of a sketch from the Monty Python TV show. ‚ÄòI started doing very strange walks, like the Ministry of Funny Walks. ‚ÄòIt went from scary to comical. I was trying to get into bags.‚Äô Fogle asked to be restrained after a paramedic came. ‚ÄòI wanted them to give me a sedative to make it stop. The paramedic did some tests and knew that I had to go to hospital so an ambulance was called. ‚ÄòBy now the whole experience took a different shift and it went from this aggressive episode into what I‚Äôd call a spacey moment. ‚ÄòIn the ambulance they were saying to my wife he must be on some sort of drugs.‚Äô He said the episode lasted about six hours and he ended up ‚Äòvery emotional and very teary‚Äô on Saturday morning. Fogle spent about 12 hours in A&E. He said the hospital does not do toxicology tests so he could not find out for certain if his drink was spiked. As a result he spent three days having tests on his heart and brain and being seen by psychiatrists. Fogle, pictured with son Ludo, now three, is most angered by the fact that he handled his children while under a 'very psychotic drug' ‚ÄòI‚Äôve spent the last few days genuinely worrying that I was going crazy,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòWhen you go through this and don‚Äôt know why you start questioning your sanity. ‚ÄòBut five doctors have now concluded it was almost certainly drugs and have 100 per cent ruled out that it was neurological or psychological.‚Äô He added: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve always been 100 per cent certain that I was spiked, however unlikely the scenario. ‚ÄòWhy would someone do it? I have no idea. It seems a bit of a coincidence that I was out with my wife and friends and I was the only person targeted.‚Äô¬† He said from what he has been told he is convinced it was the hallucinogenic drug LSD. What most angers Fogle most about the person who did it is that he handled his children while under a ‚Äòvery psychotic drug‚Äô. Fogle has reported the incident to police. He added: ‚ÄòWhat I‚Äôve realised from my experience is that drink spiking is a big thing.‚Äô Fogle, who sprang to fame after appearing in Castaway in 2000, had to postpone a five-week trip to Middle East for a BBC show while the tests were completed. He appealed to the person who spiked his drink to come forward and explain what they had done. ‚ÄòI might stare at you for a while but I would forgive you,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòI just want to know what you put into my drink and into my body.‚Äô","Fogle's wife Marina restrained him after his drink was apparently spiked .

Some are believed to be reapplying this year, but others have taken places at European universities and Ivy League US colleges after being put off by the introduction of ¬£9,000 fees in the UK. The traditional choice: Oxford and Cambridge are the only British institutions still in the top 10 globally but they could miss out to other world-ranking universities . Independent school heads have reported an increased interest in applying abroad by pupils who believe that foreign universities can offer better value for money. Sixth formers are also attracted by incentives such as top class sporting facilities or better opportunities for working overseas after graduation. One in four pupils at the sixth form at Sevenoaks School in Kent have applied to American universities this year. Two students from the school last year rejected offers from Cambridge for Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania. Another turned down an offer to study English at Oxford to go to Yale. Headmistress Katy Ricks told the Sunday Times: ‚ÄòThe interest in American universities has grown strongly here. Brain drain: Top British students are setting their sights on world class universities such as Harvard in Boston . ‚ÄòThe top end of our range are looking globally. ‚ÄòThere are a small group of brilliant students who are choosing between Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge and Oxford, and it is no longer a given that they will choose the British option.‚Äô More pupils are also applying to European universities, where tuition frees are often less than a third of those in the UK. Maastricht University in the Netherlands, which offers degrees taught in English and charges ¬£1,600 in annual fees, said it had seen an 80 per cent rise in the number of UK students in the past year. New international rankings released last week show that UK universities have lost ground on those in the United States and emerging Asian economies. Oxford and Cambridge were the only . British institutions still in the top 10, according to the table . complied by the Times Higher Education supplement based on the academic . reputation of universities across the world.

The paedophile son of actor Ronnie Barker is expected to receive an inheritance of more than ¬£1.4m when he is released from jail in three months. Adam Barker, 44, who was jailed for 12 months on Friday for child porn offences, inherited the money from his parents while he was on the run for eight years. But it is believed that he never received any of the cash as nobody knew where he was hiding when he was living alone in Hungary. Isleworth Crown Court heard how the former bit-part actor had only 'relatively recently' found out about the deaths of his parents. Barker gave himself up at a police station in west London in July after returning to the UK as he had run out of funds. He could be released in three months after serving half his sentence as he has already spent nearly three months on remand. Ronnie Barker who was famed for his roles in TV jail comedy Porridge, Open All Hours and The Two Ronnies left an estate of ¬£300,337 after he died of heart failure aged 76 in October 2005. His will left ¬£275,000 to be split between his three children - giving Adam just over ¬£91,000 - and the rest to his wife Joy. The bulk of his fortune did not feature in his estate as most jointly-held assets pass directly to a spouse. Mrs Barker who lived near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds died aged 78 in January last year, leaving a net estate of ¬£6,520,426 which was split equally between her three children. Adam and his brother Larry, 52, and sister Charlotte, 49, inherited around ¬£1,340,000 from their mother after inheritance tax and other expenses. Charlotte was made executor of her mother's will, responsible for distributing her estate. It is thought that the money due to her younger brother was left in an account waiting for him to claim it. Adam Barker caused his father ‚Äòunquantifiable distress‚Äô after going on the run for eight years to avoid being prosecuted for child porn offences, a judge said. He missed both his parents‚Äô funerals as he hid in Hungary. The 44-year-old‚Äôs whereabouts remained a mystery until he finally returned home to face justice earlier this year after his funds dried up. He was jailed for a year after admitting possessing 1,675 indecent images of children at his home, including child rape. Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‚ÄòYour offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.‚Äô Referring to a letter written by Barker‚Äôs sister to the court, she said it was clear his decision to flee ‚Äòcaused an unquantifiable distress to your family, and that must of course remain on your conscience. 'But for the court‚Äôs processes it means you prevented justice taking its course‚Äô. Barker was arrested in 2003 as part of Operation Ore after police traced credit card payments he made for some of the images. During a dawn raid on his home in Ealing, West London, he told a detective examining his computer:¬† ‚ÄòYou‚Äôd better take it otherwise it would a dereliction of your duty.‚Äô Barker, who appeared in the ITV detective series Wycliffe and had small parts in Monarch of the Glen, Casualty and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, was released on bail while officers liaised with prosecutors about what charges to bring. Family ties: Adam Barker (left) with his famous father (right) and mother in 1997. Both of his parents have since died . Actor: Adam Barker has appeared in TV programmes including Wycliffe, pictured as DS Ian Potter, far right, Monarch Of The Glen and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies . But he vanished leaving a note for . his parents, which read: ‚ÄòDear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police . came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my . computer. I was arrested. ‚ÄòI . must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You . must understand that I won‚Äôt be able to contact you for quite some . time.‚Äô Ravinder Johal, . prosecuting, told Isleworth Crown Court: ‚ÄòWhat we know now is that Mr . Barker fled to Hungary where he stayed for eight years, returning in . July when it appears that he ran out of funds.‚Äô An artist impression of a much thinner Adam Barker in July, during his first appearance in court .

Detectives were waiting to question his son at the memorial service held at Westminster Abbey, but he did not turn up. He also missed the funeral of his mother Joy, who died aged 78 after a short illness last January. It remains unclear whether he will collect it. Simon Ray, defending, said Barker had not been aware of their deaths until recently. ‚ÄòThis is a source of sorrow and grief for him. He is profoundly sorry for the fact that is caused distress for his family. He accepts that what he did was wholly wrong.‚Äô Barker claims that he did not own a computer and never viewed child pornography during his time in Budapest. However, the judge said: ‚ÄòNobody is in a position to know what he was up to in Hungary.‚Äô Barker pleaded guilty to 20 counts of child porn between January 1999 and June 2003.Of the 1,675 images and videos in his possession, 92 were graded level four ‚Äì the second highest category.

Intrusive: Judge Anthony Thornton condemned Haringey council for its heavy-handed approach to the abuse case . A mother told of her nightmare yesterday after being secretly . investigated for child abuse by social workers who received a¬† single, . anonymous letter. The woman was left ‚Äòterrified‚Äô that her six-year-old daughter would be . removed in the probe by Haringey Council ‚Äì the authority at the centre . of the Baby P scandal. After winning a ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô case yesterday, she also spoke of her anger . that the local authority had sought to avoid being named in the affair . to prevent further public embarrassment. Officials had obtained three . mobile numbers and a landline phone number for the family after . contacting the girl‚Äôs school without her parents‚Äô knowledge. The mother ‚Äì who works as a social . worker ‚Äì said she was ‚Äòhorrified‚Äô when a student social worker later . contacted the couple to belatedly reveal they were investigating . allegations of mistreatment. Yesterday a High Court judge condemned . Haringey for its ‚Äòknee-jerk reaction‚Äô to the unsigned letter, which was . riddled with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. This included approaching the child‚Äôs GP . and her school to ask for any signs of ‚Äòemotional and physical abuse‚Äô of . the child before they had spoken to her parents. Pay out: The parents of a young girl have won High Court damages over an 'unlawful' decision by social services to investigate whether their child was being ill-treated or was at risk of suffering significant harm . Judge Anthony Thornton said the child was never at risk of harm from her middle class parents, who had never been in trouble with police or had previous contact with social services. He quashed the ‚Äòunlawful‚Äô decision to start the investigation and ordered the council to pay ¬£2,000 compensation to the couple and legal costs expected to run to tens of thousands of pounds. After the hearing, the girl‚Äôs mother urged the Government to step in to . sort out Haringey‚Äôs beleaguered child protection department. She . expressed fears that while the council squandered taxpayers‚Äô cash . investigating spurious complaints it risked overlooking genuine cases. She said: ‚ÄòThis has been a dreadful ordeal that has taken a huge . emotional and financial strain on my family. Although I knew it was . groundless, I was terrified they would take my child away. ‚ÄòWe were accused of smacking our child. As it happens, we don‚Äôt smack, . but if the council starts investigating all parents who occasionally . smack their child to discipline them, they would end up looking at 90 . per cent of families in the borough.‚Äô The woman and her partner are both experienced social workers and so knew the council‚Äôs reaction was excessive. Decision: A judge ruled there was no basis on which the London Borough of Haringey's social workers should have started the inquiry. Haringey council building is pictured .

They brought a legal challenge to the council‚Äôs decision to investigate them under Section 47 of the 1989 Children Act, which the judge described as an ‚Äòintrusive‚Äô assessment of a child and her parents to determine if she was being harmed.

Sandra Cole, aged 68, who has arthritis and a heart problem, walked the five miles to her home in Tile Hill, Coventry, after a row with a bus driver. The female bus driver confiscated her pass after telling her it was too worn to check her ID, then ordered her off the bus. The retired nurse had to walk home because she did not have enough money to pay for another bus ticket. After her son lodged a complaint about the 'heartless' way she was treated, the bus company Stagecoach apologised and said she should have been allowed to continue her journey. Mrs Cole, a full-time carer for her disabled husband Hugh, says she felt humiliated by the incident which happened as she tried to board the X17 bus near Crackley Lane on the outskirts of Kenilworth. Sandra Cole, who has arthritis and a heart problem, endured a three-hour trek to her home in Tile Hill, Coventry from where she was ordered off the bus in Crackley Lane .

Mrs Cole says she had no choice but to walk the five mile route home through Crackley Woods, Cannon Hill, and Canley. It was nearly three hours before she arrived home, which she says was distressing knowing her wheelchair-bound husband was probably in need of her help. '[The driver] was heartless...she said it wasn‚Äôt her problem when I told her I‚Äôd have to walk five miles. It was so humiliating. I felt intimidated, like I‚Äôd been abandoned.' Mrs Cole added that she had used the pass for three years without any problems and had used it earlier that day. 'I can't let it happen again. What if she does this to someone more frail than me? Someone who can barely walk, or a child?' Her son Alastair, 34, a teacher in London, was so incensed by the way his mother was treated he lodged an immediate complaint with Stagecoach, and received an apology from the company three days later. A Stagecoach boss confirmed it was company policy to remove a pass if the photo and name were no longer visible. A Stagecoach spokesman said: 'We are very sorry to hear of Mrs Cole‚Äôs experience in using our bus service.

Peeping Tom: Declan Crosbie was given a community order after he pleaded guilty to attempting to spy on the Chinese Olympic swimming team in a women's changing room . A Peeping Tom was spared jail by a lenient judge today after being caught trying to spy on members of the Chinese Olympic swimming team at a training pool. Declan Crosbie, 25, was caught peering over the top of cubicles as members of the team were getting changed at a sports centre in Leeds. But a judge at Leeds Crown Court said he thought the public would be better protected from Crosbie by a community order rather than sending him to prison because it would guarantee he would go on a sex offenders‚Äô treatment programme. A previous hearing heard how a woman reported seeing Crosbie enter the changing room alongside members of the Chinese team, who were training at the pool ahead of the London 2012 Olympics. She made made a complaint after spotting him looking over the top of cubicles while they were changing. When staff at the centre went to find the 25-year-old, he hid in a cubicle and tried to answer them in a woman‚Äôs voice. He then came out and begged staff not to call the police before running away. Crosbie, from Lea Farm Place, Leeds, later handed himself in to police and pleaded guilty last month to trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence. The defendant was jailed for three years . in 2009 after trespassing in a private home and he was found standing . over a sleeping student, whose trousers had been pulled down. He also has convictions for voyeurism in 2005 and 2006. The court was told Crosbie was already on the sex offenders‚Äô register. The Edge training facility at Leeds University was being used for training by the Chinese Olympic swimming team, but Declan Crosbie was trying to spy on them getting changed . Today, the Recorder of Leeds, Judge . Peter Collier QC, said the 2009 jail sentence was passed in the hope . Crosbie would be sent on a treatment course but it never happened. Peter Collier QC said sparing Crosbie from a jail sentence would guarantee he would attend a sex offenders' treatment course . Giving him a three-year community order, Judge Collier said this would guarantee he would attend the course. He . said: 'I‚Äôm satisfied it is on the public interest and long term . interest of better protection of the public that I make a community . order in your case today.' The judge barred him from entering any female changing area or toilet for five years. A judicial source familiar with the case said: ‚ÄòSentencing guidelines allow that in cases of voyeurism, as opposed to someone filming sexual activity and making it public or posting it online, that community orders as opposed to custodial sentences are accepted.

A mother and daughter are lucky to be alive after their washing spontaneously combusted and a fire tore through their home. Nicola Boulton and daughter Claire awoke to the smell of smoke in the early hours of the morning - and firefighters had to rescue them through the bathroom window of their house in Leicester. They were flabbergasted when fire crews revealed that the source of the blaze was a pile of clean tea towels that had burst into flames. Burnt fingers: Claire (left) and Nicola Boulton with the tea towels that went up in flames . Firefighters believe the cloths had retained heat after being taken out of the tumble dryer - and got so hot they burst into flames. Cafe manager Miss Boulton, 19, had brought the tea towels home from work countless times to wash and dry. She said: 'It‚Äôs bizarre. We‚Äôve washed and tumble dried those towels the same way hundreds of times and nothing has ever gone wrong. 'I woke up and I could smell this really strong smell of smoke. I went to my door and looked out and there were clouds of smoke billowing up the stairs. 'I shouted to my mum who was fast asleep, and we ran into the bathroom.' Feeling the heat: The flames from the pile of washing melted a plastic wash basket and set fire to the stool and wall, sending clouds of thick smoke through the house . The pair were rescued shortly after 2am yesterday morning, after 999 operators told them to shut themselves in the bathroom and put wet towels around the door. Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service insisted after the Boultons' fire that although blazes started by spontaneous combustion were unusual, they were not unknown. East Sussex Fire & Rescue Service warned last October of the danger of ‚Äòexploding tea towels‚Äô after the phenomenon struck twice in a single day in Brighton at a restaurant and college. A spokesman said cooking fats or chemicals on tea towels can spontaneously combust after being dried - and advised people to properly air laundry after drying to avoid it happening. Mrs Boulton, 49, said: 'We were struggling to breathe as the smoke was coming in. It was really quite frightening. It doesn‚Äôt seem real now.' After helping them out of the window, firefighters put out the blaze - but could find no obvious source of the fire. After investigating the scene, they realised a pile of recently laundered tea towels had spontaneously combusted. The towels and a plastic washing basket were destroyed in the blaze but, apart from a blackened kitchen wall, the rest of the house was untouched. Fire station manager Steve Smith, said blazes started by spontaneous combustion were unusual but not unknown. He said: 'Due to the configuration of . the materials and the circumstances at the scene, we have determined the . most likely cause was self-heating to a point where ignition occurred. Hot wash: The mother and daughter were lucky to escape with their lives after firefighters were called to their home at around 2am . 'This is not a common phenomenon, but it has occurred and has been widely documented in the past.' Mrs Boulton, a personal banker for Barclays, said: 'It was the most terrifying night of my life. 'I‚Äôd taken the towels out of the dryer before I went to bed at about 9.30pm, and made sure all the plugs and gas hobs were turned off, like I always do. 'My daughter woke me up screaming: ""Mum, there‚Äôs smoke coming up the stairs!"", and our smoke alarm started going off. 'She pulled me into the bathroom and I grabbed my phone, but I was shaking so much I could barely dial 999. The 19-year-old and 49-year-old were helped out of a bathroom window at the rear of the house, pictured . 'We could barely breathe and we had to stand in the bath and lean out of the window to get air. 'The firemen came and helped us out of the window, but as they helped me down the ladder, I heard one firefighter shout to another: ""Bloody hell, get out of there now!"". 'It was terrifying - we were put into an ambulance and taken to hospital, just to be checked over. 'The firemen asked us what had been on top of the stool in the kitchen, and I said, my plastic washing basket with the towels in it. 'I think he was expecting me to say I‚Äôd left a candle burning, or a plug socket overloaded - he was pretty surprised. 'He said that it would have burned very slowly though, so it would have taken a few hours for the fire to take hold. 'I couldn‚Äôt believe doing the washing nearly cost me my house - or worse, my life. 'We‚Äôre very lucky that we were able to get out so quickly, and the firefighters did such a good job containing the fire.'","Clean pile of tea towels set alight after being taken out of tumble drier .

A conservative Jewish university in the heart of New York is in uproar after one of the school‚Äôs four student newspapers published a first-hand account of an Orthodox woman‚Äôs one-night stand. In reaction to the piece, the student council of Yeshiva University pulled funding from The Beacon after the online paper refused to remove it from its website, sparking a campus-wide debate on censorship. The column, called How Do I Even Begin To Explain This, was written by an anonymous 20-year-old Orthodox modern Jewish woman who writes in detail about her one-time Manhattan dalliance . How do I explain? This image accompanied Yeshiva University's essay on an Orthodox woman's account of a one night stand . In the essay, the woman describes her thoughts and feelings as she transforms herself from a self-described ‚ÄòOccasionally-Cute-Modern-Orthodox-Girl‚Äô into a ‚ÄòSexually-Appealing-Secular-Woman.‚Äô ‚ÄòBetween the fumbling, the pain, the pleasure, I convince myself that I‚Äôve learned to make love,‚Äô the woman wrote.

The Beacon co-editors Simi Lampert and Toviah Moldwin met Wednesday with three Yeshiva administrators, as well as the president and secretary of student affairs. Ms Lampert told Fox News that the administrators asked them to remove the column, or at least ‚Äòchange some of the wording in it.‚Äô Controversy: The essay sparked campus-wide debate over censorship; The Beacon lost its funding after refusing to take down the article .

A schoolgirl died following a severe asthma attack after her doctors had to repeatedly remind her to use her inhaler. Chloe Passmore had been treated in hospital twice for her condition but an inquest was told her asthma was sometimes not being 'well controlled.' Last March the schoolgirl - described as a 'beautiful angel' by friends - was in her bedroom when she collapsed with a massive seizure after taking a shower. Chloe Passmore, 12, died from a severe asthma attack after her doctors had to repeatedly remind her to use her inhaler. Chloe had been treated in hospital twice for her condition . An inquest into the death of Chloe Passmore was told that her asthma was sometimes not being 'well controlled' and she had to be reminded to use her inhaler . She was rushed to hospital where doctors battled in vain for nearly an hour to save her. An inquest was told Chloe, from Lancaster, had first been diagnosed with asthma in 2006. She had been to the doctors many times with asthma complaints and was hospitalised twice in 2011 after suffering attacks. She was later given a brown 'preventative' steroid inhaler as well as her usual inhaler which gave immediate relief. But the day before her death last March, she had been off sick from Our Lady‚Äôs Catholic College, Morecambe Road, Lancaster where she was a Year Eight pupil, after feeling breathless during the night. She was still unwell the following day and had returned to her bedroom after taking a shower. Tributes: Headmaster Brendan Conboy said the whole community of Our Lady¬øs School in Lancaster was extremely shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Miss Passmore . The hearing was told Chloe started having an acute asthma attack and her mother Wendy Passmore went upstairs to find her daughter panicking and struggling to breathe. Her inhaler was giving her no relief so an ambulance was called. When the ambulance arrived, medical staff began trying to resuscitate Chloe who was in respiratory arrest. En route to Royal Lancaster Infirmary hospital the crew began to revive her with CPR. But just under an hour after she arrived in the accident and emergency department, and after continuous attempts to revive her, Chloe was pronounced dead. Dr Stefanie Bitetti, consultant paediatric pathologist, said the post-mortem examination revealed evidence of a rare thyroid disease and a problem in the adrenal glands, but these were 'incidental findings' and did not contribute to Chloe‚Äôs death. 'In my opinion, Chloe died as a result of an acute and fatal asthma attack,' said Dr Bitetti. Our Lady's Catholic College, Lancaster, where Chloe was a pupil. Headmaster and teachers have paid tribute to the schoolgirl . Dr Graeme Mechie, GP at Owen Road surgery in Lancaster, confirmed Chloe had been to the doctors many times with asthma complaints and had been given a brown ‚Äòpreventative‚Äô inhaler as well as her usual inhaler which gave immediate relief. Dr Mechie said there had been occasions when Chloe needed to be reminded to keep using her brown inhaler, but added: 'It‚Äôs sometimes quite tough to persuade children to take an inhaler when they don‚Äôt see an immediate benefit.' Recording a verdict of death by natural causes Lancashire deputy coroner Simon Jones, said there was evidence in the past that Chloe‚Äôs asthma was not being 'well controlled.' But he added: 'It would appear that in the last 24-36 months of Chloe‚Äôs life the usage of her medication was in line with what Dr Mechie expected.' At the time of Chloe‚Äôs death tributes were paid to the youngster. Her headmaster Brendan Conboy said: 'The whole community of Our Lady‚Äôs is extremely shocked and saddened by the tragic death of this lovely girl. 'She will be fondly remembered and we offer our deepest condolences to her family and many friends. Chloe and her family were remembered in a special Mass for the whole school and we will keep them all in our prayers.'

They're the jeans every woman‚Äôs been waiting for ‚Äì making you look a dress size skinnier without having to diet. Celebrities including Miranda Kerr and actress Melanie Griffith have already been spotted creating the illusion, thanks to a dark panel down the side of the trousers. Now all British women will get a chance to try out the effect, thanks to a ¬£16 version on sale at Asda. Optical Illusion: Jeans that make you look a dress size smaller, popularised by celebrities like Miranda Kerr (left), are now available to all women thanks to a ¬£16 Asda version, worn (right) by MoS reporter Dana Gloger . The beige Illusion Jeans are designed to slim and elongate legs by drawing the eye down the length of the body. Asda created the jeans, available¬† in sizes 8 to 24, for its George range after a quarter of women aged 16 to 70 said their legs were their main body hang-up. Designer Kausar Mitha said: ‚ÄòThe panel is slightly wider at the top, around the hip and thigh area, and then tapers down the leg. ‚ÄòThis is because women‚Äôs widest point is at the top of thigh. The panel draws the eye in and then follows the contour of the body, which creates an illusion of slimmer legs and hips. ‚ÄòWe tried five different-sized panels and this was the one that made the wearer look most svelte. The jeans are also made from stretch cotton, which gives a more toned look. The vertical panel adds an illusion of extra length.‚Äô Hourglass figure: Kate Winslet kicked off the trend for optical-illusion clothing when she wore a white-and-nude dress with black panelling at the Venice Film Festival last September . The trousers are Asda‚Äôs latest addition to a line that began with the Illusion dress in April. The frock, which sold out within a week, was followed by the Illusion swimsuit in May. Next month, the retailer will launch a pair of Illusion jeans in blue with a black stripe on the inside thigh, for those who feel this is their problem area. Victoria‚Äôs Secret model Miranda Kerr was spotted last month in a pair of beige-and-black trousers similar to the Asda jeans, while actress Melanie Griffith was recently pictured in a black-and-white version.

A pair of transgender lesbians today told of their joy at becoming man and wife, and also wife and wife, on the same day - after one had a sex-change. Jenny-Anne Bishop, 65, formerly called Paul, and Elen Heart, 68, who was once named Alan, initially got together as a male gay couple in 2004. The pair, who are both divorced and have five grown-up children between them, lived together in Clwyd, Wales, for six years as transgender lesbians. Just married: Jenny-Anne (right) and Elen (left) pose with their transgender bridesmaid Gabrielle (centre) outside the Metropolitan Community Church in Manchester today . But the couple decided against surgery due to the associated risks at their age until last year - when Jenny-Anne went under the knife for a gender reassignment op. Father-of-two Jenny-Anne went on to have a breast augmentation procedure this January followed by facial feminisation surgery. The couple have now officially tied the knot as 'husband and wife' after opting for a private civil ceremony in North Wales. Retired graphic designer Elen, who takes herbal hormones to make her appearance more feminine, took on the role of groom and wore a silky red dress and bright red high heels. The couple refer to father-of-three Elen - who started living as a woman in 2004 - as the 'groomness'. Retired product sales manager Jenny-Anne wore a strapless cream bridal gown complete with a train and a tiara and took on the part of bride. They were officially announced as husband and wife in front of four close friends, who attended as witnesses. The retired newlyweds then had a gay wedding service at the Metropolitan Community Church in Manchester, where transgender friend Gabrielle was their bridesmaid. The couple tied the knot as 'husband and wife' in a registry office before having a church blessing . Pucker up: Jenny-Anne (right) was married for 31 years before she divorced in 2000. Elen is twice divorced . Jenny-Anne said: 'It was a beautiful weekend. We had so much support and sheer love from our friends and the wider community. 'At the registry office Elen had to be ambiguous, so we made sure she got to celebrate her femininity at the Church, where we were pronounced ""wife and wife"".' Jenny-Anne was married for 31 years before she divorced in 2000. Elen is twice divorced. Her first marriage lasted for seven years and her second - in which she fathered a daughter and two sons - lasted for 20 years. The couple met at a friend's Christmas party in 2004 and wrote to each other as friends for a year before becoming lovers. They run a refuge for transgender people who struggle to be accepted and present trans-awareness training to public service providers, such as police and local councils. Jerry-Anne, who has a granddaughter, added: 'The law has seen us go from a gay couple - to a lesbian couple - to a heterosexual couple who can get married, but basically we are just two people who love each other and wanted to publicly declare and celebrate our relationship. 'We want to encourage other transgender couples to celebrate their relationships and uniqueness.'","Jenny-Anne Bishop and Elen Heart fathered five children in previous relationships .

Maybe that‚Äôs why he was so happy to greet French tax rebel Gerard Depardieu yesterday after granting him Russian citizenship. The actor, 64, has been accused of betrayal after quitting his homeland to avoid a new 75 per cent tax rate for millionaires. Warm welcome: Depardieu was offered citizenship and a passport by the Russian President . Open arms: Russian President Vladimir Putin greets French actor Gerard Depardieu . Welcomed: French actor Gerard Depardieu poses with his new Russian passport on a theatre stage, wearing a traditional folk outfit, after he arrived in the city of Saransk, 435 miles east of Moscow, Russia, on Sunday . Putin said last month that Depardieu . would be welcome in Russia, which has a flat income tax rate of 13 . percent, compared to the tax on income over 1 million euros . ($1.3million) that Hollande wants to levy in France. He also offered Depardieu a Russian passport, . saying he had a close, special relationship with France and had . developed warm ties with the actor, even though they had rarely met. The Russian president and Depardieu were . shown on state-run Channel One shaking hands and hugging each other . early as they met at Putin's residence in the Black Sea town of Sochi, during what the Kremlin said was a private visit by the . actor to Russia. 'A brief meeting between the president . and Depardieu took place,' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ‚ÄúOn the . occasion of his visit to Russia, he was handed a Russian passport.‚Äù Peskov did not say whether Putin personally gave Depardieu the passport or if he picked it up through standard procedures. He said the actor also told Putin about his career plans. Depardieu, who has made more than 150 films including Cyrano de Bergerac and Green Card, which is about a man who enters into a marriage of convenience to get US residency, is a popular figure in Russia. The 64-year-old actor has appeared in many advertising campaigns, including for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is . prominently featured on the bank's home page. He also worked in Russia in 2011 on a film about the eccentric monk Grigory Rasputin. Putin asked Depardieu whether he was pleased with his work in the movie, with the French actor saying he had already sent Putin some excerpts from it. Dinner talk: The actor enjoyed an evening meal with President Putin at his residence in Sochi . Lively debate: Depardieu gestures during his meeting with Putin . Table talk: The actor has decided to leave his native France over a proposed tax hike for millionaires . The actor's decision to quit France follows his revelation that last year he paid taxes amounting to 85 per cent of his income. In an open letter . published in mid-December, Depardieu said he had been 'insulted' by France's prime . minister Jean-Marc Ayrault and planned to turn over his passport and . French social security card. Ayrault called him pathetic for wanting to leave France, initially for tax-friendly Belgium, to avoid the new top rate. In an angry letter, published in Le . Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Depardieu wrote: 'I was born in 1948. I . started working aged 14, as a printer, as a warehouseman, then as an . actor, and I‚Äôve always paid my taxes.' Over 45 years, Depardieu said, he had . paid ‚Ç¨145million euros in tax, and to this day employs 80 people. Last . year he paid taxes amounting to 85 per cent of his income. 'I am neither worthy of pity nor admirable, but I shall not be called 'pathetic', he concluded. 'I'm a true European, a citizen of the world.' New document: Gerard Depardieu shows off his Russian passport on Sunday at Mordovia airport in Saransk . Russian appeal: Depardieu is well-known in Russia, where he is attached to a number of advertising campaigns . Widespread fame: The French actor is a popular figure in Russia . The tax on millionaires was struck . down by France's highest court on December 29, but the government . intends to resubmit the law in a slightly different form soon. Depardieu's decision to quit France has prompted accusations of national betrayal, but some have backed the actor's move. Sixties sex symbol Brigitte Bardot, 78, said the actor had been the 'victim of extremely unfair prosecution'. The animal rights campaigner has also now threatened to leave France and move to Russia amid plans to put down two elephants after they contracted tuberculosis at a Lyon zoo. Meanwhile in Russia, critics of Putin said the granting of a passport to Depardieu was a stunt and pointed out the president announced a campaign only last month to prevent rich Russians from keeping their money offshore.","Star of Green Card quit homeland over proposed 75 percent income tax .

The airport completed the first phase of a more than $201 million modernization effort and opened newly renovated concourses about a week ago. Mayor William Bell said he talked with the boy's father - who was not injured - and is pressing officials to explain how the sign toppled over. 'I cannot come close to understanding his heartache. But I will get answers. I'm calling on the airport authority to thoroughly investigate this horrible incident. I want a full report on my desk as quickly as possible,' he told AL.com. Airport officials met Saturday, but would not elaborate on other safety measures being taken. 'President and CEO Al Denson and the staff are continuing to work with officials to investigate. This includes discussions with contractors and subcontractors responsible for the modernization,' Chairwoman of the Airport Authority Board of Directors Gaynell Hendricks said in a statement. The contractors and subcontractors were not identified. Airport spokeswoman Toni Herrera-Bast said officials aren't sure how the sign fell. The airport continued operating while rescue workers tended to the family. Heather underwent surgery last night, but . surgeons decided her body wasn't strong enough for all the work they . needed to be done and so she is due to have additional surgery on . Sunday. The two younger boys Sam, 8, and Tyler, 5, are being treated at Children's of Alabama where their condition is described as 'fair'. Sam has a broken leg . and nose, while Tyler has a concussion. Family tragedy: Luke Bresette, 10, was killed after an airport sign collapsed on him, his mom and two younger brothers . Luke Bresette, 10, second from right was the third eldest of five children . The terrible incident occurred at . about 1:30 p.m. on Friday as the family were returning to Overland Park, . Kansas after spending a week in Destin for Spring Break. Husband and . father Ryan Bresette wasn't injured, nor was older sister Anna and . another brother, Joe. Luke was the third of the five children and was in . the fifth grade at St. Thomas More School, Kansas City. His uncle Alex Bresette has described his nephew as some who was full of love and life. ‚ÄòHe was a beautiful boy,' he told AL.com. ‚ÄòHe was great in school. He was bright and inquisitive.‚Äô Luke enjoyed playing . baseball, football, basketball and sang in the choir. He was also an . avid fan of Notre Dame football and the Kansas Jayhawks. 'You know how some kids get too old to hug you anymore?' Alex Bresette said. 'Not Luke, he always hugged.' Witnesses said the family was walking by the giant sign when it came crashing down on top of them. It took six men to lift it off the family and later about a dozen men held it up while rescue workers worked on the family. The sign weighing between 300 and 400 . pounds took eight to 10 bystanders to lift it off the family said . Birmingham Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Donald Jones. First responders: The massive flight information board is seen propped up against the wall by rescue workers . Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family . Rushed away: One of the injured is seen being taken away from the scene on a stretcher . Immediate care: One of the young is taken away from the scene by emergency personnel . The children's father is said to have been checking them in at the nearby Southwest desk, according to a witness, when the horrific incident occurred around 1.30pm. ‚ÄòThe 300-plus pound sign toppled and hit the family without warning,‚Äô witness to the scene Albert Osorio told AL.com. ‚ÄòThe whole thing flipped down on those kids. It took all of us here to stand it back up. Everybody started screaming.‚Äô Mr Osorio said that from what he saw, the sign appeared to have been attached to the wall 'only with liquid nails,' a type of caulking adhesive, he told the website. Airport spokesperson Toni Herrera-Bast told WBRC an investigation is underway into why the board fell with the cause not immediately known. Herrera-Bast said she wasn't sure how the board was attached to the wall. Closed off: Two workers are seen cleaning in a closed off section of the terminal where the large sign, said to be between 300-400 pounds, fell off the wall . Safety measures: As a precautionary measure barricades have been placed around the airport's other flight status boards, the fallen one is seen here . A witness Tweeting a photo near the scene described it as 'blood everywhere and a mom screaming.' The terminal has since closed with no word yet on when it will reopen. Barricades have since been positioned around the airport's other flight status boards as a precautionary measure. Birmingham's mayor William Bell released a statement immediately after the incident promising his full support in the investigation. Emergency rescue: Fire trucks rushed to the terminal at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport . Crews: Emergency crews rushed to the scene just after 1.30pm on Friday . 'I have offered our full support to the Airport Authority as they . investigate what has occurred this afternoon. I have asked our public . safety staff to assist this family in their time of need in any way . possible as they grapple with what has happened,' the statement read. The board was in a new terminal of the airport which opened last week following a $201 million modernization effort. Flights were said to have not been disrupted going into or out of the airport due to the incident on Friday. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE: .

Official figures show that 1,330mm (52.4 inches) of rain fell in the past 12 months - just 7mm short of the highest total reached in 2000. Depressingly this new data also shows that four of the five wettest years ever to hit the UK have been since the Millennium. Bad news: 2012 was the second wettest year on record and experts predict floods like this are even more likely . Battered Britain: Tewkesbury Abbey surrounded by flood water in Gloucestershire in November 2012, one of many places to be hit badly by flooding last year . The top five wettest years in the records dating back to 1910 are 2000, 2012, 1954, 2008 and 2002. It came as Met Office figures also showed the number of days of extreme rainfall is also hitting record levels, meaning the UK can expect more years of floods. The UK as a whole had 15 per cent more rainfall than average during the year, with England experiencing almost a third more rain than normal. Overall 2012 was the wettest year on record for . England and the third wettest for Wales, but Scotland experienced only . its 17th wettest year and in Northern Ireland it was the 40th wettest. 1.¬†¬† ¬†2000 ‚Äì 1337.3mm . 2.¬†¬† ¬†2012 ‚Äì 1330.7mm . 3.¬†¬† ¬†1954 ‚Äì 1309.1 mm . 4.¬†¬† ¬†2008 ‚Äì 1295.0mm . 5.¬†¬† ¬†2002 ‚Äì 1283.7mm . Almost 8,000 homes and businesses were flooded last year as the UK was repeatedly battered by heavy rain, storms and floods. But 2012 began with a number of water companies imposing hosepipe bans as swathes of England faced drought following two dry winters. The dry weather then gave way to persistent rain, with the UK experiencing a record April and June, and the wettest summer in a century.Farmers‚Äô crops were hit by the unusually wet summer, while much of the UK‚Äôs wildlife struggled in the poor conditions, with only a few species including slugs and orchids thriving. The Met Office said changes in sea surface temperatures as a result of natural cycles and a reduction in the amount of Arctic sea ice could be helping to increase rainfall, but more research needed to be done to establish how big a role they were playing. Same as last year then: Today only part of a road can be seen above the flood water from the River Ouse near Cawood, North Yorkshire . Sodden: Only the speed limit signs from a submerged Yorkshire road show the aftermath of the Ouse bursting its banks . Serene: Beautiful weather masks the fact that persistent heavy rain over recent weeks means this area has been completely flooded . Long-term averages over 30-year . periods show¬† an increase in annual rainfall of about five per cent from . 1981-2010 when compared to 1961-1990. It has also been revealed that torrential rain heavy enough to cause flash flooding is on the rise and climate change is probably the cause, a different Met Office study looking at the last 50 years of figures has revealed today. Official statistics show during the 1960s the heaviest rains of the year fell on an average of one in 125 days a year, but now it is closer to one in 75 days. Extreme rain: This graph shows that since the 1960s there has been more and more days of torrential rain a year in Britain . Wet spots: This map of Britain shows where the the highest levels of torrential rain in 24 hours tends to fall . The Met Office's chief scientist Julia Slingo says that the frequency of extreme rainfall events in the UK looks to be increasing. 'What this data is telling us is that the nature of our rainfall is changing and what we are seeing is more intense rain, more regularly,' she told MailOnline. 'There‚Äôs evidence we are getting slightly more rain in total, but . more importantly it may be falling in more intense bursts ‚Äì which can . increase the risk of flooding,' she said. 'What this means is that when it raining there is more potential for more flash floods and surface water floods, like the ones we have seen this year. This means we have to look at the strength of our flood defences and also our drainage systems, including the use of more permeable surfaces.' Heavy: Warm air allows clouds to pick up more moisture, the Met Office says, as this picture of London's skyline shows during one of many heavy rainstorms in the last year . Torrent: The Gloucestershire Fire And Rescue Service launch their boat in Gloucestershire in May, in floods often caused by sheer volume of rain . Rising temperatures are being blamed as for every 0.7 degrees the global . temperatures rises, clouds can hold four per cent more rain, the Met . Office has said. 'The data we have bears out that warmer air holds more water,' Julia Slingo said. Friends of the Earth head of policy Mike Childs said climate change was already affecting the UK. 'Four of the five wettest years in the UK have occurred since 2000, and experts including the Met Office expect extreme weather events such as intense rainfall to become more common as global warming takes hold. 'There is still time to tackle climate change. We must end our dependency on dirty fossil fuels and reap the benefits of energy efficiency and developing clean power from the wind, waves and sun.' Typical scene: Waves crash into the sea wall at Seaham Harbour as the UK was battered by rain and wind in 2012 . Dumped: Increasing amounts of heavy downpours are happening, and being predicted for the future - like this one over Westminster . The Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) warned that despite the wet year, there was a need for a coherent strategy to manage water resources to cope with drought as well as floods, including creating new storage facilities to catch rainfall. ICE water expert Michael Norton said: 'Without a strategy, we will continue to swing from flooding to drought and climate change will only exacerbate the situation. 'Developing new storage facilities across the country to harvest more rainfall must form part of this strategy - rainfall is becoming more varied in terms of time and place and we can no longer rely on large reservoirs in only a few locations.' It appears that in the long term, with a mix of years of high rainfall and years of drought. But the overall trend shows that there has been consistently more heavy rain in the last 50 years. In the early 1970s there were as few as one in 155 days of the heaviest rainfall, while in in 2000 - the wettest year on record, there were torrential downpours on one in 60 days. Gardeners can expect longer grass and more daisies and buttercups . Gardeners have been warned to forget about creating the perfect English lawn, with changing weather patterns making it virtually impossible to plan the perfect garden. Experts fear that summers will become more prone to extreme weather conditions, with torrential rain and prolonged droughts becoming the norm. Gardeners can expect longer grass and more daisies and daffodils on their lawn as a result. Drier springs and wetter summers will mean that flowers will also struggle to cultivate in beds and borders. Met Office experts made the predictions at a recent Royal Horticultural Society Conference. Retire University of Reading professor Richard Bisgrove, an expert in turf management and garden history, said: 'My own view is that climate change won't affect gardens dramatically but the weather will. 'Nobody can tell one year to the next what we will have. 'In terms of grass, I would say to a large extent that the less effort you put in the better. People should accept a higher cut of grass, more daisies and buttercups.'","1,330mm of rain fell in the last year - 7mm less than in 2000 .

Sir Joshua Reynolds' portrait of Omai was exempt from capital gains tax because it was used in the business of opening the house to the public . The owners of multi-million-pound art treasures may be able to class their paintings as worthless to escape hefty tax bills after a landmark ruling. The aristocratic Howard family successfully argued that a painting they sold for ¬£9.4‚Äâmillion was part of ‚Äòplant and machinery‚Äô at their stately home and therefore a ‚Äòwasting asset‚Äô exempt from capital gains tax (CGT). The family said the picture by 18th Century English painter Sir Joshua Reynolds had been put on display to attract visitors and so was declining in value for tax purposes. Wealthy aristocrats, nightclub owners and high-end restaurant chains are all eyeing the new tax break that could save them millions of pounds when they sell treasured collectors‚Äô items. The painting ‚Äì a depiction of Omai, a South Sea Islander who spent two years in England in the 1770s after being picked up by Captain Cook‚Äôs ship Adventure ‚Äì was sold at Sotheby‚Äôs in 2001. The Howards, whose Yorkshire home was the setting for ITV‚Äôs 1981 adaptation of Evelyn Waugh‚Äôs classic Brideshead Revisited, had been arguing with the taxman ever since. But this month‚Äôs Upper Tax Tribunal judgment determined that there was no CGT due on the sale of the painting. Mr Justice Morgan said: ‚ÄòI accept that there is something surprising in holding that an asset of high value, and one liable to appreciate in value, with a predicted life of more than 50 years, was a wasting asset. ‚ÄòHowever, the painting was only a wasting asset because it satisfied the established test.‚Äô HM Revenue & Customs had argued that if famous paintings could be treated as plant, it would create a huge loophole for tax avoidance. Simon Howard and his wife Rebecca successfully argued that the ¬£9.4¬ømillion painting was part of ¬øplant and machinery¬ø at their stately home and therefore a ¬øwasting asset¬ø exempt from capital gains tax . Officials are now considering the judgment. Accountants are equally interested in the details. ‚ÄòWe will be raising it with our clients, many of whom have valuable paintings,‚Äô said Mike Warburton, a tax adviser at accountancy firm Grant Thornton. ‚ÄòPeople will be looking to locate artwork where it is a part of their business.‚Äô Mr Warburton said the ruling could have wide implications. ‚ÄòSupposing somebody bought a Jimi Hendrix guitar. If you hang it on the wall of your nightclub, it‚Äôs there for the ambience,‚Äô he said. That would mean it would not be subject to CGT. Individuals usually pay up to 28 per cent tax on any gain they have made when selling valuable items. It is not clear how much CGT the Howard family will avoid through the ruling. The painting was acquired by Frederick Howard, the 5th Earl of Carlisle, in the 1790s. Mr Warburton said the case showed that tax rules are a muddle. ‚ÄòThe painting was not caught for capital gains tax because it was treated as a wasting asset. 'A valuable painting is almost certainly going to survive for more than 50 years and rise in value. The lawyers were successful in arguing that the painting was ‚Äúplant‚Äù. Few people would think a painting was plant.‚Äô A spokesman for the Howard family said: ‚ÄòFor many years the painting had been on display to visitors. The judge held that Omai had been ‚Äò‚Äòplant‚Äô‚Äô used in the business of opening the house to the public. It therefore qualified for exemption from capital gains tax when sold.‚Äô","Painting of Omai by Sir Joshua Reynolds exempt from capital gains tax .

Nine in 10 rapes and other sexual assaults go unreported to police because women lack confidence in the criminal justice system, Britain's chief prosecutor will say today. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, is to reveal that convictions for rape have reached record levels but the true number of offences is far greater. He will say that while more than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year, only one in 10 victims of a serious offence reports it to the police. Looking for improvement: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, will admit that nine in 10 rapes and other serious sexual assaults are not reported to police . Campaigners have warned that the number of convictions is only the 'tip of an iceberg'. Mr Starmer, who heads the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), will tell a gathering of criminal justice agencies and women's groups: 'We now deliver justice for 15,000 more women each year than we did just four years ago. 'And we do so within a different culture - one which challenges myths and stereotypes and should improve confidence in the criminal justice system. 'But while more than 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year, while only one in 10 women who experience serious sexual assault report it to the police, and while conviction rates remain lower for these attacks than for other crimes, none of us can afford to stop working to improve further.' The number of cases involving violence women and girls which have been prosecuted by the CPS has risen from 75,000 in 2007-08 to 91,000 in 2011-12. Over the same period, the number of convictions rose from 52,000 to almost 67,000. Silent: Some women fail to report abuse because they lack confidence in the criminal justice system (Picture posed by model) Mr Starmer is expected to say the rise can be partly explained by a 'cultural change' in the way such cases are dealt with. He will say: 'The work of the service in recognising violence against women and girls as a unified, high-priority issue, championed at the most senior level nationally and in the areas, and addressed through new policies, training and the use of specialist staff, has delivered a cultural change. 'Cases are now judged entirely on the merits of the evidence: we have recognised that myths and stereotypes previously held have no place in our criminal justice system - and that we need to tackle them head on.' Mr Starmer is chairing a case review panel to explore the handling of the prosecutions in Rochdale of nine Muslim men, mainly of Pakistani origin, who were found guilty of plying girls as young as 13 with drink and drugs and raping them. He will say: 'Violence against women and girls is not a race issue, but what we do recognise is that the manifestation of abuse varies across communities and we have to discuss the issues and possible solutions together with those communities.' Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Starmer added: 'I have asked for all our cases involving child exploitation to be looked at so we get a proper picture of all sorts of cases in their proper circumstances.' Asked about recent child sex grooming case in Rochdale in which a gang of Asian men were jailed, he said: 'For my part I'm less concerned about ethnic backgrounds. If you focus on the victim it becomes clear that these are often very vulnerable groups of individuals. 'Why is it that these people presented as victims. Why was it that they were not taken as seriously as they should have been.' Rapist: Shabir Ahmed, who led a child sex exploitation ring in Rochdale. Keir Starmer is chairing a review of the case . Mr Starmer is also expected to talk about the issue of teenage relationship abuse, where there remains a low volume of prosecutions and explain how a National Scrutiny Panel he is hosting will look at six recent cases and work out recommendations. He will mention female genital mutilation, for which there have been no prosecutions. 'I am determined that we will find a way to bring offenders to account,' he will say. Sandra Horley, chief executive of domestic violence charity Refuge, said: 'Refuge welcomes the recent CPS report which shows that the number of perpetrators being prosecuted for domestic violence has increased to 91,466 per year. 'Refuge has been campaigning for four decades to ensure that women and children are given the protection and justice they deserve and we commend the CPS for their efforts. 'Whilst we recognise these efforts are a step in the right direction, there is no room for complacency. 'Refuge remains concerned that the numbers of perpetrators prosecuted and subsequently convicted represents the tip of an iceberg. 'In London alone, there were almost 52,000 domestic violence offences recorded in one year, so the 66,860 successfully prosecuted nationally, barely scratches the surface.'","Britain's chief prosecutor, Keir Starmer, will say rape convictions have reached a record high but the true number of offences is much greater .

A former county supervisor and the estranged wife of California's Treasurer has been arrested after police found methamphetamine stashed in the Orange County home she was living in with the couple's nine-year-old son. Nadia Lockyer, 41, was until recently considered a rising star in Northern California government with her career being helped along by her powerful politician husband of ten years Bill Lockyer, 71. But she is now facing charges of drug possession and child abuse, in the latest in a string of public substance abuse and relationship struggles faced by the woman. Rising star: Nadia Lockyer, pictured, was until recently considered a rising star in Northern California government . Arrested: Lockyer is now facing charges of drug possession and child abuse after being caught with meth . Mr Lockyer, the state's former attorney general and current treasurer, helped his much younger wife with $1.6million in campaign funding when she won her supervisor seat in 2010, but has since filed for divorce and is seeking joint custody of their son. She resigned from the seat in April following a series of bizarre public incidents that she blamed on drug and alcohol dependency. According to the San Jose Mercury News, she said at the time she wanted to focus on her family and resolve personal issues. Mrs Lockyer said at the time: 'We're married. There's no talk of changing that. We're committed to our son.' Power couple: Bill Lockyer is one of the most powerful Democrats in California. He spent $1.6million to help his young wife Nadia win a seat as an Alameda County Supervisor . Campaigning: Nadia Lockyer, right, won her supervisor seat in 2010 . The sordid details of the political . power couple began to leak out in February when Mrs Lockyer called . police to a hotel where she was staying to report that she had been . assaulted by her former lover, a convicted felon whom she met in rehab . for addiction. A police investigation revealed an . ongoing relationship between Mrs Lockyer and construction worker Steve . Chikhani, including explicit text messages and pictures sent between the . two but he was never charged. Mr Lockyer was also reportedly sent a sex tape of his wife and lover and Mrs Lockyer revealed that they had been together for a year before she ended the relationship. Mr Lockyer filed for divorce in July, . citing 'irreconcilable differences' in the legal papers and just hours . after being served, Mrs Lockyer ran her car off the road and hit a tree. Police received a tip last week that . led them to a house where Mrs Lockyer was staying with relatives, . district attorney's spokeswoman Farrah Emami said. The woman was not home, but officers . found methamphetamine and paraphernalia used for smoking it. Later, when . they found Mrs Lockyer, she showed 'objective signs' of meth . intoxication and she was arrested. Estranged: Bill Lockyer, pictured left, has filed for divorce from wife, Nadia, right, due to her drug dependency . The other man: Steve Chikhani, a convicted felon with a history of drug arrests, reportedly made a sex tape with Mrs Lockyer after the couple met in rehab . Mrs Lockyer pleaded not guilty in . court on August 30 to a felony count of drug possession, two misdemeanor . drug charges and one misdemeanor count of child abuse, because she is . alleged to have kept the drugs in the home with her son. She was released after acknowledging she needed to check in to a drug rehab centre and is due back in court on Monday. 'Nadia recognizes her error and is in . the process of doing everything possible to regain her health,' said . her attorney, Allan Stokke. Mrs Lockyer had made various accusations in the past of abandonment by her husband and that the divorce had been coming for some time. According to the¬†San Francisco Chronicle she said at the time of their divorce: 'My husband and I have differed on how to protect the family,' she said. 'I feel he has abandoned me and my child, and it's created an unsafe circumstance.' Even before her resignation from office, Mrs Lockyer publicly accused her husband of mistreatment. Split apart: Mr Lockyer cited 'irreconcilable differences' when he filed for divorce after five months of enduring the public humiliation of his wife's affair and addiction . An email that appeared to be sent from Mrs Lockyer went to a newspaper, accusing her husband of supplying her with drugs, a claim he denies. 'I simply can't bear this any longer. Goodbye to everyone,' the note read, prompting the paper to call police, fearing for her safety. At the time, Mrs Lockyer said, 'Alcoholism and addiction are diseases from which many of us suffer, and unfortunately, I have not been spared.'

Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik is smitten with a neo-Nazi called Beate Zschaepe. He has sent her a letter praising her role in a terror cell which assassinated nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman in a decade-long reign of terror. Breivik, who slaughtered nearly 80 young people last year, said she should use her upcoming trial on murder and other charges ‚Äòto spread right-wing propaganda!‚Äô Infatuated: Anders Breivik has sent Beate Zschaepe a letter praising her role in a terror cell . He also called her a ‚Äòcourageous heroine of national resistance‚Äô and addressed the letter to ‚ÄòDear Sister Beate.‚Äô ‚ÄòReveal your political motives to the population,‚Äô said Breivik. Details of the correspondence are revealed in this week‚Äôs edition of Der Spiegel magazine which went on sale on Sunday in Germany. The three-sided letter is apparently full of admiration for the woman who was one of three main players in the National Socialist Underground; a death squad which idolised Hitler and wanted nothing less than the setting up of a ‚ÄòFourth Reich‚Äô in Germany. It imploded in November last year when the two male members of the team took their own lives following a botched bank raid. Zschaepe was left with orders to blow up the gang‚Äôs HQ and destroy as much evidence of their activities as possible. Neo-Nazi Beate Zschaepe was part of a terror cell that assassinated nine immigrant businessmen and a policewoman . Since the NSU‚Äôs disintegration police have gathered evidence which suggests that Zschaepe was present at most murders and probably carried out several of them. Breivik, who claimed at his murder trial that his killings were carried out as a ‚Äòwake up call‚Äô over multi-culturalism and unchecked immigration in Europe, is clearly spellbound by the woman who has been dubbed ‚ÄòThe Nazi Mare‚Äô in Germany. ‚ÄòYou did everything to stop the multiculturalism and the Islamization of Germany,‚Äô he went on. But he said that the cell, which was based in the eastern German city of Zwickau, was wrong to target immigrant businessmen. ‚ÄòYou should have gone for political elites instead,‚Äô he advised. ‚ÄòBut both forms of attack would damage the multicultural experiment.‚Äô Breivik, 32, waxed lyrical about the ‚Äòmission‚Äô he sees himself and Zschaepe, 37, involved in, adding; ‚ÄòWe are both among the first drops of rain that foretell the huge, cleansing storm about the break across Europe. ‚ÄòWe are martyrs of the the conservative revolution and should be extremely proud of our sacrifice and our troubles.‚Äô But his words never reached his jailbird sweetheart; the letter was seized by authorities in Germany and confiscated. Breivik bombed government buildings in Oslo, resulting in eight deaths, then carried out a mass shooting at a camp of the Workers‚Äô Youth League of the Labour Party on the island of Ut√∏ya, where he killed 69 people, mostly teenagers. He was convicted of mass murder, causing a fatal explosion, and terrorism in August 2012 after being declared sane at the time of the atrocity. He was sentenced to 21 years in jail, serving a minimum of 10.","Breivik called Beate Zschaepe a 'courageous heroine of national resistance'

"PUBLISHED: . 21:04 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:04 EST, 17 March 2013 . Olen Burrage, who was acquitted in the case of three civil rights workers killed by Ku Klux Klansmen in Mississippi in the 1960s, has died. He was 82. Burrage died Friday at a hospital, the McClain-Hays Funeral Home Chapel said. The funeral home did not release a cause of death. Burrage owned land in Neshoba County in central Mississippi where the three civil rights workers were buried under an earthen dam after KKK members killed them in 1964. He said he knew nothing about the killings and was acquitted of conspiracy in 1967. Suspect: Olen Burrage (left) has died aged 82. Burrage was accused of conspiracy after three men murdered by the Ku Klux Klan were buried on his land in Mississippi (right) Victims: These three civil rights workers were abducted, killed and buried by the KKK in June 1964 . The FBI called its investigation 'Mississippi Burning' - which was later used as the title for a 1988 film loosely based on the case. Among the others charged with conspiracy in 1967, seven were convicted. None served more than six years in prison. The jury deadlocked on charges against a local minister, Edgar Ray 'Preacher' Killen. Killen was accused of orchestrating the killings. He was charged again in 2005 with killing Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney and convicted on three counts of manslaughter. Killen is serving a 60-year prison sentence. Ben Chaney, the younger brother of James Chaney, met with Justice Department officials in 2009 and asked them to pursue charges against Burrage and other suspects before they died, but Burrage was never charged again. After learning of Burrage's death, Ben Chaney told the Clarion-Ledger newspaper, 'I am disappointed. Wow! I'm very disappointed.' Burrage's funeral was set for Sunday. His death was first reported by the Clarion-Ledger. Blaze: Burrage was accused of setting fire to Ford car owned by the three civil rights workers . In a 1964 confession, Klansman Horace Doyle Barnette talked of meeting Burrage after the bodies were buried in the dam. His confession was read to the jury by an FBI agent during the trial. 'Burrage got a glass gallon jug and filled it with gasoline to be used to burn the 1963 Ford car owned by the three civil rights workers,' Barnette said. 'Burrage took one of the diesel trucks from under a trailer and said, 'I will use this to pick you up, no one will suspect a truck on the road this time at night.' It was then about 1 to 1:30 in the morning.' Norma Bourdeaux, who was on the federal grand jury that indicted Burrage in the 1960s, told the Clarion-Ledger she believed Burrage was guilty. 'A man who has a piece of property doesn't generally have people come in, take a bulldozer and bury three bodies under a dam unless he knows about it,' she said. U.S. Attorney Doug Jones of Birmingham, Ala., who successfully prosecuted the 1963 church bombing that killed four girls there, told the newspaper authorities need to quickly assess this case and other civil rights cold cases. 'The window to true justice in these cases is closing,' he said. 'Today is just another example of one who escaped justice, and we'll just have to rely on a higher power now to bring justice.'

One of the first black students who enrolled at the University of Alabama a half century ago in defiance of racial segregation has died. James Hood of Gadsden was 70. Officials at Adams-Buggs Funeral Home in Gadsden said they are handling arrangements for Hood, who died Thursday. Then-Alabama Gov. George Wallace made his infamous 'stand in the schoolhouse door' in a failed effort to prevent Hood and Vivian Malone from registering for classes at the university in 1963. In this June 11, 1963 photo, Vivian Malone and James Hood stand in the doorway of Foster Auditorium where they hold what they called their 'first and final news conference' after the two African-American students registered at the University of Alabama . In this 1996 file photo, James Hood is pictured with former four-term Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace who had tried to prevent him entering the university more than 30 years previous . Hood and Malone were accompanied by Deputy U.S. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach when they were confronted by Wallace as they attempted to enter the university's Foster Auditorium to register for classes and pay fees. Wallace backed down later that day and Hood and Malone registered for classes. UA President Judy Bonner remembered Hood as a man of 'courage and conviction' for being one of the first black students to enroll at the university. 'His connection to the university continued decades later when he returned to UA to earn his doctorate in 1997. He was a valued member of The University of Alabama community, and he will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time,' Bonner said. Hood was the last survivor among the major figures in the schoolhouse door incident. Wallace died in 1998, Vivian Malone Jones in 2005 and Katzenbach last year. After enrolling, Hood remained at UA for a few months and moved to Michigan, where he received a bachelor's degree from Wayne State University and a master's degree from Michigan State. Gov. George Wallace, right, attempted to prevent James Hood and Vivian Malone from registering for classes at the university in 1963 . He later moved to Wisconsin, where he worked at the Madison Area Technical College for 26 years. He retired in 2002 as chairman of public safety services in charge of police and fire training. He finally returned to UA later in life to earn his doctorate. Culpepper Clark, author of 'The Schoolhouse Door: Segregation's Last Stand at the University of Alabama,' called the schoolhouse door incident 'an iconic moment' in the Civil Rights Movement because it provided a confrontation between Wallace and the Kennedy administration. He said the incident was 'symbolically important' and helped lead to passage of the Voting Rights Act. Clark described Hood as a man with a lot of 'intellectual energy' who understood the importance of what he did at the University of Alabama in 1963. James Hood pictured going to class and outside his dormitory at the University of Alabama in 1963 . 'He didn't try to make it into more than what it was,' Clark said. The Rev. Preston Nix grew up in Etowah County and said he knew of Hood, who was several years older than he. Nix said it took a lot of courage for Hood to challenge the segregation at the University of Alabama in 1963. Nix said he felt Hood did what he did partly to 'pave the way' for others to be able to improve themselves and get a higher education and partly because he wanted to attend the University of Alabama. Samory Pruitt, vice president for community affairs at UA, agreed with Nix. 'Because of what he did, people like me were afforded the opportunity to go to the University of Alabama,' said Pruitt, who is black. 'I think it's about people having the opportunity to be the best they can be.'

They were en route another gig in St. Petersburg, Florida when the incident happened. The musician was able to carry his Gibson with him on the first leg of the flight. The duo drove down to Buffalo, where the Delta staffers said he could not carry on his guitar. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve always carried it on,‚Äô Mr Schneider said, adding that he had never had an issue with carrying on his instrument before. The guitarist said that in a last ditch effort, he showed the Delta staffers an article from early 2012 about new Federal Aviation Administration laws that allowed for instruments that could be safely stowed onboard ‚Äì either in overhead storage or under a seat ‚Äì as carry-on luggage. The FAA law also allows musicians to buy an extra seat for bulkier instruments. Reason to celebrate: The LeeVees had performed in Portland, Maine, and were trying to get to another gig in Florida . However, that failed to work, as did gate check, and Mr Schneider was forced to check his instrument.In Detroit, he took out his smartphone to film his guitar‚Äôs return.

He took to Facebook to vent his anger, writing: ‚ÄòDelta Airlines, next time I beg you not to make me check my 1965 Gibson ES335, please do so. You had the space, darn darn darn. ‚ÄòBTW It got jammed in an ELEVATOR!

Campaigners today slammed Google for violating Android users' privacy after it emerged that the company was sharing their personal details with mobile app developers. An Australian software developer revealed that the search giant was sending him the full names, email and post codes of everyone who purchased his app on Google's Play Store. He said the information was so detailed he would even be able to use it to 'track down and harass users who left negative reviews or refunded the app purchase'. A model poses with Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, which run on Google's Android OS: An Android app developer has revealed that Google sends him the personal details of anyone who buys his app . Incredibly, it has emerged that the . data sharing was not the result of a software glitch, but is actually . part of Google's policies for its app store and its Google Wallet . payment service. Nick Pickles, director of privacy and . civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, today accused Google . of taking decisions about consumers personal data 'without their . knowledge'. 'The true facts about about what is happening are buried in vague privacy policies,' he told MailOnline. 'Apps are an increasing part of . everyday life, so it‚Äôs essential that it is made crystal clear to . consumers what happens to their data. 'App developers aren‚Äôt asking for this . data, no other app stores share data in this way, so yet again we‚Äôre . faced with a situation where it looks like Google has put profits before . user privacy.' His outrage was echoed by Marc . Rotenberg, executive director of the U.S.-based Electronic Privacy . Information Center, who said Google has 'buried' the notice about how it . shares users' personal information in fine print. 'Meaningful consent is about people understanding what they're getting into. It's about not tricking them,' said Mr Rotenberg. 'In a situation like this, where . people just don't know what information is being transferred or who it's . going to or for what purpose, it seems ridiculous to say that Google . has consent.' The episode is merely latest privacy flare-up for Google, whose position as the world's number one search engine has made it the biggest name in online advertising. The company agreed last August to pay a $22.5million fine to settle charges in the U.S. that it bypassed the privacy settings of customers using Apple's Safari browser. It also settled a privacy investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in 2011 related to its rollout of the now-defunct Buzz social networking service. Other Web companies, notably Facebook, have also drawn scrutiny over their privacy practices and entered into settlements with regulators. Don't be evil: The episode is merely latest privacy flare-up for Android-maker Google, whose position as the world's number one search engine has made it the biggest name in online advertising . Google said in an emailed statement that 'Google Wallet shares the information needed to process transactions, and this is clearly stated in the Google Wallet Privacy Notice.' But Mr Rotenberg said he believed that Google may be violating its 2011 settlement with the FTC. Developer Dan Nolan broke the issue online in a blog post on Tuesday. 'Let me make this crystal clear,' he wrote. 'Every App purchase you make on Google Play gives the developer your name, suburb and email address with no indication that this information is actually being transferred. 'With the information I have available to me through the checkout portal I could track down and harass users who left negative reviews or refunded the app purchase.' Mr Nolan added: 'This is a massive oversight by Google. Under no circumstances should I be able to get the information of the people who are buying my apps unless they opt into it and it‚Äôs made crystal clear to them that I‚Äôm getting this information.' Microsoft took a pop at Google last week by accusing its rival of invading Gmail users' privacy when scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised ads. The attack, the latest volley in Microsoft's Scroogled campaign, comes with a website and is aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company's Outlook.com email service. It follows a series of Scroogled adverts last year which targeted Google's controversial privacy policies. 'Google goes through every Gmail that‚Äôs sent or received, looking for keywords so they can target Gmail users with paid ads,' the website says . 'And there‚Äôs no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy.' It also includes a feed of quotes from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt. These include his infamous declaration that '[i]f you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.' And also: 'We don‚Äôt need you to type at all. We know where you are, with your permission; we know where you‚Äôve been, with your permission; we can more or less know what you‚Äôre thinking about.' Mr Nolan's app, which automatically generates insults in the style of a well-known Australian politician, is already a best-seller on the iPhone and he recently released a version for Google's Android operating system. He told Reuters that Google acts as a marketplace when an app is purchased, hence the transactions occur directly between developer and the purchaser. 'The way the system is designed, it (the information) is not what a user would expect to hand over,' he said. 'If you buy something on the iOS app store, you purchase it off Apple, and they pass the money to the developer.' The Google Wallet privacy notice states that Google will share users' personal information with other companies 'as necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account.' That's different than the way Apple's App Store works. According to an Apple spokesman, the company only shares general information about the number of downloads with third-party app developers. Apple does not pass along personal information, such as email, except with publications available through its Newsstand store, and only then if customers agree to it, the spokesman said. Others have said they are pleased with Google's policy of passing along customer information to developers. Barry Schwartz, an app developer and editor for the online blog Marketing Land, said it made it easier for developers to directly handle customer service issues, such as refunds. 'I want to be able to service my customers, and yes, they are my customers, not Google's and not Apple's customers. They download our products,' Mr Schwartz wrote. But Joel Reidenberg, Director of the Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham University School of Law, said Google and other online and mobile services needed to be more transparent about what personal information was being shared with third-party firms. 'When you buy an app, you could have a pop-up that tells you this is the information that's going to the app developer,' he said. That was an opinion echoed by Mr Pickles, who said: 'Consumers could be asked for their permission if the data is required, but it‚Äôs wholly wrong for Google to take control of our data away from people like this.'","Australian software developer reveals online advertising giant is sending him the details of everyone who has bought his app .

Ayres, who had served two tours in Iraq with the Royal Marines, . suffered devastating brain damage in the collision, which occurred . shortly after midnight on September 27, 2008, and was faced with a . lifetime of serious disability. The care he will require for the rest of his life was estimated to cost millions of pounds and many of his friends have organised a series of charity events, including marathon runs and a benefit rugby match, to raise funds for him. High Court Judge Mrs Justice Swift yesterday guaranteed that . Mr Ayres would be awarded a huge compensation payout when she ruled . that Mr Odedra bore the lion's share of blame for the accident. Rejecting as 'inherently implausible' the driver's plea that his car had not even touched Mr Ayres before he . fell, the judge said that Mr Odedra's initial account to police of a . crowd of people surrounding him and urinating on his car before the . accident was 'wholly false'. Ruling: High Court Judge Mrs Justice Swift guaranteed that Mr Ayres would be awarded compensation for his injuries, despite calling his actions 'foolish' Mr Ayres 'not acting in a hostile or threatening manner' towards the driver or actively interfering with his car, said the judge. However, she firmly rejected claims that Mr Odedra had deliberately or recklessly driven into the half naked pedestrian, who at the time was working as a trainee nurse at De Montfort University Hospital, in Leicester. Finding Mr Odedra 80 per cent to blame, the judge said that he had probably wrongly believed that, by steering slightly to his left, he could avoid Mr Ayres and get safely on his way. Mrs Justice Swift ruled that Mr Ayres' behaviour, 'whilst reprehensible' and 'very foolish', had not caused the accident. However, the judge said that he could not be absolved from all responsibility and found him 20 per cent to blame. He had placed himself in danger by standing, half-clothed, in the middle of the road in front of Mr Odedra's car. 'His drunken state and dropped trousers hampered his ability to move freely and at a normal speed out of the path of the car,' the judge added. The court's ruling means that Mr Ayres' compensation will now be assessed on the basis of 80 per cent liability. The amount of his payout will be calculated at a further court hearing, unless final settlement terms are agreed before then.","Robert Ayres suffered brain damage when he was knocked down by car .

Quentin Tarantino films and I have never really got on, and it‚Äôs partly because the sort of films that inspired him when he was growing up are, by and large, ones I don‚Äôt like at all. But then came news that his latest project was a spaghetti Western and it seemed all was perhaps not lost: I rather like spaghetti Westerns. And, to my astonishment, I loved Django Unchained. Yes, it‚Äôs buttock-numbingly long and, yes, it lives up to its 18 certificate for ‚Äòstrong, bloody violence‚Äô but it‚Äôs still¬† the best film he‚Äôs made for years. It reunites him with the superlative Christoph Waltz (unforgettable as the charming, psychopathic Nazi in Inglourious Basterds),¬† benefits from a wonderful supporting¬† performance from Leonardo DiCaprio and stands real comparison with the films¬† that made Tarantino deservedly famous: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Double act: Django Unchained sees, Christoph Waltz as Dr King Schultz, left, a bounty hunter who asks freed slave Django for help . It takes its title from 1966 spaghetti . Western Django, directed by Sergio Corbucci and starring the Italian . actor Franco Nero, now married to Vanessa Redgrave. There‚Äôs a lovely . moment when Nero makes a brief cameo appearance in the new film. ‚ÄòThe D is silent,‚Äô explains the new Django. ‚ÄòI know,‚Äô replies the old one quietly. When Tarantino, who writes as well as directs, is getting the little details so¬† wonderfully right, you know he‚Äôs on good form. That sentimental aside apart, however, this is a new story with Jamie Foxx playing Django, a black slave in the Deep South two years before the Civil War,¬† and Waltz taking on the role of Dr King Schultz, the sharp-shooting ‚Äòdentist‚Äô who so unexpectedly frees him from his chains and offers him a deal. If Django will help him track down the Brittle brothers, notoriously brutal plantation overseers and now wanted men, he will give him his freedom. As these are the same Brittle brothers who branded and humiliated Django and whipped and then sold his beautiful slave wife, he doesn‚Äôt take long to say ‚Äòyes‚Äô. Acting out: Django meets charismatic plantation-owner Calvin Candie, played by Leonardo DiCaprio . In fact, he takes to the bounty-hunting business, as Dr Schultz‚Äôs true vocation¬† is soon revealed to be, with murderous alacrity: ‚ÄòKill white folk and they pay you for it,‚Äô he exclaims, ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs not to like?‚Äô The first hour of Django Unchained is close to perfect, with Waltz, undoubtedly drawing on his Inglourious style, making the linguistically fastidious Schultz¬† the most interesting and entertaining character Tarantino has written in a long time, while Foxx provides menace, presence and humour as the much-wronged Django. Captivating: Jamie Foxx in Django Unchained . This is a film about revenge, and when the bad guys get what‚Äôs coming,¬† as they do ever more frequently, they certainly deserve it. Tarantino‚Äôs screenplay, which has already secured him an Oscar nomination and won him a Golden Globe, is spot-on in the first half, delighting in word play and the sort of humour that the Monty Python team or Mel Brooks, in the days of Blazing Saddles, would have loved. A scene in which a Ku Klux Klan lynch-mob have to rethink their murderous plans because they can‚Äôt see out of the eye-holes cut in their hoods is surely¬† destined to become as famous as Samuel L. Jackson‚Äôs and John Travolta‚Äôs Big Mac routine in Pulp Fiction. Watch out for Jonah Hill‚Äôs brief cameo as the splendidly sulky clan man whose wife sewed the hoods and, indeed, for Jackson, a Tarantino regular, as a voluble house slave. Tarantino is a great one for dividing . his film into acts and there‚Äôs no doubt the pace slows considerably as . Act Two begins with Schultz and Django setting off to find Django‚Äôs . wife, the gloriously named Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). This change of gear proved close to . disastrous in Inglourious Basterds but works a lot better here, thanks . to¬† DiCaprio‚Äôs captivating turn as the charismatic plantation-owner . Calvin Candie, who likes to be called Big Daddy by his slaves but . Monsieur Candie by his white peers. A lot of speechifying by fine southern . gentlemen and the growing suspicion that the actors might be having . more fun than we are will be a test for some, but the verbal . pyrotechnics are a Tarantino trademark, DiCaprio has never been better . and, best of all, there is, of course, some serious shooting to come. There . is no point being po-faced about the violence; this is a Western, for . goodness sake. What‚Äôs more disconcerting is hearing the now taboo . ‚Äòn-word‚Äô being used over and over again. But this is that rare thing, a . Tarantino film where the maverick director gets just about all of the . big¬† judgment calls right.",Film review of Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained .

They were part of a group of six which had defied warnings about the conditions to go climbing in the Glencoe area of the Scottish Highlands. They were swept away by hundreds of tons of snow tumbling downhill. Tragedy: The avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian in the Scottish Highlands (pictured) left two men and two women dead . Rescue attempt: Search and rescue workers in Glencoe, where an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian claimed the lives of four climbers . A man in the party is thought to have . escaped the fall and raised the alarm around 2pm, when search teams were . scrambled to the 3,772ft mountain, called Bidean Nam Bian.

All six, three men and three women, had been located by early evening. Police confirmed that four were dead.

Fatalities: A member of the Glencoe mountain rescue team at the foot of Bidean Nam Bian in the Scottish Highlands . Mountaineer and former Glencoe Mountain Rescue team leader Hamish MacInnes described conditions as ‚Äòhazardous‚Äô. He said: ‚ÄòI was talking about the . danger with a member of the mountain rescue committee just about an hour . before it happened because there was a heavy fall of snow. ‚ÄòIt had been blowing a lot and forming a very fine powder. It was a fairly hazardous situation for avalanche. ‚ÄòI was speaking to some people who . were up the mountain and the snow was drifting quite badly although a . lot of it had gone, the temperature had risen.

With a dash of Grand Marnier, a soup√ßon of Chartreuse, a hefty dose of cognac and a dash of Angostura Bitters, the new 'Winston' cocktail at Melbourne's Club 23 sounds like a delicious treat for liqueur fans. But there's a catch that might just make patrons choke on their drink: the 'Winston' costs a staggering ¬£8,167. As a result, the expensive tipple has now been crowned the world's most expensive cocktail, pushing London's 'Salvatore's Legacy' into second place. Expensive taste: Club 23 bartender Joel Heffernan puts the finishing touches to a 'Winston' cocktail . The hefty price tag is thanks to the ultra-luxe ingredients, which include Grand Marnier Quintessence and Chartreuse Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolonge. Most expensive of the lot is the 1858 Croizet cognac, which costs ¬£99,000 a bottle. The cocktail is served with garnishes that include chocolate nutmeg dust, poppy seed essence, rose essence and a little coconut. Along with deep pockets, those who wish to sample the cocktail will need to place their orders well before they arrive, as the drink takes two days to make, thanks to the labour intensive garnish. The cocktail it replaced at the top of the most expensive list is the 'Salvatore's Legacy' made and sold at the Playboy Club in London's Mayfair for ¬£5,500. Created by longtime mixologist, Salvatore Calabrese, the drink is based on alcohol that pre-dates both American Independence and the French Revolution. Among them are a 1778 Clos de Griffier Vieux Cognac, a 1770 Kummel Liqueur, an 1860 Dubb Orange Curacao and two dashes of Angostura Bitters dating from around 1900. Drink up! Will it be a 'Winston' for owner Shane Warne or regular, singer Delta Goodrem? While Club 23's offering might not have quite the pedigree of the Playboy Club's cocktail, it has certainly made headlines - something the club's owner, former cricketer Shane Warne knows all about. The club opened less than two years ago in November 2011, and Warne, never one to miss out on a party, threw a lavish, star-studded bash to celebrate. Since then, A-listers, including Tiger Woods, Delta Goodrem and former Spice Girl, Mel B, have flocked through the doors to enjoy the plush surroundings. Whether or not they'll splash out on the ¬£8,000 'Winston' remains to be seen.","Invented by Club 23 in Melbourne, the 'Winston' costs ¬£8,167 .
