On paper it looked like an F1 fan's dream come true - a 'VIP trip' to the Belgium Grand Prix courtesy of Red Bull. But the competition winner has since had a complaint to the advertising watchdog upheld after his experience turned out to be far from glamorous. The man, who was accompanied by his brother, was flown on a budget airline via two different countries, had to arrange his own travel for the 150-mile round trip and the pair ended up sharing a hotel bed. Drama: Lewis Hamilton crashes during the Belgium Grand Prix last year - one of the most prestigious races of the year - though the competition winners had to leave early . Missing out: The 'VIP' competition winners missed Jenson Button lift the trophy after winning the Belgium Grand Prix because they had to catch a flight 90 miles away . The pair, who have not been named, were flown to Cologne, Germany, ahead of the race on August 31 last year. They then had to pay their own way to Maastricht in Holland to arrive at their hotel and then travel a further 45 miles to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium. After carrying their suitcases to the track, they were forced to leave early, missing Jenson Button's winning performance, in order to catch their flight home from Brussels Airport another 70 miles away. The competition had promised: 'We're giving one winner a pair of tickets to watch the action as well as flights and accommodation at the four-star Beaumont hotel for two nights.' After their travel woes the brothers had to share a bed because the hotel had ignored their request for two singles. At the race they found their tickets were in grandstand rather than the VIP area. The winner complained to the Advertising Standards Authority, questioning whether the competition had been properly represented and whether the VIP description of the prize was misleading. Red Bull said that the conditions were made clear prior to entry, and pointed out that the Belgium Grand Prix was one of the most prestigious races on the F1 calendar. The ad did not claim that event tickets were VIP and that the VIP headline referred to the entire package which included tickets to the event, flights and accommodation at a four-star hotel. Embarrassing: Red Bull has been rapped after the winner of this 'VIP trip' competition suffered a dreadful experience . Race: The competition winners were flown to Cologne, Germany, and had to pay their way to Maastricht in Holland to arrive at their hotel and then travel a further 45 miles to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps (above) in Belgium . Because the flight was short haul only one class of travel was available and the tickets to the race cost £300 each. Red Bull accepted that the winner flew into Cologne Airport in Germany and was then required to travel to the hotel which was located in the Netherlands and, after travelling to the event in Belgium, returned home from Brussels airport. But the company pointed out that he been informed beforehand that he would have to organise his own travel. Not quite four-star treatment: The pair were forced to share a bed for two nights after a mix-up at the Beaumont hotel in Maastricht, Belgium . The company apologised that despite specifying to the hotel two single beds on behalf of the complainant and his companion, they had failed to provide this. And once it became clear they had to leave early for the return flight they had offered to cover the complainant’s expenses. But the ASA upheld the complaints saying the pitfalls of the holiday had not been made clear. It said: 'We considered that information relating to the different locations of the event, airport and hotel, and that travel to and from them was not included, was significant information likely to influence consumers’ understanding of the promotion and should therefore have been stated clearly in the promotional material.' 'We considered that the term “VIP”, in the context of the ad, was likely to be understood by readers as exclusive, and specifically non-standard, and that they would not expect, unless otherwise stated in the promotion, for the flights to be with a budget airline. 'We also considered that “VIP” had a specific meaning in the ticketing industry and that, given that the Grand Prix issued tickets that included admission to a VIP area, readers would expect the winning tickets to include this. 'The ad must not appear again in its current form.' At least someone had something to celebrate: McLaren technical director Paddy Lowe and Jenson Button shared the champagne after winning the Belgium Grand Prix in September .","Two competition winners had been promised 'VIP' trip to Belgian Grand Prix .

Rio Ferdinand is at the centre of a row over tobacco advertising after anti-smoking charities accused him of promoting a company that owns one of Asia's biggest cigarette brands. The Manchester United defender features in billboard advertisements and YouTube videos in Indonesia that promote Gudang Garam International's internet-based sports channel, Intersport. But the company is one of Indonesia's largest tobacco firms and its cigarettes, flavoured with spices such as cloves and cinnamon, are popular with children. Apology: Manchester United said Rio Ferdinand was sorry for any misunderstanding resulting from his appearance in the ads . A spokesman for Ferdinand, who supports the global children's charity Unicef, insisted that the footballer, who does not smoke, was advertising the sports channel and not tobacco. It appears that Ferdinand, one of many international football stars to appear in the ads, had been unaware that Gudang Garam International makes much of its profits from tobacco or that his image would be used on billboards which carry the cigarette brand logo. Its Intersport channel shows Premier League football matches and helps to raise the profile of English football in Asia, . The spokesman added that Ferdinand was consulting lawyers about the use of his image in the campaign. Talking point: The clip with Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand . The World Health Organisation predicts smoking will kill one billion people worldwide this century. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the anti-smoking group Ash, said sponsorship deals such as this were banned in the UK because of concerns that they promoted cigarettes to young people. She also called on Ferdinand to dissociate himself from GGI. 'Rio talks a good talk about putting children first when he tweets for Unicef, but he has to put his money where his mouth is,' Ms Arnott told The Observer. 'Well over a third of 15-year-old boys in Indonesia smoke and smoking rates among the young have increased sixfold since 1995. 'Rio is estimated to be worth £40m and to earn more than £100,000 a week; does he really need to do this? 'I hope now he realises what he's done he'll apologise.' Separately, Indonesia's National Commission for Child Protection has written to the Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson urging him 'to have this unhealthy promotion removed immediately'. In the YouTube videos, Ferdinand, wearing a red football kit and displaying the GGI corporate badge, says how 'football is everything and everything about football is only on Gudang Garam Intersport'. The final scene cuts to the Intersport logo, which is then followed by the Gudam Garang International logo and a tobacco health warning. The gaffer: United boss Sir Alex Ferguson . Tobacco firms worldwide are keen to cultivate the next generation of smokers, but their efforts are hampered by blanket advertising bans in Europe. No such laws apply in Indonesia, where GGI also operates a music website - which anti-smoking groups claim is another attempt to reach young people. Andrea Crossfield, the director of . Tobacco Free Futures, which is campaigning for cigarettes to be sold in . plain packets in the UK, said: 'I don't believe that it is a coincidence . that Gudang Garam chose a Manchester United player to promote their . brand sponsorship of Indonesian football, as the iconic Manchester . United kit so closely resembles their own cigarette brand colours.' Ian . Gray, from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, told . Environmental Health News:  'We must be concerned about the prevalence . of smoking internationally, particularly in the developing world, where . it is a major killer. 'It is particularly galling to see a prominent UK celebrity recognised by young football supporters the world over participating in such a distasteful and ill-advised campaign.' A United spokeswoman told The Observer: 'The contractual agreement between Rio and Gudang Garam Intersports runs to 31 October 2012, at which time all forms of advertising will cease. 'Both Manchester United and Rio Ferdinand are sorry for this misunderstanding and will endeavour to ensure that it is not repeated in the future.'","Anti-smoking charities accuse the Manchester United star of promoting Indonesian tobacco firm Gudang Garam International .

For the first time in 13 years, the music industry has seen an increase in worldwide revenues, thanks in no small part to British hitmakers. Three UK acts - Adele, One Direction and Mumford & Sons - who all won at the Brits awards last week, helped boost global music sales by 0.3 per cent in 2012 to £10.9billion ($16.5billion). The figures were released yesterday by the International . Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which represents 1,400 record companies worldwide. The growth may be modest, but for an . industry which had seen revenues crash more than 40 per cent since its 1999 peak as it battled rampant internet piracy, it was almost cause to break into song. For the first time in 13 years, the music industry has seen an increase in worldwide revenues - up by 0.3 per cent in 2012 to £10.9bn ($16.5bn) British soul diva Adele helped boost global music revenues with her album 21. Pictured above, performing at the Oscars earlier this week . Adele's album reached 8.3million sales globally, while Mumford & Sons' Babel sold 2.3million . 'It is hard to remember a year for the recording industry that has begun with such a palpable buzz in the air,' said Frances Moore, chief executive of the London-based IFPI. 'These are hard-won successes for an industry that has innovated, battled and transformed itself over a decade. 'They show how the music industry has adapted to the internet world, learned how to meet the needs of consumers and monetised the digital marketplace.' Soul diva Adele's album 21 became the first record to top the global album sales chart . for a second year running - selling 8.3million units in 2012. Also in the top ten best-sellers worldwide were One Direction (with Up All Night and Take Me Home in third and fourth place respectively, each with over 4million sales) and Mumford & Sons at number nine, with Babel which shifted 2.3million.

Meanwhile, Rod Stewart's album, Merry Christmas, Baby, came in at number ten, with sales of 2.6million. The IFPI said paid-for digital music . downloads from sites such as Apple's iTunes, along with other new . sources of revenue, had finally grown enough to compensate for the . decline of CD sales. Digital revenues grew by 9 per cent in 2012, the organisation said, bringing their share of total industry revenues to 34 per cent. Across the world, 4.3billion songs and albums were downloaded in 2012. The IFPI also said subscription-based Internet music services such as Spotify and Rhapsody had leapt 44 per cent last year, giving them 20million users worldwide. Some subscription services allow users to listen to songs for free with adverts played every few minutes, while others provide advertising-free music for a monthly fee. But the IFPI admitted that the industry still faces 'major hurdles' in adjusting to the Internet age. 'Our markets remain rigged by illegal free music,' said Moore. 'This is a problem where governments have a critical role to play, in particular by requiring more cooperation from advertisers, search engines, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and other intermediaries.' The IFPI figures also revealed that Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen topped the global singles chart for 2012 with her single Call Me Maybe, followed by Gotye's Somebody I Used To Know. South Korean sensation Psy came third with Gangnam Style, which made history in December when it became the first YouTube video to be viewed a billion times. Adele wins Best Original Song award at this year's Oscars for Skyfall from the Bond film . Downloads, streaming and the ever-present threat of piracy . Mark Mulligan, of U.K.-based MIDiA consulting, warned that the figures did not mean the industry had put its misery years behind it. 'We're probably near the bottom,' he said, 'but it's so marginal we could easily have another year or two where it could get worse.' The physical music market - everything from vinyl records to DVDs - continues to contract, losing another $500 million in revenue between 2011 and 2012. The industry group has placed its bets on downloads, streaming, and subscription services to make up for lost ground, but there's still a long way to go. Mega man: Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom launches his new file-sharing site 'Mega' surrounded by dancers . Downloads and streaming audio now account for most of the music sold in the United States and Scandinavia, but physical music still accounts for the majority of industry revenue worldwide. Illegal music downloads remain a problem worldwide, particularly in potentially huge markets such as Russia, India, and China. Moore urged governments to follow the example of the international enforcement action against Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, accused by American prosecutors of facilitating millions of illegal downloads. Dotcom, who is fighting an attempt to extradite him from New Zealand to the United States, denies the allegations. The report hailed the action against Megaupload and sites like The Pirate Bay - which has been blocked by several European countries - but it estimated that 32 per cent of all internet users still regularly downloaded pirated music. 'What other industry has to cope with a third of its customers being able to get copies of its products from illegal services?"" Moore said. With growth uneven across various countries and piracy still a stubborn problem, it could take years for the industry to return to its previous health. If it ever does. Mulligan said he believes some of the lost revenue may never be recovered, with many casual users who used to buy the odd CD turning to free services such as YouTube, television music channels, or Internet radio instead. 'This is a case of managed decline,' he said, predicting 'a sustainable but smaller market built around more engaged music fans.'","Worldwide sales rise 0.3% in 2012 to £10.9bn, according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry .

Victim: Virginia Messick, now 21, was raped by her trainer while she was in the Air Force in 2011 . A female Air Force recruit who was raped by her trainer has broken her anonymity to speak out about how she was left with nowhere to turn after the violent attack. Virginia Messick was 19 when she was raped by Staff Sgt Luis Walker at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. When the attack was over, he told her it was fun and they should do it again. Afterwards, he demanded she keep quiet or face being kicked out of the Air Force, and knowing he was the one she would report any wrongdoing to, she felt cornered. 'He told us that he was God, that the . Air Force wasn't going to believe anything we said over him,' she told the New York Times. 'That we were never going to get anywhere - especially the fact that we . were women.' Ms Messick, who is now 21 and has . left the military, is the first of Walker's 10 victims to publicly talk . about the man who gained her trust and then attacked her. Walker, . a married father of two young boys, was found guilty last July of 28 . counts, including rape and sexual assault, and is now serving a 20-year . prison sentence. He was the . first Lackland Air Force Base officer to face a court-martial; in total, . 62 trainees were victims of assault or other improper conduct by 32 . instructors at the base between 2009 and 2012. Walker . singled out Ms Messick, who moved to Texas from a rural Florida town, . just weeks after her arrival and invited her to his office so she could . send emails to friends, which is against military code. Attacker: Staff Sgt. Luis Walker is now serving 20 years in prison for attacking 10 female trainees at the base . During one visit, he groped her and she demanded that he stop, the New York Times reported, and he assured her it would not happen again. But five . weeks into her training in April 2011, Ms Messick had just finished . cleaning a dorm for new arrivals and was putting towels in a . room, unaware that Walker had been hiding behind a door. 'He closed the door behind me and that's . when he proceeded to rape me,' she said. '[He] told me I was going to do . what he wanted me to do or I was going to get kicked out of the Air Force.' She was unable to move or scream, and she was left with overwhelming shock that she had been assaulted by the man the Air Force had entrusted with her life, the Times reported. Nowhere to turn: Ms Messick said she did not report the attack in fear of losing her job in the Air Force . Threats: Walker had told her that she had no chance getting officials to believe her as she was a woman . '[He said] if . I would have said something about it I . would've been putting my own career in jeopardy,' she said. 'So I . didn't report it. I didn't say anything. I didn't talk to anybody.' She . blocked out the attack and continued to train with him for nearly . another month, aware that the person she was supposed to report the . attack to was the person who had attacked her. She also married a friend in the Air Force in a bid for 'some kind of protection' but they divorced months later. She told only one friend that she had 'sex' with Walker, and months later she was approached by Air Force investigators who hauled her into a room for an interview. 'I was so numb to it I didn't even want to talk about it,' she told the New York Times. 'On top of that, it was two strangers. I don't want to talk to two strangers about that.' She eventually gave them a lesser version of what had happened, still fearful of losing her job. Locked up: Walker, a married father of two young boys, is pictured before his sentencing last July . Trial: Walker, right, as he arrived for the fourth day of his trial at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio . None of the victims at Lackland told . officials about the attacks, and they were only revealed when a female . trainee who had not been assaulted went to senior staff. Even . though Ms Messick went on to testify in his court-martial that Walker had raped . her, because she did not say this in earlier interviews, he was only . charged in her case with engaging in an unprofessional relationship involving sodomy and sexual intercourse. But he was eventually found guilty of 28 counts involving 10 trainees. Ms Messick said she has decided to speak out now because she thinks it will be therapeutic. She left the military in 2012 with an injury and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder. A military lawyer arranged for her to . take a therapy program at a nearby Department of Veterans Affairs . hospital and last December she married again. Scene: Lackland Air Force Base is where every American airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year . But she is still bitter about the military and how they have failed to care for her. 'They haven’t come to me or any of the other . girls to ask them what to change,' she said. 'They basically have left me to fend . for myself.' Of the  Air Force instructors who carried out sexual attacks on women trainees, seven have faced a court-martial, including Staff Sgt. Luis Walker. Eight more court-martial cases are pending, while 15 other instructors are under investigation, and two senior officers have been relieved of command, the Times reported. As an increasing number of cases emerge, the military has been accused of failing to resolve a key issue: Women being too afraid to report the attacks because of repercussions for their careers. Moving on: Ms Messick has now left the Air Force and has married. She still suffers from PTSD . More than 3,000 sexual assault cases in . the military were reported in 2011, but Leon Panetta said the actual . figure could be as high as 19,000, with an incidence of one in three . women. In the U.S., commanders make the final decision . over whether criminal charges are brought in military courts, which . varies from other countries where independent military judicial systems . are in place. 'It's no mystery why they don’t come . forward,' Laurie Leitch, a psychologist who deals with assault . cases, told the Times. 'It is like going to your boss to report that you . have been sexually assaulted. How realistic is that?' Lackland is where all Air Force recruits go through basic training. It has about 475 instructors for about 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. While one in five recruits are female, most instructors are male.","Virginia Messick is the first of Staff Sgt Luis Walker's victims to speak out .

The son of . former Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov, the 36-year-old is widely . credited with bringing stability to the war-ravaged region. But he has . been condemned in the international media amid allegations of serious . human rights violations. Depardieu, . who received a Russian passport from President Vladimir Putin last . month, officially became a resident of Saransk on Saturday. Inner Russian: Gerard Depardieu wore a Cossack hat on a visit to the Chechen capital Grozny . The actor, who has denied that he accepted the passport to escape the taxman, has now had it stamped with his new address in Democracy Street, Saransk, a city of 300,000 which lies around  400 miles east of the Russian capital. He has been accused of national betrayal by critics in France, where President Francois Hollande plans to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent for those with an income in excess of 1 million euros. But Depardieu is apparently unfazed by criticism aimed at him in his home country, and was pictured embracing President Putin on a trip to Russia to collect his new passport in January. Controversial: The actor poses for a photograph with Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov (left), who stands accused of human rights abuses . Hospitality: Depardieu was greeted with a hug from dictator Kadyrov when he touched down in Grozny yesterday . Saransk is the provincial capital of the Mordovia region, home to a sprawling web of Soviet-era prison camps, where one of the members of the Pussy Riot band is serving her two-year sentence for an irreverent 'punk prayer' against Putin. Depardieu said at the ceremony that he appreciated the symbolism of his new address. 'I want to be an ambassador of democracy to the world,' he said, according to Russia Today television, which quoted him as saying that 'Russia is a country with a great democracy'. Saransk has otherwise mostly retained Soviet-era street names. Democracy Street is surrounded by Proletariat, Communist, Soviet and Bolshevik streets. Local cuisine: The newly-minted Russian citizen inspected some local cheese on a visit to a factory outside Saransk . Culture: The actor walks among a group of actors wearing traditional clothing on a visit to the Mordovian national culture centre outside Saransk . New address: Depardieu visited an agricultural complex in his new hometown of Saransk during his tour . Depardieu, who has starred in films such as 'Green Card' and 'Cyrano de Bergerac', enjoys broad popularity in Russia and received an enthusiastic welcome in the city. Showing off his knowledge of local history, Depardieu likened himself to Yemelyan Pugachev, the chief of a peasant rebellion in the 18th century. 'Yemelyan Pugachev was a peasant tsar who came to Kazan and to Saransk,' Depardieu said, according to Russia Today. 'I am like Pugachev: I am a peasant, and I want to be tsar of Saransk.' Depardieu was registered at an apartment belonging to the relatives of his Russian friend, the head of the Gosfilmofond state film archive, Nikola Bordachev. It is not clear if Depardieu will actually live in the apartment, and he has no requirement to spend any particular amount of time there - though he promised to visit the city often. Depardieu's decision to accept citizenship has earned sarcastic comments from Putin's critics, who say the actor is a tool of Kremlin spin.","Actor has a new permanent address in Russia, where income tax is 13% .

Locked up: Thomas Coutts has been jailed for ten years after he grabbed a 20-year-old woman from behind and dragged her into bushes where he gagged, handcuffed and raped her at knifepoint . A rapist who attacked a random woman because he was angry at being dumped by his girlfriend made a 'pinky promise' with his terrified victim not to kill her. Thomas Coutts, 21, grabbed the 20-year-old woman from behind and dragged her into bushes where he gagged, handcuffed and raped her at knifepoint. During the brutal attack, Coutts locked his little finger with hers and promised he would not kill the terrified woman after she begged for her life. Afterwards, Coutts ran off leaving the traumatised victim to stagger into the road to raise the alarm. He was arrested for the rape in Poole, Dorset, and jailed for 10 years by a judge who said he had 'eked out his revenge' on the unfortunate victim after being dumped. Coutts, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, went out at 1am armed with a knife and handcuffs and 'selected' the woman as she walked home alone while listening to music on her headphones. He placed his hand over her mouth and forced her into nearby bushes and began tearing her clothes with the knife. Carolyn Branford-Wood, prosecuting, read out a statement on behalf of the woman to Bournemouth Crown Court at the sentencing hearing. It said: 'I immediately started screaming and I was pulled to the ground and the man kept telling me to be quiet. 'I told him ""I'm not going to make any noise, just please don't kill me, I'm not going to recognise you"".' Miss Branford-Wood said: 'She made a determined decision not to look at him in the face so that by not being able to recognise him she hoped that would safeguard her in some way. 'He kissed her and promised he was not going to hurt her, and held her little finger with his and said he was making a pinky promise, as he called it.' The court heard that the woman was now too scared to go out alone and had lost her job since the attack. Investigation: Police officers assess the scene in Poole, Dorset, where the attack took place in August last year . Coutts pleaded guilty to charges of rape and sexual assault that happened on August 20 last year. In a pre-sentence report his ex-girlfriend, who has a young child by him, described how Coutts had a 'controlling sexual nature towards her'. Judge John Harrow told him: 'It would seem that after your girlfriend told you she wanted to end your relationship you decided to eke your revenge out on an unfortunate young woman. 'You went out at night armed with a knife and handcuffs and selected your victim, a clearly vulnerable young woman who was oblivious to any danger. Attack: The court heard Coutts went out at 1am armed with a knife and handcuffs and 'selected' the woman as she walked home alone while listening to music on her headphones . 'This must have been a terrifying and almost indescribable experience for her. 'I've read what your girlfriend said about you and you had a rough and controlling sexual nature towards her.' The judge said he was handing Coutts an extended prison sentence because he is 'dangerous'. Miss Branford-Wood, crown advocate for the CPS Wessex, said afterwards: 'This young woman has clearly been the victim of a terrifying ordeal. 'She is to be commended not only for having the courage to report this crime but also in supporting a prosecution. 'We hope that this conviction and sentence will bring some closure to the victim and will enable her to move on with her life.' Coutts must serve two-thirds of his 10 year sentence before being considered for release and will then serve five years on licence.","Thomas Coutts jailed for ten years for raping 20-year-old woman .

Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott on their wedding day, joked about the night of the fatal blaze to a police officer just a week later, a court has heard . A father accused of killing his six children in a house fire joked about the night of the fatal blaze to a police officer just a week later, a court has heard. PC Joanne Halford told Nottingham Crown Court that Michael Philpott, 56, seemed 'jovial' when she spoke to him at Royal Derby Hospital in the early hours of May 18. She told jurors: 'He was laughing and joking about the incident saying that when he was trying to rescue the children he had took his chance to hit out at two coppers trying to hold him back.' Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead are on trial for the manslaughter of their six children along with a third defendant Paul Mosley following a fire at their house in Allenton, Derby, on May 11 last year. A week after the fire, which the three are accused of setting to frame Philpott’s former mistress Lisa Willis, PC Halford said she met Philpott at the hospital, where the bodies of the youngsters were being held, at around 1.30am. The police constable told the court that when she asked him what he was doing at the hospital, Philpott said to her 'I’m here to see you gorgeous. Paul Mosley’s brother Brian, who was with Philpott, asked PC Halford: 'Don’t you know who he is? He’s Mick Philpott, father of the six dead kids.' She told the court the statement seemed to be used like a 'badge of honour'. Richard Latham QC asked her: 'How was that statement being used to you?' PC Halford replied: 'I describe it as a badge of honour'. Philpott alleged that neighbour Adam Taylor, who was later arrested and released without charge, had set the blaze because he had borrowed a strimmer and a petrol can from him two weeks before the fire and had failed to return the petrol can. Deadly blaze: Philpott surrounded by the six children whose lives were claimed by the fatal house fire last May . He also told her that he was angry police had asked him about his family background and that it was none of their business, PC Halford told the court. She said he was 'cross' that his wife Mairead had disclosed information to them, including about threesomes the couple had in the past. PC Halford told the court that when she returned from phoning the information Philpott had given her to her colleagues, Philpott seemed 'jovial' in an office inside the hospital. 'He was jovial, laughing and jolly with the other men in there,' she told the court. Scene: Flowers are left outside the house where the children died in the fire . The police constable also told the court Philpott inferred that he would like her to join him at the hotel where he and Mairead were staying following the fire at their home. The court also heard evidence from a family friend who said she saw Mosley and Philpott at the hospital on the night of the fire on May 11. Claire Smith said she saw co-accused Mosley arrive at the hospital and thought it was Philpott’s brother. 'He does look very similar to Mick and I thought he was Mick’s brother', Ms Smith told the court this morning. She said she saw the pair go down the side of Royal Derby Hospital away from everybody else for about half an hour. 'Was anyone else with them?', Mr Latham asked her. 'No', Ms Smith replied. 'Could you hear what they were saying?', Mr Latham asked. 'No,' she replied. Ms Smith told the court it seemed strange to her, when Philpott already knew he had lost five of his children and that his surviving son Duwayne was fighting for his life. Giving evidence she said: 'You have just lost your five children. You’ve got your other one in the hospital. Everyone reacts differently but me on my hand, why would I want to go and talk to my friend for half and hour when my son is lying in hospital fighting for his life.' Ms Smith told the court Mrs Philpott seemed very distressed when she saw her at the hospital.'She was very distressed. Like anyone would be when they’ve lost their children. She was very upset.' The court also heard Mosley offered his cousin Steve Owen money to get him 'out of' Derby when he saw him last year. Giving evidence this afternoon, Mr Owen told the court he had had little contact with his cousin since 2001 but had seen him in the street in Alvaston last September. On Trial: Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead (pictured here at a press conference after the fatal fire) are on trial for the manslaughter of their six children, along with a third defendant Paul Mosley, following a fire at their house . The meeting came after Mosley was first arrested and released by police in June last year in connection with the fire. Jurors heard Mosley asked his cousin why he had been arrested in connection with the case.Mr Owen told the court: 'He told me he never did anything but that he knew more than the police knew about it'. He said Mosley offered him £10,000 to take him out of Derby and claimed he had been given the money by a national newspaper for his story. Mr Owen said he didn't believe his cousin until he saw reports that Mosley had been charged on Sky News. He told the court he then went to the police. In his police statement, Mr Owen said during the meeting in September Mosley had also told him he was 'at the scene' when the fire was started. He said in his statement that Mosley was 'there at the time the fire was started, then left and then came back', the court heard. Mr Owen also told police Mosley had said he knew 'more about the incident than the police.'Mosley was rearrested and charged in November. Prosecutors have alleged Mosley, with the Philpotts, set the fire at the couple's house to frame Philpott's former mistress Lisa Willis. Miss Willis left the three-bedroomed house she shared with the Philpotts and their children in February, taking her five children with her. Jurors have heard Philpott was due to attend a custody hearing with Miss Willis to discuss residency of the five children, four of which he had fathered, on the day of the blaze. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow morning. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","PC Joanne Halford tells court Philpott seemed 'jovial' week after fire .

Facing jail: Ursula Rose, pictured today, was found guilty of fraud and theft totaling more than £20,000 today . A primary school teaching assistant who pretended she had terminal brain cancer to trick colleagues into handing her £20,000 for 'life saving treatment' faces jail. Former colleagues cheered from the public gallery after Ursula Rose was found guilty of theft and fraud at Croydon Crown Court today. The 42-year-old said she had 'tumours in her head', which were in fact headaches caused by stress. Nevertheless she still claimed she needed to finance private Harley Street treatment for the illness, and her friends spiralled into debt after taking out loans and withdrawing money from their childrens' accounts to help. Mother-of-four Rose, who worked at Saint Thomas Becket school in South Norwood, denied she invented the illness - instead claiming her victims volunteered to help her with money problems. But a jury of six men and six women found Rose guilty of four counts of fraud, by falsely representing that she had a life-threatening illness, on various dates between September 30 2008 and July 31 2009. Rose stared straight ahead as the jury gave her verdict, but former friends and colleagues stood up and shouted with joy as the verdict was returned. Prosecutor Claire Robinson previously told Croydon Crown Court Rose had . repeatedly made false representations to friends and work colleagues . that she was suffering from cancer, and that she had tumours in her head. She said: 'She did this to get their sympathy, to get loans of money from them. This was dishonest and calculated to make people feel sorry for her. 'Over a number of years she repeatedly told friends and colleagues that she was severely ill with cancer and she was doing it in order to gain money from people.' Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave the defendant £3,000 after Rose convinced her she feared dying on the operating theatre table during a £37,000 private operation and felt her husband would not cope financially. 'She told her and others that the brain tumours were growing aggressively and she was going for daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment' Miss Robinson said. Work: Ursula Rose had a job at St. Thomas Becket primary school in South Norwood, south London, where she defrauded colleagues . 'Conned': Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave the defendant £3,000 after Rose said her husband would not cope financially if she died . 'She was told by Ursula Rose that one of the tumours was wrapped around a main artery near her temple and it could kill her at any moment. 'She said it was terminal and at level four and she needed an operation that was too dangerous for the NHS so was paying £37,000 to go private. 'Mrs Trype's two daughters had money in their savings and she borrowed that, intending to repay it with a lump sum from her pension,'  explained Miss Robinson. She said Rose took time off work for the non-existent 'operation' and when she returned told colleagues it had been partially successful, but a £7,000 American wonder drug could combat the remaining life-threatening tumour. Guilty: The jury at Croydon Crown Court found Rose guilty today, and she now faces jail . In June, 2009 staff attended a fundraiser at Croydon's Bar Txt, contributing to a collection aimed at raising money for the new drug. Another member of staff, Allison Patmore, gave Rose £6,500 as a deposit on a £40,000 private Harley Street operation - again claiming it was too dangerous for the NHS -  the court was told. Mrs Patmore took out a £6,200 loan, plus £300 cash from her bank account, accepting Rose's claim she would be repaid when her home was remortgaged. Rose told long-time friend Michelle Willis she had only six months to live and needed a strong dose of radiotherapy - knowing her pal had money remaining from a recent house sale. Mrs Willis gave her £5,000 and a few weeks later Rose asked for another £5,500 to avoid her home being repossessed. The friend convinced her own daughter, Sarah, to give Rose the money. Eventually the school's headmaster, Noel Campbell, received confirmation from Rose's doctor at Mayday University hospital that she never had cancer. 'He said she did not, and never had, brain tumours, but suffered from tension-like headaches.' Rose then resigned in February, 2010, telling the headmaster she had been given the cancer all-clear and was cured.","Ursula Rose, 42, found guilty of four counts of fraud today .

Flat pack shelters that take just 30 minutes to assemble have been designed to help save lives during natural disaster. When earthquakes, storms, floods, forest and bushfires and landslides hit a region, one of the problems faced by rescue and humanitarian services is providing a safe place to treat the wounded and provide shelter for those who have lost their homes.

Scroll down for video . Flexible: The Modularflex disaster shelter can be assembled in half an hour to shelter displaced survivors of hurricanes and other disasters . The shelters feature electrical points and even in-built LED lighting . The folding design means it can be assembled by two man teams or, for ease and speed, simply 'popped-up' using a crane. They also have a hinge that allows them to be collapsed like accordions. The company says the shelters are lightweight, flexible and sturdy and, when folded flat and not in use, packed six to a group on the back of a truck, meaning they can be transported easily and efficiently to wherever they are needed most, without needing unwieldy heavy machinery. The walls are made from insulated . thermal panels, similar to a supermarket cold storage room, and can . withstand temperatures ranging from -20C° to 49C°. A hinge in the centre upright wall means the Modularflex can be built even quicker if lifted by a crane . The modular design means that a number of the shelters can be used to create larger dwellings with as many doors and windows as needed. Each model also comes with electrical wiring and LED lights. They also come in different designs, such as camouflage for the military or a red cross for humanitarian efforts. The Modularflex was launched last year at an Expo in Buenos Aires and the creators are currently in negotiations with mining companies to provide housing for workers as well as the Argentine armed forces.

These dramatic-looking spiders may seem like they're getting ready to attack, but this colourful display from male peacock spiders is in fact a mating ritual. Similar to peacock birds, where this spider gets its nickname from, the male flashes its brightly coloured, iridescent stomach flaps in a bid to attract females. And even if these arachnids did attack, they wouldn't get far because the adults only grow to about 5mm long. Scroll down to video . Male peacock spiders extend their legs and flash their colourful, iridescent abdominal flaps to attract a mate . Peacock spiders are members of the jumping spiders family, renowned for being tiny. Adults only grow up to around 5mm in length . While the male peacock spiders carry out their mating ritual, the females carefully study the colouring, vibrations and movements to make sure the potential suitor is healthy and the correct species to mate with . This is the Maratus harrisi species of peacock spider that is traditionally found in the Namadgi National Park in New South Wales. The ruler is shown for scale . When a male peacock spider senses a female it will begin the mating ritual by lifting its legs and flashing its stomach in a sequence that looks like a dance routine. The females carefully study the colouring, vibrations and movements of the male to make sure the potential suitor is healthy and the correct species to mate with. Once he has mated, he will repeat this dance with as many females as he can find and Maratus spiders can have multiple partners at one time. There are 20 known species of peacock . spiders living in Australia, yet they're so hard to come by only eight . have been formally identified. The species was first described by Octavius Pickard-Cambridge in the late nineteenth century. He said at the time: 'it is difficult to describe adequately the great beauty of the coloring of this spider.' The photos shown here were taken by entomologist Jurgen Otto, and published in An illustrated review of the known peacock spiders of the genus Maratus from Australia. This photo shows the Maratus mating with a female. The females are brown with black marks and are dull in comparison to the males . The tiny, colourful spiders all come . from the Maratus genus of arachnids, and are members of the Salticidae . family of jumping spiders. It was first thought that the colourful stomach flaps were used to help the jumping Maratus spiders glide. Because of this they were initially . nicknamed gliding spiders.

In Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, four brothers fight in the Second World War – and only one comes out alive. But there is a British family that can go not only one, but five better. And in the case of the Windsor brothers, all nine lived to tell the tale. What's more, one of the siblings also fought in the First World War, along with two older brothers. Heroes: From left, (top row) Arthur, who was the father of researcher Bob, then Bill and Albert, (second row) Harry, Jim, Tom (third row) Dick, Sid and Wally . The record-breaking contribution by the Windsor family of North London to the battle against Hitler had been largely forgotten. It was only rediscovered by 68-year-old Bob Windsor as he researched his family tree. He knew that both his father Albert . and an uncle Wally served in the war but a visit to the 90-year-old . Wally revealed the true scale of the family's contribution. He discovered how Albert – 41 when he . enlisted – signed up at the same time as Jim, 37, Harry, 35, Bill, 33, . Arthur, 31, Tom, 30, Dick, 27, Sid, 23 and Wally, 18. Albert and three brothers served in . the Army while four served in the RAF, with Dick serving in the Royal . Navy. Mr Windsor made the discovery when he spotted a framed Guinness . World Records' certificate on the wall of his Uncle Wally's home. It acknowledged that Albert and eight younger brothers held the record for the most siblings to fight in the Second World War. Special legacy: Bob Windsor with the Guinness World Records certificate that his father and eight brothers received for their war effort . Mr Windsor said: 'It makes me . intensely proud. The fact is, this record is never going to be beaten. Big families are a thing of the past. 'It's a shame I never knew about the amazing story. My father and his brothers just grew apart over the years. Inspiring: The award that 68-year-old Mr Windsor spotted on the living room wall after he tracked down the last surviving brother, 90-year-old Wally . 'They never thought it was particularly exceptional that they had all fought in the war – they saw it as just doing their duty. 'They also never knew about the award. It was Wally's son who notified Guinness about the record.' He said he feared the worst as he delved into the family's past and and into why his father and uncles had all drifted apart. 'I was expecting to find some dark tale of murder or scandal but instead made this wonderful discovery,' he said. 'Every time I think about it, it just hits me how much of an amazing story this really is.' He said he had not managed to find out . all the details of the brothers' war service, but added: 'I do know . that Sid bumped into Wally while out in India.

An extract from The Buffalo Evening News from July 8, 1944, covering the tragedy of the Niland brothers . Steven Spielberg's 1998 epic Saving Private Ryan tells the story of a WWII mission in Normandy to find paratrooper James Ryan (played by Matt Damon) - the last surviving of four soldier brothers - and return him to his family. Although a work of fiction, the story was based on the Sole Survivor policy, introduced by the U.S. War Department in 1942. It was brought in to prevent an entire generation of serving relatives being wiped out - a decision taken following the tragedy of the five Sullivan brothers. When the USS Juneau was sunk in November, 1942, in the South Pacific, it led to the deaths of the five boys from Waterloo, Iowa. When they signed up, brothers George, 27, Francis, 26, Joseph 24, Madison, 23, and Albert, 20 had insisted that they not be separated. Tragically, following the torpedo attack, Francis, Joseph and Madison were instantly killed; Albert drowned a day later; while George lasted around four days on a life raft before disappearing. However, it is believed that Spielberg's main source of inspiration came from the case of the Niland family. Of the four brothers, just two survived the war - but it was believed at the time that only one, Frederick, had made it back alive. Sergeant Frederick 'Fritz' Niland was a member of the 101st Airborne's 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment. He was dropped into Normandy on June 6, 1944, landed near Carentan, and made his way back to the rest of his unit.

His three siblings, however, were in other units: Technical Sergeant Robert Niland with the 82nd Airborne Division (505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, Company D); Lieutenant Preston Niland with the 4th Infantry Division (22nd Infantry Regiment); and Technical Sergeant Edward Niland as a pilot in the Army Air Force. In Normandy, Robert was killed on D-Day; and Preston died near Utah beach. Edward, who had been shot down over Burma in May, 1944, was missing presumed dead. In keeping with Sole Survivor, Fritz was sent home to his family in New York. He would later learn that Edward had in fact spent a year in a Japanese PoW camp and was later rescued by the British.","Bob Windsor, 68, found a Guinness World Record on the wall of the last remaining brother .

In its first 30 days of operation, an average of 400 soldiers a day used the simulators, including some from the 3rd Division.

When a deer and her fawn were trapped on the thin ice of a frozen harbour in Canada, rescue workers decided it was too risky to go out and help the stricken animal. The mother was exhausted after hauling itself out of the freezing water of Antigonish Harbour in Nova Scotia after repeatedly crashing through the ice and could not even stand up on the treacherous surface. Not wanting to leave the deer and its offspring to their fate, a skilled helicopter pilot hit on an ingenious solution - blow the deer to shore using the downdraft from his helicopter's rotors. Scroll down for video . A deer and that was trapped on the thin ice of a Canadian harbour with her faun was rescued by a skilled helicopter pilot, who used the rotors to blow the stricken animal to waiting rescue workers on the shore . Ian Waugh, a retired biologist from Alberta, says he spotted the deer struggling on the ice last month and reported it to the Department for Natural Resources (DNR), which decided it was too risky to rescue the animal on foot. 'It caught my eye that the female was down on the ice and every time she tried to get up, she would fall back down and she was splayed out,' he told CTV. A few hours later, Waugh spotted a DNR helicopter near the mother and the alarmed fawn ran to shore as the chopper descended. He was amazed by what happened next. Airborne: A Department of Natural Resources helicopter hovers near the deer and frightens off the fawn . Skilled: The pilot manouevres to the side of the animal and tilts the rotors . Air rescue: The deer slides on the ice, propelled by the downdraft of the chopper . 'The wash, because the ice was so smooth, the wash was so powerful that it actually started to push the deer,' says Waugh, who recorded the incredible rescue on camera. At first the terrified animal struggled, but as it realised it was moving towards safety it stopped struggling and allowed itself to be blown along. Once it hit dry land, a DNR officer and the pilot helped it to its feet and sent it on its way. Waugh later saw the deer and her fawn reunited in the woods. He said: 'It was just brilliant. It was a solution exactly tailored to the situation.' The action was captured by retired biologist Ian Waugh, who often photographs wildlife in the region . When the deer reaches the shore it is pulled to safety by waiting Department of Natural Resources officers. The animal was later reunited with her fawn . A department official said it’s not always practical to help wild animals in distress, but that they will assist on a case-by-case basis if it’s appropriate and safe. Loyola MacDonald runs a store in nearby St. Andrews and says her brother was one of the officers who helped the deer. She has been showing the video to customers. 'Everybody I’ve shown it is more than impressed with it and was quite amazed at the situation and the wonderful outcome that happened with the deer,' she said.","The exhausted animal was trapped on the thin ice of a Canadian harbour .

Decision: Banbury Town Council is planning to spend up to £10,000 on a replica chain to protect the current regalia, pictured here being worn by the mayor, Councillor Tony Ilott . Leaders of a cash-strapped council have been criticised for planning to splash up to £10,000 of taxpayers' money on a fake chain for the town mayor. Conservative-run Banbury Town Council is planning to fork out the money for the replica ceremonial chain to protect the current 'irreplaceable' gold regalia from getting damaged or lost. The mayor's current chain is worth £25,000 and taxpayers have been left baffled at the decision to spend so much on a fake version, having managed with the current one for 140 years. Councillor Tony Ilott would don the new gold-plated ceremonial wear for 'out-of-hours' engagements such as public appearances and charity events across the Oxfordshire town, if it is bought. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance today branded the move 'ridiculous'. He said: 'Banbury residents will be staggered that town council leaders think that now is the right time to buy a replica chain, after presumably coping without one for nearly 140 years. '£10,000 is an eye-wateringly large sum to spend on such frippery when budgets are so tight. 'Anyone spending taxpayers' money needs to ensure that they are delivering value with every penny in the budget and after this ridiculous waste of money Banbury residents will seriously question the town council's sense of priorities.' Councillor Ilott said although no money had yet been spent, the council had decided to get quotes to see how much the replica would cost. He said: 'The council wanted to go and get three quotes. We could, if we wanted to, spend up to £10,000 without bringing it back to the council.' He said the council was still waiting for the third quote. He said: 'When we get the third quote it will go back to the committee who will then make a decision on whether or not we go along with it, but we haven't spent a single penny yet.' Regalia: Councillor Tony Ilott (pictured left wearing the original) will don the new gold-plated ceremonial wear for 'out-of-hours' engagements. Pictured right is Banbury Town Hall . Labour group leader Steve Kilsby said his party regretted backing the decision, which was made last year. Cllr Kilsby said: 'My feeling is if the Labour group had looked at this again we probably would have voted differently.' While . fellow Labour councillor Sean Woodcock, who represents the Banbury . Ruscote ward, added: 'We're seeing here how the council is struggling to . balance budgets and my concern is whether this is the right time to be . spending a lot of money on a piece of fake regalia.' Labour . councillor Patrick Cartledge said: 'We understand that the last thing . people want to see in these hard times is money spent on putting a chain . around someone's neck.' Defence: Council leader Councillor Kieron Mallon has defended the decision, saying it went through full council meetings and opposition had only recently arisen . Locals in the small market town also expressed their disbelief at the 'waste' of taxpayers' money. Mechanic . and father-of-four Brian Galloway, 50, said: 'There are dozens of other . issues that need addressing in this town that money should be spent on . rather than something which is there for vanity reasons. 'I cannot believe this decision. It's not even that much cheaper than the real one.' Council leader Councillor Kieron Mallon has defended the decision. He said: 'Our civic regalia is irreplaceable. 'The chain dates to 1874. If you compare it to other towns it is second to none. 'Without cutting anything else from the budget and without raising council tax, we decided to look at the possibility of creating a replica.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 12:44 EST, 4 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 4 December 2012 . After a gun accident took off half his face, Richard Lee Norris spent 15 years living as a recluse. Horribly disfigured, he hid indoors. When he ventured out, it was behind a baseball cap and surgical mask. He didn’t pursue a career and never married. Now, seven months after undergoing the most extensive face transplant in history, 37-year-old Norris is finally coming out of hiding. Thanks to a combination of potent medications and dogged determination, Norris is healing faster than anyone expected, according to his doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center, where his transplant was performed. Scroll down for video . Second chance at life: Richard Lee Norris, 37, is now able to go out after years of living as a recluse following his full face transplant . Extensive injuries: After a gun accident in 1997, Norris spent his life as a recluse at his Virginia home until his face transplant in March (right) 'We as doctors do the operation, but the rest is up to you as the patient,' said Eduardo Rodriguez, a dentist and surgeon at UMMC. 'You have to carry the ball.' Mr Norris, Rodriguez says, took the ball and ran with it. By the time Norris, from Hillsville, Virginia, was selected as a transplant candidate in 2005, he had already undergone more than a dozen operations attempting to give him functional use of his mouth. Despite the numerous surgeries, certain facial features - such as his lips, nose and the front of his tongue - were beyond repair. Handsome: How Mr Norris looked prior to his devastating gun accident in 1997 . 'After several attempts at reconstruction, it became apparent it wasn’t going to work,' Norris, who declined to be interviewed in person, said in a written statement. 'The face transplant was one of my very few options left.' The 36-hour operation was completed in March and involved more than 150 doctors, nurses and UMMC staff members. 'Everything from the scalp to the mid-line of my neck was replaced, including the jaw bones, teeth, part of my tongue, muscles, and nerves' said Norris, who has retained his eyesight through the gun accident and the subsequent surgeries. The days immediately following the transplant were promising. Norris was taken off his postoperative ventilator, and within the first week he was able to shave his face and brush his teeth. When Norris saw his new face in a mirror for the first time, he wrote: 'The only thing I could do was hug Dr. Rodriguez.' He spent the first two months following the surgery in the hospital. The goal at that time, Rodriguez said, was to reduce inflammation and stymie the risk of rejection through high doses of immuno-suppressing drugs. In May, Norris was discharged but instructed to remain in the Baltimore area, where he could meet with his transplant team as well as a psychologist, a social worker, and speech and physical therapists multiple times each week. Finally, Norris was allowed to return home to Hillsville, in southwest Virginia, where he does his speech therapy 'homework' and meets with his local physician. He returns to Baltimore once or twice a month for checkups with Rodriguez and other doctors. Watch video here: . 'I have been doing very well regaining my speech back,' Norris said. 'Each day it improves a little more.' There was, however, one hiccup in the recovery process: the much-feared rejection. As . with any transplant, there was a possibility that Norris’s body would . reject his new face. In this case, the rejection was mild and treatable, . Rodriguez said. 'When people hear ''rejection,'' they think, ''Oh, my God, the face is going to melt off,''' Rodriguez said. 'That’s not the case at all. The skin . got a little bit swollen and there was a little bit of redness. On a . scale of 1 to 10,” with 10 being the worst-case scenario, “this was a . Grade 1 rejection.' Still, . Norris is not in the clear. He continues to run the risk of rejection . and he will have to take medications for the rest of his life. Rebuilding process: Mr Norris's skull after his accident (left) and as surgeons began to piece it back together (right) Remarkable: After a 36-hour operation, doctors had reconstructed the lower half of Mr Norris's face . Rodriguez said that one of the most common questions he is asked is: 'How is Richard dealing with having a new face?' Dr Rodriguez said: 'We always think . that there is going to be a facial identity crisis. That’s the worry of . people with normal faces. We think how we’d feel if this happened to us. 'But for people with disfigurements — . these people have lived lives concealed from society. That’s a very . different and difficult recovery.' Before . the transplant, Norris rarely left his home. In addition to wearing a . surgical mask and baseball cap on his infrequent trips out in public, he . did his shopping at night so he wouldn’t have to face the stares of as . many people. 'I am now able to walk past people and no one even gives me a second look,' he wrote. After . years of going out of his way to avoid people, Norris is surprisingly . comfortable socializing now, Rodriguez said. 'Everybody (at the . hospital) knows him. He’s such an animated guy.' While Norris’s results are 'extraordinary,' Rodriguez said the full recovery will take more time. There’s the challenge of teaching Norris, who has not eaten or spoken properly for 15 years, to use his fully functional face. The teeth plus the tongue is a lot to . get used to when someone has gone so long without them, Rodriguez said. Additionally, minor surgery is planned for the soft tissue of his face, . such as the eyelids where there is extra skin. But . more than anything else, there is a looming question. Even with . immuno-suppressing drugs, doctors say they have no idea how long the . transplant will last. There is an expectation that they will have to . repair or replace the transplant eventually. Dr . Rodriguez looks with hope to earlier face transplants. The world’s . first full face transplant took place in Spain in 2010 and is aging well . two years later. The first partial transplant was done in France in . 2005, and Rodriguez said its longevity is promising. 'I’d like to hit that 10-year mark with Richard,' he said. 'Of course, we can’t promise anything, but 10 years would be great.' In the meantime, Norris said he is excited to fish, golf and spend time with his family and friends. 'My friends have moved on with their . lives, starting families and careers,' he said. 'I can now start working . on the life given back to me.'","Richard Lee Norris, 37, spent years hiding behind a mask and only shopping at night after sustaining horrific injuries in 1997 .

Decline: Frozen burger sales have dropped by 43 per cent since evidence of horse meat contamination first emerged . Supermarket shoppers are abandoning the frozen food aisles as sales of burgers and ready meals plummet in the wake of the horse meat scandal. Frozen burger sales are down by 43 per cent  and frozen ready meals by 13 per cent since traces of horse DNA were first found in products on sale in Britain on January 16. Despite the evidence of customers turning their backs on frozen food, surveys have revealed significant numbers of consumers would be happy to eat horse meat - provided it was labelled correctly. Two polls found large numbers of Britons would eat horse meat as long as it was 'safe' and properly labelled. The evidence of British meat eaters' willingness to try horse emerged after it was discovered in a huge consignment of meatballs being served up in Ikea restaurants last week. French owned catering firm Sodexo withdrew the suspect products from outlets in the UK and 12 other countries on Friday - without telling consumers why. Details of the contaminated frozen beef products only emerged following the publication of test results by food watchdogs in the Czech Republic. Last week also saw supermarket giant Tesco make the shocking admission that the 'minced beef' in its Everyday Value range frozen bolognese contained up to 100 per cent horse meat. The ready meals were produced by Comigel, a French firm also linked to contaminated products at Findus and Aldi. New figures for . the 12 weeks to February 17 indicate how consumers have responded to the . scandal, and suggests shoppers are changing the products they buy . rather than the supermarkets they buy them from. Edward . Garner, director of Kantar Worldpanel, which compiled the figures, said: 'The issue has so far only affected the performance of . individual markets rather than where consumers are choosing to shop. 'For the four weeks ending February . 17, frozen burger sales were down by 43 per cent and frozen ready meals . declined by 13 per cent, clearly demonstrating a change in shopping . habits. 'Tesco's share has come under . pressure this period with a drop from 30.1 per cent a year ago to 29.7 . per cent now,' said Mr Garner. Criticism: A survey revealed 43 per cent of shoppers regard Findus' response to the horse meat scandal as 'poor' He added that the decline should not . be attributed entirely to horse meat contamination, as the supermarket . giant introduced heavy promotions this time in 2012 which have not been . repeated for 2013. Nestle - the world’s biggest food comapny - announces it is removing beef ready meals from sale in Italy and Spain after its own tests found more than one per cent horsemeat DNA in its beef ravioli and tortellini. Birds Eye removes three beef ready meals from sale in the UK and Ireland after one of its products being sold in Belgium tested positive for horse DNA . Pub giant Whitbread - which owns Beefeater, Brewers Fayre, Table Table, Taybarns and Premier Inn - confirms it has found horsemeat in its products. Tesco reveals its Everyday value spaghetti bolognese contained up to 100 per cent horsemeat. Revealed that packs of Findus frozen lasagne meals being sold around the UK contained up to 100 per cent horse meat. The lasagne packs were manufactured by French company, Comigel, at a plant in Metz, which produces food for supermarkets in Britain and Europe. Comigel makes a range of beef products for Tesco and Aldi. Both stores begin removing those products as a ‘precautionary measure’. Asda removes four own-label brands of frozen burgers from sale following the discovery of beef contaminated with horse meat at a manufacturer in Northern Ireland. Burger King admits to selling burgers contaminated with horsemeat, . Emerges that Asda and Co-op have also been selling burgers contaminated with horsemeat. Hotel chain Premier Inn removes beef burgers supplied by the company from its restaurants. It has also revealed schools and hospitals have been serving beef contaminated with horsemeat. Last week it emerged horse meat had been detected in meatballs on sale in Ikea's in-house restaurants. 'Not repeating this offer will have adversely affected its share,' he said. He added: 'Waitrose and Aldi deliver all-time record shares this period of 4.8 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively,' he said. Mr Garner added that 10.1 per cent . growth at Iceland indicated the frozen food category as a whole 'remains . robust' despite the impact on burger and ready meal sales. A survey of almost 14,000 meat eaters found 51 per cent would buy horse meat as long as they knew it was bred for eating and was therefore safe. Of those who said they would eat horse meat, 29 per cent said it would need to be cheaper than beef. However, 48 per cent said they would refuse horse meat outright, even it if was free, according to the survey conducted by MoneySavingExpert.com. Founder Martin Lewis said: 'With a majority of meat-eaters saying they would consider buying horse meat, the mislabelling scandal may have opened the door for providers of horse meat into the UK. 'Many who have, albeit unwittingly, already eaten it, now say if it were properly labelled they'd give it a go.' A separate survey by Ipsos Mori found consumers aged 45 to 54 are the most likely to be willing horse meat consumers (38 per cent), while those aged 16 to 24 are the least likely (21 per cent). It revealed 33 per cent of Britons expect to buy fewer ready meals in future and 18 per cent will choose fewer Findus products in particular, with 43 per cent saying they considered the company's response to the crisis to be 'poor'. However they are slightly less critical of other food brands affected by the scandal, with 35 per cent rating Tesco's response as poor and 34 per cent disapproving of Aldi's reaction, while 12 per cent said they planned to reduce their spending at Tesco. The majority (59 per cent) said the Government should do more to regulate food safety.Ipsos Mori spokesman Stephen Yap said: 'Our findings clearly show that the news of horse meat entering the food supply is having a profound impact on British consumers and has eroded trust in food suppliers. Changing shopping habits: A survey found 35 per cent of customers regard Tesco's response to the crisis as 'poor', and 12 per cent plan to reduce their spending at the supermarket . 'Findus in particular is bearing the brunt of public anger, with widespread calls for greater government intervention. 'As the scandal deepens and new instances of horse meat contamination are uncovered on an almost daily basis, regulators and the food industry must work quickly and take decisive steps to restore consumer confidence that could be damaged for a long time to come.' The Co-Operative said today that none of its own brand minced beef products tested for horsemeat contamination were affected. Peter Marks, the Group Chief Executive, said in a message to company members: 'In . total, 101 of our products were tested for contamination as part of a . mass testing exercise called for by the Food Standards Agency. 'None . of these products which cover the totality of our current minced beef . food range, have been found to contain any trace of horse DNA.

'Our independent testing will continue on a rolling basis to ensure ongoing scrutiny,' he said. The Co-Operative will review its meat supply chain and introduce 'greater transparency' in the process, said Mr Marks. 'Let . me repeat the sincere apology I made to our customers and members last . week and assure you that we will do all we can to reinforce the . integrity of our products and the trust that we have spent generations . building up,' he added.","Sales of frozen ready meals are also down by 13 per cent, survey shows .

Regardless of motivation, those who converged on the auction could sense the immense value of the treasure upon arriving. Sold: Appraiser Howard Herz stands among gold coins discovered in a Nevada garage which were auctioned off for $3.5 million on Tuesday . Gold: Mexican 50 peso pieces, two seen here, were among the $3.5 million in gold coins auctioned off with one bidder securing nine of the 11 lots . There were numerous guards at the entrance, then more in the hallway outside the courtroom, and finally several with bullet proof vests and others with helmets inside the room holding the gold. Five bidders diligently inspected the 11 lots of gold displayed in plastic sleeves, tubes and felt jewelry display boxes in a heavily guarded room before the bidding wars began. By the time all sales were final, however, one bidder had secured nine of the 11 lots for sale. Carson City's Alan Rowe of Northern Nevada Coin spent $617,000 from his own company, and another $2 million on behalf of the Illinois-based Rare Coin Company of America Inc. It was the uniqueness of the gold that drove his bidding, he said. 'Every one of us has a little hoarder nature in our culture and we all like to have things, but to this degree is quite a story,' Rowe told reporters after the auction, adding that the metal value 'is not as exciting as the story itself, there's actually value to the story.' Discovery: A crew sent to clean out this modest Carson City, Nevada home after the quiet death of Walter Samaszko Jr discovered more than $7.4 million worth of gold coins in the garage . Owner: It took several weeks before Mr Samasko was found dead in his home, having been unmarried and authorities having to search strenuously to find an heir . He added that some of the coins will be available in the store or online for locals hoping to snag a piece of history. Others, he said, will be marketed nationally and likely on television. This auction was only for the bullion coins -- items that are not necessarily rare, just expensive because they are made of gold. There will likely be a second auction for the larger portion of the collection which is comprised of the rare coins, said Alan Glover, the public administrator for Samaszko's estate. 'They're buying and bidding on an ounce of gold, pure gold by the weight,' Glover said. In total, about 150 pounds of gold was sold at Tuesday's auction. About $800,000 will pay various fees and estate taxes, and the rest of the profits go to a substitute teacher in San Rafael, California, who is the first cousin and sole heir to the trove of Walter Samaszko Jr. Because of the other coins' rarity, that sale is expected to net higher profits. James Mitchell of Reno's Silver State Coin and a California-based group named Spectrum Group International Inc. grabbed the two lots not purchased by Rowe or his partners. Mitchell landed the lot of 4,600 Mexican dos pesos, the largest number of coins in a single lot. He said the story posed no additional value to him. 'It had the most potential for profit,' Mitchell said of his purchase. 'There was one lot I wanted more, but this one will have to do.' That lot, a collection of 620 Canadian Maple Leafs, was the largest in terms of weight and the coins were the purest gold available. It fetched $1.16 million from Rowe and the Rare Coin Company of America. Heir: California substitute teacher Arlene Magdanz has been officially declared the rightful owner to the fortune and will receive any proceeds after $800,000 in taxes and fees are payed . No one knows exactly when the collection began, or why Samaszko never sold it. Frankly, no one knew anything about him even though he lived in the same neighborhood for decades. Weeks passed before authorities even discovered he had died in his modest Carson City home. A coroner said he died of heart problems. When cleanup crews arrived, they made the startling discovery of the 69-year-old man's vast collection of thousands of gold coins worth millions of dollars stashed in old ammunition boxes in his garage. Officials discovered the trove neatly wrapped and stored mostly in ammunition boxes stacked on top of each other. There were more than 2,900 Austrian coins, many from 1915; more than 5,000 from Mexico; at least 500 from Britain; 300 U.S. gold pieces, some dating to 1880; and more than 100 U.S. gold pieces as old as the 1890s. Among the coins were meticulous records of the purchases dating back to at least 1964, when gold averaged about $35 per ounce. The precious metal currently sells for more than $1,600 an ounce. Authorities believe that his mother, who lived with Samaszko until her death in 1992, purchased most of the coins. Despite the millions of dollars in his garage, Samaszko didn't appear to lead a luxurious life. Records show he only withdrew about $500 a month to pay modest bills. He died with $1,200 in a checking account and just a bit more than $165,000 in a money market and mutual fund account. Since learning of her inheritance, Magdanz has shunned publicity and not made any comments about the fortune.","Nearly half of Walter Samaszko Jr's gold was auctioned off on Tuesday .

A popular punk rocker has told of his shock at catching a tapeworm which burrowed into his brain and had to be removed in a major operation. Jay Whalley, lead singer of Australian group Frenzal Rhomb, feared he had cancer after suffering two seizures on his way to a gig. After the growth in his brain was removed, he discovered that it was an egg from a pork tapeworm - but since he is a vegetarian, he was baffled as to how the parasite entered his body. It later emerged that the tapeworm had apparently come from a vegetarian burrito which Mr Whalley had eaten in Central America which had been contaminated by the person who cooked it. Scar: Jay Whalley's head after the singer underwent surgery to remove a cyst from his brain . The 40-year-old singer has released eight albums with Frenzal Rhomb, one of Australia's leading punk groups. Along with his bandmate Lindsay McDougall, Mr Whalley used to present a radio show on station Triple J. The rocker took to Facebook yesterday to post a comprehensive 1,000-word account of his ordeal after catching the parasite. He said that his first hint of health problems came on February 25, when he started feeling unusual and having difficulty seeing. After he failed to recognise the coins he was holding in his hand, a friend stepped in and made sure he was safe while he endured two seizures. Agony: Mr Whalley, pictured performing last year, suffered two seizures after catching a tapeworm . Mr Whalley was taken to hospital, where doctors gave him a brain scan and discovered a 1cm object which appeared to be a tumour. 'Worst case would be a malignant melanoma, the best would be a benign tumour or an infection of some kind,' he later wrote. However, when he was operated on three weeks later, he was relieved to be told that the growth was not a tumour but a cyst. Doctors later told him he had been infected with Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, during a trip to Central America, despite the fact that he does not eat meat. Surprise: Mr Whalley was afflicted with the pork tapeworm despite being a vegetarian . Taenia solium, known as the 'pork tapeworm', is native to pigs as well as humans. It lives in the intestines, and is usually caught by pigs when they eat human faeces contained the worm's eggs. The most common way for people to become infected by T. solium is eating . the meat of an infected animal which has not been thoroughly cooked. The worm can grow as long as seven metres and lives in the intestine for years. Its eggs frequently migrate into muscle and brain tissue, causing . cysticercosis - the formation of cysts which isolate the egg from the . rest of the body. These cysts can cause muscle pain, and when present in the brain induce seizures. Mr Whalley posted a vivid description of the infection process: 'So the tapeworm eggs live in pig flesh (most common in C America but found in loads of other countries too), the pig is killed and the meat undercooked and eaten by old mate. 'Old mate grows a tapeworm in his intestine which eventually produces eggs. Old mate goes to el baño, doesn't wash his hands properly then busies himself cooking my vegetarian burrito. Gross.' Once the egg had made its way to Mr Whalley's brain, his body formed a cyst around it to isolate it, which remained in place for four years. However, when the cyst grew large enough to press on his brain, it caused the debilitating seizures which he suffered last month. The singer now appears to have fully recovered after a period of weakness in hospital following his operation. 'I don't feel like I've retained any deficits from the brain surgery but I guess only time will tell,' he wrote. 'Perhaps the slice will be taken out of my golf swing. My friend Clem thinks I will become racist.' Mr Whalley also joked about possible nicknames based on his experience, including 'Ham Solo', 'Notorious P.I.G.' and 'Oink 182'.","Jay Whalley of Frenzal Rhomb suffered unexpected seizures .

Sentimental: The diamond ring was given to Wendy Dolton, left, by her husband Malcolm, right, just months before he too died from cancer . A thief ripped a diamond wedding ring off the finger of a cancer patient as she lay dying in a hospice. Wendy Dolton, 65, who had lung cancer, succumbed to the disease just hours after she was targeted in her death bed by the 'despicable coward'. Her grieving family say they are devastated at the loss of the ring, which was a gift from Wendy's husband Malcolm just months before he too died from cancer. Wendy's son Sean said his mother was 'violated' when she was at her weakest. He said: 'It is the most vile and despicable crime that someone would come into her room where she was being cared for and take the ring from her finger. 'I remember seeing her wearing it just hours before and can't believe someone stole it from her in those last few hours. 'She was totally violated when she was at her weakest. 'It is difficult enough to deal with losing her so tragically, but to know how and when it was taken is very difficult.' The ring, which has a large square diamond, was given to the great grandmother in 2004 as a 40th anniversary present from her husband. Just months later, he was diagnosed with throat cancer and died soon afterwards at Pilgrim’s Hospice in Canterbury, Kent - the same hospice where Wendy was cared for. Furious: Wendy Dolton's family said they are devastated that she was targeted on her death bed and said they would never have sold the ring and wanted to keep it in the family . Tragic: Wendy Dolton and her husband Malcolm taken on the day on which he had presented her with a gold ring, which was taken despicably as she lay dying . Sean Dolton, a firefighter, said the theft is 'unforgivable' and has urged the thief to return it. The 46-year-old said: 'It is a despicable crime by a coward to prey on somebody in the last 24 hours of their life when they are that vulnerable. 'I can’t put it into words how upset my family is. That ring was so special to our family. My dad gave it to my mum as a 40th anniversary gift.' Police believe the thief struck either on the eve of Wendy's death, or the actual day she died - February 14.

Although thin Lizzie probably doesn't have much cellulite to worry about, Wrangler say that clinical . tests showed that 69 per cent of those trialling the jeans reported an improvement in the appearance of their thighs. Testers at the Institut Adriant in France wore the jeans for eight hours a day, five days a week during the six-week testing period.

Pub landlords who illegally screen English football matches could face heavy fines or jail under copyright law as the Premier League and BSkyB begin a hardline campaign to retain its exclusive broadcasting rights. Just months after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that UK bar owners can . bypass Sky by using cheap overseas de-coders to access sports services, the industry is now seeking alternative areas of law to halt them. In what will be seen as a retaliatory strike, legislation is now being used to fine landlords for broadcasting logos, national anthems and pre-recorded footage - because it breaches copyright. The move appears to circumvent an earlier legal ruling. Game over: It is still unclear how the court case result will effect the wider legality of screening matches in pubs around the UK . Crack down: The Premier League and BSkyB have taken the hardline stance to stop pubs from screening illegal football matches . The hardline approach comes after a High Court judgment earlier this month, when the Premier League won a . copyright ruling against pubs using foreign de-coder cards to screen . games. Judge David Kitchin found that - when . customers are able to view footage featuring logos, pre-recorded video . sequences, previous games and anthems - pubs are violating Premier League . copyright. In what is thought to be the first of many prosecutions to come, a landlord in Essex was last week ordered to pay more than £19,000 in fines and costs this month after being convicted of screening Premier League and international matches via Sky Sports without a commercial viewing agreement. Ruling: The FA Premier League cannot stop people from seeking better deals from foreign broadcasters than the TV sports subscriptions offered by BSkyB . Frederick Young, licensee of a pub in Shenfield, was convicted under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988, of six offences of dishonest reception of a television reception, according to the Independent. He was fined £2,500 for each offence and also ordered to pay £4,522 in court costs. Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy is currently fighting an £8,000 fine she received for using a cheaper Greek satellite service to show English football in her pub. She was paying £118 a month to use the foreign de-coder instead of Sky subscription rate of £480. She will go to the High Court next week in a bid to get her case overturned, using October's ECJ ruling. Delighted: Landlady Karen Murphy had her £8,000 fine for using an imported Greek satellite decoder to save money on subscription fees in 2006 overturned today . However, while she might successfully . get her £8,000 fine overturned, the High Court is likely to uphold the . Premier League's right to copyright, which could result in a separate . fine. While the first ruling was seen by . many as a chance for football fans to watch 'cut-price' Premier League . matches, pubs will now find themselves trapped by the copyright ruling. The broadcaster has paid more than . £1billion for the UK broadcast rights for Premier League matches, and . October's ruling was described as driving a ‘coach and horses’ through . one of BSkyB’s . most lucrative sidelines. Sports broadcasting licences tied to individual countries were ‘contrary’ to EU competition law, the ECJ said.

A former boyfriend of socialite and model Tamara Ecclestone was today jailed for four years after attempting to blackmail the heiress for £200,000. Derek Rose, 33, who dated the daughter of Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone in 2002, was involved in a plot in which it was claimed that he was approached to sell his story to a tabloid newspaper. Rose was included in an email mentioning the possibility of discussing 'a non-release fee' and signing a confidentiality contract. Derek Rose arrives at the Southwark Crown court today for sentencing after he was found guilty of trying to blackmail his former girlfriend Tamara Ecclestone . Tamara Ecclestone arrives at Southwark Crown Court last week for the trial of Derek Rose . An email was sent by media studies student Jakir Uddi, 20, to Ms Ecclestone’s . agent saying ‘one of the biggest tabloids’ had made a ‘life-changing . offer’ for a kiss-and-tell story when in reality, no newspaper had . approached him. The email said: ‘As you can imagine, since Miss Ecclestone’s show has . been aired, my client [Rose] has been inundated with offers from a lot of . today’s major tabloids, plus many television companies and radio. ‘Now they all seem to want to talk to my client about Tamara, and Tamara only. ‘I’ve asked my client not to talk to the press about Tamara for ten years, and have let her live her life. ‘On Monday this week we was approached (sic) by one of the biggest . tabloids with a life-changing offer of £200,000 to disclose all. ‘My client is a quiet family man, and doesn’t need the headache of this story coming out.’ Tamara Ecclestone (right) and Derek Rose (left) dated in 2002 and Rose threatened to sell intimate details about her to the press . Judge Andrew Goymer at Southwark Crown Court told Rose: 'This was an audacious attempt to obtain a large sum of money.' The court heard that he dated Ecclestone when she was 17, before changing his name by deed poll from Jonathan Ketterman. The email was sent on November 16, 2011, the day that Ms Ecclestone had starred in Billion Dollar Girl, a reality television programme exploring her life as a rich youngster. It said the newspaper had set a deadline of 1pm on November 18 for Rose to respond by. Tamara Ecclestone had just started her new show Billion Dollar Girl when she received the email . The trial heard that the email had “pernicious” implications and was sent to elicit money from Ms Ecclestone, 28. The judge said that 10 years ago, Rose, who sold his story to the Mail on Sunday in 2002, was in a relationship with Ms Ecclestone, which ended acrimoniously. 'You felt extremely hurt, and within a few days of writing a bitter message, you were selling your story to a tabloid newspaper, and that speaks volumes about your true character.' 'She came to your attention again in November 2011 when she was the subject of a television series. The email that you sent on 16th November in which you threatened to reveal personal details was not the product of a broken heart. 'All that was long in the past.' The judge added: 'It was nothing more than a cynical and greedy attempt to extract a large sum of money. 'No doubt you thought that £200,000, which is a large sum to most people, would be small change to somebody with the amount of money that she and her family are reputed to have. 'You also thought that for this reason they would readily part with it to buy your silence. She did not do this.' The judge said that the well-known, well-connected and well-off did not deserve special protection, but the reality was that they were more likely to fall victim to this type of offence. He said: 'Blackmail is always an unpleasant and vicious offence. It can properly be said to be one of the worst offences that does not involve physical injury because of the fear and insecurity that it produces.' Judge Goymer added that although Rose has ‘caring responsibilities’ for his 13-year-old son - a promising footballer- he still deserved a custodial sentence, . The jury failed to reach a verdict about media studies student Jakir Uddin who sent the email . Ms Ecclestone is famous for being the daughter of Bernie, the Formula 1 supremo . He said: ‘Although his mother is his . primary carer you have taken an active and positive part in his . upbringing and helping him to realise his ambitions. ‘He is of course entirely innocent of any involvement in this offence but your greed blinded you to the humiliation and misery that it would bring upon him. ‘There is a need to deter this type of offence which can be relatively easy to commit. ‘The least sentence I can pass on you is four years imprisonment.’ Representatives of Ms Ecclestone said that she  welcomed the sentence. Her family lawyer Charlotte Harris of the firm Mishcon de Reya said in a statement: 'Tamara Ecclestone is relieved that Judge Goymer has acknowledged, in his sentencing of Derek Rose, the serious nature of blackmail and the need to deter others from attempting to commit similar offences. 'Ms Ecclestone was content to waive her anonymity in giving evidence because she strongly believes that all people have a right to be protected from such cynical and vicious behaviour. The sentence of four years is welcomed.' Jakir Uddi stood trial alongside Rose but the jury failed to reach a verdict in his case and was discharged yesterday. He denied blackmail, claiming he was acting under orders from Rose, and is facing retrial.","Derek Rose threatened to sell a story about Ecclestone to the tabloids .

The International Space Station is planning to change its orbit after narrowly avoiding two pieces of space junk last month. A broken Russian satellite and the remains of an Indian rocket passed within miles of the ISS, with the station primed to move and the astronauts having a tense few hours wondering if disaster was about to strike. Now, the Russian space program's Mission Control Centre says it will move the ISS into a different orbit to lower the risk of possible collisions. There is 'no practical aim' to the . morse code beacons, according to its creator, Professor Takushi Tanaka . of the Fukuoka Institute of Technology, except to test the possibility . of optical communication from space. The FITSAT-1 team say it will try to fulfil all requests for appearances.

The 3lb satellite's main mission is to test a high-speed data transmitter which will beam VGA images taken by an onboard camera back to Earth. Scientists believe their transmitter can send a 480x640 jpeg within 6 seconds. FITSAT-1 will orbit the earth between 51.6 degrees south latitude and 51.6 degrees north latitude and it will carry a mounted neodymium magnet to force it to always point to magnetic north like a compass.

Cherry had been driving a Maserati sports car when he was shot, and the vehicle then collided with a taxi, causing it to explode. The driver, Michael Bolden, 62, and his passenger, identified in local media reports as Sandi Sutton, from Washington state, were killed in the explosion. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said Harris is wanted for the murder of all three, and that officers were 'utilising every available resource' to find him. Murder: Police are treating the three deaths following the shooting and crash in Las Vegas as murder . He warned yesterday that any members of the public 'harbouring' Harris or helping him to evade the authorities could face charges themselves. Lt Steiber said that although there were other men were in the Range Rover at the time, Harris is believed to be the only shooter. He added: 'At this point Ammar Harris is the one responsible for the shooting and the murder of three individuals.' No weapons were found in the silver Maserati, police have confirmed, and Cherry, an aspiring rapper, did not return fire. Terrifying: Kenneth Cherry Jr. was shot dead and taxi driver Michael Bolden died when his vehicle exploded . Lt Steiber added: 'Right now, as far as we're concerned, Mr Cherry, he's the victim of a murder and that's what we're focused on.' Harris, who lived in South Carolina and Georgia, was convicted of marijuana possession in 2005 in Atlanta. In December, he was arrested in Miami for reckless driving and failure to produce a valid license. He also used the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris when he was arrested last May in Las Vegas and charged with sexual assault, kidnapping and coercion with a weapon. Explosion: A fiery crash followed the shooting with Cherry's Maserati colliding with a taxi . His apparently brand new Range Rover has been impounded, but police have declined to say where it was found. Steiber said no guns were found inside. Authorities say the shooting may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip. It took place less than a mile from where rapper Tupac Shakur was shot in September 1996. The 25-year-old had been riding in a BMW with Death Row Records co-founder Marion 'Suge' Knight after the two men had attended a Mike Tyson boxing match.","New photograph shows heavily-tattooed prime suspect Ammar Harris .

A 26-year-old man was killed and a 29-year-old man injured in Philadelphia last night in a drive by shooting outside the tour bus of rapper French Montana. The Moroccan-born artist whose debut album, due to launch in May, features a track with Nicki Minaj, had just played a headline show at the city's Theater of Living Arts when gunfire erupted outside the Holiday Inn Express on Christopher Columbus Boulevard, where he and his entourage had rooms booked. A group of fans followed French Montana's tour bus to the hotel and was gathered around the vehicle when a car pulled up and opened fire around midnight, police said. Tour bus life: French Montana, pictured right, tweeted this picture of himself and some pals from his tour bus moments before the shooting . The victim, who was shot in the stomach, was taken to Hahnemann Univserity Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:30 a.m. He was later identified as Jowann King of New York. The injured man was shot in the shoulder and is now in stable condition at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. The 28-year-old rapper, who was among a group of around 25 people who were questioned by police, was clearly unfazed by the death of one of his fans, tweeting 'nobody got time for this s**t' with a photo of him and an investigator. Chief Inspector Scott Small said they don't think the rapper or his entourage were targeted in the shooting. Neither victim appeared to be with the rapper's group. Instead they believe it may have been an altercation between groups of fans. Crime scene: The shooting took place near French Montana's tour bus, pictured, which was parked outside a Holiday Inn in Philadelphia . Holiday Inn: A group of fans had followed the tour bus back to the Holiday Inn on Christopher Columbus Boulevard, pictured . Gunshots: The tour bus appears to escape bullet holes but a silver car nearby, pictured, was damaged . Police gathered everyone on the tour bus into the lobby of the Holiday Inn immediately after the incident and then transported them to the Homicide Unit to be interviewed. Small said one man may have returned fire, and three men, who were found with loaded handguns, were taken into custody and remained there overnight. According to Philly.com, police found at least seven shell casings near the tour bus but the vehicle itself appeared to escape gunfire. Unfazed: The rapper, pictured right, seemed unfazed that one of his fans had been shot, tweeting this picture during questioning with the caption 'nobody got time for this s***' Billing: The drive-by happened immediately after French Montana played at the Theater of Living Arts in Philadelphia, pictured . Police are investigating a parked car found riddled with bullet holes near Jefferson Hospital's emergency room, though it is believed to be the vehicle that took the injured victim to hospital. The Philadelphia gig was part of the 28-year-old rapper's 'Excuse my French' tour to promote his upcoming album. He is the CEO of Cocaine City Records in New York and tweeted a picture of himself with some pals on the tour bus presumably moments before the shooting, with the caption 'tour bus life' clearly enjoying his new found fame.","A 26-year-old man was killed and a .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 11:44 EST, 13 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:21 EST, 15 February 2013 . FBI officers are authorised to used Stingrays on terrorism investigations . A new surveillance tool used by the FBI has been criticised for being invasive and unconstitutional by an American digital rights pressure group. The 'Stingray' acts as a fake mobile phone tower, tricking your phone to connect with it even if you are not on a call. It can allow users to eavesdrop on your call and locate you to within two metres. Now the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has warned that the device, which is widely used across the US by the FBI, is being used for far more routine cases than the terrorism investigations it was originally introduced to help. The pressure group has described it as 'an unconstitutional, all-you-can-eat data buffet', and says it can 'suck down data on potentially thousands of innocent people along the way'. The EFF says that when the Los Angeles Police Department got a Department of Homeland Security grant in 2006 to buy a Stingray, it was on the grounds that it would be used for 'regional terrorism investigations'. Instead, EFF's web report says: 'LAPD has been using it for just about any investigation imaginable. 'In just a four month period in 2012, according to documents obtained by the First Amendment Coalition, the LAPD has used the device at least 21 times in “far more routine” criminal investigations.' It said the LA weekly reported that Stingrays were used for more than 13 per cent of 155 mobile phone investigation cases that LAPD worked on between June and September 2012, including burglary, drug and murder cases. The EFF report says the use of the Stingray is just the latest example of the US government using 'terrorism' as an excuse to exert stronger powers over even ordinary citizens. It adds: 'Stingrays are particularly . odious given they give police dangerous “general warrant” powers, which . the founding fathers specifically drafted the Fourth Amendment to . prevent.' In pre-revolution . America, British soldiers used 'general warrants' to search houses . without specifying what they were after without specification. Los Angeles Police are authorised to use the Stingray for 'regional terrorism investigations' (file photo) George Washington's copy of the US Constitution: The fourth amendment guards against unlawful searches . Critics say the Stringray could be used by officers searching for one target to suck up mobile phone signals of countless innocent individuals. The Foundation also highlights a report in Slate that mentions FBI internal guidance relating to America's Communications Act about how 'interference' with communication signals is outlawed. The report says it is significant because it demonstrates: '""That there are clearly concerns, even with the agency, that the use of Stingray technology might be inconsistent with current regulations"" according to EPIC attorney Alan Butler. '""I don't know how the Department of Justice justifies the use of Stingrays given the limitations of the Communications Act prohibition.""' Slate also suggested that the FBI was loaning out the devices to local police. An FBI spokesman told MailOnline: 'In all FBI investigations, the use of any investigative tool is required to be in compliance with the constitution, the laws of the United States, and internal Department of Justice guidelines. 'The FBI strives to protect our country and its people using every available tool, with utmost respect for the rule of law and our cherished right to privacy. All our investigations are furthermore subject to internal and external oversight and compliance review.' He added: 'Location information is a vital component of law enforcement investigations.  During the course of FBI investigations and as permitted by controlling legal authority, the FBI may use a variety of tools and technology, including cell phone location technology. 'The specific equipment used by law enforcement to obtain location information and the capabilities of that equipment generally are considered “Law Enforcement Sensitive.” 'Law Enforcement Sensitive is a designation applied to protect certain information about law enforcement capabilities so that subjects of law enforcement investigations do not learn how to evade or defeat lawfully authorized investigative activity.'","The Electronic Frontier Foundation calls surveillance tool 'unconstitutional'

No care: Gloria Foster, 81, was found close to death after being left for nine days without treatment when police closed down the care agency looking after her . A widow of 81 starved to death after she was ‘forgotten about’ by the care system for nine days. Stroke victim Gloria Foster depended on agency nurses who visited her home four times a day for food, water and medication. But after the agency was closed down last month – for allegedly employing illegal immigrants – her council did nothing to look after her. When someone eventually went to her home, in Banstead, Surrey, on January 24, they found that Mrs Foster had all but wasted away. She was severely dehydrated, suffering kidney failure, had serious bed sores and only a faint pulse. She was taken to Epsom Hospital but died on Monday. Surrey police are now investigating the circumstances surrounding her death after a raid on the company that had been looking after her. She had been receiving help in her own home in Banstead, Surrey, from Carefirst24, but Surrey County Council became responsible for her care after a number of its workers were arrested last month following a UK Border Agency (UKBA) raid. Yesterday her friends said what happened to her had been ‘appalling’ and demanded answers from Surrey County Council, the local authority responsible for her care. Ann Penston, from Sutton, said: ‘How on Earth could this have been allowed to happen? ‘How can they just close this thing down and not identify the people they were supposed to be taking care of? ‘She did not deserve to go out like this – in agony with a total feeling of being lost.’ Mrs Foster’s MP, Conservative Crispin Blunt, described her ordeal as ‘horrific’. He said: ‘Clearly there are questions to answer and I would expect a comprehensive investigation between all of the agencies involved.’ Mrs Foster, a lover of classical music and the theatre who is believed to have worked as a stenographer, had no children. Her husband Bob, an accountant, died in a car crash in Saudi Arabia about 30 years ago. Mrs Foster, left, from Banstead, Surrey, depended on nurses for food, water and medication . Worrying: Six people were arrested when police and the UK Border Agency raided Carefirst 24's premises in Cheam, on January 15 . She had suffered a stroke and lived alone in the £200,000 house she had owned since 1984. Private agency Carefirst24 had a . lucrative contract from the council to look after her. But the agency . was suspected of employing illegal immigrants and six people were . arrested by UK Border Agency officials when its Sutton headquarters was . raided. Alternative arrangements should have been made but Mrs Foster did not get any replacement care. She had no idea the agency had closed . and was unable to call for help. A district nurse visited her by chance . and found her in a critical condition. Miss Penston, who had known Mrs . Foster since the 1980s, said she ‘couldn’t imagine’ how her friend would . have felt after being left alone for nine days. ‘I don’t know how she survived. She . had a glass of water by her bed. 'I don’t know if she managed to get up . and get it but my assumption is that for she was just lying there . waiting for someone to come.’ Paul Burstow, Liberal Democrat MP for . Sutton and Cheam, said the council needed to get to the bottom of why . its procedures did not work properly. Yesterday a Surrey County Council . spokesman said the ‘tragic’ case would be looked at ‘urgently’ to . establish what had gone wrong. ‘We’re very sad to hear about Mrs . Foster’s death, and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this . difficult time,’ the spokesman said. ‘The safety of vulnerable adults is . our top priority, which is why this tragic event is already being . urgently looked at by the Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board.’ The UK Border Agency said it had warned the council of plans to shut Carefirst24. Neighbours and residents condemned the failings that led to Mrs Foster’s death. A man named Robert posted an internet . message saying: ‘Surrey County Council Social Services should be . ashamed of themselves. Appalling.’ Disbelief: Ann Penston, a friend of Mrs Foster, holding a picture of the two. She said: 'How on Earth could this have been allowed to happen?' Forgotten: The woman was left without the four daily nurse visits she needed after Carefirst 24 was shut down by police and the UK Border Agency officers . Another resident said: ‘The way we treat the elderly in this country is disgusting. I hope someone is brought to task.’ All those arrested in the raid on Carefirst24 have been bailed until dates in March. Two British women aged 48 and 52, a . 52-year-old British man and a 34-year-old Mauritian man were held on . suspicion of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to facilitate foreign . nationals. They are alleged to have employed illegal workers using . former workers’ identities. There was no answer yesterday at the . offices of Carefirst24, which provided care to the elderly and . vulnerable in Surrey and South London. Carefirst24 is owned by Mahen . Caussyram. The company’s website says: ‘Mahen is a family man who takes . his responsibilities quite seriously. He enjoys spending time at home . with family and friends.’ Mr Caussyram is a registered nurse . who ‘developed an interest in human resource management’ and worked as . an ‘activities coordinator’, the website adds.

Warning: Marta Andreasen will appear in Eastleigh alongside Cabinet ministers as she becomes the most prominent figure to leave Ukip and join the Conservatives . Voting for UKIP risks handing Nick Clegg a crucial by-election win this week, the Tories will warn today. Defecting Euro MP Marta Andreasen will appear in Eastleigh alongside Cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Patrick McLoughlin as she becomes the most prominent figure to leave UKIP and join the Conservatives. She told the Daily Mail that the ‘cold reality’ was a ‘vote for UKIP in Eastleigh is simply a vote to give Nick Clegg another pro-Euro MP’. The Liberal Democrats last night slumped to their lowest-ever poll rating in the wake of the sexual harassment allegations against their former chief executive Lord Rennard. A ComRes survey for The Independent put the party on just eight per cent, in fourth place behind UKIP for the first time. However, a separate survey by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggested that in the Hampshire seat of Eastleigh, where voters go the polls on Thursday, the Lib Dems are clinging on to a five-point lead over their coalition partners. The Eastleigh by-election, triggered by the resignation from Parliament of the disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, has become a high-stakes battle for David Cameron and Mr Clegg. Defeat to the Tories in what has been a traditional stronghold would be a shattering blow for the Deputy Prime Minister and mark the first time a prime minister has taken a seat in a by-election since Margaret Thatcher in her Falklands pomp in 1982. While a ComRes poll shows the Lib Dems down to just 8 per cent nationally, a separate survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the party five points ahead in the Eastleigh by-election . But Mr Cameron will face questions . about his own chances of securing a majority in 2015 if the . Conservatives fail to take the constituency against the backdrop of Mr . Huhne’s resignation and the deepening scandal over the allegations . against Lord Rennard. Mrs Andreasen, who was UKIP MEP for . the south-east region and the party’s only female representative in . Brussels, said she had been persuaded to join the Tories by Mr Cameron’s . pledge of an EU referendum last month. Previous affiliations: Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) is pictured with Marta Andreasen (left) in June 2009 . Battle: The Eastleigh by-election was triggered by the resignation from Parliament of the disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne (pictured) She said Ukip supporters were ‘good . people’ but launched an attack on the party’s leader Nigel Farage for . failing to stand in Eastleigh, instead selecting a little-known . councillor from Surrey. ‘The fact that Nigel Farage ducked-out . of fighting the Eastleigh by-election made it crystal clear to me that UKIP just isn’t serious about offering real leadership,’ she said. ‘It was a golden opportunity to try . and return an MP to Westminster and he shirked it. Selecting a relative . nobody underlined what I had started to fear for some time: that UKIP is . a pressure group with no real political ambitions or aspirations. ‘In this context I have to ask what do you get if you vote UKIP? We have a perfect answer this week in the Eastleigh by-election. ‘Only two parties have a real chance . of winning in Eastleigh - the Liberal Democrats, and the Conservatives. That’s the party that wants to take us into the Euro or the party that . wants to give us an in/out referendum. ‘UKIP cannot win, but it could still . affect the result - UKIP votes could help the pro-EU Liberal Democrats . get in. A vote for UKIP in Eastleigh is simply a vote to give Nick Clegg . another pro-Euro MP. That is the cold reality of a UKIP  vote.’ Mrs Andreasen said the Tory candidate . in Eastleigh, Maria Hutchings, was a ‘eurosceptic like me’ who ‘really . cares about her community’. ‘She will stand square behind David . Cameron in fighting for a better deal for Britain in Europe. She is the . candidate for a party with serious plans to cap immigration. We need her . and more of her calibre in Westminster,’ she added. Lord Ashcroft’s poll in Eastleigh . suggests UKIP could indeed cost the Tories the seat - putting them on 21 . per cent, with the Tories on 28 per cent and the Lib Dems on 33 per . cent. In the running: Mrs Andreasen said the Tory candidate in Eastleigh, Maria Hutchings (pictured centre with London Mayor Boris Johnson last week), was a 'eurosceptic like me' who 'really cares about her community' It found that Mr Cameron and . Chancellor George Osborne retain a clear lead over Ed Miliband and Ed . Balls when it comes to trust on the economy, but the Lib Dems are well . ahead of the other parties on ‘understanding the Eastleigh constituency . and representing local people in parliament’. Two thirds of voters in the . constituency - including two thirds of Lib Dems - are either satisfied . with Mr Cameron’s performance as Prime Minister or would prefer him to . Mr Miliband.

Lord Ashcroft said undecided voters . could ‘yet produce a surprise’ in Thursday’s by-election, but added: . ‘With two days to go, the Liberal Democrats have the edge.’ Mr Clegg, on a flying visit to the . constituency yesterday, accused the Conservatives of ‘breathtaking’ opportunism over their campaign in Eastleigh. The Tories have produced posters . criticising Lib Dem candidate Mike Thornton for backing a housing . development on greenfield land in the constituency. ‘I flatly reject the cynicism, the . opportunism, it’s really breath-taking from the Conservatives, who have . no plan to protect green spaces elsewhere, no plan to provide affordable . homes’, Mr Clegg told BBC Radio Solent.

In court yesterday the prosecutor asked Lyu Qing, one of the nine alleged traffickers, how much could be earnt from a successful operation and sale of a kidney, to which he replied: 'About 20,000 yuan (£3,200).' He was said to have earned a total of 161,00 (£2,500) yuan through kidney trafficking until he was arrested, according to Xinhua. The people willing to sell their kidneys were based at rented houses in . the city's Jianggan Districtt, with the sale of their kidneys taking place from . November 2011, according to the district prosecutor. The case has shone a spotlight on the illicit organ trade in China triggered by the disparity between  1.5million people on hospital transplant waiting lists and the fact that only 10,000 organ transplant operations are performed each year. Few Chinese agree to donate their organs after death, fuelling the rampant llegal market activity.

Challenge: Daphne Burgess left £200,000 to her daughters Julia Hawes (pictured) and Libby Burgess when she died aged 80 but her son was left out of the will . A bitter battle over a family will ended yesterday with the two sides spending more on lawyers than the £200,000 at stake. Daphne Burgess left that sum when she died four years ago at the age of 80. But she had cut her son Peter out the will, leaving her estate to her daughters Julia Hawes and Libby Burgess. Peter managed to overturn that decision yesterday – but only at what a leading judge described as a calamitous expense. The hearing, which pitched Peter and Libby against Julia, lasted six days and called on 26 witnesses. Lord Justice Mummery compared the case with the infamous lawsuit in Charles Dickens’s Bleak House: ‘It may be recalled that the foggy family law suit in Jarndyce v Jarndyce dragged on before the Lord Chancellor for generations until nothing was left for the parties to take.’ He said the only real difference was that the disappearance of Mrs Burgess’s estate had ‘happened faster than under the dilatory procedures of the unreformed Court of Chancery in the Jarndyce case’. He added: ‘The cost of contesting Mrs Burgess’s will is a calamity for this family in every way. Even worse are the human consequences for a once close-knit and loving family.’ He said the rift between the three siblings was ‘likely to be beyond repair’. Julia, a former Milton Keynes magistrate, insisted her mother was of sound mind when she decided to write her son out of the will she wrote two years before her death in 2009. Libby and Peter, who runs a recruitment company, argued in return that their mother was in the grip of dementia and lacked the legal capacity to make a valid will. Hearing: Peter Burgess (left) and his sister Libby Burgess (right) argued their mother lacked the legal capacity to make a valid will . Yesterday, the Court of Appeal came down in their favour, ruling that their mother had lacked ‘knowledge and approval’ of the will’s contents and that – if her estate was not exhausted by the legal action – it should be split three ways. Mrs Burgess changed her will shortly after moving from her home in Milton Keynes to a nearby bungalow bought for her by her son. Comparison: Lord Justice Mummery compared the case with an infamous lawsuit in Charles Dickens's Bleak House . She had decided to leave some of her personal effects to each of her children and also wanted to specify who should give the eulogy at her funeral and where her ashes should be scattered. Julia was with her mother when solicitors drew up the will, which included a clause that Mr Burgess would not receive anything from her estate, because of ‘lifetime provision’ she intended to make for him in the form of improvements to the bungalow. Peter and Libby instructed city solicitors and a top QC to challenge the will, pointing to an Oxford professor’s evidence that their mother may have been confused and suffering from a ‘moderate’ disorder of the mind at the time. Lord Justice Mummery said he ‘entertained doubts’ as to whether Mrs Burgess in fact lacked the mental capacity to make the will – but nevertheless ruled it invalid on the grounds that she had not fully appreciated the document’s impact. The judge, sitting with Lord Justice Patten and Sir Scott Baker, said Julia and Peter had fallen out before the document was signed. However he remained close to his mother until her death, without her telling him about the new will. Under Mrs Burgess’s previous will, signed in 1996, her estate was split three ways and that will now take precedence. Julia was ordered to pay her siblings’ legal costs.

A gay man has described how he was beaten and forced to jump off the side of a mountain to escape his attackers before falling 20 feet onto a ledge in the first hate crime trial of its kind in the U.S. Kevin Pennington, 29, told federal jurors on Wednesday in London, Kentucky, that he didn't understand why Anthony Ray Jenkins and David Jason Jenkins kidnapped him and took him to a park to try to kill him in 2011. 'You're gonna die, you ... faggot! You deserve this!' Pennington said the men yelled at him while brutally punching and kicking him, Kentucky.com reports. Harrowing escape: Kevin Pennington described in court his attempt to outrun two attackers before jumping off a mountain's cliff and landing on a ledge . The cousins are charged with kidnapping, assault and committing a hate crime. They have pleaded not guilty. On trial is whether the men attacked Pennington because of an anti-gay bias. Defence attorneys have painted a detailed picture arguing otherwise. 'Mr Pennington does not come to this with clean hands,' Jenkins' attorney Andrew Stephens said in court on Wednesday. The defence accused Pennington of being a drug dealer who lied early into the case by not revealing a planned deal before the attack, which Pennington has since acknowledged fearing it would outweigh his claims of his sexual orientation sparking the attack. Anthony Jenkin's attorney, Stephens and Willis G Coffey, said Pennington was beaten up but not because of his sexual orientation. 'There was simply an argument that led to a fight because Jason was out of his head,' Coffey said according to Kentucky.com, accusing David 'Jason' Jenkins of having been drunk and on drugs at the time. Accused: Anthony Ray Jenkins, left, and David Jason Jenkins, right, are charged with kidnapping, assault and committing a hate crime all of which they have plead not guilty to . The attack in Kingdom Come State Park in April left Pennington with chest, head and other injuries after Pennington . was invited to go on an evening drive with two women he knew: Alexis Leann . Combs Jenkins and Mable 'Ashley' Jenkins. Coffey said Pennington had agreed to buy Anthony Kenkin's sister Ashley a dose of Suboxone, a drug that can be used to get high while also to break drug dependency if in safe doses. Ashley Jenkins testified having bought Suboxone from Pennington several times before the April attack. - Ashley Jenkins said of her brother and cousin . Things got deadly when her brother suspected Pennington's drug source was a police informant, Coffey said, prompting their planned attack. 'They was going to take him up on the park and beat him to death,' Ashley Jenkins told the court of her brother and cousin. She said the two cousins sat in the car wearing hoodies, turning their faces away from Pennington when he approached their vehicle so he wouldn't recognize them. When he did, he immediately wanted to be taken home, but was attacked. Pennington told investigators that David Jenkins demanded a sexual favor from Pennington, which was refused. Then the man said David Jenkins threatened to violently rape him, according to the affidavit. The . truck stopped in the park because a tree had fallen across the road and . Anthony and David Jenkins pulled Pennington out of the truck and . attacked him. ‘During the . attack (the victim) was covering his face and they were all screaming . `how do you like this fa****?'‘ the affidavit said. Horrific attack: Mr Pennington said he was invited to go on an evening drive through the mountains when David Jenkins, whom he didn't expect to see in the vehicle, demanded a sexual favour which he refused . Temporarily blacking out on a road, Pennington told the court he awoke to the men searching for a tire iron to continue the assault. It was then he frantically raced over the mountain's side. Pennington next ran to a ranger station, broke a window to get inside and called police. Under Pennington's claims it's the first prosecution charging a violation of the sexual orientation section of the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act passed in 2009. The women in the truck, Alexis Leann . Combs Jenkins and Mable Ashley Jenkins, have been charged with . kidnapping and aiding a kidnapping, authorities said. ‘The indictment marks the first federal case in the nation charging a violation of the sexual orientation section of the Federal Hate Crimes Law,’ said a U.S. Department of Justice statement. ‘It's vindicating to see that the years of hard work that went into making sure this law was on the books is now being put into place,’ said Michael Cole-Schwartz, a spokesman for the Washington-based Human Rights Campaign which pushed for the law's passage. Drug motive: The defense said the attack was over a drug deal and not over Pennington's sexual orientation with Anthony Kenkin's sister Ashley expecting to buy a dose of Suboxone off Pennington on the night of the attack . ‘The bigger picture here is that the U.S. attorney's office is sending a message that you don't try to hurt someone and you don't injure them because of their sexual orientation or gender identity,’ said Jordan Palmer, president of the Kentucky Equality Foundation, a civil-rights group that lobbied the Department of Justice to intervene in the case. David Jenkins' lawyer claimed Jenkins knew Pennington and Jenkins denies that he committed a hate crime. ‘The hate crime component of this is just flat wrong,’ lawyer Andrew Stephens said. ‘I think it's very difficult to get into the mind of somebody and figure out what their intent is.’ Kerry Harvey, U.S. Attorney for Kentucky's Eastern District, said that a possible conviction on the hate crime charge could send the two men to prison for life. He said the men used a truck and travelled on a federal highway with the victim, which allowed the case to fall under federal jurisdiction. Even though Pennington was treated in a hospital for his physical injuries, he says he remains emotionally scarred from the attack. Mr Palmer previously spoke with Pennington's mother and said she was pleased when she heard of the hate crime charges. She had contacted the group just hours after the attack on Pennington, Palmer said. ‘I thought it was pretty sick when I heard about it,’ he said. The law is known as the Matthew Shepard-James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Shephard was a gay college student killed in Wyoming in 1998. ‘The law was really meant as a backstop so that the resources of the federal government could be brought to bear when necessary to deal with these kinds of crimes,’ Mr Cole-Schwartz said.","Kevin Pennington described fleeing his alleged attackers after being punched and kicked .

He is accused of kissing and groping them after being booked for a massage . A masseur groped two women clients and rubbed their breasts, a court heard today. Gary Lester, 53, is accused of sexually assaulting the two women and allegedly told one: 'Don't get carried away.' He also told them they had 'great bums', St Albans Crown Court was told. The court heard the masseur ran his hands up the thighs of one of the customers and remarked: 'I am more up than down', which was said to refer to him having an erection.' Lester, of Kensworth, near Dunstable, Bedfordshire, pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting one woman on September 19, 2010, and one of sexually assaulting another woman on June 1, 2011. The first woman, from Hertfordshire, said Lester massaged her breasts and kissed her during the the third massage she had with him. She said he had been recommended to her. She said she was wearing only knickers with a towel to cover her during the appointment in September, 2010, and had lit candles, put out aroma therapy oil and dimmed the . lights. She said he told her he was booked to massage at a swinger's party the following weekend. She told the court: 'He . was working on my legs and came up to do my bottom. He was a bit longer . than I expected. He said: ""I'm taking too long massaging your bum. You . have got a really nice bum.''' The . woman, who said she had more than 100 massages in the past, said she . felt uncomfortable when he ran his hands up from her hip to the side of . her body and allegedly asked: 'Do you want a sensual massage?' She told the court she declined but allowed him to massage her breasts, which she thought was part of a normal massage. When she told him she did not feel comfortable he stopped. At . the end of the massage she said he kissed her on the forehead. 'I said: ""Did you just kiss me?"" He didn't say anything and he just kissed me . again in the same place,' she said. During the previous massage, in September, 2010, she said Lester touched the rim of her knickers and touched her in a 'more sensual' way than during their first appointment. She said he told her 'You have lovely skin' and said he did not have much of a sex life with his  girlfriend. On that occasion the woman said he massaged her breasts, but did so in way that she did not think was sexual. She told the court she did not want Lester to do anything sexual and was not interested in anything but a massage. The woman complained to police in June 2011 after she heard that a woman in Bedfordshire had made an allegation against Lester. One of the alleged victims told St Albans Crown Court that Lester told her he was good at oral sex, that she had 'great boobs' and kissed her face . Prosecutor George Heimler said: 'He is a professional masseur. He took advantage of his . position to test the boundaries with the two complainants to see if they . want to provide sexual favours, to see if he could obtain some form of . sexual gratification. 'He kissed the first victim twice. It was unsought, undesired and unwanted.' The Bedfordshire woman went for a back massage on March 9, 2011. She went back again on June 1 when it was alleged Lester made sexual remarks. Mr Heimler said: 'He told her if she wanted any sexual or . sensual touching all she needed to do was to cough. 'There . was some sexually explorative language to see how far he could go. He . kissed her on the chin and said: ""Nearly"". He missed her lips. He . touched her thigh near the knicker line. She told him in no uncertain . terms to desist.' Mr . Heimler alleged Lester told her he was good at oral sex and lifted up . his shirt to show her a tattoo. 'He told her she had a ""great bum"" and ""great boobs""', he said. In a . sexual reference as he massaged her he allegedly said: 'I am more up . than down.' 'This was a sexual reference referring to an erection', the prosecutor said. The woman went home distressed, the court was told, and the police were called two days later after she told her mother. Mr Heimler said: 'It is clear they did not consent to what he was doing.' When . Lester was questioned by the police he said all the contact was fully . consensual and he behaved professionally throughout. He said the . Bedfordshire woman had been 'flirting like crazy' and was coming onto . him sexually. He said the Hertfordshire woman was the one who spoke . about sex and swingers parties. The trial continues.

The Pentagon has suspended the flights of all 51 F-35 fighter planes after a routine inspection revealed a crack on a turbine blade in the jet engine of an F-35A, the Air Force's version of the jet, in California. Friday’s decision marked the second grounding of the warplane in two months and marked another setback for the $396 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's biggest and most expensive weapons program. The program has already been restructured three times in recent years and may face further cutbacks if Congress does not avert major budget reductions due to take effect on March 1. Scroll down for video . Grounded: A pre-production model of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is seen flying while on Friday the Pentagon grounded its entire fleet the fighter jets after discovering a cracked engine blade . The Pentagon envisions buying more than 2,400 F-35s, but some members of Congress are balking at the price tag. The F-35 program office said it was too early to know if the crack was a fleet-wide issue involving all three versions - the Air Force's F35-A, Marine Corps' F35-B and Navy's F-35C - but said it was suspending all flights until an investigation was completed. A total of 51 F-35 jets were affected, including 17 that are being used for testing and 34 in use for training in Florida and Arizona. It said it was working closely with Pratt & Whitney, the United Technologies Corp unit that builds the engine, and Lockheed Martin Corp, the prime contractor for the radar-evading warplane, to ensure the integrity of the engine and return the F-35 fleet to flight as soon as possible. Impact: A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B lands at the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona last November a part of the $396 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's biggest and most expensive weapons program . February 19: All F-35s grounded after crack found on low pressure turbine blade of Air Force variant warplane . January 16: Marine Corps' F-35B suspended for nearly one month after single engine failed during test flight in Florida . January, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta took Marine Corps version of warplane off probation . August, 2011: Flight and ground operations suspended after electrical problems on Air Force aircraft . March, 2011: Fleet grounded after dual generator failure on Air Force test aircraft . January, 2011: Then Defense Secretary Robert Gates placed probation on warplane threatening to cancel fighter jet unless costs and problems were sorted within two years . The Pentagon's F-35 program office began notifying the chiefs of the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps late on Thursday about the engine issue and decision to ground the planes, said Kyra Hawn, a spokeswoman for the program office. She said that a routine inspection at Edwards Air Force Base in California on February 19 revealed a crack on a low pressure turbine blade that is part of the F-35's F135 engine. The blade was on an F-35 A-model, or Air Force variant, which takes off and lands from conventional runways. Pratt spokesman Matthew said the inspection showed ‘an indication of a crack’ on the third stage low pressure turbine airfoil. He said the company was working closely with the Pentagon, Lockheed and the military services to get the planes flying again. Engineering teams are removing the turbine blade from the plane and plan to ship it to Pratt's engine facility in Middletown, Connecticut, for more thorough evaluation and root cause analysis, according to the Pentagon and Pratt. Replacing: The F-35 is intended to replace older fighters like the Air Force F-16, pictured, and the Navy F/A-18 while hoping to purchase more than 2,400 . Hawn said an initial analysis was expected next week. The U.K., Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, Australia, Denmark and Norway are scheduled to purchase versions of the F-35. The grounding comes on the heels of a nearly month-long grounding of the Marine Corps variant of the new warplane after a manufacturing defect caused a fuel line to detach just before a training flight in Florida. The Marine Corps variant of the F-35, which takes off from shorter runways and lands like a helicopter, was grounded for nearly a month after a fuel line detached just before a training flight at Eglin Air Force Base in January. That issue was later found to be caused by a manufacturing defect. The Pentagon and the U.S. Navy lifted flight restrictions on the B-model of the plane on February 13.

A good Samaritan braved the freezing waters of Lake Michigan risking his own safety to rescue a confused dog wandering on ice floats. Spotting Pifas, a three-year-old stranded golden retriever mix half-a-mile out on the lake, Dave Kehnast, 37, didn't think twice about donning his wetsuit and jumping aboard his kayak to rescue the stricken dog on Friday. As the Chicago Fire Department went through safety procedures, Kehnast cut through the ice with his raft and herded the dog back to shore through the perishing waters of the lake off the Loyola Park section of Chicago.

Dave Kehnast tried to get the dog to listen to his commands - but Pifas was scared and confused . Rescued: Pifas the dog was reunited with his owner at a Chicago Animal Care and Control center on Friday evening - he will be allowed home on Sunday . News cameras captured the heartwarming rescue at 4.30 p.m. on Friday - which included hand-in-mouth moments as Pifas the dog fell into the water on occasion, clearly struggling with exhaustion. 'I was up on the fire escape there on the seventh floor up there and I saw him way out there and so I grabbed the kayak over here and I know that the lake is only a couple of feet deep all the way out to where the ice shelf ends so I knew I'd be fine,; Kehnast explained to Fox News.

Watched by a news camera onboard a helicopter - Dave Kehnast and Pifas made their way to the sure together . Chicago Fire Department officers also attempted to encourage Pifas the dog to make his way to shore . 'I just kept encouraging him, ‘here boy, here boy, here boy' said Kehnast. 'I got really close to him and he wanted to bite me so I just stayed on me and at that point I could get into the water and just hustled him along. 'I wanted to just grab him because it was shallow enough where I could stand, and I just wanted to get my hands on him but he wanted to bite me, it looked like. He didn't want anyone touching him.' In fact, once the dog reached safe ground after the hour-long ordeal, he took off running. He took off from there, escaping authorities as he ran around nearby apartment complexes. Eventually crews caught up with the exhausted dog and ushered it into the back of a white utility van - from where it was taken to an animal shelter. Hero (left) Dave Kehnast saved Pifas the dog from the freezing waters of Lake Michigan . Owner Nerijus Steponavicius had lost his dog over a week before the dramatic rescue on Friday .

'We used a helicopter to try and move the dog a little closer to shoreline, we brought a boat in.' Dog and owner are due to reunited on Sunday after Steponavicius heard from family that his dog had starred on the afternoon news. As the rescue attempt was caught on live television, Steponavicius, of Wicker Park, said his cell phone was ringing non-stop, from calls from people who recognized the dog. Rushing to the Department of Animal Care and Control, Steponavicius was told he couldn't be reunited with Pifas because he was not neutered, an operation carried out yesterday. Once he was back on shore - Pifas was still so confused that he made off and went running around - and had to be caught be emergency workers . However, Pifas was pleased to see his owner. 'He’s really shy, so when he saw me he started jumping around in the cage,' said Steponavicius with a huge smile. 'The biggest lesson, once again: keep those dogs on leashes along the lakefront in the wintertime,' said Chicago Fire Department Deputy District Chief Ron Dorneker. 'This is what can happen when they get out there on that ice and they fall through and they get a distance off-shore.' For hero Kehnast, he said he simply could not have just watched the dog flounder on the ice. 'I wanted the dog to live just like any other person out here watching him,' said Kehnast.

A mother who kidnapped her two children and fled to Australia after complaining her husband spent more time playing cricket than he did with her has won the right to take them to live abroad permanently. The Australian-born dental nurse abducted the couple's children, aged four and five, when her marriage broke down, taking them from their home in East Sussex to Melbourne without telling her British sports masseur husband. Now a judge at London's High Court has ruled that the children should live in Australia, despite the 'abysmal' and 'cruel' way the 34-year-old woman had treated their father when she disappeared to the other side of the world with his young family. 'Selfish': A judge ruled the children should live in Australia with her mother, despite the 'abysmal' way she had treated their father . In a judgement made public today, Mr Justice Mostyn said in the interests of the children - who cannot be named for legal reasons - he had decided not to punish their mother for her 'high handed, selfish and autocratic' conduct, and to 'shut out his strong feelings of sympathy' for the youngsters' father. The woman's estranged husband, 33, has agreed to move from East Sussex to Australia - where the judge noted he could still pursue his passion for cricket - following the outcome of the case. The judge told how the Australian born mother became 'miserable' and complained that her husband, a member of a local cricket club, spent more time with playing sport than he did with her. There days after her husband asked for a divorce, the woman took the couple's children to her parents home in Melbourne. The judge told how the couple met in Brisbane in 2001 while they were both on holiday, and renewed their acquaintance when the mother was travelling in the UK. They lived together at the home of the man's parents in the UK for the first half of 2005 before the woman returned to Australia. The man then moved in with her in Australia at the end of 2005 and the pair got married in the country in April 2006. After returning to Eastbourne in July 2010 the couple moved in with the husband's parents once again, before renting their own flat in the town from January 2011. But in May 2011 the woman 'went home' to Australia without telling her husband. The ensuing legal battle saw the children 'subjected to two years of uncertainty' ahead of the High Court's ruling. 'This was an open and shut case of child abduction,' Mr Justice Mostyn said. Kidnapped: It was an 'open and shut case of child abduction' when the woman took the children to Australia without telling their father, a judge said . It led to protracted court proceedings in Australia where the mother battled to keep her children in Melbourne while their father fought to have them returned to England. In July last year the mother dropped her defence and in August after 15 months in Australia the father brought them back to live in England. She returned to England in December and applied for a relocation order to take them back permanently to live in Australia. The judge said the decision he had to make 'is exceptionally difficult as the merits each way are evenly balanced'. He added: 'But in a way the decision I have to make is not as heart-rending as is the case in so many of these relocation disputes. 'This is because the parents have agreed that whatever I decide there will be shared care. I will have to decide in which country the children should live and in the light of that decision the unsuccessful parent will travel to live in that country. 'This is to the very great credit of the parents, who each is prepared to put his or her interests beneath those of the children,' the judge said. 'These children will grow up enjoying the society of each of their parents and will not be confined, like so many children in these relocation disputes, only to occasional direct contact with the non-residential parent.' The judge said that the father 'accepted that he retained friends in Australia although these had dwindled to few in number'. He added that the man would be able to continue to pursue his 'principal recreational interest' of cricket in Australia. In finding in favour of the children returning to Australia the judge said he found the father to be 'honest and fair'. Ruling: The judge said the father intended to move to Melbourne, in Australia, to be close to his children following the outcome of the case at London's High Court . While the father described his wife's apology as insincere and 'manipulative' the judge said she had eventually shown 'remorse' and apologised for her actions. 'However, it must be possible for the scales to fall from the eyes of someone in the wrong; for her to recognise her wrongdoing; and to seek redemption,' the judge said. 'I judge the mother to have been sincere (up to a point) in her remorse and apology, and at last to have recognised that her behaviour was very poor indeed.' He added: 'I am therefore prepared to give the mother the benefit of the doubt. I very much hope that the faith that I place in her will not prove false. She should have no doubt that if that faith is breached she will likely lose the shared care of the children. Mr Justice Mostyn said he regarded the children's father as 'highly competent and self-sufficient'. He said the children's 'physical, emotional and educational needs are much the same whether they are in Eastbourne or Melbourne'. The judge continued: 'The decision that I make is based from first to last on the interests of these children. I must shut out my strong feelings for sympathy for the father at the high-handed, selfish and autocratic way he has been treated by the mother, and I must eschew any temptation to punish the mother for that conduct.' He said the couple had decided to divorce in whichever country they live in, which would now be Australia. But before leaving the case he said: 'Finally, I would repeat what I have said before. Child abduction seldom, if ever, has a happy ending. It has rightly been described as a form of child abuse. 'The mother's conduct was abysmal. It was an act of deliberate cruelty to her husband, the father of her children. It was directly contrary to the interests of the children for them abruptly to have been removed from the society of their father. 'It has subjected them to two years of uncertainty while they have been taken across the world, back and forth. It has embroiled all members of the family in extensive litigation with days in court in both countries. 'It has brought the mother to the brink of bankruptcy. Yet it has not been until very recently that the mother has developed any self-awareness. Her attitude was ""I did not abduct them; I just took them home"". 'This is an all too common attitude but it is as misguided as it is futile. If the place to which the children are taken is a subscriber to the Hague Convention then the children will almost inevitably be returned with all the delay and heartbreak that this case has demonstrated. Had the mother behaved correctly and made an application for relocation in 2011 then I expect it would likely have been granted, and all that trauma avoided,' the judge said.","Mother fled to Melbourne with children when marriage broke down .

Farmers' subsidies: The money is being clawed back because of 'inadequate control procedures' in the handing out of farmer subsidies . The European Commission is demanding £86 million back from Britain for failing to stick EU farming rules. The money is being clawed back because of 'inadequate control procedures' in the use of the farming subsidies member states receive from the EU budget under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget, a commission statement said. National authorities are responsible for managing the bulk of CAP handouts, including checking the validity of farmers' claims for direct payments. The commission carries out more than . 100 random audits annually to monitor national controls - with the legal . power to demand funds back if 'member state management and control is . not good enough to guarantee that EU funds have been spent properly', . said today's statement. The . UK is one of 22 member states targeted for clawbacks totalling nearly . £360 million for 'non-compliance with EU rules or inadequate control . procedures on agriculture expenditure'. The . sum demanded back from London is the biggest single clawback from any . member state - more than double the £42 million being recouped from .

Prime Minister David Cameron promised last month to give Britons an in-out choice on whether to remain in the 27-nation bloc if he is re-elected in 2015, after trying to negotiate a reform of EU policies to meet British concerns. 'Knowing Britain a little bit, and knowing how important the business community is and the role that different parts of British society can have on this open debate, in case there is a referendum, I am confident that Britain will remain a member of the European Union,' Barroso said.","'Inadequate control procedures' blamed in handing out farmer subsidies .

New BBC director-general Lord Hall has appointed a former colleague to a top post at the corporation on a £395,000 salary. Channel 4 chief operating officer Anne Bulford has been handed the role of managing director of BBC finance and operations without the job being advertised. Her appointment comes shortly after the new director-general announced that he had hired former Labour culture secretary James Purnell to be its strategy and digital chief on a £295,000-a-year salary. Like Miss Bulford he was appointed without the role being advertised. Lord Hall, chief executive of the Royal Opera House, formally takes up his BBC post in April. Before joining Channel 4 in 2005, Miss Bulford spent three years with the Royal Opera House as director of finance and business affairs. Lord Hall knows her from their time together at the Royal Opera House and also from his time as deputy chairman at Channel 4. Her appointment is bound to trigger fears of cronyism. Miss Bulford had previously worked at the BBC as head of internal audit and then finance director of BBC Productions. She will replace the BBC’s outgoing chief financial officer, Zarin Patel. In her new job, which begins in the summer, she will also take on some of the responsibilities of former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who left the BBC last year. Miss Bulford is already being tipped as the corporation’s first female director-general. There was some disquiet within the BBC yesterday about how this and Mr Purnell’s appointment had happened without any formal job application process. stressed graphic.jpg . Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘At a time when the BBC are saying they are having to cut back on programme budgets because of the squeeze on the licence fee, it is extraordinary that they think this is an appropriate amount to pay in public money to an individual, however good. ‘Secondly it demonstrates they are still completely out of touch with the world in which most people have to live today.’ In an email to staff, Lord Hall said Miss Bulford was a ‘direct appointment rather than an advertised one’ because he believed her talent and experience ‘make her the best person for this role’. Her salary is not far off Lord Hall’s pay of £450,000 a year, but the BBC claimed it was a net saving of about £250,000 from the combined salaries of Miss Patel and Miss Thomson. Miss Bulford’s salary at Channel 4 was £375,000 but she earned a total pay package of £456,000 there last year. She said: ‘I am really looking forward to returning to the BBC. I have such great respect for the organisation. ‘I am also very pleased to be working with Tony [Lord Hall] once again.’",Anne Bulford tipped as the corporation's first female director-general .

Blue Gum was orphaned by recent raging Australian bushfires but is gradually being nursed back to health at a wildlife centre. And carers hope the four-month-old will soon be on the mend and jumping for joy. Bouncing back: Blue Gum was rescued from the pouch of his dying mother during sweeping bushfires . Orphan: The baby kangaroo's mother did not survive and he is being cared for at Wildhaven Wildlife Centre . Blue Gum was rescued by a passer-by from his mother's pouch as the Donnybrook fire swept through Melbourne's northern suburbs. However, the joey's mother did not survive the blaze and he was taken to the Wildhaven wildlife shelter. Carer Stella Reid said without the man's intervention, Blue Gum would have died as well. She said: 'If a member of the public hadn't been out checking their own animals and spotted his legs sticking from his mother's pouch, he would've died.' The Donnybrook fire started on February 18 and the grassfire soon became out of control. Peek-a-'roo: Blue Gum, pictured swathed in blankets, is on the mend but suffered a broken leg in the trauma . Playmates: The tiny kangaroo is dwarfed by a banana and a wombat also being cared for at the centre . It eventually burned more than 5,000 acres of land as it headed towards the suburbs. It took 170 firefighters and 40 trucks to battle the flames into submission. But despite his traumatic start, Blue Gum is already bonding with other animals at the 104-acre shelter. Pictures show Blue Gum cosying up to a small wombat as the pair relax in blankets. He will now stay with Stella for the next two years until he is old enough to be set free. Relaxing: Blue Gum will be cared for at the wildlife centre for two years. In the wild he would have stayed in his mother's pouch until he was at least eight months old . Deadly: Thousands of livestock and unknown numbers of wildlife have perished in the devastating bushfires . The Australian bushfire season has been one of the worst in living memory spurred on by an intense heatwave. The country experienced some of the hottest temperatures in history last month and a new record of 40.33C was set on January 7.

'Gentle giant': The family of the late 7ft 2in Graham Mellor face a 70-mile round trip to cremate him because his local crematoriums can't cater for his giant coffin . The two crematoriums nearest his home . in Bucknall, Stoke-on-Trent, turned them away saying Mr Mellor’s 7ft 9in . coffin is too big for them to cremate.

He died at his home on February 13 . after suffering a ruptured aneurysm. His relatives were stunned when . crematoriums at Carmountside in Stoke-on-Trent and Bradwell in .

A disgraced former police officer who quit the force and turned to a life of crime has been jailed for running a 'sophisticated' cannabis factory with a convicted killer. Paul Lewsey, 50, spent 12 years as a 'highly respected' traffic officer with Lincolnshire Police before leaving on medical grounds and eventually turning to crime. Lewsey has now been sentenced to more than three years in prison after his former colleagues found £150,000 worth of cannabis in the factory he was running with Simon Hopps - a man who had previously been jailed for manslaughter in 1994. Disgraced: Former traffic officer Paul Lewsey, left, has been jailed for running a cannabis factory with Simon Hopps, right, who was previously jailed for manslaughter in 1994 . Lincoln Crown Court heard Lewsey was spotted carrying large containers of water into the factory, which the pair ran from a disused warehouse off the A631 in Hemswell. Lewsey was jailed for three years and four months yesterday after he admitted producing a controlled drug between August 10 and September 23 2012. Hopps, 38, was sentenced to 16 months in prison after admitting the same charge. Sentencing Lewsey, Judge Sean Morris said: 'This was clearly a set-up that was meant to be there for a long time and to produce extremely large amounts of cannabis. 'I am quite satisfied you had a significant role in this. You had full awareness of the sheer scale of the operation,' the judge told Lewsey. 'Significant role': A judge said the former police officer had 'full awareness of the sheer scale of the operation' The court was told the factory was well hidden and could not be detected by specialist heat-seeking equipment typically used to track down cannabis farms. But it was uncovered because the lack of a mains water supply meant hundreds of litres of water had to be transported to the site each day in order to maintain the plants. Undercover police officers spotted Lewsey bringing in water in 25-litre containers on a daily basis. When the building was raided officers found a sophisticated cannabis-growing operation divided into two rooms, the court heard. It is thought the plants recovered from inside the factory, together with the remains of a recently harvested crop also found in the building, would have produced £150,000 worth of cannabis, the court was told. Well hidden: Undercover officers observed Lewsey visiting the disused warehouse in Hemswell carrying large containers of water . Illicit: Plants recovered from the building would have produced an estimated £150,000 worth of cannabis, the court heard . Lewsey also used his own home as a nursery for young plants, and when police raided his property they found 117 seedlings waiting to be transferred to the site. He served as a detective constable and as a traffic officer during his career with Lincolnshire Police, which began in 1986. In August 2005 he was jailed for six years for supplying cocaine. Lewsey, a former detective constable, had been arrested after offering drugs to an undercover police officer he met in a pub. Prosecutor Jeremy Janes said the cannabis plants found inside the building were capable of producing nearly 7kgs of the drug, while the remains of a recently cultivated crop in the adjoining room would have produced a further 8kgs. Barry Gilbert, defending, described Lewsey as having 'a chequered past'. A former colleague of Lewsey's said yesterday: 'I worked with Paul for many years and he was a good officer, highly respected and thorough. 'Somewhere along the line he must have flipped and went over to the other side. It's very sad.'

Victoria Kish-Donovan slept surrounded by his pictures and spent hours sobbing at the tree where he died, leaving flowers and notes. Eventually, unable to cope with the grief any longer, she hanged herself from the same branch of the same tree. Romeo and Juliet: Builder Raymond Oswell 31, was found . hanged after girlfriend Victoria Donovan, 24, ended their romance and started dating someone else. She then took her own life, a Manchester inquest has heard . An inquest heard how Mr Oswell, 31, moved out of the couple’s home after their seven-year relationship broke down.

Their families wept as Manchester . coroner Nigel Meadows read out details of the tragedy. He said: ‘This is . almost a repetition of a very famous play by Shakespeare called Romeo . and Juliet – it could be the modern equivalent. ‘Victoria was so traumatised by . Raymond’s death she wanted to take her own life, even though it would . mean leaving her children and family behind.

I love you Ray' and in the run up to her death would lie in her bed surrounded by photos of her former partner (pictured) The couple met in 2005 when Miss . Kish-Donovan was 17 and Mr Oswell was 24. They set up home together in . Wythenshawe, Manchester, and had two children but after seven years . their relationship came to an end in March last year. The body of the ‘distraught’ father was found on June 21, hanged from a tree in Hatchett’s Wood near his home. Tragic: The couple left their two children, along with Victoria's eight-year-old son from a previous relationship . He was discovered by his sisters after they went to search for him when he failed to return home. Following his death, Miss . Kish-Donovan’s family said, she was devastated and spiralled into . depression after she became unable to cope with the guilt. She would regularly be found at the . tree where Mr Oswell died, which had become a shrine to him surrounded . by photographs and flowers. Her mother Paula Donovan, 43, said: . ‘She would go to the tree and I would try and take her away, but she . would not stay away. She just never stopped crying; she blamed herself . for what had happened to Ray and felt responsible. ‘She said she wouldn’t do anything to . herself because of the kids but I felt it inside. I worried about her. She would lay on her bed with Ray’s pictures around her.’ On July 7 last year Miss Kish-Donovan was found hanged in the same secluded wood as Mr Oswell by a group of boys. She still had faint signs of life but police and paramedics called to the scene were unable to save her. Goodbye notes to her children and family and a love letter to Mr Oswell were later found in her bedroom. Miss Kish-Donovan’s sister, Simone, 29, said: ‘Victoria and Raymond really were truly in love.

Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps. Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents’ credit cards. Now as many as 23million people in the US are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. Hidden costs: Angry Birds is one of the free-to-download games from iTunes that has in-game purchases which lure youngsters into spending their parents' money . A number of software companies have . developed games that are popular with children. These ‘bait apps’ let . you buy credit in order to progress through the game. When children purchase ‘currency’, . their parent’s iTunes account gets automatically charged. Apple started . requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March . 2011. But many parents around the world had already been hit by large . and unexpected bills. A US legal case was triggered by a . nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of ‘virtual . money’ from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, . the games were described as ‘highly addictive’ and designed to ‘compel’ children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million). The company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK. Those claiming $30 or more from Apple may choose to receive a cash refund instead of an iTunes store credit, according to the filing. The case involves games such as Angry Birds, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads on tablets such as Apple's iPad. Money down the drain: Payments are taken automatically from the credit . cards of the adult owners of the computer or smartphone via, for example, . an iTunes or Google account . Often, the first time a parent finds . out about the purchases is when their credit card is rejected at a . check-out till or they find a black hole in their current account. The . lawsuit, filed by five parents in 2011, involved allegations . surrounding purchases in certain downloaded apps, which plaintiffs claim . were made by children without the knowledge or permission of the . account holder. The lawsuit . also alleged that 'Apple failed to adequately disclose that third-party . Game Apps, largely available for free and rated as containing content . suitable for children, contained the ability to make In-App Purchases.' The . founder of parenting website Netmums, Siobhan Freegard, told the Daily . Mail earlier this month: ‘We have heard of cases where parents have been . hit with bills for hundreds of pounds as the apps are often linked to . their card details through iTunes. Often the bills aren’t immediate and . it takes days to find out they have been charged.’ Last year, six-year-old Jake Sadler spent £1,000 playing Zombie Takeover, which was free to download, on his mother’s iPad. His parents only discovered the problem after receiving a call for their bank’s fraud team who had concerns with ‘unusual activity’ on their account. Taking aim at Apple: Today's proposed settlement requires court approval. The court will hear the settlement on March 1. Jake’s mother Gemma, 31, a nursing . support assistant, from Portsmouth, said: ‘We had no idea the money was . even going out of our account until the fraud squad at the bank rang us. ‘And when we looked at our bank account and found such a large amount of money missing I felt absolutely sick.’ In theory, Apple accounts require users to input a password to clear any purchases. However, . if the parent uses the password once, this creates a 15 minute window . where the child can then make a series of purchases. Separately, . children who have become engrossed in a game will often pester their . parents continuously to allow them to make purchases. Spencer Whitman of app protection firm AppCertain said: ‘App developers are not often altruistic. ‘They . often include in-app purchases hidden behind the free price tag. Either . they offer a small amount of play, then charge for continued use; offer . in-app purchases for more in-game content such as extra areas of play . or upgrades; or they constantly interrupt game play to ask for in-app . purchases.’ Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, said: ‘It’s all too easy for our children to get sucked into games and, before you know it, they’ve racked up huge costs buying coins, berries and doughnuts. ‘You do need to keep an eye on your child’s device settings and to keep your password for purchases private at all costs.’ Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s far too easy for children to run up huge bills on phone apps when most default settings allow ‘in-app purchases’ without asking for a confirmation or password. ‘If your child has run up a huge bill without your knowledge, contact the app store or manufacturer, as you may be eligible for a refund.’ Apple said: ‘All iOS devices have built-in controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content, such as internet access and age-rated content. ‘Parental controls also give parents and guardians the option to turn off functionality, such as purchasing from iTunes, and the ability to turn off in-app purchases.’ Today's proposed settlement requires court approval. The court will hear the settlement on March 1. Apple could not immediately be reached for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours.","Silicon Valley firm agrees payout to settle class-action lawsuit .

The Stop the Killer Robots will warn about the threat that robots pose to humanity, like in the 1984 American science fiction action film The Terminator directed by James Cameron . A group of academics, pressure groups and Nobel peace prize laureates is to launch an international campaign to ban 'terminators' before they reach the production stage, it was reported today. The Stop the Killer Robots campaign will call for a global treaty on robot warfare and autonomous weapons, the next step from unmanned drones, before they become a 'threat'. Dr Noel Sharkey, a leading robotics and artificial intelligence expert and professor at Sheffield University, said weapons like these are already being worked on by scientists and will be available within the decade. He believes that development of the weapons is taking place in an effectively unregulated environment, with little attention being paid to moral implications and international law. The campaign will be launched in April at the House of Commons and includes many of the groups that successfully campaigned to have international action taken against cluster bombs and landmines, The Observer reported. Professor Sharkey told the paper: 'These things are not science fiction; they are well into development. 'The research wing of the Pentagon in the US is working on the X47B [unmanned plane] which has supersonic twists and turns with a G-force that no human being could manage, a craft which would take autonomous armed combat anywhere in the planet. 'In America they are already training more drone pilots than real aircraft pilots, looking for young men who are very good at computer games. They are looking at swarms of robots, with perhaps one person watching what they do.' Sharkey insists he is not anti-war but deeply concerned about how quickly science is moving ahead of the presumptions underlying the Geneva convention and the international laws of war. He disputes the justification that deploying robot soldiers would potentially save lives of real soldiers and says at present there is no mechanism in a robot's 'mind' to distinguish between a child holding up a sweet and an adult pointing a gun. In November it was reported that a centre for 'terminator studies', . where leading academics will study the threat that robots pose to . humanity, is set to open at Cambridge University. Sheffield University's Professor Noel Sharkey, a world leading robotics expert and former judge on TV's Robot Wars, is backing the campaign . The Stop the Killer Robots campaign will call for a global treaty on robot warfare and autonomous weapons, the next step from unmanned drones (pictured) The campaign will be launched by Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal, at the House of Commons in April .

The suits, filed in Pennsylvania, California and other states, claim consumers have been cheated out of the alcohol content stated on labels. Budweiser and Michelob each boast of being 5 percent alcohol, while some 'light' versions are said to be just over 4 percent. The lawsuits are based on information from former employees at the company's 13 U.S. breweries, some in high-level plant positions, according to lead lawyer Josh Boxer of San Rafael, California. The lead lawsuit, which the company dismissed as groundless, says the alcohol content is mislabeled on the brands Budweiser, Michelob, Michelob Ultra, Hurricane High Gravity Lager, King Cobra, Busch Ice, Natural Ice, Bud Ice, Bud Light Platinum and Bud Light Lime. Attorneys for the plaintiffs say their lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco on Friday, could affect tens of millions of consumers of products from Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer. Josh Boxer, an attorney behind the legal challenge, acknowledged his San Rafael, California-based Mills Law Firm is not basing its claims on independent testing of Anheuser-Busch products taken from store shelves. 'We learned about the mislabelling from a number of former employees of AB (Anheuser-Busch) at breweries throughout the United States,' Boxer said. 'And some high-level guys at the brewery level all told us that as a matter of AB corporate policy, these target brands are watered down.' Aside from the lead lawsuit in California, companion suits were being filed this week in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and other states, Boxer said. There will be about a dozen lawsuits in total, he said. The plaintiffs' attorneys plan to ask a judge to designate their legal challenges as a class-action lawsuit. They are seeking restitution for U.S. consumers that they say could amount to tens of millions of dollars, and . a court injunction to impose requirements on how Anheuser-Busch labels . and regulates alcohol content in its beers. Hopping mad: Beer lovers across the country have filed $5 million class-action lawsuits accusing Anheuser-Busch of watering down its Budweiser, Michelob and other brands . 'We have a situation here where a nationwide class of beer drinking consumers has been denied the full value that they paid for AB's products,' Boxer said. Peter Kraemer, vice president of brewing and supply at Anheuser-Busch, said in a statement the lawsuits were 'groundless' and the company's beers were in 'full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws.' 'We proudly adhere to the highest standards in brewing our beers, which have made them the best-selling in the U.S. and the world,' Kramer said. Rebuttal: Anheuser-Busch has vigorously denied the allegations from drinkers . The plaintiffs in the lead lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco are Nina Giampaoli and John Elbert. Giampaoli for the past four years has bought a six-pack of Budweiser every week, the lawsuit said. The suit accuses Anheuser-Busch of watering down beers right before bottling, which the complaint states shaves 'the total alcohol content to well below the percentage stated' on labels. The plaintiffs' attorneys said that, in court, they will seek to obtain documents from Anheuser-Busch's in-house measurements to demonstrate how much the company's beers are diluted.","Class action lawsuit claims parent company Anheuser-Busch watered down several brands of beer, including Budweiser and Michelob .

The teenage daughter of a crown court judge killed herself after scouring suicide websites then drinking a lethal drug she ordered on the internet. Isobel Narayan, 16, bought a drug used to kill patients by lethal injection on Death Row after suffering a ‘mini crisis of confidence’ a month before her death. But her father, Harry Narayan, 66, told an inquest that Isobel, a top student who was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder, had seemed to be ‘back on track’ after talking to her school tutor. Tragic: Isobel Narayan, 16, killed herself with a drug bought over the internet. She was found dead in her bedroom at the family home . Mr Narayan said: ‘There was absolutely nothing which indicated that there was a problem.’ Then, on the morning of December 18, . 2011, Isobel’s mother Anne,  56, discovered her youngest  daughter dead . in her bunk bed  at their £400,000 home, in West  Didsbury, Manchester. The couple tried to resuscitate Isobel, a keen horse rider who wanted to become a vet, but she was pronounced dead in hospital. Upsetting: Harry Narayan told of his doomed attempt to save the life of his 16-year-old daughter . A post-mortem examination and . toxicology tests revealed a significant amount of the drug in her blood. There were no drugs or alcohol in her system other than the substance, . which she had drunk with mouthwash. Police examined her computer and . discovered that in late October Isobel had begun reading online forums . and researching how terminally ill patients could end their own lives. They also found a typed a list of reasons why she should end her life. At around the same time, the drug was sent to the family home from either America or China. Mr Narayan, a barrister who sits as a . crown court recorder and a part-time immigration judge in Manchester, . said he was at a loss to understand why his daughter, known as ‘Bel’, . would take her own life. He said: ‘Bel was a top student  in physics. The only thing she  complained about was not getting enough homework.’ The inquest heard Isobel had moved to Xaverian College, Manchester, to start her A-levels in September 2011. She appeared to be doing well but . unexpectedly took a week off school in November. Mr Narayan said: ‘When . she was off I was asking, “are you pregnant or being bullied” and she . said “no”.’ He said Isobel spoke to one of her . tutors because there was some concern about how she was coping and ‘a . few tears were shed’. But the following week she returned to school and . ‘it was business as usual for the family’. Difficult day: Freya Narayan, right, the sister of Isobel, is pictured leaving Manchester Coroners court . Recording a verdict of suicide, coroner Nigel Meadows said: ‘Isobel had a mini crisis of confidence. ‘There was no clue or indication of . what was going through her mind.  It’s a strange time of life for . teenagers; hormones are raging, there are pressures which we do not . recognise when we’re older, and on occasion they do harm themselves.’ Mr Meadows said he would write to the .

"PUBLISHED: . 18:10 EST, 25 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:49 EST, 27 February 2013 . Parents desperate to conceive feel they have no choice but to travel to Mexican clinics to spend thousands of dollars in cash on a controversial and potentially dangerous blood therapy suspended in the United States. Jennifer Benito-Kowalski and Steve Kowalski tried and failed at great expense to become pregnant using LIT - the technique pioneered by Dr. Beer . Lymphocyte immunization therapy or LIT is fast becoming a last resort for couples for whom IVF and natural conception has failed but because it is not offered by U.S. insurance firms would-be moms and dads are flooding over the border in hope. Pioneered by American fertility physician Dr. Alan Beer, his eponymous Center for Reproductive Immunology in Los Gatos, California, is actively encouraging parents into shady dealings with Mexican physicians during which cash is handed over in turn for access to treatment. Dr. Alan Beer, who died in 2006, theorized that a woman's immune system can become hyper-defensive, mistaking her partner's sperm as a disease and actively stop a fetus from growing. 'Effectively, women become serial killers of their own babies,' he wrote in his 2006 book, 'Is Your Body Baby-Friendly?' reported the San Francisco Chronicle. Beer argued that LIT works by injecting a woman with her partner's blood cells until her immune system fails to see them as foreign - much like an allergy shot in reverse. The science of LIT argues that the therapy blocks prospective mother's antibodies who have been trained to see male sperm as foreign invaders. The course of treatment also is supposed to shift the body's immune response to a state where it accepts foreign cells. Beer claimed the credit for pioneering the treatment in the United States and said that in Mexico, LIT was responsible for achieving an astounding 78 percent success rate in parents who attended clinics there. Dr. Alan E. Beer pioneered the use of LIT before it was suspended in the United States and claimed an extraordinary success rate for pregnancies with it . However, a 1999 study by the University of Chicago with women who had had more than three miscarriages came to different conclusions. Eighty-six subjects over the course of their research underwent a course in LIT and 85 patients received a placebo according to the San Francisco Chronicle. One-third of the LIT patients became pregnant, but 50 percent of the control group also became pregnant. 'This therapy,' the researchers concluded, 'should not be offered as a treatment for pregnancy loss.' So, in 2002 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suspended it, citing the scientific findings of the University of Chicago that it does not work. However, that move left prospective parents such as Jennifer Benito-Kowalski and Steve Kowalski without another option once natural conception and IVF had failed. Ruling out adoption, and feeling the advance of time, 38-year-old Jennifer and her husband traveled to the Alan E. Beer Center for Reproductive Immunology and Genetic in Los Gatos for help. Despite LIT being illegal in the United States, this has not stopped the doctors at Beer's from directing hundreds of patients to leave the country to undergo the procedure - all paying cash in hand. 'They're couples who are very, very frustrated,' said Dr. Edward Winger, the clinic's director. 'They've been through the system. They've been told, 'Oh, if you just do this, it'll work. Oh, if you just do IVF (in vitro fertilization), it'll work. 'I'm very convinced that this approach of going after the immune system, and making adjustments there, is an approach which is based rationally and does work.' Alan E. Beer Center for Reproductive Immunology in Los Gatos, California is not considered a bone-fide fertility clinic because it does not handle male sperm or female eggs . Encouraged by the physicians at Los Gatos, the Kowalski's approached a clinic just over the Arizona border in Nogales, Mexico, run by Dr. German Quiroga. Subsequently contacted via email by the doctor's assistant, the Kowalski's were asked to travel to meet in a McDonald's in Tuscson and to bring $600. 'It seems so movie-like,' Jennifer recalled later to the San Francisco Chronicle. 'I didn't know what to expect.' The nervous couple were told to leave their hotel the next day and drove to the border where they were instructed they would be picked up. Dr Edward Winger of the Alan E. Beer Center for Reproductive Immunology and Genetics - is a staunch proponent of LIT . A van arrived and inside was Dr. German Quiroga and another couple from St. Louis headed for the clinic in Nogales also. Altogether the group were transported across the border to Mexico to Nogales, known for its booming private cosmetic, dental and fertility clinics. Taken up to Dr. Quiroga's second floor office, he drew out Steve's blood and made a solution from his white blood cells and then gave Jennifer four shots in each arm. The procedure was so fast that later that afternoon they were back in Arizona. Soon after, Jennifer developed red marks and itching on her skin - a common side-effect according to a 2006 survey of 2,600 LIT patients in Germany. Failing to fall pregnant over the . course of the first treatment, the Kowalskis paid for an additional four . to the tune of $3,450, plus travel costs - but they felt this was a . deal compared to the $12,000 average cost of IVF they had paid before. 'You . have a therapy that does not cost nearly as much as what IVF costs,' said Los Gatos clinic director Winger to the San Francisco Chronicle, 'and you can prevent needing a . second failed IVF.' The Los Gatos clinic is adamant it does not receive any money from LIT treatments that their patients seek outside the country. Also, . the Los Gatos clinic does not perform any treatments in which eggs and . sperm are handled, the California Department of Public Health does not . class it as a fertility clinic. However, because of this and their experimental approach to medicine, many experts are unconvinced. 'There's no scientific evidence that's consistent to support this theory,' said the Kowalski's own fertility physician at their local hospital to the San Francisco Chronicle. 'But there have been a handful of patients who conceive after the immunotherapy.' 'It makes no sense whatsoever and it's potentially dangerous,' said Dr. Joseph Hill III, a physician at the Fertility Centers of New England and a critic of Beer. 'I'm surprised anyone in this country is still doing anything along those lines.' The Mexican/American border - Arizona is on the left and Nogales is on the right . Despite all their efforts, last year, after another miscarriage, the Kowalski's decided to use a surrogate in India and halt LIT. 'I don't know if they (Beer's clinic) would have ever said, 'You guys ought to try something else, maybe we can't help you after all,' said Kowalski to the San Francisco Chronicle. However, one patient, Jacquelyn Smit, 41, of Half Moon Bay in California has given Beer's program the thumbs up after she became pregnant with twin boys. She already had a daughter in 2007, but failed to conceive again and miscarried six times in three years. Learning of LIT on the Internet, she went to the Beer clinic who told her she had a two percent chance of falling pregnant without their help. Deciding to follow their advice she made her way to Mexico: 'I don't believe that I would have my twins if I hadn't gone through their protocol,' she said. 'The conception was never the problem,' she added. 'It's holding onto the pregnancy that was the problem. So I think it's the way my body reacted to a pregnancy that had changed.' However, Jennifer could never understand why she couldn't fall pregnant, but is magnanimous about the program. 'I know other women and they do go through the Beer protocol and it works for them,' she said. 'But it didn't work for me.'","Couples at their wits end hoping to conceive are being encouraged to travel to Mexico to undergo a controversial blood therapy .

A B-52 aircraft drops a scramjet' during tests in California: A B-52 could be used in an offensive on Iran . America and Israel are considering a joint surgical strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, it was claimed today. Foreign Policy magazine reported a source 'close to the discussions' and said the strike might compose primarily of bombers and drone support. The suggested attack is expected to last no more than a few days - or even just 'a couple of hours', the magazine said. Such a strike could be carried out without civilian casualties, and would set back the Iranian nuclear program by back many years. Benefits of such a strike would be regional, Foreign Policy says. The source, said to be in favour of the strike, said the Israel-led assault would be 'transformative' and would end up 'saving Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, reanimating the peace process, securing the (Persian) Gulf, sending an unequivocal message to Russia and China, and assuring American ascendancy in the region for a decade to come.' However the strike would need the support of outside countries, particularly the U.S. - 'whether acting alone or in concert with Israel and others.' The report added that, with the progress made between Israel and the U.S. administration recently, a strike could help President Barack Obama defuse his opponent's Mitt Romney's criticisms about Iran. The report concluded: 'It's not the size of the threatened attack but the likelihood that it will actually be made, that makes a military threat a useful diplomatic tool. And perhaps a political one, too.' Nuclear base? An alleged facility in Natanaz, Iran, which could be targeted in any strike . Mitt Romney, seen here meeting students in Virginia, said Obama was 'sitting on the sidelines' This week Romney recently vowed to . help arm Syrian rebels fighting against President Bashar Assad's brutal . regime as part of a push to abandon President Barack Obama's 'passive' leadership in the Middle East. In . a foreign policy speech at the Virginia Military Institute, said he . would 'will work with our partners to identify and organise those . members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain . the arms they need to defeat Assad’s tanks, helicopters, and fighter . jets'. He accused Obama of . 'sitting on the sidelines', quoting a Syrian woman as accusing the . President of abandoning Syria, saying: 'We will not forget that you . forgot about us.' Romney argued that rebel forces in . Syria could be important future allies against Iran. 'Iran is sending . arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat . for them,' he said.

Millionaire: Walter Samasko Jr died with only $200 in his bank account, but weeks later officials discovered gold coins in his garage valued at more than $7million . Even though he lived in the same quiet neighborhood for decades, no one seemed to know of 69-year-old Walter Samaszko Jr., or of his amazing fortune worth millions piled quietly away in his garage. Mr Samaszko, as well as his secret, were so unknown that weeks passed before authorities discovered he had even died in May. Today about half of 135-pounds of gold coins discovered weeks after his death inside his Carson City, Nevada home will be auctioned off in a city courtroom. The fortune is expected to net about $3 million toward some $800,000 in government estate taxes and fees. The obvious profits from any sales beyond that amount will go to Samaszko’s first cousin and sole heir, Arlene Magdanz, a substitute teacher in San Rafael, California who hadn’t spoken to him in at least a year. When a cleanup crew was sent to his property it was only then that his multi-million dollar stash tucked inside old ammunition boxes was discovered. Authorities say it took an exhaustive search to locate Ms Magdanz whose first words upon hearing of the inheritance in September were ‘Oh my God, Oh my God,’ according to her attorney. Auction: Nearly half of 135-pounds of gold coins discovered in this Nevada home's garage in May will be auctioned off toward taxes . Heir: Profits beyond those toward taxes will go to Mr Samaszko¿s first cousin and sole heir, Arlene Magdanz, a substitute teacher in San Rafael, California, pictured . The auction will include only the bullion coin collection, not the collector's edition coins, said Alan Glover, Carson City's clerk recorder who will oversee the auction. 'They're buying and bidding on an ounce of gold, pure gold by the weight,' Glover said. The bidders are all professional coin collectors who regularly make purchases ranging from $3 million to $10 million, he added. Coins have been grouped into 11 sets based on type, and the sets have been weighed by the ounce. The collections range from 24.1 troy ounces to 602 troy ounces. In total, about 135 pounds of gold is to be sold at auction, which Glover said is expected to net about $3 million. Another auction for the larger half of the collection is likely later, he said. Officials discovered the trove neatly wrapped and stored mostly in ammunition boxes stacked on top of each other. There were more than 2,900 Austrian coins, many from 1915; more than 5,000 from Mexico; at least 500 from Britain; 300 U.S. gold pieces, some dating to 1880; and more than 100 U.S. gold pieces as old as the 1890s. Adding up: Officials said that much of Mr Samanko's wealth was from $20 U.S. gold coins (stock photo) Royal find: He also had a collection of British sovereign coins that depicted Queen Victoria, in both her earlier and later years on the throne (stock photo) Among the coins were meticulous records of the purchases dating back to at least 1964, when gold averaged about $35 per ounce. The precious metal currently sells for nearly $1,600 an ounce. Authorities believe that his mother, who lived with Samaszko until her death in 1992, purchased most of the coins. ‘They were most likely taking money out of their stock accounts and buying gold with it,’ Mr Glover said. Despite the millions of dollars in his garage, Samaszko didn't appear to lead a luxurious life. Records show he only withdrew about $500 a month to pay modest bills. He died with $1,200 in a checking account and just a bit more than $165,000 in a money market and mutual fund account. Since learning of her inheritance, Magdanz has shunned publicity and not made any comments about the fortune. Glover had died from heart problems, a coroner found, at least one month before he was discovered. Leaving no will, and with no known relatives, officials set about tracking down a list of people who had attended Samasko's mother's funeral after she died in 1992, the Las Vegas Sun reported. She had not spoken to her cousin for a year. Other things found in the 'anti-government' pensioner's home included a stash of conspiracy theory books and several guns, Mr Glover said. He rarely went out and never went to a doctor, Mr Glover said. Samasko had lived in the house since the 1960s. Records show that he hadn't held down a steady job since 1968. His mother also lived there until her death in 1992. Cases like this are rare within Carson City. ‘I’ve never had a case like this, and not in this amount,’ Mr Glover said, adding thoughtfully: ‘(Mr Samasko) had some definite survival tendencies.’","Walter Samaszko Jr. died in his Carson City home last June .

Ms Hathaway's decision was prompted when she saw Amanda Seyfried's Alexander McQueen gown, which was apparently very similar to the Valentino number she had been set to wear . Ms Hathaway made reference to the gown switch when interviewed by Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet on Sunday. 'I didn't know what I was wearing until about three hours ago,' she told him. 'This was the one that spoke to me in the end.'

An incredible video has emerged of a kindly pod of dolphins helping save a baby seal from being washed up on a beach. In the video, captured by a Canadian film crew, the exhausted baby seal struggles against the current as it drifts ever closer to the shoreline and away from the safety of the deeper waters. But just as it seems as though the pup will lose its battle against the waves, a family of dolphins emerge and lend a helping fin as they send the pup on its way. This is the amazing moment when a friendly pod of dolphins intervened to help a struggling seal pup find its way back to deeper water and safety . The seal had somehow become separated from its group and was straying dangerously close to the shore when the pod of bottlenose dolphins arrived . The lone pup had floated into the shallow . waters and, exhausted, was drifting close to the shore, unable to save . itself by swimming away. Then grey shapes appear in the water nearby as a family of bottlenose dolphins swim into view. Curious, they swim up to the struggling pup, and then, seeing its distress, lend a helping fin by nudging the pup gently back to deeper waters. The remarkable video was captured by a Canadian crew working on a series of documentaries entitled Return to Shark Island for the nature channel Oasis HD. Safe at last, and saved from near-certain death, the seal pup swam away from its rescuers back into the deep waters . Creatures lending a helping hand - or fin, or wing - is widely recorded throughout the animal kingdom particularly in species with complex social structures. For example, vampire bats regularly regurgitate blood and donate it to other members of their group who have failed to feed that night, ensuring they do not starve. Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of  between 10 and 30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles emitted from the blowhole and sounds emitted through body language, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface. There have been numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence, which has driven interaction with humans. They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers. In numerous bird species, a breeding pair receives help in raising its young from other ‘helper’ birds, who protect the nest from predators and help to feed the fledglings. Vervet monkeys give alarm calls to warn fellow monkeys of the presence of predators, even though in doing so they attract attention to themselves, increasing their personal chance of being attacked. Lori Marino, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, who has studied bottlenose dolphins, told Associated Press that dolphins show similar intelligence and social behaviour as apes, monkeys and even humans. She said: 'The more you learn about them, the more you realise that they do have the capacity and characteristics that we think of when we think of a person.' Dolphins have ridden to the rescue of humans as well as baby seals: they have been known to save injured divers by raising them to the surface. They also do this to help injured members of their own species. In November 2004, a dramatic report of dolphin intervention came from New Zealand when four four lifeguards, swimming 330 feet off the coast near Whangarei, were approached by a shark. Hero dolphins herded the swimmers together and surrounded them for 40 minutes, preventing the shark from attacking, as they slowly swam to shore.","Helpful behaviour shown by the dolphins is 'common' in the animal world .

A colourful, fruit-eating bird with a black mask, pale belly and scarlet breast has been discovered and named following an expedition to the remote Peruvian Andes. The Sira Barbet, or Capito fitzpatricki, is described by Cornell University graduates in a paper published . in the July 2012 issue of The Auk, the official publication of the . American Ornithologists' Union. The team discovered the barbet on a ridge of mountainous cloud forest in the Cerros del Sira range in the eastern Andes. The Sira Barbet, Capito fitzpatricki, has been discovered and named by Cornell University graduates following an expedition to the remote Peruvian Andes . The new species was discovered during a . 2008 expedition led by Michael G. Harvey, Glenn Seeholzer and Ben . Winger, young ornithologists who had recently graduated from Cornell. Steep ridges and deep river gorges in the Andes produce many isolated habitats and microclimates that give rise to uniquely evolved species. Though clearly a sister species of the Scarlet-banded Barbet, the Sira Barbet is readily distinguished by differences in color on the bird's flanks, lower back and thighs, and a wider, darker scarlet breast band. Machu Picchu in Peru: The unique terrain of the surrounding area leads to a diverse range of species . By comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences of the new barbet to DNA sequences of its close relatives in the genus Capito, the team secured genetic evidence that this is a new species in the barbet family. The genetic work was done by co-author Jason Weckstein at The Field Museum in Chicago. The team chose the scientific name, Capito fitzpatricki, in honor of Cornell Lab of Ornithology executive director John W. Fitzpatrick, who discovered and named seven new bird species in Peru during the 1970s and '80s. Winger said: 'Fitz has inspired generations of young ornithologists in scientific discovery and conservation. 'He was behind us all the way when we presented our plan for this expedition.'",Species Capito fitzpatricki named after Cornell director who discovered new species in the 1970s and 1980s .

Mother: She was convicted of all eight counts of child sexual exploitation, transporting a child across state lines to produce child pornography and possession of child pornography . A top lawyer has been found guilty of using her daughter, 14, as a sexual pawn to entice men to engage in threesomes, which she filmed to produce child pornography. The born-again Christian, from New Hampshire, who has been named only as 'L' to protect the identity of her daughter, is a reformed drug addict who credited turning her life around to God. She was convicted of eight counts of child sexual exploitation, transporting a child across state lines to produce child pornography and possession of child pornography, and was convicted on all of them after the jury deliberated for less than an hour. As well as exploiting her daughter, 'L' - who is divorced - forced her to drink and smoke marijuana. She is now in foster care. The 43-year-old's attorney called no witnesses during barely a day of testimony, only imploring jurors in his closing arguments to put aside their emotions as they deliberated. In a recorded phone conversation with her daughter from jail in December, the woman told her, 'I should have been the mom, not the friend.' She was neither, according to a U.S. attorney and testimony at the brief trial in U.S. District Court in Concord, which included two men recounting sexual encounters with the mother and daughter. A Canadian named Kevin Watson testified that he met the girl online in 2012, that they had sexually explicit Skype sessions, and that he spent Memorial Day weekend last year with mother and daughter in a motel room in Niagara Falls, Ontario, about three weeks after the girl's 14th birthday. The woman told him it was her daughter's first time having intercourse, and she videotaped that and other sexual encounters during the weekend, Watson said. It isn't clear whether Watson knew the girl's age at the time. Testimony: 'L' told the Canadian it was her daughter's first time having intercourse, and she videotaped that and other sexual encounters during the weekend . Brandon Ore, of Lebanon, New Hampshire, testified he met the two after responding to a personals ad placed by 'two girls, 18 and 33, looking to party'. He moved in with them in July 2012 and said it was weeks later that he learned they were mother and daughter, and that the girl was 14. He moved out two months later and turned himself in to police, triggering the lawyer's arrest. 'The partying was out of control, the sex was out of control and she was charging high rent,' Ore said. The men testified they often had sex with the mother with her daughter present. A . friend testified on Wednesday for the prosecution that the lawyer is a . devout Christian, someone she befriended a dozen years ago when the two . met regularly in a home Bible studies group. The . defendant put herself through college after nearly a decade of . convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol and driving while . her license was suspended, according to records published in the New . Hampshire Union Leader in the 1990s and early 2000s. She was valedictorian of her . college's graduate and professional studies program in 2005. In her . address, she credited Christianity with saving her from a life of drugs, . alcohol and abusive marriages, the Union Leader reported then. 'When I became pregnant with my daughter, I now had the responsibility for a second life,' she said in her speech. The . lawyer was a member of, and had advocated for, a Christian legal group . that fights against same-sex marriage and for other conservative causes. Testimony at the trial was graphic and wrenching. Trial: A U.S. District Court jury in Manchester, New Hampshire, took almost no time at all today to convict 'L' on all counts of child exploitation . Attorney: Jim Moir said his client is devastated at the verdict, though she showed no emotion when it was read out in court . As jurors watched recordings of various sexual encounters, the defendant averted her eyes from the laptop screen in front of her and dropped her head into one hand. The final video, prosecutors said, depicted the woman having oral sex with her daughter. Before introducing it into evidence, prosecutors had the girl's father – the defendant's ex-husband – identify the voices captured on tape. He wept uncontrollably after identifying the voices as his daughter's and his ex-wife's, and he left the courtroom before the tape was played for the jury. As the tape played, its audio track filling the courtroom, the defendant clapped her hands over her ears and wept. The judge ordered the video stopped partway through. 'This goes on for quite a while,' the judge said. He had prosecutors skip to the end. In other recorded, expletive-laden phone calls to her parents in December, the defendant called her daughter a liar and blamed her for her predicament. 'This is not her daughter's fault. Tell her by your verdicts she should have been a mother,' U.S. Attorney John Kacavas said in closing. 'The defendant was her pot pusher, her pornography producer and her predator,' he said. Defense Attorney James Moir had an uphill battle defending his client against the layers of graphic videos the defendant was alleged to have planned and produced. He said she didn't force or prompt her daughter to engage in the sex acts but called no witnesses. 'You can hate her. You can be morally outraged by what she did,' Moir told jurors in his closing argument. 'You can have these emotions, but you have to put them aside when you deliberate.' The jury signaled in less than an hour that it had reached a decision. The daughter sat in the courtroom, apparently unnoticed by her mother, as the verdicts were read Thursday. Neither mother nor daughter showed a visible reaction. 'The evidence was pretty overwhelming,' said juror Peter Evans, of Manchester. 'She's going to deserve whatever she gets.' The mother has been behind bars since her arrest in November and faces at least 25 years in prison when sentenced in April. L's Facebook page says she is a 'lawyer in Manchester and a torch-bearer of religious freedom.

But that all changed last November, when daytime talk show 'The Doctors' gave Keim the chance to have her hearing restored through breakthrough surgery.

Kingsman David Robert Shaw who died in hospital yesterday after he was wounded in Afghanistan . A British soldier who died in hospital yesterday after he was wounded in Afghanistan was someone who would 'make time for a hug for everybody', his family said today. Kingsman David Robert Shaw, from 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, was shot when his checkpoint came under attack from insurgents in the Lashkar Gah district of Helmand Province on Monday. The 23-year-old was flown back to the UK for treatment but died yesterday at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. His family paid tribute to Kingsman Shaw today, saying: 'He will be missed and never forgotten.' In a statement issued through the Ministry of Defence (MoD), his family said: 'David was a much-loved son and brother who was proud to have served his country in the 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. 'He loved his family and friends and would always make time for a hug for everybody. 'He enjoyed playing football, running and was an Arsenal fan. He also followed his local team, Barrow AFC. 'He has touched many lives. He will be missed and never forgotten.' Known in his battalion as 'Doctor S', Kingsman Shaw, from Barrow-in-Furness, joined the army in February 2008 and after training was posted to 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment. He was first deployed to Afghanistan in March 2010 with Corunna Company, and returned last October as an Assault Pioneer as well as a qualified sharpshooter, the MoD said. In one incident, he gave first aid to four local children who had fallen into a canal after a vehicle accident, showing actions 'of the highest calibre'. Aerial views of Lashkar Gah, Helmand, Afghanistan, where the sharpshooter was injured when his checkpoint came under attack from insurgents . Lieutenant Colonel Nick Wood, commanding officer of 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, described his death as a 'devastating tragedy'. 'David was a true Cumbrian and Kingsman: physically and mentally tough, a warrior through and through, utterly loyal to those he worked with and possessing a sense of humour that touched us all,' he said. 'Known throughout the Battalion as 'Doctor S', he was the most popular of individuals. His joking and light-heartedness would lift the gloomiest of situations and have us all laughing. He was someone we all wanted to be with and have around. 'Highly experienced in operating in Afghanistan, he was conducting his second tour, having previously served here in 2010. 'Both times he deployed regularly into some of the most dangerous parts of the country but was unflinching in his bravery and courage.' He said the 23-year-old's ability to inspire people marked him out as a future leader. 'Everyone wanted to be next to David on patrol as they knew he would be there for them. 'As one of the more senior Kingsmen in his platoon, he took pride in helping those junior to him through challenging times, and there were plenty. Such unselfishness was something that we all aspire to. 'The loss of David has left a gaping hole in the battalion and in our lives. Our memories of him will make us laugh and cry and renew our resolve to succeed with the mission - his sacrifice will not have been in vain.' Major Mark McLellan, officer commanding Corunna Company, 1st Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, said Kingsman Shaw had been selected to attend a potential junior NCOs cadre, where he would have 'done very well'. He said: 'Kingsman Shaw had been through some of the fiercest fighting we have seen as a company and always came out the other side smiling and cracking jokes. 'He had the ability to raise morale just by being in the room and his loss is keenly felt across the whole battalion as there are few people who did not know him.' He said Corunna Company had been left hollow and saddened by the loss, but that would 'only be a shadow' of what Kingsman Shaw's family must be feeling. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of Kingsman David Robert Shaw. 'He has been praised by his colleagues as a highly-skilled and capable soldier whose loss will be felt deeply by all who knew him. 'My thoughts are with his family, loved ones and those he served alongside in the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment.' Kingsman Shaw, who joined the army in February 2008, is the second British serviceman to be killed in Afghanistan this year. His death takes to 440 the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.","Kingsman David Robert Shaw helped four children who had been injured in a vehicle accident .

For Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the past year has been one of disbelief, unspeakable grief, and of action. Her son was killed last February by armed Neighborhood Watch captain George Zimmerman, launching a battle over the controversial ‘Stand Your Ground’ law, as well as a fight for civil rights. Speaking of her late son, Ms Fulton said: ‘I never said he was perfect, but he was mine.’ Mother's grief: Sybrina Fulton, right, pictured with Tracy Martin, center, said that she still finds it hard to believe Trayvon is gone, a year after he was killed . One year later: Ms Fulton appeared on 'Piers Morgan' with Tracy Martin, right, and their attorney, Benjamin Crump, left . Martin had been staying with his father, Tracy Martin, at the Retreat at Twin Lakes residences, a gated community within the town of Sanford, Florida after being found at school with an empty marijuana baggie. Ms Fulton spoke with the Washington Post today over the past year, saying that it’s been difficult to come to terms with Martin’s death. ‘From that day until now, I’m still in disbelief,’ the mother said. Zimmerman claims he shot Martin out of self defense after Martin attacked him, but the attorneys for the Martin family claim that the white Hispanic man was racially profiling the black teenager. Speaking tonight on CNN’S ‘Piers Morgan Tonight,’ Ms Fulton said that she and Martin’s father plan to honor the anniversary of their son’s death by attending a candlelight vigil in New York. Tracy Martin also added that in light of recent events, from the shootings in Aurora to Newtown, ‘it’s time for America to take a look at our gun laws.’ He added: ‘It’s too much senseless violence.’ Shot: Martin, pictured in an undated family photo, was shot after an alleged altercation between himself and George Zimmerman, a Neighborhood Watch volunteer . Day in court: George Zimmerman arrives for a hearing in Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida February 5; his defense team is hoping to be granted immunity from a self-defense hearing . Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, added that he hopes the trial will bring to light the problems surrounding the ‘Stand Your Ground’ law, which Mr Crump said encourages ‘vigilante justice.’ Asked about the trial and whether or not she hopes Zimmerman is found guilty, Ms Fulton said: ‘We’ve just asked for (the case) to come to trial. Whatever decision the jury makes, we may not like it, but we’re going to accept it.’ Evidence in the case was slow to trickle out; Sanford police did not immediately arrest or charge Zimmerman with any crime, and the photographs they took of Zimmerman from that night, apparently with bloodied head wounds and a broken nose, were also slow to be released. Zimmerman has been raising money for his defense, including attorney Mark O’Mara. According to his defense website, Zimmerman has raised more than $314,000 to pay legal fees and his $95,000 bond, but may have to pay more than $1million by the time the trial is done. His website states that the defense hopes to begin a Self-Defense Immunity Hearing on April 22. If Zimmerman is not granted immunity, a trial is scheduled to commence on June 10, 2013. Scene: A file photo from February 27, 2012 shows the scene where neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin . Last meal: Trayvon Martin picked up candy at this 7-Eleven before he was shot; he was found carrying Skittles and an iced tea . Since posting bond, Zimmerman has been living at an undisclosed rental house in Seminole County with his wife. Zimmerman is also in a legal battle against NBC, and is suing the network following an edit of the original 911 dispatch tapes. He claims that the tapes were edited to be more sensational, cutting together Zimmerman saying that Martin ‘looks black’ and appeared to be ‘up to no good.’ At the time of the lawsuit, NBC Universal said the claims were unfounded. ‘There was no intent to portray Mr Zimmerman unfairly,’ the company said in a statement, adding: ‘We intend to vigorously defend our position in court.’ In the weeks after the shooting, thousands of people marched through Sanford, demanding Zimmerman's arrest. T-shirts and posters of Martin sold rapidly on Sanford streets, with people holding posters and chanting ‘Justice for Trayvon,’ many of them carrying Martin’s final purchase from a 7Eleven – Skittles and Arizona iced tea. Filmed: Surveillance footage of Martin from last February shows the 17-year-old making his purchase . Injuries: Photos from the State Attorney's Office shows George Zimmerman's injuries following his fatal altercation with Martin . The protests stopped after Jacksonville prosecutor Angela Corey took over the investigation and filed second-degree murder charges against Zimmerman a month and a half after Martin's shooting. At the height of the protests last March, national civil rights leaders such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and the NAACP's Ben Jealous had vowed to turn Martin's shooting into a movement addressing equal justice under the law, as well as 'stand your ground' laws that allow people to use deadly force if their lives are in danger. While those issues have retreated somewhat in the national discussion, they haven't in Sanford, where race relations and concerns about traditionally underrepresented communities have moved to the forefront. 'It's on our minds all the time,' City Manager Norton Bonaparte told the AP. He is black. 'Out of tragedy comes opportunity,' said Mayor Jeff Triplett, who is white. 'There was a scab over the wound of race relations, and this event opened it up.'

President Obama’s former press secretary said today that he was specifically instructed by the White House not to acknowledge the administration’s use of drones. Speaking Sunday on MSNBC’s ‘Up w/Chris Hayes’ Sunday, Robert Gibbs said that he was told when he was named White House Press Secretary that ‘one of the first things they told me was, “You’re not even to acknowledge the drone program. ‘”You’re not even to discuss that it exists,”’ the former press secretary and current MSNBC political analyst said.

Game of drones: The Obama administration has claimed transparency but has, until recently, denied the scope of the program's existence . Mr Gibbs’ statement today is in direct opposition of one of the Obama Administration’s mainstays – transparency. ‘You’re the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program…pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,' he said on the MSNBC program. The president said in a statement . that his administration was striving to create ‘an unprecedented level . of openness in government,’ saying that he would work ‘to ensure the . public trust and establish a system of transparency, public . participation, and collaboration. ‘Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government,’ the president had said. However, the administration has . significantly expanded its drone program, deploying around 100 troops to . Niger in West Africa to target Al Qaeda. Drones will be used for . surveillance, and ostensibly, for attacks. Controversial: Drone strikes have been used increasingly to carry out dangerous missions . Mr Gibbs referenced a 2009 exchange with former Fox News reporter Major Garrett, who asked about the drone program. ‘I would get a question like that and . literally I couldn’t tell you what Major asked, because once I figured . out it was about the drone program, I realize I’m not supposed to talk . about it.’ The White House did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment on Mr Gibbs’ statement.

Gibbs added that he believes the president must be more forthcoming. ‘I . have not talked to him about this, so I want to be careful – this is my . opinion – but I think what the president has seen is, our denial of the . existence of the program when it’s obviously happening undermines . people’s confidence overall in the decisions that their government . makes.’ Deny: Gibbs, pictured in January 2011, served for two years in Obama's administration .

One of the world’s most acclaimed artists has admitted to having an ‘non platonic’ affair with a former Vogue writer, even though both of them are married and even though she has denied it. Abstract painter Brice Marden, 72, admitted to trysts with Helen Lee Schifter, who is 18 years his junior, behind the back of his wife, also called Helen. The affair is said to have gone on for more than a year and culminated in an extraordinary fight at an exclusive Manhattan restaurant between the two Helens. Man in the middle: Painter Brice Marden has admitted to a year-long affair with Helen Lee Schifter, left . Mrs Marden is said to have walked up to her at Bar Pitti and said: ‘Are you the ***** that has been ******* my husband?’ At this the entire restaurant is said to have burst into applause. The row has apparently been common knowledge among Manhattan's art world cognoscenti for some time, but was only now burst into the open. Marden has since reportedly apologised to his wife of 43 years, who is the mother of his two grown-up daughters. According to the New York Post the row is over Schifter who is Marden’s ‘muse’ and inspiration for his renowned minimalist works, which sell for as much as $9.6million. Over the last 12 months however their relationship is said to have tipped over into something more, with Mrs Marden all too aware of what was happening. She is said to have been at Bar Pitti in Manhattan's West Village recently, when she got up, walked over towards Schifter's table and began shouting at her. A source said: ‘Helen Marden lurched at Helen Schifter and said, 'You need to go to another restaurant!' She lurched at her but she didn't actually slap her.’ Long-time love: Brice and Helen Marden have been married for more than 40 years . Marden has two daughters with Helen, Mirabelle, 32, and Melia, 30, along with a son from a previous marriage, Nicholas, 49. He grew up in a Westchester suburb of New York, graduating from Boston University’s School of Fine Arts before receiving an MFA from Yale in 1963. Critics have called him ‘the most profound abstract painter of the past four decades’ and he has featured in dozens of shows around the world. Schifter is married to Tim Schifter, co-creator of Gwen Stefani's L.A.M.B fashion line. She is 54 and used to write for Vogue magazine and is a regular on the New York party scene. Coupled: Helen Lee Schifter. left, is married to Tim Schifter, co-creator of Gwen Stefani's L.A.M.B. fashion line, right . A source said: ‘Helen Schifter is a muse for Brice's artwork, nothing more. She is happily married. ‘Brice has since apologised for his wife's behaviour.’ Mrs Marden, who is herself an artist, said in a statement: ‘I was cold and calm. I did not lurch. I was not in a rage. I slapped her. We have been married 43 years. I am not interested in this story any more.’ Schifter denied any suggestion she was having an affair. ‘It's platonic,’ she said. ‘Brice has been a mentor and a friend. Out of respect for their marriage, I have no further comment.’ Her husband Tim said: ‘I stand by my wife completely.’ Marden has in the past spoken about his devotion to his family - and how much its members inspire him. Stand-off: Bar Pitti , the Manhattan restaurant where Mrs Marden confronted Mrs Schifter . In a 2000 profile piece in trade magazine Art News, he claimed that he had little social life outside of his family. ‘The children keep you very straight,’ he said, adding that Helen is his ‘best friend’. ‘Her opinion is the opinion I respect the most about my work,’ he said. Marden's first wife, whom he married in 1958, was Pauline Baez, sister to Bob Dylan's then girlfriend Joan. However, when he failed to make it as an artist, the strain took its toll and the couple were divorced by the end of the next decade. Only after marrying Helen did Marden flourish and earn his fortune with a style that has been described as ‘a preoccupation with rectangular formats and the repeated use of a muted, extremely individualised palette’. His daughter Mirabelle is involved in the art scene in her own right and co-owns the Rivington Gallery on New York's Lower East Side.",Helen Lee Schifter claims relationship with Brice Marden was merely artist and muse .

The Democratic candidate won in large part because of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s super PAC, which gave her more than $2million for the race. The gun debate played a vital role in the nomination, the first since December’s fatal shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. Scroll down for video .

'That's what money gets you,' he told the AP after conceding late Tuesday. 'We earned every vote.' Guns were a leading issue at . candidate forums and email blasts from candidates, even as Jackson's . legal saga played out in court and frustrated voters who've seen two . other congressmen in the office leave under an ethical or legal cloud. Jackson resigned in November, after a . months-long medical leave for treatment of bipolar disorder and other . issues, then pleaded guilty earlier this month to charges that accused . him of misspending $750,000 in campaign money on lavish personal items, . including a Rolex watch and fur coats.

Investigators in California believe the home invasion robbery that ended in the death of a San Jose millionaire last year was the result of a tip off from a prostitute to members of rival gangs it was revealed today. Law enforcement officials familiar with the case have said that Raven Dixon, 22, passed on information about the layout of Raveesh 'Ravi' Kumra's home to three men connected with two of Oakland's most notorious gangs, The Money Team and Ghost Town. Deangelo Austin, 21, Javier Garcia, 21 and Lukis Anderson, 26 have been charged with the November murder of the 66-year-old cell-phone entrepreneur after his 7,000 square-foot home in Monte Sereno was ransacked and cash, jewelry and rare coins stolen. Scroll Down for Video . Murdered: Raveesh Kumra, best known for owning Mountain Winery, was tied up and then killed in his mansion in November . Dixon is also charged with being an . accessory to the killing of Kumra and according to sources, Kumra hired . Dixon many times as a prostitute which explains her familiarity with his . home. Millionaire Kumra was a former owner . of Mountain Winery in Saratoga and his bound body was found in his home . by his wife, Harinder, who made the 911 call to police. Despite a Santa Clara County Judge . sealing all documents related to the case, law enforcement officials . told the San Francisco Chronicle that gang members Austin and Garcia . joined forces to commit the robbery and murder after Dixon gave them a . tip-off.

Garcia's mother, Maria Rodriguez of Oakland, said Wednesday, 'Javier has nothing to do with it - they have the wrong guy.' His brother, 25-year-old Cordell . Rodriguez, added, 'Of course, he ain't killed nobody. They need to find . the person who killed somebody. That's what they need to do, their job.' Javier Garcia, 21 (left) and Lukis Anderson, 26 . have been charged with the murder of 66-year-old businessman Raveesh . 'Ravi' Kumra . Deangelo Austin, 21, (left) is also charged with . the businessman's murder and allegedly received a tip-off from Raven . Dixon, 22, regarding the layout of the millionaire's home . This comes two weeks after it was claimed the millionaire businessman led a sordid life filled . with prostitutes, drink and drug problems, illegitimate children and a . sham divorce, court papers revealed this week. Raveesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, was found dead in his Monte Serlo, California, mansion on November 30 . and though a prostitute and three men were arrested in connection with . his death, police are remaining tight-lipped about the details, except . to say it was not a random act of violence. Volumes . of court files presented approximately two weeks ago to Santa Clara County's Sunnyvale . courthouse painted Kurma as a ruthless businessman who lived a sordid . and debauched lifestyle full of lies and deceit. One email from a  former CEO of Kumra's Tesla Capital venture . firm, to another former Tesla executive said: 'Ravi has never treated anyone fairly in . his life, except for his whores.' It also detailed that his 2006 divorce from his wife Harinder was a sham in order to hide millions of dollars in assets, according to Mercury News. Ravesh 'Ravi' Kumra, 66, a cell-phone entrepreneur and the former owner of Mountain Winery in Saratoga. His body was found after his wife summoned police to the couple's ransacked, 7,000-square-foot home in Monte Sereno, in the hills west of San Jose . The mansion: Kumra's ex-wife, Harinder was also home at their large villa in Monte Sereno and was tied up during the attack. She told police she believed three or four people had entered the family's mansion . Ravel Chanel Dixon, 22, a single mother and college student, was arrested last month for allegedly offering sex, drugs or money to an undercover cop. It was after her arrest she was linked to Kumra's murder. The millionaire is best known for owning Mountain Winery in the 1990s. Kerry Harris, spokesman for the police . department, said two weeks ago: 'We have not exhausted all investigative . leads at this time and until that happens, we can't be sure that we . have all the suspects. 'At that point in time, we will be able to . paint a more complete picture.' At 1.30am on November 30, Harinder called police to the couple's gated Monte Sereno estate and said she had been beaten up and her husband tied up after four intruders broke in. When police arrived they found Kumra dead. Harinder was taken to hospital for her injuries. They have not said whether or not anything was stolen from the home during the break in. Former CEO Stephen Kaffee said that before he died, Kumra told him that his divorce was 'on paper only', that he had an illegitimate child whose mother was trying to extort hundreds of thousands of dollars from him and that he received a 90-day suspended jail sentence in the late 1990s due to his alcohol-fueled and violent behavior. Kaffee wrote in a 2007 declaration filed . in the divorce proceedings: 'However successful Kumra may have once . been in business, in my opinion his chronic abuse of alcohol, his . chronic use of marijuana, his failure to address his health problems, . and his immersion in a fantasy world of prostitutes and illegitimate . children have left him without the interest or ability necessary.' Charged in connection to homicide: The visibly frightened Dixon, of Alameda County, California, was charged with 'accessory after the fact' in the November 30 killing of 66-year-old millionaire investor Raveesh Kumra . When the couple divorced, the house, the . furnishings, the Mercedes, a cellular phone company and the Tesla . venture capital firm were signed over to his wife, which Kaffee believes was done to avoid a pending lawsuit involving Kankakee Cellular of Illinois stripping him of his millions. The lawsuit accused Kumra of using funds from the Kankakee bank account 'to pay . for escort services, prostitutes, purchasing condominiums for his . female companions and other personal expenses'. He was supposed to have a management role in the firm but court papers said he 'performed virtually no services whatsoever'. In return, Kurma accused Kaffee and another executive of trying to embezzle money from him. The case was later dismissed. Kumra was the first homicide victim in Mountain View, California, in 40 years.

In today’s era, we worry about our digital and environmental footprints, but what of the genetic traces we leave behind? One Brooklyn-based artist has pondered such information, and rendered 3D models of anonymous New Yorker’s faces by using only their DNA collected from everyday discarded items such as gum, cigarette butts, and fallen strands of hair. Information artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg said that these renderings bear only a ‘family resemblance’ to their original owners, as it would be near-impossible to exactly replicate someone’s looks. Here's looking at you, kid: Information artists Heather Dewey-Hagborg collected objects from the streets of Brooklyn and created generalized 3D portraits using only their DNA; this cigarette was retrieved from the intersection of Myrtle Ave. and Himrod St. Brooklyn; its smoker is an Eastern European female . In her project, entitled ‘Stranger Visions,’ Ms Dewey-Hagborg was initially intrigued by what information people leave behind. The original idea came to her during a therapy session. 'I noticed there was a crack in the picture and there was a hair in the crack. I became really curious about it,' she told MailOnline on Sunday evening. 'And seeped in the popular culture of forensics, I really wondered what was actually possible.' From a single strand of hair, she can extract basic hereditary traits, including hair color, eye color, ethnicity, and gender. However, her 3D renderings were based only on eye color, gender, and maternal ethnicity. 'Age isn’t one of the factors I’m using,' the 30-year-old Bushwick resident said. 'It is information that is becoming increasingly available. Right now, (the renderings) are in the 20-something range. But they could be eight or 80.' She analyzed the samples and rendered them in a program she wrote herself, and printed out the end result using a 3D printer. The artist told Co.Exist that a lot of the actual rendering had a lot of guesswork to it. Dominant genes, such as brown hair and brown eyes, are hard to predict. ‘There’s an 80 percent chance that this person has brown eyes and 20 percent chance they have green eyes,’ she told the website. Traces: Another subject left a cigarette behind on Myrtle Ave.; the artist discovered that he, too, was of Eastern European descent and had brown hair and eyes . Found objects: The cigarette was recovered from a fairly dingy area of Myrtle Ave. in Brooklyn . ‘You have to make that call.’ Ms Dewey-Hagborg added that the rendering called for a bit of, well, artistic licence. ‘It does involve, essentially, creating a stereotype and generating faces based on those stereotyped ideas,’ she told Co.Exist, adding that she’s hoping to tackle additional traits. She writes on her blog that many of the samples were taken from unassuming locations. 'Like any kind of science, as the . technology becomes implemented, there is the potential for great help . and the potential for great harm.' A cigarette butt from Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn carried the DNA of an Eastern European male, who was found to have brown eyes. At the intersection of Wilson Ave. and Stanhope St., Ms Dewey-Hagborg found a discarded piece of used gum. The DNA was Haplogroup D1, meaning the chewer was of Native American and South American backgrounds. 'My original goal in starting this project was to understand more about forensic and DNA technology,' she told MailOnline. 'I’m thinking about the issues more, and I hope it can open up a dialogue both in terms of how it can be used in law enforcement and the opportunities we have to survey each other. We don’t have a lot of legislation, and we need a dialogue on it. 'Like any kind of science, as the technology becomes implemented, there is the potential for great help and the potential for great harm.' Ms Dewey-Hagborg's renderings are currently on display at the Clocktower Gallery in Lower Manhattan. Pieces of me: A New Yorker's discarded gum led to this 3D rendering of a man Ms Dewey-Hagborg found to be of Native and South American decent .

One of the animals then lunges towards the 35-year-old and pulls him to the ground. Scroll down for video . Witness: The trainer and the tiger were videoed from outside the ring by an onlooker . This picture is believed to show the trainer Alexander Crispin 'Suarez', who was killed by a tiger during a performance of Circus Suarez in the city of Hermosillo, Mexico . Mexican news agency Notimex reported Mr Crispin suffered neck injuries from bites and scratches on Saturday. He was taken by ambulance to the Red Cross . hospital Huatabampo, Sonora where he died while receiving medical care, . as a result of hypovolemic shock. The video shows spectators fleeing the circus tent as two workers beat the tiger to free Mr Crispin, who was pinned to the ground. It is presumed that the Bengal Tiger was . killed by one of the companions of the trainer during the struggle to . try to save the trainer's life. The tiger pounces on the man, inflicting fatal neck injuries from bites and scratches . The tiger bit and scratched the 35-year-old man, going for his neck as horrified spectators looked on . The circus tried to fight off the tiger, but it was to no avail. He was taken to hospital where he died of his injuries . Immediately, spectators flee the circus tent as two workers beat the tiger to free Crispin, who was pinned to the ground .

In the wild, Bengal tigers live alone . and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals away - . but rarely attack humans. The most famous of these occurred in October 2003 when Roy Horn, of . the famous Siegfried & Roy Las Vegas show, was attacked by a seven-year-old white tiger named Montecore during one of the duo's . performances. Horn was in critical condition for several weeks after he suffered massive blood loss and a stroke, but eventually recovered. Thumbs up: Alexander Crispin is believed to be shown in this picture playing with a tiger . The Suarez Brothers Circus is described as a traditional and successful act that tours Latin America. It was founded in 1853 by Miguel Suarez . Tiger tamers have been part of the performance at the circus for many years, as this leaflet shows . In their natural habitat Bengal tigers are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals. The tigers use their distinctive coats as camouflage and lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce. A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60lbs in one night, though they usually eat less. Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans however, a few do become dangerous maneaters. These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live in an area where their traditional prey has vanished. Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from the male. Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their mothers for two to three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.","U.S. citizen Alexander Crispin circled two tigers during his act .

A director of a youth center has been accused of having a six-month affair with her son's 15-year-old friend. Susan Sundo, 45, was arrested on Wednesday after her own husband tipped off police about the alleged sexual relationship with the boy. The mother-of-three is alleged to have had sex in her basement with the teenager when he stayed for sleepovers at her home in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. Scroll down for video . Illicit allegations: Susan Sundo, a married mother-of-three, has been accused of having an affair with the 15-year-old friend of her son . On trial: Susan Sundo, 45, arrives for her preliminary hearing on Wednesday, January 16, after the youth center director allegedly had an affair with a teenage friend of her son . Sundo is also believed to have sent the 15-year-old explicit text messages describing sexual acts she would like to do to him. According to the criminal complaint, the teenager would meet Sundo in the attic or basement of her home wearing just his underpants while others in the home were asleep. The couple also had sex in the backseat of her SUV with their most recent sexual encounter allegedly taking place on December 16. Sharpsburg Mayor Richard Panza said Sundo's husband had complained to police about his wife's relationship with the teenage boy. The couple have three children, aged from six to 14. After her arrest, Sundo was removed from her position as director of the Sharpsburg Youth Recreation Center. Police are also investigating if she had any inappropriate contact with other young people at the center. Position of authority: Sundo has been removed from her job as director of the recreation center as police investigate whether she had other inappropriate relationships with young people . The affair was revealed after Sundo‘s husband went to police with allegations that his wife was seeing his son's teenage friend. He told police that the boy got a large number of text messages and phone calls from his wife that began last summer. In an interview with police, the 15-year-old said he received a large number of text messages from Sundo and while on sleepovers was encouraged to meet her for sex. The arrest report reveals that when Sundo‘s husband drove to the boy‘s home to confront him and his parents, the teenager told him that they had sex for several months in her home and her car. The boy later told police he had sex with the 45-year-old on at least a dozen occasions. 'She ran the recreation center and she no longer does,' said Michael Witherel, the Sharpsburg Borough solicitor. 'As soon a council was told about this in executive session by the chief of police – they were filled in on the details – and in an abundance of caution, recognizing that these are charges – nothing proven yet, but the borough council took immediate action at the public meeting then to remove her.' Her attorney claims Sundo’s reputation has been wrongly tarnished. 'She’s a very ordinary, everyday housewife,' said David Shrager said. 'These accusations are extremely upsetting to her as anyone could imagine. 'She’s very distraught with these circumstances. The families were all very close prior to this. Her children were very good friends. It’s upsetting.' Sundo has been ordered to have no contact with the alleged victim and has a court date in March. She has been charged with corruption of minors, statutory sexual assault, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and unlawful contact with a minor.","Susan Sundo, a married mother-of-three, arrested after police tipped off by her husband .

Scientists from the University of Manchester have discovered that omega-3 acids in the oil boost the immune system, affecting the body's ability to fight skin cancer and infection. It is the first time the protective effect of omega-3 - commonly found in fish and plant oils - has been demonstrated in humans. Omega-3 acid reduces the way sunlight suppresses the immune system, scientists believe . The research team, from the university's photobiology unit, claim the oils reduced the sun's impact on the immune system by half. Exposure to a lot of UV radiation from the sun can suppress the immune system, which affects the body’s . ability to fight skin cancer and infection. Team leader Professor Lesley Rhodes, who also works for Salford Royal Hospital, described the findings as 'very exciting'. He added: ‘It has taken a number of years to get to this stage. ‘This study adds to the evidence that omega-3 is a potential nutrient to protect against skin cancer.' He added that although the changes when someone took the oil were small, they suggest that omega-3 could reduce the risk of skin cancer over an individual's lifetime. ‘There has been research in this area carried out on mice in the past but this is the first time that there has been a clinical trial directly in people.’ Fish oil has also been shown to have other beneficial health effects, such as combating cardiovascular disease . The study was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The 79 patients who volunteered for the trial took a 4g dose of omega-3 - about one and a half portions of oily fish - daily, before being exposed to the equivalent of either eight, 15 or 30 minutes of summer midday sun in Manchester using a special light machine. Other patients took a placebo, before being exposed to the light machine. Suppression of the immune system was 50 per cent lower in people who took the supplement and were exposed to eight and 15 minutes of sun, compared with people who did not take the supplement. The study showed little influence on those in the 30-minute group. Fish oil has already been shown to have many beneficial health effects, such as helping with cardiovascular disease. Prof Rhodes' team are now continuing their research with further omega-3 studies being carried out on healthy volunteers at Salford Royal Hospital. Around 100,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer were diagnosed in the UK in 2010, according to the most recent figures available, making it an extremely common cancer.","Omega-3 fatty acids found to halve the negative effect sunlight can have on the immune system .

The customer is always right, or so the old adage goes, but a tradesman from Pennsylvania disagrees with it so much he has launched a website so angry businesses can warn each other off working for 'nasty clients'. Matt Stachel, of Feasterville, the head of a landscaping company, founded Nastyclient.com, a website he dubs the 'anti-Yelp' where angry contractors can vent against clients and alert each other to avoid being hired by them. Members can search clients by name but business owners can remain anonymous. Scroll down for video . Backlash: Matt Stachel, pictured, has set up nastyclient.com - he dubs 'anti-Yelp'. It enables contractors - as opposed to clients - to share their views and reveal cheap or annoying customers . Stachel, says he was inspired by the constant badmouthing of tradespeople by customers online and in the press. 'The straw that broke the camel's back wasn't one particular story of mine,' Stachel tells Metro Philadelphia 'It was more the frustration of always seeing the other side of the story being told in the media.' 'You always see on the news 'another deadbeat contractor takes a deposit from a homeowner and doesn't do any work' or see reviews on Angie's List or Yelp where the person is just ripping a business to shreds, but you never get the business's side of the story and you never get to hear, 'Hey, that customer that's ripping on the business, maybe the customer's really the jerk.'' The website provides a searchable database so companies can check out potential clients before agreeing to do work. Stachel says he vets all the posts to make sure they stick to the facts, rather than allowing users to fire unsubstantiated abuse at clients who aren't there to defend themselves. Outed: Matt Stachel hopes his website will attract aggrieved contractors who want to share bad experiences. It charges an annual subscription fee to those who want to use its database to search for bad customers . An annoying customer is easy to spot by just meeting them according to the site. It says they are the kind of people who 'insist on “your best price',' alert you that they’re getting at least 4 or 5 more estimates' and 'ask you to do additional work for free while you’re on the job'. They also 'constantly call with questions', 'take time off from their job to be home while you are working' and 'stand over your shoulder the entire time'. Money is by far the biggest cause of contention on the website. Complaints on the site lament and reveal customers they call 'cheap-skates' and 'cheap negotiators'. A landscaper, called Peter, says: 'I've been stiffed for 20 grand from this guy. I work hard for this money and I'm not happy'. A post written by Harleyrydr says: 'I did . an estimate for a guy that I knew I should not have done...I told him . that if the lowest price was the most important thing to him that I . would probably NOT be the cheapest bidder.  He said price was NOT the . most important thing to them.  I reluctantly did eight separate . estimates for only three jobs. When I called the guy to tell him my . estimate, I asked if he had gotten his two other estimates yet. At that . point he told me he was now getting 5 more estimates.  What a waste of . my time, because I am never the cheapest bidder.  I am soooo sick of . cheap skates!' Customer not always right: Nastyclient.com, left, outs clients that contractors think are rude or unfair so they can warn each other off accepting work from them. Complaints include dubbing customers 'cheap-skates' Another anonymous post states: 'At the meeting the husband told me he found another guy that would do more work for a cheaper price and if I wanted the job, I needed to include some free work...The extra work ended up taking two guys 8 hours, which equals a totally free day. We did the job and got paid, but I would just be aware that these people are the epitome of cheap negotiators. I don’t get it. Would these same people keep working at their job if one day their boss told them to work late every day for a week for no extra money?... These people drove me insane! I wouldn’t work for them again and you shouldn’t either!' Stachel says to promote fairness he encourages contractors to share their complaints with clients and if disputes are settled he'll reflect it in reports. But ultimately the site, which anyone can subscribe to for $15.99 a year, is intended to punish those deemed unfair by workers. 'The goal in my head for the website is, in same way a business owner now says to themselves, 'You know what? Maybe I shouldn't do shoddy work because I don't want to end up on Angie's List and I don't want a comment on the Better Business Bureau,'' he told Metro. 'I want the consumer to say, 'You know what? I better pay my plumber because I don't want to end up on Nasty Client. I don't want to be calling heating guys in January because my house has no heat, but everyone is saying they're don't want to work for me because I have three reports filed against me.'","Nastyclient.com set up by Matt Stachel, of Feasterville, Pennsylvania, in reaction to customer sites like Angie's List  and TripAdvisor .

Patricia Davies was sacked after pupils complained of inappropriate behaviour . A science teacher sacked for performing a lewd act in front of her class has failed in her bid to have her dismissal overturned. Patricia Davies, former assistant head of science at Willingsworth High School in Tipton, West Midlands, was accused by pupils of simulating male masturbation using a broomstick as a prop. The demonstration came as she taught them about the production of static electricity by friction. She has protested her innocence, insisting she had fallen victim to a conspiracy or whispering campaign. However, Appeal Court judges said her dismissal was not unfair, ruling in favour of Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council. Miss Davies was given a final warning over the incident in 2005 after 'a number of statements either in double figures or approaching double figures' were received by the school from pupils who said they had witnessed her demonstration. She was sacked in 2006 for alleged misconduct and the council accepted that the broomstick allegation had weighed the balance against her. Miss Davies campaigned to prove she was unfairly treated and that the final warning should have been treated as 'a nullity'. Her hearing before an employment hearing lasted 24 days, racking up huge legal costs. But today, Lords Justice Mummery, Lewison and Beatson ruled unanimously that, as the final warning was on her record when she was sacked and Miss Davies's appeal against it had been aborted, Sandwell was entitled to take it into account. Judges at the Court of Appeal found that her dismissal was not unfair . The court upheld an employment tribunal's decision that the warning had been issued in good faith and that her dismissal was 'within the range of reasonable responses' open to the local authority. Miss Davies had earlier argued that records showed she had in fact been teaching Hooke's Law of Elasticity on the day in questions. She also said that school registers indicated that two of the pupils who made statements condemning her were in fact absent from school at the time. The school had viewed the children's evidence as overwhelming but she argued the finding against her and the final warning were 'obviously wrong'.","Claims she was teaching children about Hooke's Law of Elasticity .

A man who lost his penis in a car accident at the age of six is looking forward to getting his sex life back by having a penis reconstruction surgery. Mohammed, 40, from Edinburgh, was pushed into the road as a child, falling under a moving car which dragged him for 600 yards, resulting in serious injuries to his genitals and thighs. His penis was completely destroyed, along with his left testicle. He thinks part of his right testicle was saved, but he can’t see or feel anything. Mohammed lost his penis after being hit by a car when he was just sixyears old . Speaking to Dr Pixie on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies, Mohammed explained how surgeons built him a new penis using skin from his leg, which he describes as just 'a tube to pee out of'. He can’t remember much from that period of this life, aside from spending a lot of it in hospital, and underwent over 100 operations to fix the problem. 'When . you're that age you just don't realise,' he said. 'I was treated by one . nurse when I was just seven, and she helped me throughout my younger . life. She was like a second mother to me and we are still in touch.' Mohammed, 40, from Edinburgh, was pushed into the road as a child, falling under a moving car which dragged him for 600 yards, resulting in serious injuries to his genitals and thighs . Mohammed’s penis, around 6-7cm in . length, is numb to the touch, though he can feel when he’s urinating. He . describes the whole area as very sensitive. And while he can orgasm, he is unable to achieve any kind of erection. After . recently getting married to a woman he met in Pakistan three years ago, . Mohammed wants to completely resolve the problem in order to consummate . their relationship. The Embarrassing Bodies team - Dr Dawn, Dr Christian and Dr Pixie - helped Mohammed rebuild his sex life . He said: 'I recently got married and I've not . just got myself to think about, I've got my wife to think about. I want to have sex and be normal. 'My wife isn't putting any pressure on me but I just want to lead a normal life.' 'I have always been interested in medical programmes, I could watch open heart surgery all day after all I have been through' 'I have always been interested in medical programmes, I could watch open heart surgery all day after all I have been through. 'I thought I would come on the show and give it a shot, why not?' he added. Dr Pixie referred Mohammed to a . specialist, to see whether an erection might be possible for him - and . whether he is producing any sperm. He explains to a shocked Dr Pixie how he has undergone nearly 100 operations but has a wife to think about now . Mohammed went to see leading penis surgeon Mr Nim Christopher, Consultant Uroandrologist at University College Hospital, London. Mr Christopher and his colleague Consultant Urologist Mr David Ralph specialise in functional and structural penile problems, working together on large cases like this. Mr Christopher recommended a completely new and larger penile reconstruction from a radial forearm flap, which would be fully sensate. This approach is a long term prospect and is completed over three separate operations. The show explains how penis reconstruction is used for genital abnormalities, gender reassignment or, as in Mohammed's case, penis loss . Mohammed has now had the first . of these three operations, in which skin and fat from his forearm was removed to create a . new penis, which was then attached during an 11-hour operation. Mr Christopher also discovered Mohammed’s missing testicle - which could mean a fertile future for the newlyweds. Two further operations will address both the appearance and functionality of Mohammed's new penis. Mohammed is thrilled with the progress. He said: 'It . is absolutely brilliant that somebody can say they can do something for . me, I just didn't think anyone could do anything about it. Six weeks later, and following a few infections, Mohammed is still recovering from this major procedure and waiting for three more operations, all of which will be covered in future episodes of Embarrassing Bodies.

Had Charli Evans not suffered a stroke, the two-inch tumour in her brain would have remained undetected and could have killed her . A schoolgirl's life was saved when she suffered a stroke - because doctors discovered she had a deadly brain tumour. Charli Evans, 15, had been in constant pain for two years and endured crippling headaches and completely lost her appetite. Playground bullies teased her about her shrinking size and a dietitian said she was suffering from an eating disorder. But despite repeated visits to her doctor and specialists, Charli's tumour was only detected after she suffered a stroke and collapsed at home. Doctors told her parents Carol and Andrew, 43, that if she hadn't suffered the attack, the two-inch tumour would have remained undetected and could have killed her. Charli had an eight-and-a-half hour emergency operation to remove the growth - with no guarantee of survival - but is now on the road to recovery. Charli's health problems started in October 2010 when she was just 13. She was taken to the family doctor near . her home in Bonnyrigg, Midlothian, complaining of a loss of appetite and . a lack of energy and was diagnosed with glandular fever. But her condition deteriorated and her weight dropped dramatically. She was so tired that she was forced to give up playing football as training sessions became too much. Before being diagnosed, Charli (with mother Carol) had been in constant pain for two years and endured crippling headaches and completely lost her appetite . It was only after a massive stroke that doctors found a rare brain tumour that had been growing for two years . Charli said: 'It was . gradual. It started off with me not wanting to eat breakfast, then I . wouldn't want to eat lunch and then I wouldn't want to eat anything on a . daily basis. 'I didn't want to do anything, I didn't . want to go anywhere and I didn't want to see anyone. I didn't feel well . enough to go out. It was horrible. 'I just got thinner and thinner. I used . to get teased every day and I didn't want to get changed for P.E. because people looked at me funny. 'I was sick of people telling me that I had an eating disorder and that I had an issue with food.' An MRI scan revealed a benign tumour two-inches . wide growing upwards towards her skull. Charli had to undergo a . gruelling eight-hour emergency operation to remove the tumour . The type of tumour Charli had - haemangioblastoma - usually forms on the kidneys or the liver, so doctors were baffled to find it on the brain . The real cause of Charli's condition . only emerged after her stroke last September when an MRI scan revealed a . benign two-inch tumour growing upwards towards her skull. She said: 'At the time, I just thought ""15-year-olds don't have strokes"". It was horrible, but it's the best thing that has ever happened to me. 'I can't really remember the stroke, but I remember being scared and shouting. I had pins and needles in my arm, then it spread to my leg, then my face, then I couldn't feel my tongue. 'When the doctor told me the worst possible scenario would be a brain tumour, I didn't take it in. I didn't think it was a possibility.' It's thought that Charli's stroke was triggered by pressure from the tumour building up in her brain. Around 4,300 benign tumours of the . central nervous system are diagnosed each year in the UK but of these . only two in 100 are haemangioblastomas. Her mother Carol, 47, said: 'The type of tumour that Charli had - haemangioblastoma - was uncommon and usually forms on the kidneys or the liver, so doctors were baffled to find it on the brain. They'd never seen it there before. Charli on the day of the brain tumour surgery (left); she is now on the road to recovery and said: 'Having a stroke was horrible, but it's the best thing that has ever happened to me' 'They told us that if it wasn't for the stroke then it wouldn't have been detected. 'It was a nightmare. You think that these things happen to somebody else, you never think that it could happen to you.' She has since gained over two stone in weight, rediscovered her appetite and is attending school a few days per week. Mrs Evans, a a security officer at Edinburgh University, said: 'People need to be aware that just because kids are young doesn't mean that they want to look like size-zero models. 'The stigma of kids not eating because they want to be thin and like models is not always the case. 'Looking back I feel relieved. As a mother I'm delighted that she is back with all her friends and doing what she has wanted to do for the past two years. 'Our life has changed as a family and we take every day as it comes. I know it can only get better now.' Martin Ledwick, head information nurse . at Cancer Research UK, said: 'It's important that any symptoms in . children are taken seriously and any unexplained symptoms should be . investigated if they persist. 'But the signs of brain tumours can be . quite vague and hard to identify and most GPs and A&E departments . will hardly ever see a case.'","Charli Evans, 15, had suffered pain and crippling headaches for two years .

While many moons show signs of their age, with pockmarked surface and craters, Titan manages to retain its youthful looks - are researcher have finally found out the secret behind its youthful appearance. The secret to eternal youth, they found is simple - sand. Dunes of exotic, hydrocarbon sand are . slowly but steadily filling in its craters, according to new research . using observations from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Images from the Cassini spacecraft show a 'fresh' crater called Sinlap (left) and an extremely degraded crater called Soi (right) that has been filled in by sand. These craters are both about 50 miles (80 kilometers) in diameter . Titan is the only moon in the solar . system with a thick atmosphere, and the only world besides Earth known . to have lakes and seas on its surface. However, Titan has a frigid . surface temperature of around minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (94 kelvins). The rain that falls from Titan's skies is not water, but contains . liquid methane and ethane, compounds that are gases at Earth's . temperatures. 'Most of the Saturnian satellites - Titan's siblings - have thousands and thousands of craters on their surface,'  said Catherine Neish, a Cassini radar team associate based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. 'So far on Titan, of the 50 percent of the surface that we've seen in high resolution, we've only found about 60 craters,' she said. 'It's possible that there are many more craters on Titan, but they are not visible from space because they are so eroded. 'We typically estimate the age of a planet's surface by counting the number of craters on it (more craters means an older surface). 'But if processes like stream erosion or drifting sand dunes are filling them in, it's possible that the surface is much older that it appears. 'This research is the first quantitative estimate of how much the weather on Titan has modified its surface,'adds Neish. Neish and her team compared craters on Titan to craters on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Ganymede is a giant moon with a water ice crust, similar to Titan, so craters on the two moons should have similar shapes. However, Ganymede has almost no atmosphere and thus no wind or rain to erode its surface. 'We found that craters on Titan were on average hundreds of yards shallower than similarly sized craters on Ganymede, suggesting that some process on Titan is filling its craters,' said Neish, who is lead author of a paper about this research published online in the journal Icarus. Titan captured in front of Saturn. Researchers say it may be older than they thought . Titan's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen with a trace of methane and other, more complex molecules made of hydrogen and carbon (hydrocarbons). The source of Titan's methane remains a mystery. 'Since the sand appears to be produced from the atmospheric methane, Titan must have had methane in its atmosphere for at least several hundred million years in order to fill craters to the levels we are seeing,"" says Neish. However, researchers estimate Titan's current supply of methane should be broken down by sunlight within tens of millions of years, so Titan either had a lot more methane in the past, or it is being replenished somehow. 'The presence of liquids on the surface and in the near subsurface can also cause extensive modification to crater shape, as is observed on Earth,' says Neish.","New images from the Cassini spacecraft reveal huge differences in the depth of craters on the Saturnian satellite .

A mother has told of her devastation after her baby died after being sent home by doctors several times. Axel Peanberg King died from pneumonia when he was just seven weeks old, having originally been diagnosed with a viral infection. Today at his inquest his mother Linda broke down in tears as she described the agonising wait in A&E while he went into cardiac arrest. Mrs Peanberg King, from Islington, north London, recalled how she and her husband Alistair had visited a a privately-run out-of-hours GP centre several times before their son's death. Axel Peanburg King died from pneumonia despite his mother calling and visiting a privately-run out of hours GP centre several times . She told St Pancras Coroner’s Court that they were first in contact with the Harmoni centre in the Whittington Hospital in north London on the night of October 30 last year. The next morning she took Axel to her own GP, who suspected he probably had a viral infection. But when his condition did not improve by the following evening, Mr and Mrs Peanberg King contacted Harmoni, and saw Dr Kuljeet Takhar. Mrs Peanberg King said Dr Takhar told them Axel’s vital signs were good and his lungs were clear. He said the infection was probably viral but he gave them a prescription for antibiotics, so they would not have to return if the baby’s condition changed. Mrs Peanberg King said: 'I had already presented him with symptoms of Axel refusing to feed, and not having a wet nappy, and having difficulty breathing. I wasn’t expecting him to diagnose my son. 'He didn’t give any instructions as to what change should mean, or any advice as to how to manage the symptoms.' On the next day, the Friday, the child continued to be unwell, but Mrs Peanberg King felt reassured because she had seen a doctor. On the Saturday, she decided he needed to be seen again. She said: 'On the Friday, I had allowed myself to be reassured, but my gut feeling was taking over.' She called Harmoni, and when Dr Muttu Shantikumar called them back at 12.45, she said he was 'very abrupt and very short' and made them an appointment for 4pm. 'I called a taxi for 3.30 and was very worried by this stage,' Mrs Peanberg King said. 'I arrived at the Harmoni unit at 3.50, but had to stand in a queue and was told they were busy. 'There were six people in front of Axel. I could not see his chest move, so I pinched his foot but did not get a reaction. 'I asked the receptionist when he would be seen, becoming tearful. Seven-week old Axel was treated at the Harmoni centre at the Whittington Hospital in north London (pictured) before he died . 'She explained there were still three people in front of me, so I sat down again. 'An off-duty paediatric nurse was looking at him, she said, ""you need to go through straight away"". 'She started running and shouting for a nurse called Linda.' Mrs Peanberg King said that soon after Axel was taken from her, she heard he was in cardiac arrest. She said: 'It was a tense situation, doctors were almost fighting among themselves to get everything done. 'But when a doctor came to see me in the relatives’ room, I knew the battle had been lost.' Pathologist Michael Ashworth, who carried out the post-mortem examination, said there was evidence of abnormality in the lungs. He said there was extensive pneumonia which had been present probably for more than a day.Cause of death was bronchopneumonia, he said. Dr Shantikumar said he set the appointment as 'routine' and the one he arranged was the earliest available. He did not regard the case as urgent from the information he had. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe suggested to him that the information he gathered in his one-minute telephone triage was not very detailed and he agreed. She told him: 'If you are going to take on a task as responsible as triaging a seven-week-old baby, you have to do it responsibly.' He said that if there had been such factors as wheeziness or chesty cough, or not eating or drinking at all, he would have marked it as urgent, in which case the appointment would have been within two hours. Dr Giles Armstrong, a consultant paediatrician who battled to save Axel at the Whittington Hospital, said that on two occasions his heart did start, but it could not be sustained. He said that, in general, babies this young with significant chest infections will deteriorate fairly rapidly once the infection takes hold - perhaps over 24 to 48 hours. 'It's almost certainly the same infection that the entire family had - his sibling and the parents had been ill,' he added. Some babies catch a bacterial infection on the back of a viral infection, he said. Sometimes small babies, even when they are diagnosed and treated, fail to survive, but thankfully these cases are in a minority. 'The sooner you detect it, the better your chances of survival.' The inquest was adjourned until Thursday morning.","Axel Peanberg King was originally diagnosed with a viral infection .

Emma, who was born with one kidney, was diagnosed with FA in November 2012 when her mother noticed she was bruising easily.

Radical preacher: Unlike Italy, Britain has dithered over deporting Abu Qatada (above) because of a judgement blocking the move by the European Court of Human Rights . For years, successive governments have insisted that extremist preacher Abu Qatada cannot be kicked out of Britain, claiming it would breach his human rights. Perhaps we should have looked to Italy as an example. Yesterday the European Court of Human Rights admitted it is effectively powerless to intervene in the case of a convicted terrorist deported from Italy. Although the Strasbourg court ordered that compensation be paid to Mohamed Mannai, who was sent home to Tunisia in 2010 in breach of a court order, officials said they are unable to force Italy to take him back. A spokesman said: ‘Once the applicant has been deported there is nothing much we can do because he is in Tunisia, a country that is not part of the European Court of Human Rights.’ Last night, the ruling prompted calls for ministers to follow Italy’s example and deport Qatada. The Government has argued the radical Islamist – described by a judge as Osama Bin Laden’s right hand man in Europe – cannot be removed to his home country of Jordan because of an ECHR  judgment. The court’s judges said Qatada could not hope to receive a fair trial there because it would  likely be based on evidence obtained by torture. But Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘The Italian and French governments have a track record of ignoring Strasbourg in deportation cases where there is a risk of torture with precious little consequence. Flawed ruling: Conservative MP Dominic Raab (above) says Britain should send Qatada back to Jordan immediately . ‘In the Qatada case, Strasbourg went well beyond existing human rights law. Having bent over backwards to accommodate this flawed ruling, we now need to put him on a flight to Jordan without delay.’ Mannai was jailed for five years and four months in October 2006 after he and two other men, thought to be linked to radical group Ansar al-Islam, were convicted of terror charges. In negotiations: But Home Secretary Theresa May has repeatedly refused to say if she will defy Strasbourg's judges . Police said the cell planned attacks in Italy and brainwashed recruits to act as suicide bombers. After Mannai’s conviction, the Milan court said he should be deported at the end of his sentence. However, the ECHR ordered Italy to block the deportation while it  considered if sending him home would breach his human rights. Despite this order, within months of finishing his sentence in February 2010, Mannai had been put on a plane back to Tunisia. Yesterday the ECHR criticised the Italian government for ignoring its earlier ruling and ordered it to pay Mannai 15,000 euros (£12,500) plus expenses. The Council of Europe has also written to the Italian government,  saying it is ‘deeply concerned’ by  its actions. Italy took similar steps in June 2008 when it ignored a court ruling and sent convicted terrorist Ben Khemais back to Tunisia. The Home Secretary is currently negotiating with the Jordanian government to get assurances that Qatada would be given a fair trial. Last week Theresa May refused five times in an interview to say whether she would defy Strasbourg judges and return the hate preacher. However, she insisted she wanted to find a way to deport Qatada so the Government was ‘not required by any court’ to take him back. A Whitehall official last night pointed out that while Mannai had been deported as his case was still pending, a final judgment had been made with regards to Qatada. Government lawyers fear that any attempt at removing him would therefore be in contempt of court.","We can't reverse Italy's deportation of terrorist to Tunisia, admits ECHR .

The glamorous wife of Gadget shop founder Chris Gorman has struck a deal with prosecutors in Florida to avoid a trial and possible prison sentence. But it means 43-year-old Mary Gorman will agree to take part in a community service programme that could see her carry out up to 100 hours of work. Typically, the work involves menial labour, such as picking up litter and cleaning at drug rehab facilities and will almost certainly have to be completed in Florida rather than her native Scotland. Strike a deal: Mary Gorman, 43, (left) will avoid a prison sentence if she completes more than 100 hours of community service. Her husband is Scottish millionaire Chris Gorman (right) Gorman, who is known for her love of parties, is also likely to have to undergo random drug tests. If she fails a single test, or does not complete her community service, she will have to stand trial on the original charges. Details of the deal came as the mother of four spoke for the first time following her arrest after allegedly being caught in a sex act with a unknown man in an Orlando nightclub toilet. Gorman was charged with battery of a police officer and possession of cocaine at an Orlando club in August . She told MailOnline: ‘Living under the shadow of this incident has placed our family under considerable strain and so I am very encouraged that a resolution has been agreed. ‘We fully agree with our lawyer and the State Prosecutor’s office that this is the most suitable way to deal with the matter and look forward to agreeing the details in the New Year.’ Gorman and her husband, who have a £45m fortune, had earlier denied all the charges following the sordid incident in the toilet of an Orlando nightclub. They had vowed to fight the charges. Their lawyer insisted they were innocent following the incident during a family holiday to the Disney theme parks last August. Gorman, of Bridge of Weir Renfrewshire, was arrested in August after being thrown out of the Roxy nightclub when an off duty police officer saw her engaged in a sex act with a black man she had met at the club. As she was being ejected, she assaulted officer Noah Pruitt and a search of her handbag revealed two wraps of cocaine. Gorman was charged with drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and battery on a police officer. The third degree felony charges carried a maximum of 11 years in jail. Her 44-year-old multi-millionaire husband learned earlier this month that he would not face charges of resisting arrest. Her trial in Orlando was due to start in February, but instead her lawyer Mark Horwitz has thrashed out a deal with prosecutors to avoid a humiliating court appearance. Nights out: Mrs Gorman, second from left, and adult star Rebecca Jessop, second from right . Incident: The couple were arrested at the Roxy . Club in Orlando, pictured, but the other man at the scene was released . without charge . Instead, Gorman will now take part in what is known as a pre-trial diversion programme. It is eligible to first time offenders run by the Orange County State's Attorney's office in Orlando and is aimed at cutting down court costs by reducing the need for a trial. 'The type of work is always very menial and usually very hard, ‘said a source with the Orlando State's Attorney's Office. ‘As Mrs Gorman was charged with a drugs offence she could be put to work in a drug rehab centre. It would involve manual labour, such a cleaning the floors and the toilets. ‘Alternatively many of those in the programme are put on litter duties along the highways and in state parks.’ Young love: The couple wed in the early 1980s after meeting at a training course and renewed their vows in a lavish ceremony years later . Another part of the pre-trial diversion programme will see Mrs Gorman attend anger management classes. She will also probably undergo counselling for drugs. A spokesman for the Orange County prosecutor said:’Pretrial Diversion is a diversionary program run by the State Attorney's Office and is usually reserved for first time, nonviolent offenders. ‘The diversion program is similar to probation, in that once you are accepted into the programme you must report once a month to a supervising officer, undergo random drug testing, complete community service hours, and refrain from being involved in any criminal activity,’ he said. Gorman's Orlando lawyer Mark Horwitz said in a statement that the completion of the pre-trial programme will result in all the charges being dropped and no criminal record for Mrs Gorman. The businesswoman, who runs a property development company and acts as a management consultant, is thought to have been desperate to avoid jail. Honoured: Mr and Mrs Gorman pictured when he received his OBE for services to business in 2005 . Horwitz said:’It is very positive that the State Prosecutor’s office is in agreement with this approach and the details of the programme will be agreed in the New Year.’ Gorman is now expected to attend a January hearing in Orlando where details of the programme will be decided. Her lawyer had previously obtained permission from the court to allow Mrs Gorman not to appear but to go on the programme she has to meet with Orange County officials. Millionaire: Chris Gorman, 44, was accused of 'interfering' with police when they arrested his wife in the toilet of a Florida nightclub, but the case was later closed . Orlando-based criminal defence lawyer Scott Richardson said Mrs Gorman was ‘very lucky’ to be offered the pre-trial programme as one of her charges involved assaulting a police officer. ‘Whatever attorney she has she should thank. He has done a fantastic job so far to get her into the programme when she was facing an assault charge on a police officer. ‘All of those accepted into the programme have to carry out the community service in Florida, but the judge can make exceptions.’","Mary Gorman, 43, could serve 100 or more hours of community service .

A four-year old boy is hoping a liver transplant will ease a rare condition which causes him to feel like he is being eaten alive by mosquitoes. Aarron Higgins suffers from a life-threatening genetic disease called Alagille Syndrome which affects his vital organs and makes his skin unbearably itchy. The condition, which affects just one in . 100,000 children, cannot be cured - but a liver transplant would . permanently ease the itching. Aarron suffers from unbearable itching due to his syndrome, which causes a build-up of bile in his liver . Soon after Aarron was born, he developed a rare form of jaundice, which kick-started his itchiness. After a year-long series of tests, . specialists finally managed to diagnose him with rare Alagille Syndrome, . which causes a build-up of bile in his liver, setting off the itching. It is believed only a liver transplant will be able to permanently cure his condition. The brave youngster has had 15 operations, including open heart surgery, but his immune system is so weak that he constantly picks up infections. Aarron, of Baillieston, Glasgow, will be assessed next month by liver specialists from King's College Hospital in London to see if he is suitable for a transplant. His mother Jacqueline, 40, said: 'The itching is horrendous. It just gets worse and worse. 'When he is itching he gets completely frustrated. No matter how much he scratches it never goes away. He throws things and lashes out. Aarron had to wear a special suit as a baby to help stop him itching: His mother hopes a liver transplant can ease his condition . Aarron Higgins, with his mother Jacqueline. Medications is used to improve bile flow . Jacqueline with her son Aarron. Half of cases of Alagille Syndrome are inherited but half occur spontaneously . 'It's heartbreaking. When it's really . bad he stands at the top of the stairs screaming ""mummy, help me"", with . blood pouring from his legs or ears or wherever. 'It's in his nose, his ears, places he can't even scratch. He can't sleep and he can't stand the heat. Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously. Source: America Liver Foundation . 'He has got a vest, leggings, socks, mitts and a wee balaclava but he is still itching. 'It . comes in waves. He can have a few weeks without it, as it depends on . the amount of bile, and when he is not itching he is fine. He is . swinging from the lampshades. 'He has got a great spirit. He is a right wee mischief. When I look at him it makes it all worthwhile. 'I think they are going to have to transplant him. It won't cure the condition but it would stop the itching for good. 'It is a hard decision but I think in the long run it will be better for him. The itching is the main problem he has with quality of life.' Young Aarron prefers the cooler weather of winter as it soothes his itching. Just before Christmas he was treated to a trip to Disneyland, Paris, after a friend contacted the Starlight Children's Foundation on his behalf. The four-year-old loves Disney and said his dearest wish was to visit 'Donald Duck land'. The family were put up in a luxury Sequoia Lodge hotel, went on lots of rides and met some of Aarron's favourite characters. The youngster was also able to go swimming for the first time in three years. 'Aarron had a really magical time and he thinks Mickey Mouse is his best friend now,' Ms Higgins said. 'It made him so much more cheery in the run-up to Christmas and made it a really exciting and special time for us.' She added: 'Aarron's body fights hard every day to keep going and we fight along with him. He is such an inspiration.'","Aarron Higgins suffers from a syndrome that affects one in 100,000 children .

A healthcare assistant at the disgraced Stafford Hospital pulled a dementia patient around by his pyjamas with his genitals exposed and then called him an 'animal', a nursing tribunal heard today. Bonka Kostova first pushed the 73-year-old man into the bathroom and on to the toilet before pulling him out by his pyjama collar and shouting at him, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. Bulgarian-born Ms Kostova, a trained midwife covering as a healthcare assistant, was caring for the pensioner, referred to as patient A, in July 2010. Her colleague, staff nurse Jane Wilkinson, broke down in tears today as she described Ms Kostova shouting: 'I hate him, I really hate him. He is like an animal. I can’t bear working with him.' A healthcare assistant at the disgraced Stafford Hospital pulled a dementia patient around by his pyjamas and then called him an 'animal', a nursing tribunal heard today . Mrs Wilkinson, who has been a nurse at the hospital since 1985, said Ms Kostova was hard-working but could sometimes be abrupt with other members of staff, but that it was to do with her Bulgarian accent and demeanour. However, on this occasion Ms Kostova, who had qualified as a midwife in her home country, was 'losing it', Mrs Wilkinson said. 'She just seemed to be out of control with what she was saying. 'I have been a nurse for a long time and I have never witnessed anybody saying anything like that at all and she did appear to be almost losing it, really.' Ms Kostova, who was employed by the hospital between April 2009 and . September 2010, was not present at the hearing in . central London. It is understood she has not formally admitted or denied any of the charges she faces. The NMC says 41 current or previous nurses and midwives at the . hospital are were  reported, but 31 of these cases have now been closed. Ms Kostova's former colleague Jane Wilkinson told the hearing that the Bulgarian healthcare assistant appeared to be 'losing it' that day on the ward . The tribunal heard that the patient had been in the hospital just over a month receiving treatment for kidney stones when the incident took place just after 3am on July 22, 2010. He was said to be aggressive in his speech or manner around 80 per cent of the time and usually had a one-to-one carer looking after him who would sometimes need the assistance of another if the patient became particularly difficult. On this occasion, that carer went for a break, leaving Ms Kostova in charge. The hearing comes after a damning report into failings at the hospital, which found 'appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of patients'. The report into Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust highlighted the neglect of patients between 2005 and 2009. Some . were left for hours sitting in their own faeces, food and drink was . left out of reach and hygiene was so poor that relatives had to clean . toilets themselves. At today’s tribunal, Mrs Wilkinson said Ms Kostova, known by colleagues as 'Bonnie', would often 'huff and puff when talking with patients with dementia'. 'I believe this was due to her nationality,' she said. But Mrs Wilkinson added that she never saw her being rude to patients, and would only be 'abrupt' with other members of staff, and would always carry out her duties. While Ms Kostova had received general training in looking after vulnerable adults, she had not received specific training for dementia patients, ward manager Sharon Matthews told the tribunal. It was also possible that Ms Kostova, who would often work extra shifts, had worked more than 40 hours in the week leading up to the incident, which happened in the early hours of a Thursday morning. But Mrs Matthews would have been unaware of how many extra hours she had done if they had not been on her ward, where the incident happened. Alison Jepson, the hospital's matron of medicine, told the tribunal she thought Kostova did not treat dementia sufferers as human . The tribunal heard that after taking over care of the Alzheimer’s sufferer, Ms Kostova would have then been responsible for her regular 15 patients as well as the one-to-one care of the 73-year-old man. But she would not have to look after him for more than an hour, the tribunal heard. Alison Jepson, the hospital’s matron of medicine, interviewed Ms Kostova after the incident and said the carer denied pushing and dragging the patient around, saying she was guiding him. Ms Kostova said she noticed the patient was straining for the loo as he was walking around the ward and so guided him into the toilet. 'He walked outside (the toilet) without any pants or trousers at all so I needed to sort him out to protect his dignity', Ms Kostova said to Ms Jepson. 'I didn’t pull him.' Ms Kostova also said it would have been difficult for her to manhandle him because he was much taller and bigger than her, but she did admit shouting at him. Ms Jepson told the tribunal she thought Ms Kostova did not treat dementia sufferers as human. 'It came across that Bonnie felt the patient was not human because he had Alzheimer’s disease,' she told the tribunal. 'I’m unsure whether she understood the extent of her actions and the severity of the consequences.' When questioned about this description by the panel, Ms Jepson said Ms Kostova would acknowledge the feelings of the patient’s wife and family but not him. 'She wasn’t acknowledging that he would have feelings. She didn’t understand that by raising her voice and shouting - she didn’t acknowledge that he could be upset as a result of her actions,' Ms Jepson said. Ms Kostova was suspended after the incident and has not worked at the hospital since. Robert . Courteney-Harris, medical director at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust said: 'This incident was dealt with very swiftly when . it happened in 2010. The member of staff was suspended pending our . investigation and never returned to work at our Trust.' An overall verdict is expected tomorrow or Thursday, an NMC spokeswoman said.

Fatal accident: Dr Darryl Peel died three weeks after the accident which left him with severe burns . A man has died after suffering horrific burns as he was caught in a fireball lighting a bonfire in his garden. Dr Darryl Peel, 51, was preparing the pile of wood in his Suffolk home when a spark is believed to have set the petrol can ablaze. The father-of-three suffered around 80 per cent burns in the accident at his five bedroom home in Huntingfield near Halesworth, on February 6. Dr Peel, a GP for the medical practice in nearby Framlingham, managed to put out the flames and stumbled into his house to treat his burns. He was flown by air ambulance to the specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, Essex, where he was put in an induced coma after surgery. His wife Susie and teenage children were warned that it was 'touch and go' whether he would survive. He died on Tuesday nearly three weeks after the accident. An East of England Ambulance Service spokeswoman said he had suffered 'extensive burns' to his legs, hands and face. Dr Peel's wife Susie, 47, said she believed her husband had primed the bonfire before setting it alight, but a spark had then set the nearby petrol can ablaze. Mrs Peel added: ‘He managed to get back to the house, take his clothes off and douse himself with cold water. ‘The ambulance and the air ambulance arrived very quickly. They did a tremendous job.’ Mrs Peel said she hoped the accident would serve as a warning to others, not to use accelerants like petrol when starting fires. She said: ‘We now know this accident happened when he primed a bonfire, thought he had put the can in safety, but did not realise he was standing in a cloud of petrol vapour. ‘If it's possible for this appalling accident to serve any purpose it would be that nobody who reads this ever risks using any form of accelerant in connection with a fire under any circumstances and no matter how careful they think they have been.’ Dr Peel worked as a GP in Halesworth for ten years until 2003 when he emigrated to Australia with his family. Tragedy: Dr Peel was put in a coma at Broomfield Hospital after the February 6 accident and died earlier today, nearly three weeks later, from the injuries he suffered . But he returned to Suffolk a year later and joined the Framlingham Surgery. Mrs Peel described him as a 'very much loved GP' who would be stopped by six or seven people wanting a chat with him every time he went out in Halesworth. Dr Peel returned to work at the Framlingham surgery last November after a year's illness. His wife added: ‘It is just so sad that this awful accident happened after he fought very hard to get back to fitness and work at the job he loves.’ She also thanked Dr Peel's friends, patients and colleagues for their messages of support. Dr Charles Wright, the senior partner at the practice, said in a message on the surgery website: ‘It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of Dr Darryl Peel. ‘Dr Peel was badly injured in a bonfire accident at his home on Wednesday 6 February. He was taken by Air Ambulance to the specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. ‘Despite the excellent care that he received, unfortunately Dr Peel was not able to recover from his extensive injuries and died on Tuesday 26th February. ‘Our thoughts are with his wife Susie, and their three teenage children at this very sad time. ‘Dr Peel will be missed greatly by both staff and patients at the surgery. Patients of Dr Peel will continue to be looked after by the other doctors at the practice.’","Dr Darryl Peel, 51, died after accident which left him with 80 per cent burns .

Nintendo is set to release a new miniaturised version of its ground-breaking Wii console in the UK in just a month's time. The Japanese video game maker, which has sold nearly 100 million Wii consoles worldwide, today announced the scaled-down version of the machine will hit the British high street on March 24. Smaller than the original Wii - which has since been superseded by the Wii U - the Mini will come in matte black with a red border. 'Savagely compromised version of the original hardware': Nintendo is set to launch its Wii Mini in the UK next month, but the slimmed down version of their last-generation console has already been savaged by video gamers . No price has yet been announced, but it is currently on the market in Canada for the budget price of $99 CAD (around £63). Nintendo also announced that it would be expanding its discounted range of Nintendo Selects games with Mario Party 8, Mario Power Tennis, Wii Sports Resort and Super Paper Mario. However, video games websites have already laid in to the slimmed down machine, with one describing it as a 'savagely compromised version of the original hardware'. The original Wii: Launched in 2007, nearly 100million of the consoles have since been sold worldwide . Nintendo became a household name in the Eighties with its first console, the Nintendo Entertainment System, popularly known as the NES. Its star shone brighter with the subsequent Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES, but the subsequent entry of big hitters like Sony and Microsoft into the video games market proved a challenge for the company. Nineties arch-rival Sega was beaten out of the console market altogether and Nintendo found itself occupying a younger niche as adult gamers turned to the more sophisticated PlayStation and Xbox. The Wii, released in 2007, broke new ground with its motion-sensitive controllers, however, allowing Nintendo to market the first video games which could be controlled by the movement of players' bodies. In a statement today, Nintendo said: 'With a family-friendly design offering no internet capabilities, Wii Mini allows you to jump straight in and experience all the great Wii games from the last six years since the Wii console first launched. 'To coincide with the launch of Wii Mini, Nintendo is also adding to the existing range of Nintendo Selects titles, offering great value for everyone to enjoy classic Wii games.' Since 1983, when it launched the NES, Nintendo has sold more than 4billion video games and more than 651 million hardware units globally. It has also created industry icons that have become well-known, household names such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Zelda and Pokémon. However,  video games industry observers have criticised the release of the Wii Mini as something of a misstep by Nintendo. Nintendo's Wii U console: Nintendo has returned to the black for the first nine months of its business year and more than doubled its profit forecast for the full year, despite pessimism about sales prospects . In a product review of the console, Richard Leadbetter, writing for Eurogamer.net, said: 'What we have here is a crippled version of a six-year-old console that offers the absolute base level of functionality - and nothing more.' He added: 'Unfortunately, the sad reality is that the Wii Mini disappoints on almost every level. 'It's not a good-looking piece of kit at all, functionality has been stripped down to the absolute bare-bones, and perhaps worst of all for a product actively being marketed on its dinky form-factor is the fact that it's not actually that much smaller than the original model.' It emerged today that Nintendo had returned to the black for the first nine months of its business year and more than doubled its profit forecast for the full year, despite pessimism about sales prospects.","New release is scaled-down version of the 100million-selling Wii console .

It remains the worst maritime tragedy in US history, and cost more lives than the sinking of the Titanic, but the Sultana disaster is a story history has largely forgotten. In April 1865, at least 1,700 people, mostly Union soldiers returning home after the end of the Civil War, lost their lives when the riverboat exploded on the Mississippi. Captain J.C.Mason had allowed the Sultana to become dangerously overloaded with passengers - it was carrying six times its capacity of 376 - and the vast majority of helpless victims either suffocated, burned or drowned. One of the Sultana's steam boilers exploded, tearing the vessel in two and sending victims plunging into the icy water . The side-wheeler boat had been built for transporting cotton - but had been adapted to carry people and Captain Mason was encouraged to pick up Union soldiers trying to get home by the offer of $5 for each enlisted man and $10 for each officer. Captain J.C. Mason was encouraged to take on more passengers because the U.S government was paying him for each soldier and officer he brought home . He left New Orleans with around 100 passengers and headed north but each time he stopped more and more soldiers would get on. Many had spent months or years in prisoner camps and were desperate to get home. At one point the ship had to stay docked for several days while one of steam boilers was repaired which allowed even more passengers to get on. When an Army officer raised his concerns, Captain Mason assured him that the Sultana was more than capable of carrying the load. 'Take good care of those men,' the officer told him. 'They are deserving of it.' Despite being packed in like sardines, the soldiers spirits were high and they were singing songs and telling war stories. But after leaving Memphis, the extra load finally took its toll. At around 2am on April 26, one of the steam boilers exploded quickly followed by the other two. The enormous blast split the ship in two firing burning hot coals out like bullets. Victims were pitched out into the icy water while others suffocated or burned. The Sultana was carrying six times as many passengers than its maximum capacity when it sank in 1865 . Newspaper reports of the tragedy were relegated to the back pages because of the end of the Civil War . One survivor described it like this: 'The whole heavens seemed to be lighted up by the conflagration. Hundreds of my comrades were fastened down by the timbers of the decks and had to burn while the water seemed to be one solid mass of human beings struggling with the waves.' Of an estimated 2,300 people - at least 1,700 lost their lives that night, including Captain Mason. But the Sultana disaster remains a largely unknown part of U.S. history. In the aftermath of such a bloody war, the nation was largely densensitised to death and newspapers were instead full of reports about the end of the war, the new presidency and rebuilding. There was also a degree of embarrassment on the part the Army in light of the poor decisions made by officers and the ship's captain. But the bow of the Sultana remains at the muddy bottom of the Mississippi River as a sad memorial to the men who never made it home. The story of the Sultana has been retold in Uncle John's Unstoppable Bathroom Reader.

A hairstylist in Indiana who bought a winning lottery ticket good for $9.5 million has claimed that she bought that particular ticket for herself and not in an office pool and is fighting to keep the entire sum. Hairstylist Christina Shaw has maintained her winning February 16 Hoosier Lotto drawings was one she bought herself, but the seven hairstylists who went in on the office pool are demanding their shares of the prize money. The women - save Shaw - appeared in court Wednesday, testifying that .

Up in arms: Hair stylists from an Eastside Indianapolis salon leave Marion County Supreme Court 12, today; an Indiana judge said she will decide by Friday whether to freeze a $9.5m jackpot until a dispute over the ownership of the winning ticket is settled . Seven hairstylists who participated in a lottery pool at the salon where they all worked testified at a court hearing Wednesday that a co-worker claimed the winning ticket despite their agreement to equally share any prizes they won . Marion County Judge Heather Welch said . she will decide by Friday whether to freeze the jackpot until the . dispute over the ticket is settled. Lucy Lewis Johnston, who owns Lou's Creative Styles, said buying a personal ticket with pool tickets would make it impossible 'to determine which was whose ticket.' Hairstylist Linda Sue Stewart said that's why they had all agreed that any such tickets 'were all considered part of the pool.' A parade of current and former salon employees all testified to the agreement and said all of the women who played the lottery - including Shaw - knew the rules. Shaw did not attend the hearing, and her attorney didn't take part. Wednesday's hearing dealt solely with whether the $9.5 million payout should be frozen until the court can determine to whom the winning ticket actually belongs. Welch issued a temporary restraining order last week barring the Hoosier Lottery Commission from awarding the prize money to Shaw for 10 days. The lottery commission isn't opposing the proposed injunction. Kent Smith, attorney for Christina Shaw, talks to the media outside Marion County Supreme Court today . Christina Shaw, pictured, claims that she bought the winning ticket for herself and was separate from the pool tickets she purchased . Bryan Corbin, a spokesman for the Indiana Attorney General's Office, which represents the commission, said the agency 'takes no position on the preliminary injunction or on the merits of the dispute between the stylists. The commission's only interest is in paying the proper claimant. The ticket-ownership decision is solely up to the court to determine, not the commission, which does not have the authority to decide ownership.' A lottery spokesman didn't immediately return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment. The women filed into the elevator outside the courtroom without talking to reporters. Attorney Scott Montross, who represents the hairstylists fighting for a share of the prize, told reporters after the hourlong hearing that his clients were more hurt than angry. 'They're disappointed that it came to this,' Montross said. 'They're much more disappointed than they are angry.'","Hairstylist Christina Shaw claims she bought winning $9.5M lotto ticket on her own and not for office pool .

For millions of workers, lunchtime is the highlight of their day, which is otherwise marred by monotony, irritation or stress. But a study, published yesterday, reveals the crippling cost of buying lunch every day, rather than making your own packed lunch. It warns many workers are spending ‘more cash than they realise on items such as takeaway coffees and gourmet sandwiches.’ Bringing in your own packed lunch could save you thousands, as research shows people spend around £90,000 in a lifetime . On average, it estimates the average worker spends nearly £90,000 during their working life buying lunch, as well as cups of tea or coffee and occasional afternoon snacks. For those workers with an expensive coffee habit, the cost can be huge. At Costa, a medium-sized cappuccino costs £2.45. This is the equivalent of a worker, who earns the average full-time salary of £26,000, spending more than three years’ of their earnings on their lunch. Workers could pay off a £100,000 mortgage about six years early if they put the money towards making over-payments on their loan, rather than buying lunch and other snacks. On average, the poll, from the office search firm, Officebroker.com, found the typical worker spends £7.81 a day on their lunch, drinks and other work-time snacks. But those who bring in their own packed lunch and snacks as well as making their own tea and coffee spend an average of just £1.50 a day. One London-based worker told researchers: ‘I usually get through about a tenner a day on things like coffees and sandwiches from Pret a Manger. Eating out at lunchtime might be a treat, but it can rack up bills pretty quickly for those who like to splash their cash . ‘I’m also fond of fresh fruit and bottles of sparkling water. I might also pick up a biscuit a couple of times each week. ‘It does all add up but I’m happy to pay for the convenience. I’m just not the sort of person who would be making my own lunch the night before at home.’ The impact over a working life lasting 47 years is eye-watering, particularly when some workers said they spend as much as £30 a day. The lowest daily spend was £3. It estimates the total bill will reach £88,971 - and will be even higher for those who buy drinks not just for themselves, but their colleagues, during the working day. To make matters worse, researchers did not adjust the figure for the rising cost of living, which will inevitably make a worker’s favourite sandwich, pasty or soup even more expensive. Marks & Spencer said its best-selling sandwich is the prawn mayonnaise on oatmeal bread which costs £1.90. It has been its most popular sandwich since the sandwich was launched in 1982, although it is occasionally beaten by the £2.75 BLT sandwich. At Pret a Manger, which has opened 254 branches since its launch in 1986, the most popular option is the tuna baguette which costs £2.99. The other two in the top three are the £3.65 chicken Caesar and bacon on artisan bread and the £3.25 ‘posh’ cheddar and pickle on artisan bread. Pret said the average customer spends £4.55 on their lunch in one of its branches, which comprises of two different items, such as a sandwich and a bag of crisps. The study comes at a time when workers are suffering an unprecedented squeeze on their finances, according to the Office for National Statistics. Millions of workers are paid less than they were a decade ago, if their pay is adjusted for the impact of inflation. Since 2009, the ONS’s analysis shows the pay rise given to the average worker has been consistently below the rate of inflation. For example, the average pay rise given to both public and private sector workers is currently a paltry 1.3 per cent, but the cost of living is rising at 2.7 per cent.","Workers could pay off a £100,000 mortgage about six years early if they spent lunch money on their loan .

A sham marriage scam was rumbled after a fake bride went on holiday with another man only six days after her wedding to a Vietnamese groom. Amanda Nolan, 28, was handed £5,000 to enter into a ‘marriage of convenience’ arranged in her local nail salon. She used the cash to pay for a two-week holiday in Mexico with John Doyle. But after they fell out while away, he told the police the trip had been paid for by the wedding scam. Amanda Nolan (left) and Gemma Nelson (right) took part in sham weddings organised by Trang Thi Thuy Luu . It led to Nolan, Kevin Donnelly, Jason . Proctor, Denny Wallace and Gemma Nelson appearing at Preston Crown . Court accused of entering into, or witnessing, sham weddings to keep . Vietnamese immigrants in the UK on marriage visas. The court heard that Britons were . offered up to £10,000 to enter into the ‘marriages of convenience’ with . the Vietnamese, who were on temporary visas. Trang Thi Thuy Luu, known as Louise, . was the ‘spider at the centre of a web’. The Vietnamese nail bar owner . was the chief organiser of a ‘carefully orchestrated operation’ to match . Britons to her friends and family in bogus ceremonies. Luu, 24, who is . now on the run, used her connections as the manager of three Miss Nails . nail bars in Preston, Chorley and Blackburn to entice three Britons into . sham weddings between 2008 and 2010. It enabled her friends and family to successfully apply to the Home Office for visas to remain in Britain. Elizabeth Nicholls, prosecuting, said: . ‘She arranged her own sham marriage and then went on to make . arrangements to facilitate the marriages of friends and relatives.’ Scam: Trang Thi Thuy Luu ran three nail salons based in Preston, Chorley (pictured) and Blackburn, where she enticed Britons into sham weddings between 2008 and 2010 . Trang Thi Thuy Luu (left) is wanted for organising sham weddings with participants like Jason Proctor (right) But Miss Nicholls said ‘the edifice of . these marriages came tumbling down’ following the sham wedding of Nolan . to Tuan Hoang Lu in October 2010. Mother-of-one Nolan, a regular at one . of the nail bars, had confided in Luu about her financial problems. She . was paid £5,000 to marry the Miss Nails employee at Blackburn Register . Office. Wallace was a witness. CCTV footage obtained by police showed several Chinese guests behaving ‘appropriately’ at the reception at a country club. But Nolan and her co-defendants were . heavily under the influence of alcohol and treated the occasion as ‘a . joke and a farce’. And later Mr Doyle told police that the scam had paid . for the holiday in Mexico. Sham: Denny Wallace (left) had been a witness at a sham marriage and Kevin Donnelly also took part in a wedding, and got around £1,500 for it . Nolan was arrested in February 2011 . and later that month police raided Luu’s home in Preston and found . documents that were ‘stock in trade’ for bogus weddings including . passports, birth certificates and wedding photographs. Donnelly, 34, entered a sham marriage . with Luu in October 2008 at Blackburn Register Office, which was . witnessed by Nelson. He was said to have received £1,500.

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 04:34 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:39 EST, 28 February 2013 . A four-year-old girl smothered to death by her paranoid schizophrenic mother was repeatedly failed by seven state agencies charged with her care in the years leading up to her death, a damning report said today. Chantelle Blake, 33, suffocated her daughter Kaiya with a pillow after suffering from 'delusions and hallucinations' - despite the mother and child being seen by authorities at least 55 times in the space of three years. A Serious Case Review published today revealed that just two months before Kaiya was killed her mother was assessed by an experienced psychiatrist as having no symptoms indicative of a serious mental illness. Tragedy: A Serious Case Review has cited a catalogue of failings by authorities after paranoid schizophrenic Chantelle Blake suffocated her four-year-old daughter Kaiya with a pillow after suffering from 'delusions and hallucinations' Each time medical opinion was sought Blake was considered not to have any enduring mental health problems, the report said. But her own family said Blake had been mentally unwell for more than a decade . Blake, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2005, had been smoking cannabis since the age of 12. The report said the use of the drug often coincides with an exacerbation of psychosis. She was made the subject of a hospital order after pleading guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Manchester Crown Court last November. During the hearing, the court heard the woman feared she was being persecuted by her neighbours, and she suffocated her four-year-old daughter 'out of love' to protect her. There is no evidence to suggest the neighbour did anything wrong. When sentencing her, Mr Justice MacKay said: ‘The day you ended your daughter's life will, I am sure, be with you forever.’ Criticisms: A 65-page Serious Case Review report on behalf of Manchester Safeguarding Children Board criticised 'poor judgment and a lack of robustness in managerial oversight' among some of the seven state agencies who had contact with the family . The judge said it was not the purpose . of the court to punish Blake, as doctors on both sides agreed she was . and is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He said: ‘I fully accept that you did what you did out of your love for and concern for Kaiya.’ He added: ‘You were thinking in a distorted and . deluded way, but you genuinely believed that you were acting to protect . your daughter from harm by persons who wished her ill. You thought that . because you were mentally ill at the time.’ Social services were first made aware . of concerns for the child in July 2008 more than three years before her . death when Blake said her daughter, then 18 months old, wanted to have a . sexual relationship with her and that she was hearing voices. Scene: The police investigation is underway as flowers are left outside the house of Chantelle Blake after she killed her young daughter Kaiya . Twice . police used emergency powers, in July 2009 and October 2010, taking the . child from her mother, but Kaiya was returned with 'undue haste', the . report said. On both occasions Blake stripped her daughter naked because she said she wanted to check for signs of sexual abuse. Parents, nursery staff and even housing . association workmen at her flat repeatedly reported concerns but despite . a 'Child Protection Plan', conferences and strategy meetings there was a . 'fairly chaotic' approach to case planning, the report said. Damning: The report states parents, nursery staff and even housing association workmen at her flat repeatedly reported concerns . Just two months before Kaiya was killed her mother was assessed by an experienced psychiatrist as having no symptoms indicative of a serious mental illness. On one occasion she hit Kaiya so hard at local shops, three members of the public called police. And she told the child on another occasion at a police station: 'It's just me and you now; we will have to take each day as it comes and see how long we last. At least we know there is a place for us up there.' The report says Manchester Children’s Social Care received a total of 10 referrals, the first being made in July 2008. The common thread in the referrals related to concerns about Blake's mental health and her management of her daughter. But on one occasion, after Kaiya was placed in emergency foster care in July 2009, police and a social worker visited her home, where they concluded there was no immediate concerns for the four-year-old's safety and that she should return home. The report concluded Kaiya's death 'could not have been predicted'. Ian Rush, chairman of Manchester Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'Whilst the report finds that the tragic death of this little girl could not have been predicted by any of the agencies working with the family, the recommendations make it clear that agencies could and should have done some things differently. 'This was a complex case, made all the more so by the mother's mental health needs, and presenting behaviour. 'This led to an over-emphasis by agencies on dealing with the mother and her needs, rather than focusing on the child and ensuring her needs were met.' Kaiya's father, Alexander Glenford, was living mostly in Jamaica before his daughter's death.Blake believed she was being persecuted and killed Kaiya 'out of love' so no one could harm her daughter. Kaiya . was found by police at their home in Garthorne Close, Moss Side, . Manchester, on September 22, 2011 after the defendant turned up at . A&E with a child's suitcase. She had slashed her arms with a knife and told a nurse she had suffocated her daughter.Blake will only be released from hospital when cleared by doctors and by a Ministry of Justice independent review panel. In the three years leading up to Kaiya's death, the seven agencies had numerous meetings with the mother, often with the daughter present, the report states. The agencies saw the mother, either through home visits or through her attending services, at least 55 times. This figure includes face-to-face interactions only. There was further contact between Blake and the services through phone calls and letters. Manchester Children's Social Care: Blake . had at least 17 face-to-face interactions with social workers between 2008 . and 2011. Greater Manchester Police: Officers met with Blake at least five times, initially in July 2008 when a visit was made to her home with social workers. The report says home conditions were seen to be of a 'high standard' and there was nothing to indicate Blake suffered from a mental health condition. Manchester Early Years and Sure Start (Children's centre): The report cites several occasions when concerns were raised at the centre where Blake attended with her daughter from February 2009. Adactus Housing: Housing officers spoke to Blake and workers raised concerns after attending her home on seven occasions. NHS Manchester: There were 19 occasions when Blake either visited health services, or health workers visited her home or met with her, from July 2008. Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust: The trust had at least four face-to-face interactions with Blake from July 2009. Central Manchester Foundation Trust: On July 5, 2009, police took Blake to the hospital emergency department where she was assessed by a mental health liaison nurse. It was concluded that there were no signs of mental illness, denial of auditory hallucinations or thoughts of suicide or self harm.

Georgina Beevers was found dead at her home more than 13 hours after her mother warned police she was a suicide risk . A boy of four was left alone with a woman’s body for 13 hours – despite a 999 call to police. Officers were told the woman, Georgina Beevers, 37, was a suicide risk and had been threatening to take an overdose. But Greater Manchester Police downgraded the call to a lower priority and an officer who called at the house left when no-one answered the door. The Independent Police Complaints Commission accused the force of a ‘lack of diligence’  in handling the case. One member of staff has been disciplined. On January 29 last year, the woman’s mother, Sheila Beevers, 65, made a series of calls to  police and social services warning that Miss Beevers was preparing to overdose on prescription anti-depressants. Mrs Beevers, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, called police at 6.44pm because she was unable to drive to her daughter’s home herself but no-one was sent round until about 10.25pm. Miss Beevers’ body was discovered the next morning when officers called again. The boy then answered the door and they found her body on the sofa. Naseem Malik, of the IPCC, said the case needed a priority response but ‘didn’t get one due to flawed decision making and a lack of diligence’. She added: ‘All I can hope is that those involved will learn lessons from this tragedy.’ An inquest gave a verdict of death by misadventure. Ms Beevers' mother told a police call handler that her daughter was at the 'end of her tether' and her partner had been 'battling with her to stop her taking an overdose'. Although the 999 was initially treated as urgent and requiring an immediate response, it was later downgraded from Grade 1 to Grade 2. An officer should still have attended within an hour but due to an ongoing armed robbery and a missing person incident there was no-one available. The former home (centre) of Ms Beevers, where an officer visited on the night her mother contacted police, but left after there was no answer . The call was assigned to an officer . at 9.25pm and he visited the house an hour later. But he left after . getting no response and failed to realise Ms Beevers was a suicide risk . because he hadn't read the log about the incident properly. Another officer visited the house at 8.17am the next day and found Ms Beevers' body. The . Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation concluded . the call should not have been downgraded and the officer who initially . went to the house had failed to read the log properly, failed to . understand the nature of the incident and failed to act diligently. A . radio operator who requested the call be downgraded has received . 'management action' while the police officer had a case to answer for . misconduct. The call was downgraded by a supervisor in the control room but neither supervisor accepted responsibility and police systems could not prove which one had taken the decision. Therefore, no action was taken against either supervisor. IPCC Commissioner Ms Naseem Malik said: 'This was a terribly tragic incident and my deepest condolences go out to Ms Beevers' family. Ms Beevers was vulnerable and in a distressed state. 'Her mother attempted to contact social services and then turned to Greater Manchester Police for help. Despite an excellent, caring response from the initial call handler, the response that followed was inadequate. 'Following Georgina's death we referred this case to the IPCC, who managed an investigation into our handling of this incident. As a result of their findings one officer received management action for breaching the standards of professional behaviour' - Assistant Chief Constable Zoe Sheard, Greater Manchester Police . 'This was an incident that needed a priority response. It didn't get one due to flawed decision making and a lack of diligence. 'We cannot know what difference a prompter response would have made. All I can hope is that those involved will learn lessons from this tragedy.' Assistant Chief Constable Zoe Sheard, from Greater Manchester Police, said their thoughts were with Ms Beevers' family. She said: 'We note the verdict of the coroner and will respond positively to her directions. 'Following Georgina's death we referred this case to the IPCC, who managed an investigation into our handling of this incident. 'As a result of their findings one officer received management action for breaching the standards of professional behaviour.

The last . confirmed sighting of Mr Nicholls was in March 2005. Five months earlier . in October 2004 he was in an accident with a van outside the traveller . site and suffered serious head injuries. Mr Nicholls was treated in hospital . but the accident left him incontinent, with speech and memory problems. He would have needed lifelong medication and returned to live with the . Connors. Months later he tried to make a claim for compensation for his injuries and contacted a solicitor. Detective Chief Inspector Dave . Sellwood, who led the inquiry into the Connors, told the inquest that Mr . Nicholls and another street drinker called Edward McCann were picked up . by William Connors. He found them towards the end of 2000 as they hitchhiked, were offered work and accommodation, and took them to Cheltenham. Other family members: William and Mary Connors's sons John (left), 29, and James (centre), 20, and their son-in-law Miles Connors (right), 24, were also jailed at Bristol Crown Court last December . ‘Edward McCann stated they were paid a pittance, not even a tenner a day,’ Mr Sellwood said. ‘Mr . McCann and Christopher would tout for work on behalf of William . Connors. Both of them gave their benefit books to Brida Connors and . neither ever saw the benefits again. ‘Sometimes when their benefits were cashed the Connors would buy them a small amount of food. 'Edward McCann witnessed Christopher being beaten on three occasions by William Connors. Christopher would get slapped by him if he came back from touting without a job. He saw William Connors assault Christopher with a rake' Detective Chief Inspector Dave Sellwood . ‘Mr . McCann said Christopher had the “gift of the gab” before his accident . and he was good at getting tarmacing jobs on behalf of William Connors. ‘He . witnessed Christopher being beaten on three occasions by William . Connors. Christopher would get slapped by him if he came back from . touting without a job. He saw William Connors assault Christopher with a . rake. ‘He said that after the accident . Christopher was “never the same again”. He started drinking really . heavily and was constantly wetting and soiling himself.’ The . court heard that police had arrested Mr Nicholls and two other workers . in January 2005 on suspicion of criminal damage to a driveway following a . complaint from a homeowner. ‘The . following day Edward McCann attended Cheltenham police station and took . responsibility for causing the damage to the driveway,’ Mr Sellwood . said. Bad treatment: William Connors is pictured (left) with one of the men (right) - often homeless drifters or addicts, who were beaten and forced to work for as little as £5 a day . ‘He was subsequently charged, pleaded guilty and sentenced to two months' imprisonment. He was put up to doing that by William Connors and he actually used it as a means to escape from the Connors. ‘He served some five weeks imprisonment and lied to William Connors about when he was to be released and was able to leave without him knowing and never returned to the family. 'He appears like other unfortunate men to have fallen under the malign influence and control of the Connors family' Deputy Gloucestershire Coroner David Dooley . ‘He left prison on March 4, 2005 and went to London and never saw Christopher again. ‘But while he was in prison he received a letter from William Connors saying Christopher was “no good anymore” and he had put £50 in each pocket and sent him on his way. ‘Mr McCann said that having fled he wasn't going to go back to be ""a slave - as that's all you are is a slave, you're not a person like a workman. Do this, do that, do this, do that..."". ‘We concluded that William and Brida Connors ran a criminal enterprise which consisted of recruiting vulnerable men and using them as cheap or free labour to build driveways or do domestic work around various sites they owned. ‘During our inquiry we identified 37 men who had worked for the family in this way. Christopher Nicholls was one such man. ‘Their sons, John and James Connors, were brought up and entered this way of life as did their son-in-law Miles Connors. Police raid: Bizarrely, the Connors family kept money in a toilet at one of their caravans in Gloucestershire . ‘It is clear from the accounts of those victims that they were cruelly exploited and subject to threats and violence and in many cases had their benefits stolen. ‘They all lived in poor conditions, worked long hours and survived on no more than £10 a day. A number of victims have described workers being 'fly-tipped' when they were no longer of any use to the family. ‘They explained this as workers being driven off a site and dumped leaving them to fend for themselves. ‘It . would seem that following Christopher's accident he was of less use to . the Connors family as a hawker. His speech had been affected and his . gait had been affected. ‘It . is the view of the police inquiry that it is highly likely that in early . March 2005 Christopher was 'fly-tipped' by William and Brida Connors . whilst still suffering the consequences of his accident. William Connors, 52, wife Mary, 48, . their sons, John, 29, and James, 20, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 24, . were jailed in December last year after being convicted of conspiracy to . require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. They . lived the high life at the expense of the men, who they treated as . their own private workforce. The profits funded a luxury cruise around . the Caribbean and exotic holidays to Tenerife and Cancun in Mexico. As well as holidays, they drove around . in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a . Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford . Ranger and a Mercedes van, and had built up a mounting property . portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds. The . Connors' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in . Staverton in Gloucestershire, Enderby in Leicestershire and Mansfield in . Nottinghamshire in March 2011 following a lengthy surveillance . operation. ‘At that time he would have had no access to benefits and no means to housing or to provide for himself. ‘We have been unable to establish the circumstances of Christopher's death due in no small part to the passage of time between his death and discovery. ‘There is no cause of death and no overtly suspicious circumstances. There is no evidence to link members of the Connors' family directly to his death.’ The inquest heard that Mr Nicholls' benefits continued to be cashed until March 2006 when letters were returned to the Department for Work and Pensions stating he no longer lived at the caravan site. A post mortem examination could not confirm any cause of death due to the decomposition of the remains. Mr Nicholls was identified by DNA recovered from a tooth. Mr Nicholls's father John and step-mother did not attend today's hearing, although his daughter Donna did. She did not wish to speak after the inquest. Recording an open verdict, Deputy Gloucestershire Coroner David Dooley said: ‘He appears like other unfortunate men to have fallen under the malign influence and control of the Connors family.’ ‘He was used as cheap labour up to and even after his road traffic accident on October 30, 2003, which left him with debilitating injuries.’ Mr Dooley added: ‘Where he died cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. It is not known if he was brought by others to the shed or made his own way there before dying. ‘When he died cannot be ascertained with any precision. How he died cannot be ascertained due to the length of time the body remained undiscovered. ‘The police evidence confirms there is no evidence available to link any other person to his death. ‘What actually happened to Christopher Nicholls after the Connors family appeared to have considered him of no further use remains unknown as far as the police inquiry is concerned. ‘There isn't sufficient evidence to the necessary standard of proof to enable me to record any substantive conclusion explaining further how Christopher Nicholls came about his death. ‘The law requires me to enter an open verdict.’","Christopher Nicholls was 41 when he was last seen alive in March 2005 .

A hip Japanese cafe is giving customers a chance to make sweet-sized gummy replicas of themselves to give to women they have a crush on. The Fab Cafe in Shibuya, Tokyo, is offering the unique service for the upcoming White Day on March 14, when men traditionally give presents to their lovers. For around £40 (6,000 yen) customers will have their bodies mapped using a 3D scanner, with the resulting file used to 3D print a mould for the one-of-a-kind product. And they call it gummy love... A Japanese cafe . is offering male customers the chance to have themselves moulded as gummy-bear like sweets to give to their lovers on White Day . Bowled over: On White Day, men and boys in Japan . and other East Asian countries offer gifts in return to women and girls . who have given them presents for Valentine's Day . The same establishment previously held a successful Valentine's Day event where ladies were invited to create a chocolate replica of their face to give to their partners. In Japan, Valentine's Day is typically observed by girls and women presenting chocolate gifts to boys or men as an expression of love, courtesy, or social obligation. On White Day, the reverse happens. Men who received a honmei-choco ('chocolate of love') or giri-choco ('courtesy chocolate') on Valentine's Day are expected to give gifts in return. The name of the Fab Cafe, which opened last year in Tokyo's fashionable and vibrant Shibuya district, has something of a double meaning. One the one hand, it is, obviously, a contraction of the word fabulous; but it is also a less obvious contraction of the word fabrication. Two day workshop: For around £40 (6,000 yen) customers will have their bodies first mapped using a 3D scanner, then the resulting file will be used to 3D print a mould for the one-of-a-kind product . High demand: Spaces for the workshop are strictly limited . That's because the tiny coffee shop is equipped with a powerful laser cutter which any customer can use for a fee to cut out designs in Adobe Illustrator files. It also has 3D printers and other tools that designers can use to quickly prototype designs and products. The gummy bear workshop takes place over two sessions. The first, this Saturday, will be for men to come in and have their bodies 3D scanned in whatever pose they choose. By the next session, a week later, Fab Cafe staff will have 3D printed the moulds for the gummy gifts and returning customers will be able to make their gummy counterparts to take to their White Day sweethearts. Designers' hangout: The Fab Cafe, which opened last year in Tokyo's fashionable and vibrant Shibuya district, has a laser cutting machine and 3D printers that customers can use for a fee . A post on the cafe's site reads (courtesy of Google Translate): 'We have prepared a plan to use high-spec 3D printers, 3D scanners again, they make a gummy whole body of you who do not lose the impact of the chocolate face. 'Please try to express the feelings of loved ones with the whole body.' Spaces are strictly limited.

But try telling that to Beyonce – or animal rights campaigners. For these shoes, commissioned by the singer, are made from no fewer than five different animal skins: stingray, anaconda, ostrich, crocodile and calf. Fans and animal welfare groups alike condemned Beyonce, 31, as ‘cruel’ and ‘spoilt’ for having the trainers made. beyonce zoo shoes.jpg . Electric: Beyonce wowed with her energetic Superbowl performance earlier this month . A spokesman for animal charity PETA said: ‘These custom-made kicks come . with a high price – and it’s paid by the various animals who were beaten . and skinned alive or cruelly farmed and killed.’ He added: ‘We hope . that one day she’ll go completely cruelty-free.’ Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, described the trainers as ‘a . brazen publicity stunt’. ‘The less that is said about it the better,’ he . added. The cream colour shoes are a take on the wedge-style trainer, made popular by designer Isabel Marant, but given a so-called Eden makeover by PMK using a hybrid of land and sea skins. Called The King-Bey, the shoes, which have been given Beyonce's approval, are decorated with gold accents. The price is as yet undisclosed, but a regular pair sells in excess of £230 ($350) so this embellished pair would sell for far more. PMK is a favourite brand of Beyonce and her A-list husband Jay Z - indeed, Jay Z had a shoe designed for him last year- the Brooklyn Zoo - by the brand. His pair were as lavish as his wife's, with an endless roll call of reptile skins used to make the shoe. High-fashion couple: Beyonce and husband Jay Z have now both had customized trainers created by PMK . Of the trainer they designed for Jay-Z, PMK said: ‘The Brooklyn Zoo 1′s cannot be tamed with an elaborate combination of elephant-print, ostrich, python, boa, crocodile, lizard, alligator, suede, and sting ray intricately cut to transform the Jordan 1 from a basketball sneaker into the world's most daring and dapper sneaker concepts known to man.'

A father has been arrested for allegedly murdering his nine-year-old son with a hatchet as the boy slept on the couch. Matthew Raymond Hernandez was brutally slayed as his great-grandmother looked on and pleaded with his father, 36-year-old Phillip Raymond Hernandez, to stop, police said. The horrific killing at the family's home in South Natomas, California on Tuesday night came as Hernandez battled his ex-wife to keep custody of their two sons. The couple's other son, who is 12, was at the home at the time of the attack but was not harmed. Tragic: Phillip Hernandez, left, allegedly killed his nine-year-old son Matthew, right, with a hatchet on Tuesday night as the boy slept on the sofa. The boy's great-grandmother watched the attack unfold . Hernandez went into the backyard on Tuesday night and fetched a hatchet, police said. He then smashed through a sliding glass door to get back inside the home, but police do not know why. The boy's great-grandmother heard the glass shatter and ran to the living room, where she saw Hernandez standing over his sleeping son, armed with the hatchet, police said. She tried to stop him from hurting the boy, but Hernandez allegedly threw her to the side and began attacking the boy with the hatchet as the woman looked on, Police Officer Michele Gigante said. Police received two hysterical 911 calls from the female relative as Hernandez left the scene. Officers arrived to find the boy dead and searched the neighbourhood for the man, the Sacramento Bee reported. He was found walking a mile away and taken into custody. Hernandez remains at the Sacramento County Main Jail and will be arraigned on Friday. Scene: The man fled the home after allegedly killing the boy and was tracked down a mile away by police . 'Everybody is just trying to deal . with losing a child and the father of a child, because basically we lost . them both,' a relative, Chris Duran, told CBS. 'There is no way to . explain something like this.' Gigante said investigators are also deeply affected by what they found at the scene. 'I . can see how horrific the scene must have been by how the detectives are . responding. As a parent, I couldn't even imagine it,' Gigante told the . Bee. 'You don't want to envision it in your mind.' The boys' mother, Jessica Hernandez, lives out of state but is travelling to be with her surviving son. The courts had previously ordered that the boys live with her during their summer vacations, but stay with their father the rest of the year, the Bee reported. Court records show Hernandez and his ex-wife, who married in January 2001 and separated in April 2004, had a turbulent relationship with each other and the courts. In 2004, he was charged with domestic violence and pleaded no contest, and he was sentenced to 120 days in jail and five years of probation. Shock: Relative Chris Duran said Hernandez was a good father and that the killing had shocked the family . In November 2005, he was again charged with corporal injury on a spouse and sent to prison. He served time between July 2006 and October 2007 and finished parole in November 2008. After his release, the Hernandez fought for custody of the boys, CBS Sacramento reported. He wrote to the judge: 'It's been over three years since I last saw them. They are what matter, my view of life and what is important. I love them with all of my heart and I want to give what I didn't have - a father.' But in 2012, their mother launched another fight to win full custody of the boys. 'He was going through rough times and so . we don't know what triggered, but obviously something did and it's a . tragedy we all have to deal with,' Duran said.","The murder came as Phillip Hernandez, 36, and his ex-wife fought for custody of their two sons ."

Jailed: Man City youth team player Courtney Meppen Walter wept in court as he was jailed for 16 months for killing a brother and sister while speeding in his Mercedes . A Manchester City footballer who killed a brother and sister . whilst 'showboating' in a Mercedes cried in court today after he was jailed for 16 months. Courtney Meppen-Walter, 18, was at the wheel of the 'high powered' Mercedes C220 saloon and doing nearly double the 30mph speed limit when he hit a Nissan Micra emerging from a side street. The Nissan driver, Kulwant Singh, 32, from Salford, and his sister, front-seat passenger Ravel Kaur, 37, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, were both killed. Moments earlier, the defendant had been 'jockeying' and 'playing games' with a friend in a VW Golf along a nearby dual carriageway. Following the crash, Meppen-Walter got out of his car and tried to help the injured, waving his arms and saying: 'What have I done?' The defendant, who is also the captain of the England Under-18 side and played 17 times for his country, will serve half his sentence - eight months - in custody but may be released earlier on an electronic tag. He was also ordered to sell his . luxury car so the money could go to Mrs Kaur's two . orphaned children. Mr Singh's widow sat in the public gallery, with an interpreter relaying the proceedings, and wiped away tears during the hearing. The crash victims came to the UK in 2001 to start a new life after fleeing persecution by the Taliban, the court heard. Ms Kaur's two sons, aged 16 and 17, both back-seat passengers, were injured in the crash, which happened in central Manchester at about 10.15pm on September 1 last year. They are now orphans after their father was killed in Afghanistan. Meppen-Walter had one previous conviction for speeding - again doing 56mph in a 30mph zone. Dressed in a dark suit and overcoat, Meppen-Walter was in tears as he went into the dock, before the judge entered the room, and wept throughout the proceedings and as he was jailed. Meppen-Walter, of Blackley, Manchester, admitted two counts of causing death by careless driving at the city’s magistrates’ court earlier this month. Scroll down for video . Victims: The Nissan driver, Kulwant Singh, 32, left, and his sister, front-seat passenger Ravel Kaur, 37, right, were both killed in the crash . Going down: Meppen-Walter, far right, is pictured with family and friends arriving for his sentencing at Manchester Crown Court today . Mark Kellet, prosecuting, told the court earlier on that Saturday night the defendant met a group of friends, Aaron Whitehorne, James Conroy and Shay Facey at a restaurant in Rusholme, then went to a Sheesha Bar before they agreed to go home, get changed and go to a nightclub later. Meppen-Walter got into his car and Mr Conroy drove off in his Golf with Mr Whitehorne as passenger. As the cars got to Trinity Way in central Manchester another driver Saleem Mirza, saw them 'jockeying', the court heard, with the cars accelerating hard then slowing down. 'They were constantly accelerating and slowing, with the rear of the Mercedes dipping down and smoke coming from the exhaust as diesels do,' Mr Mirza told police. 'They were playing games, not racing and were not excessively fast.' Lisa Woodrow, a passenger in Mr Mirza’s car, saw the Mercedes swerve before it hit the Micra. Mr Kellet said: 'Her response to the collision was, ""That’s what happens when you mess around on roads.”’ Meppen-Walter got out of his car and tried to help the injured, waving his arms saying, ""What have I done!"" Mr Singh and his sister Ms Kaur were pronounced dead at the scene. Career ruined: Meppen-Walters can be seen here playing for the Manchester City youth team . Her son Amjit Singh, was unconscious but her other son Harveen was conscious, crying and asking for his mother, the court heard. Police initially investigated whether Meppen-Walter from Blackley, Manchester was racing a friend in a VW Golf as both cars appeared to be accelerating and slowing down apparently to avoid speed cameras. But they later ruled out the racing line of inquiry and freed the other driver without charge. Today the £1,000 a week defender who has been at City since 2003 and has represented England at under-17 level broke and wept as was given 16 months jail and banned from driving for three years. After the case Sgt Danny Byrne, from Greater Manchester Police said: . 'What this case tragically highlights is that every time someone gets behind the wheel of a car, the driver has to have 100 percent concentration, they must adhere to the speed limits and respect the laws of the road. 'There can be absolutely no room for risks or ""showboating"". A car can be a lethal weapon and sadly that has been borne out and taken Kulwant and Ravel away from their loving family forever. 'No family should have to suffer such a devastating loss in these circumstances. I can only hope now the case has concluded that they can try and move forward with their lives.' At the time Mr Singh's was driving his sister and her children home from a Sikh temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children, aged one and three. His lawyer Gwyn Lewis said in . mitigation: 'It has to be said that this type of case should always be . called tragic. Tragic for the family that lost their loved ones and also . tragic for the defendant. 'He . became involved in a matter that only took a few seconds but it will . remain with him for the rest of his life. He is truly sorry for his . actions. He was sorry when he was at the scene and he said 'what have I . done?' staying at the scene for over an hour trying to help anyway he . could. Convicted: This image was taken after Meppen-Walter had passed his driving test . 'We heard about him jostling for position. It was childish behaviour but it wasn't dangerous. It was being carried out because the defendant's mobile phone lost charge and he was giving directions to the other driver, shouting instructions of where to go. 'But even though it was that childish behaviour there was a period of time - 10-15 seconds at most - where he moved from being a child to being adult quickly. 'He assisted at the scene. He has shown personal remorse - it is genuine. He is a young man who certainly had a promising football career. ""He played for the under 18s international matches and he had played for England 17 times. He was captain for the under 18s side. He had a promising future at Manchester City. 'He is a young man that wishes he could have those 10 seconds back but he can't. He's faced up to the matter by accepting his responsibilities.' Locked up: Courtney Meppen-Walter, left, was the captain of the England Under-18 side and played 17 times for his country . Passing sentence Judge Martin Steiger QC said: 'There are a number of aggravating factors - two deaths and serious injuries to the children and the defendant was speeding earlier. 'He had been seen jockeying and that activity in my judgement says that the speeding was not an isolated act.' Outside court Kushwant Kaur, Kulwant's wife, said: 'The driver has taken away my loving husband and father to my two children. Our life has been destroyed. 'Kulwant was more than anything I have ever loved in my life, nothing can replace him. I am pleased that justice has been done and I hope that this will teach him so no family has to go through what myself and my family have been through this past few months, and will continue to go through for the rest of our lives.' Gawa Singh, brother to both Kulwant and Ravel, also said: 'Not only has this incident taken away two loved members of our family- it has also affected in such a big way the people left behind. 'Our lives had begun to improve and we were looking forward to a brighter future, now all that has been taken from us. Nothing will bring back our brother and sister and any sentence given by the courts will make our lives any better. 'People who kill on the roads should be banned from driving forever so that they can never do this again to another person. 'We are reminded daily about the loss of our brother and sister, he should be reminded every day too by not having the luxury of having the use of a car.'","Courtney Meppen-Walter, 18, was jailed for 16 months .

The self-proclaimed Muslim hater who pushed a New York immigrant into an oncoming subway train allegedly told a detective that she heartlessly killed the man because she 'thought it was cool.' Erika Menendez, 31, who was found fit to stand trial in Queens today and entered a plea of not guilty, expressed no remorse when she told detectives her senseless motive which ended the life of 46-year-old Sunando Sen last December. 'I'm prejudice,' she said according to the New York Post. 'I pushed him in front of the train because I thought it was cool.' Mentally fit: Erika Menendez, seen after her arrest for the death of 46-year-old Sunando Sen last December, was found fit to stand trial today but denied her family-retained attorney out of distrust . Menendez additionally dumped her family-retained attorney for a court-appointed attorney on Wednesday, footing any resulting bill to tax payers out of fear of her family’s manipulation. 'She indicated she doesn't want our representation because of distrust with her family,' privately hired attorney Thomas A Kenniff told the Post. Mr Kenniff tried to persuade the Queens judge to 'not use tax payers' money when the family can afford [an attorney].' ‘I hate my family, I don't care, I don't want your medicine, I know what I am doing,’ an earlier statement from Menendez while held at the 112th Precinct was read by Assistant District Attorney Peter Lomp according to the Post. When Mr Kenniff’s request was denied by the judge, to the visual disapproval of both Menendez’s mother and sister who were seated in the courtroom, he offered to work alongside court-appointed attorney Joseph DeFelice. Motive: Menendez allegedly told detectives that she killed the Indian-born man both because she thought it was cool and because she saw it as revenge for the 9/11 attack which she blamed her victim for . Victim: Sunando Sen was standing on a subway platform in Queens when he was allegedly pushed by Menendez onto the tracks . Mr Kenniff said that though Menendez suffers psychological issues, mainly paranoia having to do with her family according to psychologists, she was twice found fit to stand trial. DeFelice entered a not guilty plea for the woman charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime and plans to submit a bail application for her at the next April 18 court hearing. Earlier in January Menendez gave an interview from Rikers Island where she is being held in custody, telling the Post that she was furious the day she ended the life of the hard-working Indian man.

Amanda Saville, who runs Sports Driving Unlimited, the equine charity which trains the Chariots of Fire team, said Hettie believes she is just another one of the ponies. She said: 'There's no doubt she thinks she's a horse. She's been reared with the ponies for years now, so there's no reason for her to think she's a cow.

Deet, the widely used insect repellent, is becoming less effective at repelling mosquitoes, according to new research. A landmark study has found that while mosquitoes are initially repelled by the substance, they ignore it if they are later exposed to it again. The study tested the response to Deet on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are notorious for biting during the day and are capable of transmitting dengue fever and yellow fever viruses. Deet, the widely used insect repellent, is becoming less effective at repelling mosquitoes . Previous research had demonstrated how some mosquitoes were genetically immune to the substance, but the new research has shown that even those that would usually be deterred developed a resistance. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine say that results underline how more research is needed to find alternatives to the chemical. Dr James Logan, who led the research, said: 'The more we understand . about how repellents work and how mosquitoes detect them, the better we . can work out ways to get around the problem when they do become . resistant to repellents.' Deet - or N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide - is . one of the most widely used active ingredients in insect repellents. It . was developed by the US military, following its use in jungle . warfare during World War II. While mosquitoes were initially repelled by the substance, they ignored it when exposed again . It is also considered the most effective repellant against mosquitoes. Until recently it was not clear how the chemical worked, but recent research suggests that insects simply do not like the smell. The new study involved providing the mosquitoes with an arm treated with Deet. As expected, they were initially put off by the substance, but surprisingly, several hours later not all the mosquitoes were deterred by the repellant. To better understand why this might be happening, researchers attached electrodes to the insects' antenna. They found that the receptors at the end of the antenna were no longer  as sensitive to the chemical, although why is not fully understood. Dr Logan said it was vital to understand both these permanent genetic and temporary olfactory changes that were taking place adding that mosquitoes are very good at evolving 'very, very quickly'. He stressed that the findings should not stop people from using Deet in high risk areas. Dr Logan now plans to find out how long the effect lasts after the initial exposure to the chemical. The team would also like to study the effect in other mosquitoes, including the species that transmit malaria.","Deet is considered the most effective insect repellant .

'We waited an hour and then went outside. The blast had split the shelter and there was a huge crater that came right up to the wall. It only landed about a metre away. We only had the clothes we were standing in.' After staying with relatives, Margery, her mother Nellie and father George found a property in Baldwin Lane, Hall Green .

'We all dived down,' remembered Margery. 'They released two bombs at the same time, the one from the other side killed an elderly woman across the road and the other hit our fireplace. 'We all had to rush off not knowing when it was going to go off. Five days later it blew and demolished two houses next door and knocked down half of two others.' Kenneth and Margery are as much in love now, left, as they were as a young couple, right . Having a war wedding wasn't easy.

Margery's colleagues at Rover, where she worked as a shorthand typist, made the cake. Due to a shortage of ingredients it had to be a chocolate sponge. There was one further disaster waiting for the couple - this time a natural one. Their first home - rented accommodation in Reddings Lane - was struck by fireball lightning, destroying the chimney. 'My father was on the toilet outside and he came running down the yard when it hit and destroyed the roof and chimney,' laughed Margery. When the Baldwin Lane property was rebuilt, they moved back.

UK Border Agency officials have released these images as part of a bid to tackle rising numbers of bogus weddings, the Evening Standard reports. They went to Monday’s ceremony at the civic centre in Uxbridge and swooped on the man shortly before the wedding started. The 22-year-old Indian groom, who had been living in Harlington, was found to have over-stayed his visa and was arrested and detained for being in the country illegally. He is expected to be deported. His intended bride, a 23-year-old Hungarian woman who is here legally under EU law, was questioned and later released by officers. The pair did not share a common language.

Puppy love: A dog walker captured this rare moment when a young seal started playing with his Labrador by the Thames near Greenwich in London . The friendly seal: The young pup then bounds out of the water towards the 13-year-old dog called Mischa . The unlikely duo can then be seen playing hide and seek throughout the four minute, 35 second video clip, which was uploaded by Ms White to YouTube. Mr Nolan said: 'We were mudlarking on the Thames on the day in question, we always take Mischa, our 13-year-old Labrador bitch. 'Before the video was taken she went for a swim by herself and to our amazement the seal was swimming and playing with her in the water. 'The seal would pop up and Mischa would swim towards the seal only for it to disappear and Mischa to chase the seal in a sort of merry-go-round. 'The seal then followed us along the shoreline, paying particular attention to Mischa, whom the seal had obviously mistaken for another, very blonde, seal.

The pair also managed to spot a numbered ID tag on the seal and attempted to find out more about where it had come from. Mr Nolan continued: 'I subsequently made investigations having recorded the tag number. 'I discovered that the female seal had been rehabilitated after being orphaned and raised by people at the RSPCA seal sanctuary in East Winch - Kings Lynn, Norfolk - hence it's relaxed attitude towards humans.

Houston police searching for the parents of a newborn girl who was found wrapped in a Walmart bag on a city street last week released composite sketches of what Bay Chloe's mom and dad may look like. The pastel renderings created by a well-known forensic sketch artist depict a man and a woman with facial features combining Chloe's traits, like her grey eyes and thick dark hair. The Harris County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that the portraits are based solely on Chloe's photo and not on the description of any possible witnesses. Scroll down to watch video . Mom and dad: An artist created these pastel portraits of what baby Chloe's mother, left, and father, right, might look like using age progression and combining the child's facial features . Baby Chloe was found by a woman walking her dog near an apartment complex in Cypress last Tuesday. The child was wrapped in a Walmart bag and still had her umbilical cord attached. Artist Lois Gibson, who has created thousands of composite sketches of crime victims and suspects over the years, was touched by Chloe's story of abandonment and decided to help investigators find her parents. Renowned: Forensic artist Lois Gibson has created thousands of composite sketches of crime victims and suspects over the years, landing her in the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records . Sheriff's office spokeswoman Christina Garza said Gibson first did an age progression of what Chloe would look like as a young woman to deduce what her mother and father could look like. ‘It might just look half like one and half like the other,’ Gibson told the Houston Chronicle. 'I think I have a 50 per cent chance of the sketches looking more like one than the other.’ The artist conceded that such factors as weight gain, dyed hair and acne make the process less precise. Gibson, who made it into the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Most Successful Forensic Artist, has created age progressions in other cases involving children, but never as young as Chloe. Gibson made a name for herself when in 2007, she created a portrait of Baby Grace based from a body of a child found in a storage container near Galveston. A woman in Ohio saw the image and recognized the victim as her granddaughter. Officials in Houston hope that Chloe's parents will provide important medical and genetic information that would help her future adoptive parents raise her. The newborn, named Chloe by hospital staff in Houston, Texas, is now a week old and even has her first tooth - which she showed off to photographers as she smiled for cameras on Monday. She was found outside an apartment complex on Tuesday last week after a woman's dog picked up on a scent and led her to a bag, where she made the startling discovery. Bundle of joy: Baby Chloe smiles a week after she was found dumped in a plastic bag in Houston . Paramedics took the young girl, who still had about three inches of umbilical court attacked to her stomach, to Texas Children's Hospital, where she was listed as in good condition. 'She was very healthy… didn't have a fever,' Estella Olguin with the Child Protective Services told KHOU. 'Fortunately, she did not suffer from being exposed to the elements . that evening.' Doctors believe the young girl was dumped just hours after she was born. They also think she was born slightly premature at 35 weeks gestation. CPS is now looking for the girl's mother or father; Olguin said they do not have to claim the baby but that a discussion with them would be useful to identify Chloe's family's medical history. Abandoned: Child Protective Services is now looking for her parents so they know her medical history . Content: The newborn has been placed in foster care and a judge will decide her future next week . 'So the person who is adopting this baby can have some more genetic . family medical background on the baby to be able to raise her with more . knowledge or information about her,' Olguin said. Chloe will be cared for in a foster home as CPS continues the search. A hearing will be held on her behalf on March 4, and a judge will decide her fate, the Houston Chronicle reported. Her early tooth is a genetic trait and could be a clue to tracking down the family, doctors said. Sgt Gordon Trott, of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office, said an unnamed woman walking her pet at around 7pm came across a Walmart bag left near the fence surrounding the Stonegate Villas Apartments in the 11000 block of Grant Road in the Cypress section of Houston, according to the Houston Chronicle. Rough start: A newborn baby girl, seen in the circle inside the ambulance, was discovered alive inside a plastic bag left outside a housing complex in Houston . According to Trott, the woman's dog . picked up a scent and led her to the bag. At first, the pet owner . thought that someone had dumped a dead animal, but when she opened the . parcel, she was surprised to find a little girl inside. According to officials, the child was . naked, but her body temperature was normal, suggesting that she had not . been outside for a long time. Her umbilical cord had not been clamped, but someone made sure to clean her up after birth. Officials with the Harris County . Sheriff's Office Crimes Against Children Unit said they have few leads . since there are no surveillance cameras in the area where the newborn . was abandoned. 'If it had not of been for the . resident that came out to walk her dogs, that child may have laid there . all night, possibly would've died,' said Trott. Drop-off spot: The child was wrapped in a Walmart bag that was placed between a tree and a bush on Grant Road . Lucky break: The newborn girl was breathing on her own and listed in good condition after being taken to a hospital for evaluation . Law enforcement officials were taken aback by the mother's decision to dump the newborn on the street since Texas has a Safe Haven law which allows anyone to drop off a child at a hospital or fire station without facing any legal repercussions, Click2Houston reported. Endangering or abandoning a child is a third degree felony in Texas and punishable by two to ten years in prison. If the mother is a juvenile, she could still face repercussions in the juvenile courts. But if the biological parents come forward in this case, investigators from the Harris County Sheriff's Department will try to determine the circumstances leading to the abandonment and then discuss the case with the District Attorney's Office, a sheriff's department spokesperson said.

Jinyia You was stabbed numerous times by the large knife during the broad daylight attack on Sunday, allegedly by her husband, Ming Guang Huang. A judge has ordered Huang, 28, held without bail in connection to the crime, a portion of which was caught by a store surveillance camera. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attack: Ming Guang Huang has been charged with attacking his wife Jinyia You with a meat cleaver in broad daylight on a Manhattan street. She can be seen her being dragged along the floor . Springing into action: The attack was broken up by firefighters, who witnessed the trouble from their firehouse across the street . Both Huang and You are currently . at Bellevue Hospital - where the woman is receiving treatment for her injuries, and the man is being held in a psych ward, the New York Post reported. Huang has been charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder. A criminal complaint obtained by the paper on Wednesday said that she 'sustained multiple lacerations to the head, two of which went into the skull, hitting the brain, and required removing half of the victim's skull in order to stabilize the injury.' In court on Wednesday, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Philip Kavoor told the judge: 'This case is such a serious and strong case wherein two eye witnesses observed the defendant attack the complaining witness with a meat cleaver and strike her multiple times in the head, face and body,' according to the Post. The morning attack on Chinatown's Canal Street on Sunday left onlookers horrified, and even shocked firefighters across the street who rushed to You's rescue. Wrestle: Firemen subdued the madman as the cleaver went flying through the air . Restraint: As they held him against the side of the street, the firefighters saw a nearby police squad car, which they flagged down and Huang was arrested . Jose Ortiz and some other firefighters heard a commotion from their nearby Engine Company 9 firehouse. They witnessed the brutal attack as they prepared their equipment for the day. In front of a hair salon and novelties store, they say they saw a man dragging a woman down the street by the hair as she cried and screamed. As the woman tried desperately to fend the man off, Ortiz approached them. Cleaver fighter: Firefighter Jose Ortiz first saw the incident and he and colleagues rushed to subdue the man . View: Across the street, the firehouse door was open, so the firemen were able to see the attack and run to the rescue . The 18-year FDNY veteran told the NY Daily News that's when things got ugly. He said the 28-year-old man pulled a meat cleaver from his waistband and began hacking into his young wife's face and head. 'I would guess maybe six, eight, ten times, he hit the woman in the head,' he said. Ortiz continued to approach the man as . the attack went on. He said he tried to hold back the man's arm but he . continued swinging the cleaver uncontrollably. Bloody scene: The incident occurred in New York's Chinatown, just in front of a novelties store and a hair salon (both pictured) Fellow firefighter Shane Clarke and Jim Trainor finally came to Ortiz's aid and subdued the madman as the cleaver went flying through the air. It was more of a struggle than Ortiz had originally guessed it would be. ‘He was not a big guy, only about 5-foot-5, but the cleaver made him a little taller,’ Ortiz said. The firefighters saw a nearby police squad car, which they flagged down and the man was arrested. Meanwhile, the woman fled from the scene panic-stricken and bleeding. Panicked: The bloodied victim fled the scene but was eventually found and taken to Bellevue Hospital where she is expected to recover . ‘She bolts. Shane follows her, because I told him, “You’ve got to follow the lady, because she’s hurt,”’ Ortiz said. Clarke was able to catch up to the panicked woman at a nearby restaurant. Accustomed to terrifying and dire situations, these FDNY heroes feel fortunate to have come to the rescue so quickly but were definitely fazed by this unusual occurrence. ‘Besides the World Trade Center,’ Clarke said, ‘this was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.’ The attacker was taken into custody at the scene, where remains.","Jinyia You struck numerous times in head and face by meat cleaver that was allegedly wielded by her husband, Ming Guang Huang .

The letter, from one of his constituents, said the MP ‘cannot be trusted and is a liability to women, the public, and your party’. Claims: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left, pictured yesterday) allegedly received a written complaint in March 2011 about the behaviour of Mike Hancock (right), MP for Portsmouth South, but did not reply . Yet despite this, no investigation was ever held, according to The Spectator magazine. The letter was received months after Mr Hancock was arrested – but not charged – over allegations that he had made sexual advances on a constituent who had contacted him for help with a noisy neighbour. The alleged victim is now suing the MP over what she said was a ten-month inappropriate relationship, during which he is accused of placing his hand on her breast, exposing himself and kissing her without consent. A Lib Dem spokesman said last night: ‘If we’ve not replied to a letter, that’s not acceptable and we’ll look into why that happened. There was a police investigation into Mike Hancock but no action was subsequently taken. ‘There is currently a civil claim being made and it’s not appropriate to comment further.’ Three years ago Mr Hancock hit the headlines when his 25-year-old researcher was arrested – accused of being a Russian spy. Previously: It was also revealed that a former councillor, John Thompson, sent a letter to then party leader Paddy Ashdown (pictured in March 1992) expressing concern about Hancock's behaviour in the 1990s . The father of two, 68, has admitted in a court case that he had had ‘a few’ extra-marital affairs and that he had ‘kissed and cuddled’ a teenager. The Spectator also revealed that a former councillor, John Thompson, sent a letter to then party leader Paddy Ashdown expressing concern about Hancock’s behaviour in the 1990s. No response was received. 'If we’ve not replied to a letter, that’s not acceptable and we’ll look into why that happened. There was a police investigation into Mike Hancock but no action was subsequently taken' Lib Dem spokesman . The party is already reeling from claims that the Lib Dem leadership turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual misconduct by former chief executive Lord Rennard. However, in a remarkable display of confidence, the Lib Dem leader boasted that his party was ‘on the cusp of a great victory’ in Eastleigh, the seat vacated by disgraced former Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne. On a brief visit to the Hampshire town last night Mr Clegg told activists: ‘We can and we will win.’ His comments came despite signs that the Lib Dem/Tory marginal has turned into a dramatic three horse race following a late Ukip surge. There are signs that the controversy surrounding the Rennard scandal may persuade some Lib Dem voters to stay at home today. On the road: Nick Clegg (right) makes a speech during a visit to the party's campaign HQ with Mike Thornton (left), the Lib Dem's prospective parliamentary candidate, in Eastleigh, Hampshire, ahead of the by-election . Defeat for Mr Clegg could hasten his departure as Lib Dem leader. But the consequences of a poor result for the Conservatives are also potentially serious for David Cameron. Senior Tory David Davis warned that Cameron’s leadership would survive coming second to the Lib Dems but a good Ukip showing was ‘much more likely to have an impact on Tory MPs’. 'We can and we will win' Nick Clegg on Eastleigh by-election . Polls earlier in the week gave the Lib Dems a five-point lead over the Conservatives, with Ukip a strong third. But Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the polls had underestimated the late surge from his party. Mr Farage said his candidate, Diane James, could even win tonight, saying: ‘We have a real possibility of  causing one of the most seismic  by-election results for decades.’ He added: ‘Cameron’s problem is that in this constituency hundreds of traditional Conservative voters have looked at his views on a range of things and decided he is not a Conservative.’ A poor result for Labour in Eastleigh would raise serious questions about its ability to win votes in the south of England.","DPM allegedly received complaint about behaviour of MP Mike Hancock .

"By . Gerri Peev, In Riga, Martin Robinson and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 02:29 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:41 EST, 28 February 2013 . David Cameron is attending the the Northern Future Forum in Riga, Lativa, where he warned against banking reforms which could damage Britain's competitiveness . David Cameron and Boris Johnson joined forces yesterday to condemn ‘deluded’ plans for a Europe-wide cap on bankers’ bonuses. In a rare show of unity, the Prime Minister and London Mayor each voiced grave concerns about proposals which critics claim could damage the City and force major banks to move abroad. Downing Street said Mr Cameron had ‘real concerns’ about the plans. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable also criticised the proposals, warning they would ‘present problems for the UK’. Under the EU proposal a perk of two years' salary could only be paid if a majority of shareholders agreed to it. The deal must be signed off by EU governments before coming into force next year but Chancellor George Osborne is expected to argue against it at a meeting of European finance ministers next year. Mr Cameron, meeting European leaders in the Latvian capital Riga, also cautioned that the cap should not be allowed to stifle Britain's role as a global banking centre. Speaking during a press conference, the PM said: 'We have major international banks based in the UK that have branches and activities all over the world. 'We need to make sure that regulation put in place in Brussels is flexible enough to allow those banks to continue competing and succeeding while being located in the UK. 'We will look carefully at the outcome of the negotiations before working out the appropriate take at Ecofin next week. The Northern Future Forum brings together prime ministers from Nordic and Baltic countries and Britain in Riga, Latvia. Pictured from left: Denmark's Premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Jan Grevstad, Sweden's Premier Fredrick Reinfeld, Estonia's Premier Andris Ansip, Lithuania's Premier Algirdas Butkevichius, Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Iceland's Premier Johanna Sigurdardottir . 'Britain . wants effective bank regulations. One of the failures of the last . government was the failure of not having effective bank regulations. We . will look carefully at the outcome of the negotiations.' He said the UK should instead focus on the Vickers plan, which would separate risk-taking investment banks from retail or high street banks . 'We must be able to implement the Vickers plan in the UK which in some ways is tougher than regulations that are being put in place in other European countries.' Boris Johnson joined the chorus of British opposition, branding the plans 'deluded' and 'self-defeating'. The London Mayor warned it would simply play into the hands of the City of London's overseas rivals, while undermining support for the EU in Britain. 'People will wonder why we stay in the EU if it persists in such transparently self-defeating policies,' he said. 'Brussels cannot control the global market for banking talent. Brussels cannot set pay for bankers around the world. 'The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU. This is possibly the most deluded measure to come from Europe since Diocletian tried to fix the price of groceries across the Roman Empire.' Battle: Chancellor George Osborne opposes a cap like the one agreed by EU chiefs last night . Mr Osborne is expected to try to block the plans, claiming it would prevent City firms hiring the best staff, prompting an exodus of top talent to New York. The deal must still be signed-off by EU governments before coming into force in 2014 but the UK is struggling to convince other countries it is a bad idea. If Britain loses its showdown with Brussels, it would mean the most draconian clampdown on fat cats' perks since the financial crisis of 2008. It came as the taxpayer-owned Royal Bank of Scotland announced losses of £5.16bn for last year, but it is still expected to pay its top five executives £6m in shares and an annual bonus on top of their six or seven figure ‘basic’ salaries. RBS said it paid employees £607 million in bonuses for 2012, including £215 million for investment bankers, down from a total pot of £789 million in 2011. The bank's chief executive, Stephen Hester, insisted that 'pay should be aligned with contribution', but denounced the plan to impose bonus rules which will apply only to the banking industry. 'I don't think bankers should be treated . as special creatures in any way,' he said. 'I think we should apply rules in the . same way to anyone.' Under the proposed EU rules, payments to bankers would only be allowed to reach twice the annual fixed salary if a large majority of a bank's shareholders signed it off, said Othmar Karas, the European Parliament's chief negotiator today. 'This overhaul of EU banking rules will make sure that banks in the future have enough capital, both in terms of quality and quantity, to withstand shocks. This will ensure that taxpayers across Europe are protected into the future,' said Ireland's finance minister Michael Noonan, who led the negotiations for 27 governments. The bonus cap was part of a sweeping financial reform package introducing higher capital requirements for banks, the so-called Basel III rules. Last night's agreement - reached at during an eight-hour make-or-break negotiating session between EU politicians, the European Commission and representatives of the bloc's 27 governments in Brussels - ensures the package can take effect next year. Top bankers and traders may currently earn bonuses multiple times their base salary based on their performance, given that there is no legal pay limit yet. But public outrage has grown across Europe over large bonus payments to executives of banks that received huge state bailouts during the financial crisis. Taking the lad: Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan helped broker the deal and says it will ensure taxpayers across Europe are protected . Proponents of the bonus cap say the payments encouraged bankers to take massive risks at the expense of the long-term future of their businesses, which helped to destabilise the financial system. 'For the first time in the history of EU financial market regulation, we will cap bankers' bonuses,' Mr Karas said. 'The essence is that from 2014, European banks will have to set aside more money to be more stable and concentrate on their core business, namely financing the real economy, that of small and medium-sized enterprises and jobs.' Britain, home to Europe's biggest financial industry, had vehemently rejected the proposal, saying the rules would drive away talent and hamper growth. London tried to rally other EU governments behind its position, but failed to garner enough support. Most governments said they would accept the bonus cap to ensure the more important Basel III rules come into force by January 2014. The Federation of European Employers (FedEE) immediately claimed that the agreement to curb bankers’ pay exceeded EU powers. FedEE secretary-general Robin Chater, a former adviser to the European Commission, said: 'What EU negotiators have failed to appreciate is that such an action is beyond the powers vested in the European Union under the EU Treaty. Article 153 (5) of the treaty clearly states that EU legislative powers shall ‘not apply to pay’. 'Furthermore, even if the council’s powers were not challenged in this matter, financial institutions would remain free to increase base salaries to reward and retain key staff. He went on: 'What politicians and bureaucrats have always ignored is that high remuneration levels in the financial sector - and especially substantial variable payments - serve to minimise fraud levels, retain talent, drive high performance and encourage continuity of employment. That is why corruption is so rife in many states where senior banking staff are badly paid. 'Many EU states have long coveted the City of London’s success as an international financial centre and regarded high bonus payments as its Achilles heel. This measure is therefore no more than an attempt to exploit the current vulnerability of the City by riding on the back of the collective jealousy of bankers’ pay in public opinion and the recent downgrading of the UK’s international credit rating.' Disaster: The UK fears that the top talent working in the City will leave London for rivals like New York where bonuses would be higher . But Mr Karas said it was a bigger deal than just bank bonuses, including key measures long demanded to make loans to SMEs easier: “The new banking law is not only a piece of banking regulation, but a real economy financing act.' The negotiations on the package have been dragging on for 10 months. After a meeting last week broke down without a compromise, the European Parliament - which has insisted on adding the banker bonus legislation to the wider Basel III package - gave the EU governments an ultimatum until yesterday's negotiating session. Now the final approval by parliament and government leaders of the package is expected to be a formality, although it was not immediately clear what position Britain would take. But even if the UK would not back the package, the remaining EU members could still force the legislation through by adopting it by qualified majority. The key part of the package is requiring all banks to gradually increase their capital over the coming years to stabilise the financial sector across the European Union's member states, which together form the world's largest economy. The legislation is part of global efforts to prevent another shock to the financial system like that prompted by Lehman Brothers' 2008 collapse, when banks were highly leveraged while enjoying low capital requirements. The lack of solid financial cushions meant that many banks were vulnerable, and eventually required taxpayer-funded bailouts to avoid bankruptcy.","A payment worth twice an annual salary must be agreed by bank's board .

Long-time Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward says the Obama administration threatened him in an email by saying he would 'regret' questioning the White House on the origin of the sequestration cuts slated to go into effect Friday. The investigative journalist, who is famed for his work on the Watergate scandal, revealed details of his exchange with top economic aide Gene Sperling on CNN Wednesday and in an interview with Politico. He said the email from Sperling made him feel ‘very uncomfortable to have the White House telling reporters that ""you’re going to regret doing something.""’ Scroll down for videos . Words of war: Famed journalist Bob Woodward said Wednesday on CNN that he was threatened by a senior Obama aide following criticism over Obama's sequester plan . Concern: The Washington Post journalist spoke on Wolf Blitzer's 'The Situation Room' Wednesday; officials from the White House declined to appear on the show . The note from Sperling was in reaction to a column by Woodward that was published in the Washington Post last week. In his article, Mr Woodward – an associate editor at the paper – writes that the president’s decision to hold back on military deployments is ‘madness,’ and says the Obama administration was ‘wrong’ to blame the across-the-board cuts on Republicans alone. Woodward has previously written that the idea for the sequestration cuts originated with the White House and his assertion has been verified by several congressional officials. The White House has been emphasizing that Republicans were in agreement with President Obama when Congress approved the across-the-board cuts and Obama signed them into law. The White House also argues that President Obama - as well as Congress - never actually believed the cuts would go into effect, as they were merely a mechanism for forcing Congress' to deal with the budget deficit. Before publishing the weekend editorial, Mr Woodward had called Sperling to forewarn him about the piece. He told Politico that Sperling ‘yelled at me for about half an hour’ in a furious tirade. Sperling later sent Mr Woodward an email apologizing for his actions and his tone of voice over the phone. 'I do understand your problems with a couple of our statements in the fall — but feel on the other hand that you focus on a few specific trees that gives a very wrong perception of the forest,' Sperling wrote. 'But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here.' Woodward has accused White House top economic aide Gene Sperling (pictured) of making a 'veiled threat' Criticism: Mr Woodward attacked the president earlier Wednesday for drawing the nation's security into the budget debate . Duties: Mr Obama pictured Wednesday in Washington for the unveiling of a statue of American civil rights era icon Rosa Parks . According to Politico, this is the full email exchange between White House economic aide Gene Sperling and Bob Woodward. From Gene Sperling to Bob Woodward on Feb. 22, 2013:Bob:I apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today. My bad. I do understand your problems with a couple of our statements in the fall — but feel on the other hand that you focus on a few specific trees that gives a very wrong perception of the forest. But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here.But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying that Potus asking for revenues is moving the goal post. I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim. The idea that the sequester was to force both sides to go back to try at a big or grand bargain with a mix of entitlements and revenues (even if there were serious disagreements on composition) was part of the DNA of the thing from the start. It was an accepted part of the understanding — from the start. Really. It was assumed by the Rs on the Supercommittee that came right after: it was assumed in the November-December 2012 negotiations. There may have been big disagreements over rates and ratios — but that it was supposed to be replaced by entitlements and revenues of some form is not controversial. (Indeed, the discretionary savings amount from the Boehner-Obama negotiations were locked in in BCA: the sequester was just designed to force all back to table on entitlements and revenues.)I agree there are more than one side to our first disagreement, but again think this latter issue is different. Not out to argue and argue on this latter point. Just my sincere advice. Your call obviously.My apologies again for raising my voice on the call with you. Feel bad about that and truly apologize.GeneFrom Woodward to Sperling on Feb. 23, 2013:Gene: You do not ever have to apologize to me. You get wound up because you are making your points and you believe them. This is all part of a serious discussion. I for one welcome a little heat; there should more given the importance. I also welcome your personal advice. I am listening. I know you lived all this. My partial advantage is that I talked extensively with all involved. I am traveling and will try to reach you after 3 pm today. Best, Bob .

'You get wound up because you are making your points and . you believe them. This is all part of a serious discussion. I for one . welcome a little heat; there should more given the importance.

'The email from the aide was sent to apologize for voices being raised in their previous conversation,' a White House official told Reuters. 'The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate, nothing more.' Weighing in on the scuffle on Twitter Wednesday, former Obama adviser David Plouffe sniped that Woodward was past his prime as a reporter. 'Watching Woodward last 2 days is like imagining my idol Mike Schmidt facing live pitching again. Perfection gained once is rarely repeated,' Plouffe wrote. Neera Tanden, a former Obama campaign adviser, added via Twitter, 'My amateur advice: stop cooperating with Woodward in the first place.'

Looming: The series of severe budget cuts is scheduled to go into effect Friday; a sculpture called 'Grief and History' sits atop Peace Monument on the U.S. Capitol this week . Mr Woodward had attacked the president earlier Wednesday for drawing the nation’s security into the budget debate. ‘So we now have the president going . out (saying): “Because of this piece of paper and this agreement, I . can’t do what I need to do to protect the country.” 'That’s a kind of madness that I haven’t seen in a long time,’ he said on MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe.’ He also wrote in his column over . the weekend that the spending cuts were the original brainchild of the . White House - a point which Mr Obama originally denied, though the . administration later confirmed. The Pentagon had announced earlier this month that it was postponing the deployment of the USS Harry Truman to the Middle East because of funding issues. Likewise, Mr Obama said yesterday that maintenance work to the USS Abraham Lincoln had been delayed due to the budget crisis. The $85million sequester was mandated by Congress in conjunction with the White House as part of the August 2011 deal to avoid a government shutdown. The reductions are split between defense spending and domestic programs.

Carnival Cruise Lines year lurches from bad to worse with the news the FBI is investigating the mysterious death of an 18-year-old high school senior board a Caribbean voyage returning to New York. Seth Younes died on the last night of a Carnival Cruise in the early house of Tuesday morning . Initial reports have speculated that Seth Younes, from New York, died after becoming extremely drunk on the last night of the eight day cruise, although where and how he began drinking is not yet clear. A Carnival Cruise Lines spokesman confirmed that Younes died on board one of their vessels at around 3 a.m. on Tuesday but denied that he was served alcohol by any staff member of the embattled firm. In an emailed statement to The . Saratogian, Vance Gulliksen said the cause of Younes’ death has not yet . been determined, but 'with regard to speculation that he may have died . from alcohol poisoning, we can confirm that, based on the preliminary . investigation, there is no indication he was served any alcohol by . shipboard personnel.' The . New York City Medical Examiner's Office have said that the teens . autopsy had proved inconclusive and that further testing including . toxicology was required. And . the FBI have confirmed that they are investigating the tragic death to . determine whether a crime was committed and if so, by whom. Younes . was on the eight-day cruise with his family, which departed New York . February on 18th bound for the Bahamas and died in his cabin according . to Gullisken. An . individual posting on the Cruise Critic forum online claiming to be related to Younes has said that the boy was intoxicated prior to his . death. 'This 18 YO happens to be my husbands cousins child,' said the poster who uses the name TRESE online. It has been claimed the 18-year-old was away from his parents drinking and died in his cabin after falling asleep . 'The parents were asleep and figured their 18 YO son was fine being out of the room. He DID get very drunk...was brought back to his room, and had trouble breathing.' She added, 'The family is not blaming anyone for this tragedy.' 'All I know is security called the parents, told them their son was drunk and they needed to come get him. They took him to the infirmary and the nurse said there's two things they could do. 'Either leave him there and be charged or take him to your room and watch him. Either way, he will wake up tomorrow with a hangover. They chose to take him to the room. 'He fell asleep, snoring,,,,then suddenly had trouble breathing, gasping for air. Parents called the emergency number and started CPR. His step-dad is a Saratoga firefighter. 'He continued for 30 minutes, exhausted, it took that long for emergency personnel to show up. They started CPR as well and Seth never came back. The Saratoga teen (right) was popular among his classmates at Saratoga Springs High School . Seth Younes' classmates at Saratoga Springs High School spoke of their shock when told of his death on Wednesday . 'It truly is a tragedy and now his parents are making funeral arrangements for a kid who had a great future.' According to J. Peter Donald in the New York field . office of the FBI, the Bureau is investigating the death, but would not . comment on the cause of death. 'That is part of what we're investigating,' Donald told Cruise Critic. Classmates of Younes, were stunned to hear of the news. 'He was one of my good buddies, an outstanding person,' said classmate Craig Smith. 'If you were having a bad day and you were talking to Seth, he would make you laugh. His smile was contagious and there’s just not a bad thing to say about him.' Other students also recalled his friendly disposition. Bad Month: The Carnival Triumph was towed back to Louisiana by tugboats after its engines went down following a fire . 'Seth was one of the friendliest people I had the pleasure of meeting,' said Megan Stevens, a member of the class of 2012. 'Even if he didn’t know someone that well, he treated them like a friend regardless.' February has been a difficult month for Carnival Cruises. Earlier in the month the Carnival Triumph liner broke down in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,000 people on board. Passengers and crew had to endure terrible and unsanitary conditions as toilets began leaking and some were forced to use plastic bags to go to the bathroom. And in the days after the ill-fated Carnival cruise ship returned to Mobile, Alabama on February 14th, guests spoke of the gruesome ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets, mushy floors, food shortages and stomach-churning odors. Passengers described to relatives and the media via cellphone the conditions on board the Triumph where cabins had raw sewage running down the walls and interior passages sloshed with waste. Last resort: The urinals were covered up and trash cans lined with plastic bags for people to use for bathrooms on board the luxury liner . Squalor: Many of the passengers on board the Carnival Triumph immediately took pictures of the horrible conditions on board once they had charged smartphones and cameras . Luxury liner? Passengers set up makeshift beds on the decks of the Carnival Triumph to avoid the stench inside the ship . Passenger Kendall Jenkins, a 24-year-old self-employed property manager from Houston, Texas said conditions on board the ship were ‘like the Hunger Games' as guests looked out for themselves and hoarded food. Rian Tipton, a 29-year-old from Chicago who was on a bachelorette party with her girlfriends, told People that some passengers ignored the general rule imposed of defecating in a biohazard bag. She said: '[There] are people who just don't follow the rules, so they either go in their toilets or in the public restrooms. 'Toilets started to overflow and so were the trash cans! People were literally peeing and pooping in the trash cans. She added: 'The worst that I've heard is people going into the public bathrooms and seeing feces on the wall.' Ms Tipton was one of many passengers who described a gut-wrenching stench on parts of the ship and complained that toilets and drainpipes overflowed. Foul: Passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways . Grim: Passengers did their best in the condition on board by keeping waste outside the cabins but the smell was described as unbearable by those on board . 'The stench was awful,' said Robin Chandler, a 50-year-old from Dallas who spent her birthday on the ship. 'A lot of people were crying and freaking out.' Jacob Combs, an Austin, Texas-based sales executive with a healthcare and hospice company, praised the ship's crew. 'Just imagine the filth,' said Combs, 30. 'People were doing crazy things and going to the bathroom in sinks and showers. 'It was inhuman. The stewards would go in and clean it all up. They were constantly cleaning.' One woman who was on the arduous voyage told ABC: 'Our toilet just sort of exploded and we've been on the balcony ever since.' Some passengers said conditions deteriorated rapidly on the Triumph earlier in the week. One passenger Norma Reyes told reporters waiting on shore that the hallways were 'toxic'. There were reports of people getting sick and passengers being told to use red, plastic 'biohazard' bags as makeshift toilets. Passenger Tammy Garcia said: 'It wasn't a vacation anymore it was like survival mode. Eat what you can. 'Snack when you can. It was awful.'","Seth Younes, 18, died in the early hours of Tuesday morning as the Carnival cruise liner he was on prepared to dock in New York .

Facing jail: Rama Yade is accused of using false addresses to get on the electoral list to become a councillor and faces up to three years in prison . The youngest ever black Muslim woman to become a French cabinet minister was today facing jail for electoral fraud. Rama Yade, who is still only 36, was due to appear at Nanterre Correctional Court charged with a range of forgery offences. She became a hugely glamorous symbol of ethnic diversity when, barely out of her 20s in 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy made her Secretary of State for Human Rights. But today she was accused of using a business address and empty flat to get on to the electoral list to become a councillor at Colombes, the commuter town north west of Paris. Yade, who was born in Senegal, was actually brought up in a council flat in the impoverished suburb, but later moved out. According to the charge sheet, she offered the address of a commercial property to election organisers in December 2009, and then - in 2011 - falsely claimed to be living in a new apartment. There was an official investigation into her 'change of address' and the Electoral Commission found her new flat was actually an empty one. She now faces up to three years in prison and a fine equivalent to almost £40,000 for breaking electoral law and being ineligible for an election. Ms Yade also faces a further year in prison for making false official declarations. Rising political star: Rama Yade pictured with Nicolas Sarkozy and other women cabinet ministers in 2007 . Ms Yade insists that the first address was a legitimate one, and that the second flat was only empty because of 'water damage'. 'There was no intention to defraud,' said her lawyer, barrister Antonin Levy, who added that the charges were 'simply a way of exploiting justice' to prevent Ms Yade 'running in the municipal elections in 2014'. The initial prosecution against Ms Yade was initiated by Philip Sarre, the Socialist mayor of Colombes. He has always been a fierce opponent of the conservative Ms Yade, who was once a key ally of Mr Sarkozy. Accused: The former cabinet minister joined Prince Andrew for a Royal event at Windsor Castle in 2008 . Mr Sarkozy was frequently criticised for not doing enough for ethnic minorities, and was accused of championing young Muslim women like Ms Yade for cynical electoral purposes. She became Sports Minister for two years up until 2010, but ended up falling out with Mr Sarkozy. Last year she left his party, the UMP, and joined the Union of Democrats and Independents party of Jean-Louis Borloo, but failed to get elected as an MP. She is married to the Yiddish singer, Joseph Zimet, and is now working for a human resources firm in Paris.","Rama Yade is accused of using false addresses to get on the electoral list .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:25 EST, 21 February 2012 . Despite finding the treasure and spending more than $2million to recover it, a federal judge on ordered a deep sea salvage company to turn over $500 million worth of Spanish coins it recovered from a shipwreck to the Spanish government within a week. The Civil Guard said agents would leave within hours to take possession of the booty, worth an estimated $504 million, and two Spanish Hercules transport planes will bring it back. But it was not exactly clear when - Monday or Tuesday - the planes and the agents would leave Spain. Return to sender: $500m worth of Spanish 'pieces of eight' coins found in a shipwreck by a U.S. treasure-hunting company must now be returned to Spain, a US judge said . Retrieval mission: Spain is sending over C-130 Hercules planes like this one to retrieve the treasure, which is currently in an undisclosed location in Florida . The ruling by U.S. Magistrate Mark Pizzo ended a five-year legal battle between Odyssey Marine Exploration and Spain over the 594,000 gold and silver coins that were recovered from the wreck of the Spanish ship Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes in 2007 off the coast of Portugal. The ship was sunk by the British in an 1804 battle and Spain said it retained ownership of the ship and its cargo. A U.S. judge ruled in Spain's favour last year, and Odyssey Marine's appeals were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month. The coins have been held in a storage facility at an undisclosed location in Florida. Mr Pizzo said Odyssey Marine must provide an inventory of the coins to Spain by Tuesday and turn over custody of the coins by February 24. Spain will have to pay for the shipping costs. National treasure: Members of Spain civil guard stand next to the Ocean Alert, a ship belonging to the company Odyssey Marine Exploration in southern Spain in 2007 after the US company discovered the treasure . Defence: Maritime Lawyer James Goold represents Spain in the case against Florida treasure-hunting company Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc, and argued that the coins are a national treasure . The company will abide by the ruling, even though it 'flies in the face of all legal precedent,' Melinda MacConnel, vice president and general counsel of Odyssey Marine, told reporters after the hearing. Ms MacConnel said the ruling 'undermined' the jurisdiction of U.S. courts in naval affairs, and complained that Washington had influenced the case in Spain's favour. 'Clearly, the political influences in this case overshadowed the law,' she said. The ruling would also discourage other treasure hunters from reporting their finds, she added. 'The items will be hidden or even worse, melted down or sold on eBay,' she said. That certainly won't happen to this treasure hoard, said Guillermo Corral, the cultural counsellor at Spain's Embassy in Washington, noting that the coins and other artifacts were part of Spanish heritage. 'This is history,' he said. Spanish Navy Rear Admiral Javier Romero said the ship was a grave site for the Spanish sailors who lost their lives in the battle. Mark Gordon, Odyssey Marine's president, said the ruling would not affect current operations and business plans because all expenses of the project had already been passed through the company's prior profit and loss statements. Bygone era: The shipwreck from which Odyssey treasure hunters took 17 tonnes of coins was a Spanish warship which sunk during a battle with the British, Spain said . He said the company was planning for three shipwreck recoveries in 2012. 'The future of Odyssey Marine Explorations has never looked brighter,' Gordon said in a statement. The Spanish Culture Ministry said Monday the coins are classified as national heritage and as such must stay inside the country and will be displayed in one or more Spanish museums. It ruled out the idea of the treasure being sold to ease Spain's national debt. The Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was sunk by British warships off the coast of Portugal in 1804 while sailing back from South America with more than 200 people on board. Tales recount that the British exploded the ship and the Mercedes broke 'like an egg, dumping her yolk into the deep.' The attack - and loss of insurmountable treasure - caused Spain to declare war on Britain. Odyssey Marine Exploration claimed to have discovered the vessel and recovered more than 500,000 silver and gold coins as well as other artifacts. Besides its debt woes, Spain is saddled with a nearly dormant economy and a 23 percent jobless rate. Odyssey made an international splash in 2007 when it recovered the 594,000 coins and other artifacts from the Atlantic Ocean near the Straits of Gilbraltar. At the time, experts said the coins could be worth as much as $500 million to collectors, which would have made it the richest shipwreck treasure in history. The company said in earnings statements that it has spent $2.6 million salvaging, transporting, storing and conserving the treasure. Odyssey fought Spain's claim to the treasure, arguing that the wreck was never positively identified as the Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes. And if it was that vessel, then the ship was on a commercial trade trip - not a sovereign mission - at the time it sank, meaning Spain would have no firm claim to the cargo, Odyssey argued. International treaties generally hold that warships sunk in battle are protected from treasure seekers. At the time, experts said the coins could be worth as much as $500 million to collectors, which would have made it the richest shipwreck treasure in history. The Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes was sunk by British warships in the Atlantic while sailing back from South America with more than 200 people on board.","Odyssey Marine Exploration discovered vast fortune of Spanish 'pieces of eight' off the coast of Portugal in 2007 from 1804 shipwreck .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:29 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 28 February 2013 . George Osborne held a lengthy meeting with Tory MPs ahead of the Budget on March 20 . George Osborne is coming under pressure from Tory MPs to cut fuel, food and energy bills to help ease the cost of living for voters. The Chancellor last night faced calls to do more to cut taxes and go further in removing red-tape for business in next month’s Budget. Conservative MPs have grown increasingly anxious about the voter reaction to the state of the economy, and the impact on household budgets. Days after the British economy lost its coveted AAA rating, Mr Osborne is understood to have made clear to a meeting of Tory MPs that the pace of spending cuts would not be eased. But he faced a string of calls to announce tax cuts on March 20 to boost growth, including reductions in duty on alcohol, petrol and air flights. Efforts by ministers to act to reduce living costs have suffered a major blow after more than 40 per cent of town halls refused to bow to pressure from Whitehall to freeze council tax. Local government minister Brandon Lewis declared this week: ‘All councils have a moral duty to freeze council tax at a time when the standard and cost of living for our hard-working residents are tough.’ But figures compiled by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy show two in five councils will shun Communities Secretary Eric Pickles’ offer of the cash equivalent of a 1 per cent rise in grants return for keeping their rates to local taxpayers the same. Mr Osborne also needs to avoid a repeat of last year’s omnishambles Budget, when planned tax rises on pasties, caravans and giving to charity sparked a huge backlash and forced a string of u-turns. At last night’s meeting of around 50 Tory MPs he was presented with a raft of demands for tax cuts. Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow, was . among three MPs who stepped up calls for action to reduce fuel duty, . including acing the rise planned for this September. Dozens . of Tory MPs have backed a motion criticising the beer duty escalator . which will rise by two per cent above inflation. Tax on booze has risen . by 42 per cent since 2008, sparking warnings that it is leading to the . closure of pubs across the country. Winchester . MP Steve Brine put forward the idea of introducing regional air . passenger duty, making it cheaper to fly from airports outside London. He believes the plan could provide a boost to regional economies, without significantly harming the capital. Using 2005 as a baseline, the Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation has risen markedly, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics . Living costs: Tory MPs are demanding cuts to tax on beer and fuel to ease pressure on family budgets . One Tory MP said today: ‘We need to focus on where we can make a difference to people’s lives. Although George has cut red tape and pushed regulation back he has not gone far enough. It is business which will take us out of recession.’ David Cameron yesterday declared the deficit must be cut ‘further and faster’ to get the economy back on track and regain Britain’s AAA credit rating. He fended off criticism over the loss of AAA status, signalling he wants deeper cuts to get the public finances back on track. During Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron told Ed Miliband: ‘This credit rating does matter. It demonstrates that we have to go further and faster on reducing the deficit.’ His intervention appeared to signal a change of approach by the Coalition, but Downing Street said afterwards that the Prime Minister was not announcing a change of policy. Asked to explain ‘further and faster’, a No.10 spokesman said: ‘The PM was referring to the Government’s policy as is. He was not making a new statement. ‘The autumn statement of 2012 extended the period of fiscal consolidation, taking it further. The deficit is to fall by £1.5billion. Next year it is forecast to fall by £8billion, a faster fall. In 2016-17 it will fall by £25billion.’","Chancellor to deliver Budget on March 20, amid calls for more to ease pressure on family budgets .

Winner: Melissa Ignasiak Smith, pictured, says she was 'harassed and treated poorly' by a battalion chief and other male firefighters at New Smyrna Beach Fire Department . A 35-year-old ex-firefighter has been awarded $440,000 after a jury found she was bullied and then sacked from a Florida fire station because she was a woman. Melissa Ignasiak Smith says she was 'harassed and treated poorly' by a battalion chief and other male firefighters at New Smyrna Beach Fire Department who told her 'women should not be in the fire service.' When she complained, she was fired, she says. After five days of testimony, a seven-woman, one-man Orlando jury took just two hours to decide that the mother-of-one suffered sexual harassment at the hands of lieutenants and chiefs within the Fire Department and was let go because she spoke out. 'There are no words to describe the vindication I feel,' Smith told The Daytona Beach News-Journal. Smith's attorney William Amlong said the verdict 'was one more message from one more jury that fire and police departments can't act this way.' Smith will get $444,000 in back wages and emotional distress damages and is also entitled to her job back or front pay, Amlong said. Lawyers for the city of New Smyrna Beach said they will appeal the decision. Smith, who now works as an emergency room nurse at Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach, said she tried for years to fix the discrimination within the department but city officials ignored her. 'I took it all the way up to (then City Manager John Hagood) and pleaded with them to fix it,' she told the newspaper. 'I tried and tried to fix this while working there.' Vindicated: 'There are no words to describe the vindication I feel,' Smith said of her payout . Harassment: Smith, pictured left with her husband, and right, says she was harassed and treated poorly by staff because she was a woman . She said she also kept fighting to set a good example for her daughter. 'I also did this so my daughter can see there is still some positive out there and if you dig down deep enough and continue to fight, people will be held liable for the laws they violate,' she said. The woman filed the lawsuit against the city in July 2011 after the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission threw out her complaint, stating that it failed to see any evidence of unfair dismissal based on gender.

According to the News-Journal, the city responded to the EEOC with a list of complaints about Smith.

A police officer's wife is one of two women arrested in connection with a Florida prostitution . ring. Denise McCoy, 34, whose husband is a Boca Raton police officer, was charged along with Sara Marin, 42, in a prostitution and money-laundering scheme. McCoy owned a business called Sara’s Entertainment Service and the two women were allegedly earning a living through their own sexual activity with men and the . earnings of at least six of their hired escorts. Charged: Denise McCoy, 34, left, whose husband is a Boca Raton police officer, was charged along with Sara Marin, 42, in a prostitution and money-laundering scheme . According to the affidavit the prostitutes collected $200 per hour plus tips, and split the cash evenly with McCoy and Marin. The pair were arrested after a Brazilian woman helped police unearth the prostitution ring. The woman had been caught on immigration charges and told police she had been forced . to work as a prostitute in the Boca Raton area for the past nine . months, reported the Palm Beach Post. A police probable-cause affidavit said she had arrived from Brazil in August 2011 and met with a woman . she knew as only 'Sara.' She was allegedly told by Marin - who is also originally from Brazil - that she owned an escort agency. She was told that she was not required to have sexual intercourse with the . men she escorted and she started to work with them. No link: McCoy¿s husband of six years Samuel was suspended in 2009, the Sun-Sentinel reported, for looking at pornography on his work computer (file photo) Initially this seemed to be correct as she attended several lunch and dinner dates where there was no sex expected. But then McCoy allegedly drove her to an apartment in Boca Raton to meet a man who expected sex, reported the Sun Sentinel. When the woman  refused and called McCoy, she was threatened that McCoy would have her jailed as an illegal immigrant if she did not comply. Police say the prostitutes were forced to have sex with as many as twelve men per day at the two apartments in suburban Boca Raton. After a 5-month investigation, search warrants were executed Tuesday. They were served at two apartments rented by Sara’s Entertainment that officers suspected were used for prostitution. Denise McCoy and Marin were jailed later that day on pimping and money laundering charges, and remained in the Palm Beach County Jail without bail late yesterday. McCoy’s husband of six years, city police officer Samuel McCoy, was not arrested in the investigation and is not a subject of it at this time, said John Vecchio, violent crimes supervisor for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement’s Miami regional center. McCoy was suspended in 2009, the Sun-Sentinel reported, for looking at pornography on his work computer. He said he was looking for jujitsu videos online and clicked on other links that interested him. That same year he was caught taking pictures of his genital area while on duty, but said it was medical reasons. Boca Police Chief Dan Alexander said Wednesday that Samuel McCoy has been put on paid administrative leave. 'It's very early [in the investigation],' Mr Alexander said to the Sun Sentinel. The mayor of Boca Raton says no one has indicated that officer McCoy was involved in the alleged prostitution ring, reported WPTV.com. 'The investigation will prove whatever it proves and if he had absolutely nothing to do with this then he's a fine person and he will continue,' said mayor Susan Whelchel.","Denise McCoy's 34, husband is a Boca Raton police officer .

Critic: Speaker of the House Joe Boehner has been a regular adversary of the president and vice-president . It was taken on January 10 by his official photographer David Lienemann. The photograph follows the release of a new official portrait of president Barack Obama and the first lady, Michelle. Mr Biden, who is dubbed Diamond Joe and is considered one of the party's most effective draws for swing voters, has shown few signs of aging since his 2009 portrait. Mr Obama on the other hand has many more grey hairs, although his grin was much wider than when he posed for his first portrait.

"Failed to pay fines and said they would rather go to jail . Part of a conservative breakaway group known as Swartzentruber who live with no electricity or plumbing . By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 04:28 EST, 13 January 2012 . A group of Amish men were sent to jail today for refusing to pay fines for breaking a state highway law that requires their horse-drawn buggies to be marked with orange reflective triangles. The men, from western Kentucky, have a religious objection to the bright orange signs, which they say are flashy and conflict with their pledge to live low-key and religious lives. Ananias Byler, the first of ten Amish men due in Graves County District Court on Thursday, was sentenced to ten days in jail. Violation: Graves County deputy Zach Dunigan, right, escorts Ananias Byler to the Graves County Jail after he appeared in District Court today . Jail time: These Amish men were arrested for . refusing to put go-slow triangular safety signs on their buggies, . despite a Kentucky state law that requires all slow-moving vehicles to . display the orange badges . Refusal: The men are going to jail for not putting orange reflective stickers on their Amish buggies and refusing to pay fines for not doing so . The men were jailed for being found in contempt of court for refusing to pay the fines. Byler told Judge Deborah Crooks on Thursday that he would not pay the $489 he owes. 'I totally understand your objection,' the judge told Byler. 'But you're in violation, and it's not up to me to change the law. It doesn't really matter what I think about any of this.' The men belong to a conservative breakaway group of Amish known as Swartzentruber. They live simply, with no electricity, plumbing or appliances. But in recent years they have been running afoul of the law for refusing to use the triangles on their buggies, and some were sent to jail last year. Not all Amish groups refuse to use the reflective signs on their carts. But the Swartzentruber community is refusing to put its trust in man-made symbols for their safety. 'I don’t think it’s right to put somebody in jail for practising their religious beliefs,’ said Amish father-of-seven Levi Zook. 'But that’s what we’ll do if that’s what it takes to abide by the Biblical laws.' The men did win one battle during their time in jail - being given sombre blue prison uniforms instead of the regulation bright orange jumpsuits. The Amish men, wearing long dark coats on a snowy day in Mayfield, removed their black wide-brimmed hats before entering the courtroom. They sat quietly until their names were called. Detained: Deputy Zach Dunigan, left, stands outside the Graves County Jail with brothers Jacob Gingerich, centre, and Ben Gingerich, right, today . In court: Amish member Nevin Byler stands in front of Graves County District Judge Deborah Crooks before she sent him to jail . Proper order: The men said the bright orange signs which they hang on the back of their buggies are too flashy and contradict with their simple, religious lives . Jacob Gingerich said he and the other men will continue to refuse to pay the fines. Gingerich owed the most, $627, and was sentenced to 13 days in jail on Thursday. 'We're just not going to pay,' Gingerich, a farmer with 12 children, said before the court appearance. Police and prosecutors say the orange triangles help motorists see the buggies and avoid collisions. 'You get behind one of the buggies at night, you can't see it,' Graves County Sheriff DeWayne Redmon said. 'We're citing them for their own safety as well as the safety of others.' Gingerich and two other Amish men, with help from the Kentucky chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, have sued over the state highway law, saying it infringes on their religious freedom. The Kentucky Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case later this year after the state appeals court rejected the Amish men's argument in June. Gingerich said today that he wished the judge would have waited for the state Supreme Court to hear the case before throwing the men in jail. In court earlier this year: Five of the Amish men also ccused of aggravated burglary and kidnapping . Kentucky lawmakers are considering changes to the highway law to allow the Amish to use gray reflective tape instead of the orange triangles. Of Kentucky's 120 counties, Graves County has recorded the most violations for failure to use the orange triangles in the last five years. The county has recorded 57 of a total of 89 violations statewide since 2007. The Amish community has been increasingly thrust into the spotlight in recent months after a spate of beard-cutting attacks took place around Ohio throughout the end of last year, which resulted in the arrest of a number of men from the Bergholz Clan.","Failed to pay fines and said they would rather go to jail .

NFL teams want to know if college star Manti Te'o is gay, with his sexual orientation being described as the 'elephant in the room' among professional franchises interested in signing him. The Notre Dame linebacker has been the laughing stock of the sport since it was revealed he was duped into having an online relationship with a non-existent girlfriend. But questions marks remain over whether the 22-year-old is homosexual and NFL teams considering signing the rising star in the Draft are said to want answers. 'Elephant in the room': NFL teams interested in signing Manti Te'o want to know if he is homosexual . Mike Florio, editor of Profootballtalk.com, told The Dan Patrick Show on Monday that Te'o's sexuality should not matter, but added that the NFL was a 'unique industry'. He added: 'Teams want to know whether Manti Te’o is gay. They just want to know. They want to know because in an NFL locker room, it’s a different world. It shouldn’t be that way. 'It’s been described to me as the proverbial elephant in the room and I don't think anyone knows how to solve this dilemma yet. It’s just that they want to know what they’re getting. They want to know what issues they may be dealing with down the road.' He also explained how the man who played the girlfriend hoax on Te'o, Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, has come out as gay and said it 'raises a lot of questions' that the NFL will eventually have to deal with. Question marks: Mike Florio it should not matter if Te'o is gay but added that the NFL is a 'unique industry' Mr Florio added: 'I'm not saying anyone would take Manti Te’o off the board if they suspected he's gay or know he's gay.

Do you like girls?' 'Those kinds of things, and you know it was just kind of weird. But they would ask you with a straight face, and it’s a pretty weird experience altogether.' Homophobia has come to the fore in football following comments by San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver before this year's Super Bowl. He said days before the game that he did not 'do gay guys' and 'we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do'.

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:15 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:22 EST, 28 February 2013 . A grandfather who frogmarched an 11-year old boy home after his house was pelted with stones has been convicted of assault and ordered to pay the child compensation. David Crompton, 62, snapped and grabbed hold of the youngster and took him to his mother and father claiming he wanted them to discipline him. But soon afterwards he found himself under arrest and in court after the boy's family complained to police. It emerged during the court case that while banging on the door of the child's home he 'accidentally' pushed the youngster's face into the door handle. Had enough: David Crompton, 62, has admitted assault of a boy, 11, and says he is selling up because of anti-social behaviour aimed at his home . At Blackburn magistrates court in Lancashire, Crompton, a joiner with no criminal record, pleaded guilty to assault had to pay the boy £50 compensation as well as £215 costs. He was also given a conditional discharge for 12 months. But after the case the joiner said the process of going to court had been 'awful' and he had put his home up for sale as a result. 'It's absolutely ludicrous that I have had to pay £50 compensation. I only went out to prevent my windows being smashed,' he said. 'In my day, the parents would have had a strong word with the child if something like this would have gone on. As a child I would have never of dared to do something like this, but it is obviously a sign of the times. 'Maybe I shouldn't have grabbed hold of his collar but my only intention was to take him to his parents.' Snapped: Crompton was upset after his house was damaged by stones so dragged a boy outside to his parents' home, who called the police . Crompton said the area had been plagued with juvenile nuisance, with youths throwing stones at properties and running along the roofs. He added: 'It has been awful. I've had to put my house up for sale they have literally forced me out. It has been really intimidating. 'Everyone I have spoken to cannot believe it ended up in court, never mind that I have had to pay £265.' No regrets: Mr Crompton said that all he was doing was going out to protect his home and that what happened since was 'ludicrous' The court heard the boy and his friends were playing in the street when Crompton angrily came out of his home and grabbed a girl who started crying. He then grabbed the boy, although he had no evidence they were involved with any stone throwing. The prosecutor said the defendant was angry and he accidentally banged the boy's face into the door. But Graham Parkinson, defending, told the hearing: 'I have seen photographs of damage caused to his property and it was not a very pleasant situation.' Mr Parkinson said Crompton believed the boy was involved and when he went out his sole intention was to take him and the girl to their home addresses and ask their parent to do something about the situation. 'He intended to have a reasonable discussion about the situation but the response of the boy's parents was not good and an argument ensued,' said Mr Parkinson. The family of the schoolboy involved said their son had been an innocent party who was caught in the crossfire. The 11-year-old boy's father said: 'My son had was really intimidated and was left with a bruise under his eye after this man lost his temper. He has almost become too scared to come out. 'If my son does something wrong he gets told off. This man needed to answer for what he did. The fact he barely got a slap of the wrist is a joke.' Darwen MP Jake Berry said: 'I think it is important everyone has the right to defend their own property using reasonable force. It seems disproportionate that Mr Crompton has had to go through this ordeal when he was simply defending his home.'","David Crompton, 62, convicted of assault after the incident in Lancashire .

Surging forward in desperation after weeks without food or water, these forlorn, whimpering dogs were left to die in filth by gangsters cashing in on the celebrity craze for ‘handbag-size’ dogs. In another haunting photograph taken minutes after a raid on an illicit breeding den, the pleading eyes of a bulldog whose neck narrowly fits through the wire struts of his cage tell a harrowing story of cruelty and neglect. The malnourished pedigree dogs were unwanted breeding stock for an underground industry netting millions of pounds a year for criminal gangs — until their rescue by one remarkable British woman. Left to die: Whimpering dogs that have been used to breed puppies. They were left without food or water when their gangster owner abandoned them in their filthy illicit den . Elizabeth Oliver, 70, last year awarded an MBE, has spent 20 years battling against their inhumane treatment by Japanese breeders, and the authorities who turn a blind eye. Mrs Oliver, director of Animal Rescue Kansai, is bravely taking on a complex network overseen by the notorious Yakuza mafia, who have found breeding dogs even more profitable than drugs and prostitution. The ruthless gangs snatch cute puppies off their mothers from as early as one week old so they can be displayed in gaudy pet shops, where small dogs with painted nails are the must-have fashion accessory — a Western trend popularised by celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Adele, Donatella Versace and model Miranda Kerr. ‘The dogs are left to breed among themselves in tiny apartments,’ says Mrs Oliver, originally from Somerset. ‘Then, one day, the breeders realise they have too many — and that they’re too big to sell — and just go. A lot of gangsters will be arrested for an unrelated crime and the dogs get left behind. Sometimes these places are so filthy you can’t step inside. Caged: A bulldog tries to escape through a gap in the wire and a Shiba Inu awaits his fate on death row . Behind bars: Another casualty of the craze for tiny dogs . ‘I’ve been chasing one breeder for . years. When we went to his premises on the southern island of Kyushu, we . found dead and dying dogs everywhere. It was absolutely appalling. ‘There were hundreds of dogs crammed into tiny cages. They were underweight, with terrible skin conditions. The breeder had just left them and locked the door behind him. ‘For these gangsters dog breeding has become very lucrative. They were into drugs, guns and prostitutes, but now they are all into dog breeding. ‘One of them tried to attack me; I had to run for my life. He was prosecuted eventually, and he was banned from breeding. The penalty was a fine of about £2,000, not a proper penalty. ‘He is still breeding now. People had been complaining, but the authorities did absolutely nothing.’ Even when the authorities are persuaded to intervene, the freed dogs face a terrible fate, sent to a mechanised death row where they are allowed one week’s grace for a new owner to emerge. After that, they are gassed in a steel container called a ‘dream box’. A Daily Mail investigation has uncovered new details of what is effectively a state-sanctioned policy of extermination. At the ‘animal welfare’ centre in Tokushima, recently built for £16 million, death-row dogs are placed into a special truck to be gassed off site before being cremated. The impressive building is set in landscaped parkland with a playground and picnic tables on the front lawn. It does a remarkable job of disguising its true purpose. Our saviour: Brave Elizabeth Oliver . On the day our reporter received a . tour, some of the native Japanese Shiba Inu dogs had two days left . before the metal bars to the rear of their cages would slide up to . announce the end of their lives. Seeming . to have a tantalising glimpse of freedom, the animals will then walk . unknowingly into a narrow steel corridor in which a separate metal plate . nudges them forward. At . the touch of a button, they are forced to step into a container called a . dream box, which will soon be filled with noxious carbon dioxide. The box, on which the soothing Japanese word for ‘sleep’ has been written, is lowered into a waiting truck. Once the lorry has moved calmly off the premises, the gassing begins, activated by a vet at a control desk. It takes approximately two minutes for the animals to die and then be driven off for cremation. Up to 20 are killed here every working day. Fashion follower: Singer Adele with her little friend and Miranda Kerr with a puppy in a bag . As Mrs Oliver says, ‘Outside it’s like a Disneyland; inside it’s like Auschwitz. They have spent millions coming up with a system so they can press a button to gas the dogs, and no one knows where it is taking place.’ When Mrs Oliver arrived in Japan 40 years ago, she was shocked by how little her adopted country cares for stray and unwanted animals. ‘The tiny, chic dogs are flavour of the month,’ she says. ‘It has been a boom over the past ten to 15 years. They are all trying to breed the smallest one, the kind of dogs you can fit in a tea cup like Chihuahuas. ‘A lot of them are being bred for unusual colours or markings, too. What are essentially genetic defects are considered desirable. People like that, and they don’t think they will have big problems with that dog when they buy it; they just think: “Oh, that’s cute, it matches my bag.” ‘These puppies are shampooed, they are blow-dried and they have their nails painted. But their feet don’t touch the ground, so they have no muscles. They can barely walk.’ Mrs Oliver’s current favourite among the 180 animals at her sprawling sanctuary for rescued dogs is a three-legged stray nicknamed Wireless. He got his moniker after being found with a wire noose embedded in his leg. Vets at the sanctuary had to amputate the limb. Just one more victim of this sickeningly cruel trade.","Gangs snatch puppies off their mothers from as early as one week old .

A businesswoman who was distraught at the death of her son was defrauded out of thousands of pounds by a close friend. Marion Kyte turned to her 'trusted friend' Claire Phillips to run her beauty salon after her ex-soldier son Gavin was found hanged at the family home. But just a week after Phillips was seen weeping at the young man's funeral, she had started to steal money from the grieving mother and even hid her post in an attempt to cover up the fraud. Betrayal: Marion Kyte, left, was defrauded of £3,000 by her friend Claire Phillips, right . Heartbreak: The deception came just weeks after the death of Mrs Kyte's son Gavin, right . 'What she did to me was the cruellest thing ever,' Mrs Kyte, 58, told Mold Crown Court last week. 'When Gavin died my whole life exploded and the world that I knew disintegrated - the grief is incomprehensible. Claire supported me after Gavin's death and she came to his funeral and cried. 'Three weeks after Gavin died and just a week after she had been at my son's funeral and cried, she started the deceit.' Mrs Kyte, owner of the Face It salon in Mold, North Wales, had known Phillips, 39, for a decade and employed her at her business. When she decided to give up the shop after her son's death at the age of 33 in November 2011, she agreed to entrust it to Phillips. They agreed that the younger woman would take over on an informal basis, and would pay Mrs Kyte £70,000 over four years in return for ownership of the business. Property: The businesswoman entrusted her successful beauty salon, pictured, to Phillips in November 2011 . But Phillips immediately started taking advantage of her friend, the court heard, and used Mrs Kyte's credit card to pay for £3,000 worth of expenses for the salon with which she was no longer involved. When the bereaved mother paid £6,000 in rent for the property, Phillips' cheque to repay her bounced. Mrs Kyte's bank statements and other pieces of mail had been hidden behind a toilet in order to avoid her discovering the fraud. The defendant initially denied cheating her friend, but later changed her plea to guilty and was convicted of three charges of fraud and one of theft. She was given a 12-month community order, told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work and electronically tagged for three months. Phillips must also give her former boss £3,335 compensation, which will take her more than four years to pay off at £15 a week. Agony: Mrs Kyte said that her son's death was 'the worst time of my life' and the fraud made it even worse . Mrs Kyte, a grandmother, said that the betrayal had deeply wounded her. 'As a friend I gave her the most amazing deal to take over a hugely successful business,' she said. 'She had a young family and she could make a great business for herself and have the rewards from it. But when Gavin died she thought about what she would do and targeted me from then on. 'I had done so much to help Claire but right from the word go I was the target. She deceived me at my most vulnerable.' The court heard that Mrs Kyte and her husband Neil, a retired police inspector, found Gavin hanged at their home in the village of Pentrecelyn. An inquest later recorded an open verdict on his death after a coroner said he could not be sure the father of three intended to take his own life. 'It was the worst time of my life,' Mrs Kyte said. 'I wanted to die myself. It was terrible. He was my son and I loved him so much. 'He was my world, everything that I knew was safe just exploded.'","Marion Kyte entrusted her beauty salon in North Wales to Claire Phillips .

Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott, is alleged to have 'gone on' about wanting a bigger house . A man accused of killing six of his children in a house fire frequently spoke about wanting a bigger house, a court has heard. It was also claimed Mick Philpott, his wife, Mairead, and friend Paul Mosley also took part in a 'rehearsal' of the fatal blaze weeks before tragedy struck. They are alleged to have acted out how they would save the youngsters from the property once the fire took hold. All three are accused of the manslaughter of the six children in the fire that engulfed the Philpott family home in Victory Road, Allenton in Derby, in the early hours of May 11 last year. Giving evidence to their trial at Nottingham Crown Court, Melissa John, the girlfriend of Mosley’s nephew, said he told her after he had been arrested and bailed by police in connection with the fire that the three of them had practised the fire. She told the court: 'He said ""What if I was to tell you that we actually rehearsed this six weeks ago?""' Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked her what the plan had been once the fire had started, and Ms John said: 'Mick and Mairead were to be inside the house and Paul was to kick in the back door.' Mr Latham asked her: 'What were Mick and Mairead to do?' She answered: 'Run out on to the front and scream for help.' 'What was Paul to do?' Mr Latham asked. 'To save the children from the back bedroom,' Ms John replied. The jury of five women and seven men was told that Mosley said Philpott had been 'going on about wanting a bigger house'. Deadly blaze: Philpott surrounded by the six children whose lives were claimed by the fatal house fire last May . The court also heard Mrs Philpott, 31, . had written in a suicide note that 'next time she will take the . children with her', and part of the plan had been for her to take the . blame for the fire. Ms John also told jurors that while . talking to Mosley round the kitchen table at her home she asked about . the children's parents. 'I was asking him if he thought Mick . and Mairead were actually capable of doing it and he said ""I don’t know . but if they did it's something that's gone wrong"".' Mosley, 46, was arrested in June last . year and released on police bail. He was rearrested and charged in . connection with the children’s deaths in November. Jade, 10, and her brothers John, nine, . Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13, all perished . after the fire engulfed their home as they slept in their beds. All three defendants have denied the charges. Ms John told jurors that Mosley was 'bragging' to a number of people about being on bail for murder. The court heard that he told women on internet dating sites as well as an employee at the job centre and a taxi driver. Scene: Flowers are left outside the house where the children died in the fire . Ms John agreed with Ben Nolan QC, . representing Mosley, when he asked her if Mosley was an 'attention . seeker' and a 'fantasist' who used to exaggerate in order to 'big . himself up'. Jurors heard that, before he was . charged over the deaths, he had told Ms John he was going to sell his . story to the newspapers and had been offered 'millions' by a Chinese . publication. Mosley liked others to think he knew things they did not and would pull a 'mysterious' face at such times, Mr Nolan said. Ms John agreed that she often did not . believe what Mosley told her but when he told her about the 'rehearsal' of the fire, his demeanour changed and she believed him. 'Paul’s body language had changed from . a smug sort of body language to nervous, which is different to how I . had seen him before.' Covert recordings of conversations caught in a bugged hotel room between Mick and Mairead Philpott were played to the court and revealed them discussing what they told officers in the days after the blaze. They were heard talking in the room that was being monitored 24 hours a day by Serious and Organised Crime detectives, and officers also caught on tape sexual activity between them and Mosley. On May 16, five days following the fire and after 31-year-old Mrs Philpott’s witness evidence to police, Philpott, 56, asks his wife: ‘What did you say about me trying to get in?’ Mrs Philpott is heard to answer: ‘You tried everything you could to get in, like I said to them, I wanted to run through the flames up the stairs.’ Philpott asked: ‘Was you crying when you said it? How bad?’ She replies: ‘Not really, really bad, but I was crying.’ Mosley visited the couple in their Premier Inn room and parts of recordings were played to jurors that prosecutors said showed sexual activity between the three. On one occasion, on May 19, Philpott . refers to his wife performing a sex act on Mosley, which prosecutor . Richard Latham QC said in his opening to the court was done to keep . Mosley on side. 'I’m proud of you' // 'Hmm?' // 'I’m proud of you because you didn’t want to do it, I’m proud of you because you lied to me' // When?' // 'Well, you said you wanted to do it and you didn’t' Dialogue between Philpott couple after sex act during which all three defendants appeared to be in the same room . Philpott asks her what is wrong, to which she replies ‘nothing’. ‘Did he try to touch you?’ he asks. ‘He tried to cuddle me,’ she replies. ‘And what did you do?’, he asks. ‘I pulled away from him,’ she says. ‘Why?’ Philpott asks. ‘It just didn’t feel right,’ she says. ‘Why? He did it in front of me,’ he says. Mrs Philpott replies: ‘I know, it just didn’t feel right.’ Philpott answers: ‘So what’s the problem?’ Audio of a sex act in which all three defendants appeared to be in the same room was played to the jury, and afterwards Philpott is heard to say to his wife: ‘I’m proud of you.’ ‘Hmm?’ she replies. He says: ‘I’m proud of you because you didn’t want to do it, I’m proud of you because you lied to me.’ ‘When?’ she asks. ‘Well, you said you wanted to do it and you didn’t,’ he replies. All three defendants have denied six counts of manslaughter in relation to each of the children.In another recording on the evening of May 19, Philpott and Mosley, who is nicknamed Shakey, were heard talking. Philpott said to Mosley: ‘We all think it’s - and the police do too - we think it’s an accident.’ ‘Gone wrong?’ Mosley asked. ‘Yeah,’ Philpott replied. Mosley asked: ‘Something to scare you?’ Philpott answered: ‘Yeah and that’s unfortunate, it’s gone terribly, terribly wrong. Terribly wrong for us two.’ Philpott is heard on recordings telling people he suspected the room was being bugged by police and tells visitors he and his wife were starting to feel like suspects. Shortly after talking to police about events on the night of the fire, Philpott is heard asking his wife: ‘Are you going to be able to cope with this now? I’ll tell you something, you know. ‘I was expecting yesterday that you were going to stray.’ She replied: ‘I bet that was you thinking exactly the same as I was thinking when you were in there doing yours.’ Philpott answered: ‘I was tempted. Was you?’ She replied: 'Yeah.’ On May 20, Philpott is heard saying he was replaying the fire in his head. ‘I keep living it over and over and over again. ‘Why couldn’t I get in the bedrooms? Why couldn’t I get my kids out? Why did the fire spread so ******* quick?’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Paul Mosley 'said Philpott had been going on about wanting bigger house'

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 13:38 EST, 27 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:39 EST, 27 February 2013 . Male nurse Neil Riley, 54, was found dead at his home in Great Harwood, Blackburn . A dedicated male nurse at one Britain's most prestigious Catholic boarding schools hanged himself after he was accused of being a closet peeping tom, an inquest heard today. Neil Riley, 54, had been arrested on suspicion of voyeurism after claims he set up hidden cameras in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues. Staff at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where boarding school fees cost up to £28,443 per year, called police after it was believed four women had been secretly filmed. Mr Riley - described as 'one of the good guys' by friends - was later questioned and released on bail. But five days later his naked body was found hanging from a wardrobe next to his police bail papers at his home in Great Harwood, Blackburn. An inquest was told he had taken his own life for fear of losing his job at the school where he had worked for the past eight years. Police said there was 'a high probability' he would have been charged with voyeurism offences. Father of two Mr Riley, who raised money for BBCs Children in Need appeal, joined Stonyhurst as a nurse in 2005 after working at various hospitals. He was involved in the college's combined cadet force, where he was promoted to captain. He split from his teacher wife, Yvonne, in March last year but was arrested the following November after concerns were raised by college staff. Officers seized a computer from Mr Riley's home to check for any files which may contain film footage of the college and confiscated cameras which are feared to have been used to film the unwitting women getting undressed in a bedroom. Mrs Riley told the hearing in Blackburn: 'He didn't talk about the police arrest and I didn't know about it. I think if he thought he was going to lose his job that would affect him and his work was very, very important to him. It would have affected him.' Allegations: Mr Riley's death came just five days after he was arrested over claims he set up a hidden camera in a bedroom to spy on female colleagues at the £28,000-a-year Stonyhurst College . Investigation: A police investigation was launched at Stonyhurst College after staff reported concerns about Mr Riley's behaviour . She said that despite their split in March last year they had maintained a friendship and was in regular contact with him, even helping him to move house. She told the inquest: 'He was a very dedicated nurse who cared for a lot of people throughout his life. He was very good at his job and people respected him for the kindness and caring he showed towards them. 'Neil could be quite closed at times and tended to ignore things he did not want to see, he was quite closed. I didn't get the impression he was depressed or down. Mr Riley joined Stonyhurst as a nurse and was involved in the college's combined cadet force . 'The signs certainly were that when he moved into the house he invited friends for meals and got in touch with others for Christmas and my son had been to visit.' She said that he had been a keen bird watcher who had had an allotment growing his own vegetables also liked to make chillies and chutneys. 'He was a good artist, he had a lot of friends and was a happy man. He had trials and tribulations like anyone else would. 'I spoke to him three weeks before he died because my daughter had an appointment at the hospital and he came to meet us. I don't understand why he did what he did, there were no signs for us.' Police attended Riley's home after the school became concerned at not hearing from him. Detective Constable Jane Lawrenson said: 'When I arrived the house was in darkness and there was a blue recycling bin outside. I knocked on the door for approximately five minutes but there was no reply. 'I knocked on a neighbour's door but she said she had not seen the male all week which was not unusual. Another neighbour said that he usually parked his motorbike outside and the bin had been there since the 13th.' She said that uniform assistance were required who enforced the door down. She said that Riley was found in the front upstairs bedroom. She added that Riley had been bailed with conditions and that he had received a letter from Stoneyhurst College that week notifying him of his suspension. Bailed: Mr Riley had been released on bail while police investigated the allegations . She said that a number of items were . being examined following Riley's arrest and interview and there was a . 'high probability' that he would be charged on the information the . police had gathered. Asked if the allegations related to his work at the school and whether he would certainly have been dismissed by the school, DC Lawrenson replied 'yes'. Inquest: A coroner ruled that Neil Riley, pictured at his first job after qualifying at Walverden ward at Reedyford hospital Nelsonin 1979, committed suicide . Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Michael Singleton said: 'Given the matter of the allegations he faced, the consequences, and taking into account the circumstances he was found, my only conclusion is that Neil Riley intended to bring about the end of his own life. 'A problem shared is a problem halved, I understand that it can all become too much. I'm sure if he had taken the opportunity to talk to family and friends he would have had a great deal of suppose and all would not have been lost.' Stonyhurst College - whose French motto, Quant Je Puis means 'As Much as I Can' - is a coeducational Roman Catholic independent school, adhering to the Jesuit tradition and was founded in 1593. Former old boys include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of Sherlock Holmes, England rugby star Kyran Bracken and Mark Thompson, former Director General of the BBC. In 1998 a Jesuit priest who sexually abused four pupils aged between 12 and 16 while a maths teacher at the school between 1987 and 1995 was jailed for five years. The sentence was reduced to three years on appeal. At the time of his trial the Catholic church run Society of Jesus blamed a breakdown in communication for their failure to take heed of warnings about the priest's behaviour while abroad. Before being convicted, the Jesuits had sent him to Canada for psychiatric treatment and he later went to Our Lady of Victories, in Gloucestershire, the retreat where fallen priests from the UK and the Irish Republic are sent.","Nurse Neil Riley, 54, was arrested on suspicion of voyeurism after claims he set up hidden cameras at the prestigious Stonyhurst College in Lancashire .

Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand, both 25, were found safe and sound on a lazy river boat ride in Peru this week. Hand said everything is 'fantastic.' He laughed when told that he had sparked a major Facebook campaign involving hundreds and caused an international incident. Found: Jamie Neal (right), 27, and her boyfriend Garrett Hand, 25, had been missing since January 26 in Peru, but have now been located on a boat . Desperate hunt: The U.S. Embassy had helped in the search for the young couple before they were found this week . The couple were discovered unharmed after Peru's tourism minister, fearing rumors that the couple had been snatched by 'rebels' would hurt his country's reputation, dispatched two emissaries to track the American tourists down. Francine Fitzgerald, Hand's mother, said on Wednesday she talked to her son by phone earlier in the day. 'I'm so glad my son is well,' she told KCBS radio from her home outside San Francisco, California. Peru's tourism minister, Jose Luis Silva, personally intervened in the case after the U.S. Embassy in Lima issued a statement saying that Hand and Neal had not been heard from since January 25 while cycling from the highlands city of Cuzco to Lima.

The couple were feared to have disappeared in an . area of Peru where a criminal gang was believed to have been plotting to kidnap . tourists, authorities said this week. They had also traveled to Chile and Argentina before deciding to go to the Amazon instead of Machu Picchu in Peru. The allegations of a kidnapping angered Silva, the Peruvian tourism officials, who said he was determined to bring back proof that the American tourists were unharmed. 'It has cost as many years and much sacrifice to put Peru's image at the level it is today,' he said.","Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand, 25, from San Francisco, last contacted their families on January 26 .

Bosses at Oxford University are threatening to scrap posh 'Deans' Dinners' after light-fingered students have been helping themselves to cutlery from the high-brow events. Students at Magdalen College have pinched a catalogue of items, including decanters, crystal punch bowls, side plates and expensive silverware. Now the deans of the college, whose former students include Chancellor George Osborne, are threatening to stop future events unless the property is returned. Helping themselves: Students stole items including decanters, crystal punch bowls, side plates and expensive silverware from the Deans' Dinners event at Magdalen College (pictured), in Oxford . University chiefs admit to 'turning a blind eye' to the petty thefts in the past but they have now lost patience, Oxford University's independent student newspaper, Cherwell, reports. A letter sent out to the Junior Common Room (JCR) after the Deans' Dinner last week, stated: 'This evening saw the last Deans' Dinner of the year. 'Over the past few months we have invited all first-year undergraduates to dine in the New Room as our guests. 'At each dinner several decanters, stoppers, and other items of college property have been removed without permission. 'We would be grateful if these items could now be returned. The same applies to any items removed in previous years. 'Often, as tonight, it has been obvious what has been happening, but we have turned a blind eye to those involved on the assumption that these items would be returned quickly and safely.' Lost patience: Deans are threatening to stop future events unless the property is returned. File picture shows graduates walking towards the Sheldonian Theatre under the Bridge of Sighs, in Oxford . The letter added that stolen items could be left anonymously outside the door of the Senior Dean. It concluded: 'If we do not receive the removed items we will have to consider whether we should continue to hold these dinners next year.' JCR President Millie Ross said culprits could be punished. Writing on the JCR Facebook group she said: 'The staff often note who they spot with what (you're less subtle than you think!) so I wouldn't take the risk if I were you. 'It's fine as a harmless prank of course, and it is a bit of a tradition now, but if the stuff isn't returned they won't be able to host them next year and that would be such a shame for the next cohort. 'They are even still missing big items like fruit bowls and decanters.' The row comes three months after Magdalen students boycotted the dining hall in a 'strike' against plans to force undergraduates to pay £150 a year extra for meals. First year English student Frank Lawton told Oxford University's independent student newspaper, Cherwell: 'Other than the small matter of it technically being theft it seems to be to be a great and noble tradition. 'After all, I feel like I've been robbed every time I open my battels sheets, it's only fair that we even up the score now and then. 'Furthermore, I thought university encouraged education and equipping us with the skills we'll need for our careers? 'Personally I would like to be a bank robber or a high profile art thief.' 'It's fine as a harmless prank of . course, and it is a bit of a tradition now, but if the stuff isn't . returned they won't be able to host them next year and that would be . such a shame for the next cohort' - Junior Common Room president Millie Ross . A first year historian said: 'I think traditions like this are great as long as they're just a bit of fun and don't end up costing the college or depriving others in the future. 'I myself, along with many others, removed a rather large number of items on Friday night, which I returned to the Deans over the weekend. 'I was impressed when returning my decanters to find an antique table and a silver tray had also been left there.' 'I can understand why it was necessary to request that the items be returned but I very much enjoyed the dinner and hope they will be held in the future; and they wouldn't be anywhere near as fun without the added thrill of everyone trying to subtly cram cutlery and tableware into their pockets.'","Items stolen during 'Deans' Dinner' event for first year students .

Police who investigated the disappearance of Casey Anthony's two-year-old daughter admitted today that they overlooked a Google search for 'fool-proof' suffocation on the day the girl was last seen alive. Captain Angelo Nieves said on Sunday that his office's computer investigator missed the June 16, 2008 Internet search. It is not known who performed the search but it was allegedly done with a browser primarily used by the two-year-old's mother, Casey Anthony, who was acquitted of the girl's murder in 2011. Troubling: On the day that two-year-old Caylee Anthony disappeared, someone at the Florida home searched 'fool-proof suffocation'. Her mother Casey (right) was acquitted of her murder in 2011 . Acquitted: Casey Anthony reacts as she is found not guilty in the murder of her daughter Caylee. She is flanked by her attorneys, Jose Baez, left, and Dorothy Clay Sims, right . Anthony's attorneys argued during trial that Casey Anthony helped her father, George Anthony, cover up the girl's drowning in the family pool. WKMG reports that sheriff's investigators pulled 17 vague entries only from the computer's Internet Explorer browser, not the Mozilla Firefox browser commonly used by Casey Anthony. More than 1,200 Firefox entries, including the suffocation search, were overlooked. Whoever conducted the Google search looked for the term 'fool-proof suffication', misspelling 'suffocation', and then clicked on an article about suicide that discussed taking poison and putting a bag over one's head. The browser then recorded activity on the social networking site MySpace, which was used by Casey Anthony but not her father. A computer expert for Anthony's defense team found the search before the trial. Her lead attorney, Jose Baez, first mentioned the search in his book about the case but suggested it was George Anthony who conducted the search after Caylee drowned because he wanted to kill himself. Murdered: Caylee, 2, was last seen on June 16, 2008, the same day that 'foolproof suffocation' was searched on the Anthony family computer . Concession: Captain of Orange County sheriff's office Angelo Nieves spoke to reporters about the Casey Anthony evidence today . Not knowing about the computer search, prosecutors had argued Caylee was poisoned with chloroform and then suffocated by duct tape placed over her mouth and nose. The girl's body was found six months after she disappeared in a field near the family home and was too decomposed for an exact cause of death to be determined. Prosecutors presented evidence that someone in the Anthony home searched online for how to make chloroform, but Casey Anthony's mother, Cindy, claimed on the witness stand that she had done the searches by mistake while looking up information about chlorophyll. Development: A local TV station claims the new evidence could have resulted in Casey Anthony's conviction . Many jurors apparently went into hiding amid public outrage over the verdict and refused to comment but two have said prosecutors couldn't conclusively prove how Caylee died. Prosecutors Linda Drane Burdick and Jeff Ashton didn't respond to emails from The Associated Press on Sunday. But Ashton told WKMG that 'it's just a shame we didn't have it. This certainly would have put the accidental death claim in serious question'. Baez didn't respond to phone or email messages on Sunday but told WKMG that he expected prosecutors to bring up the search at trial. 'When they didn't, we were kind of shocked,' Baez, who no longer represents Anthony, told the station. Her attorney, Cheney Mason, who was also on the trial team, didn't return an email on Sunday, and his office answering service refused to take a phone message. The sheriff's office didn't consult the FBI or Florida Department of Law Enforcement for help searching the computer in the Anthony case, a mistake investigators have learned from, Nieves said. Prosecutors had argued that Anthony suffocated Caylee with chloroform, then taped her mouth shut. Her partially-decomposed body was found in a garbage bag dumped in a swamp on December 11, 2008 - nearly six months after she was left seen alive by her grandparents. Horrific: Prosecutors believe that Caylee's killer suffocated her with the anesthetic chloroform and then taped her mouth shut . That same day, Casey visited her parents at their home in Orange County, Florida, along with her daughter Caylee. It was the last time the child was seen alive. The next day, Caylee went missing and George and Cindy repeatedly asked Casey what had happened to their granddaughter. Prosecutors tried to convict Casey Anthony using key pieces of information that they claimed proved her guilt in the murder. It was alleged that that Anthony used chloroform to knock out her daughter Caylee. While the girl was unconscious, prosecutors said Anthony put duct tape over Caylee’s mouth, which suffocated the toddler. The word ‘chloroform’ was searched on a computer in the Anthony home 84 times as well as 'neck breaking' and 'household weapons' before the girl's disappearance. In addition, a police K-9 agent testified that his cadaver dog, Gerus, detected human decomposition in the trunk of Anthony’s car. Another agent testified that her dog, Bones, had detected human decomposition in the backyard of the Anthony family home. When she was first questioned by police, Anthony insisted that she had not seen Caylee since she left her in the care of a babysitter, whom she identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, a woman who police could never link to the murder. However, a woman with that name was not involved with Caylee’s disappearance. That woman is now suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she was fired from her job, kicked out of her apartment and subjected to death threats as a result of her questioning. Finally, on July 15, 2008 - 31 days after that visit - Cindy Anthony called police to report that Caylee had vanished. On March 17, 2008 - months before the . toddler's disappearance - chloroform, neck-breaking, head injuries, . ruptured spleen, chest trauma, inhalation and internal bleeding, were . all searched in either Google on Wikipedia on the family computer. The . fragmented search results were recovered from the hard drive, even . though the computer's internet browsing history had been deleted. The . search for 'chloroform,' typed in 84 times before Caylee's . disappearance, became a key piece of the prosecution's case - brought . up during opening statements and several times during the trial. Cindy . Anthony claimed she was the one who had searched for the word, saying . that she thought her dog was being poisoned by eating bamboo leaves from . the garden. She said the . initial search was for 'chlorophyll,' Cindy said she later found herself . searching for information on the toxic chemical. Prosecutors later proved the Cindy was at work when most of the searches took place. Chloroform vapors can knock even healthy adults unconscious when they are inhaled. In large doses, the gas can be fatal. 'There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car,' she told a 911 operator.  It is unknown how detectives missed that key piece of evidence. Other searches on the Anthonys' computer had been introduced into evidence. Baez rejected the report as an example of 'the standard anti-Casey spin.' He told the Orlando Sentinel that any revelations coming from the WKMG report are '100 per cent false.' Concerned: George and Cindy Anthony last saw their granddaughter on June 16, 2008 - the day she came to visit with Casey . Tragedy: Caylee's body was found in December 2008 - about six months after she was last seen. Her mother Casey was the prime suspect in her death .","Term was searched on Anthony family computer on June 16, 2008 when Casey visited her parents with Caylee .

A woman has broken down in tears while testifying that her husband told her 25 years ago that he shot dead his sister and her husband. Pam Wyngarden told the court in Holland, Michigan on Wednesday that she finally decided to speak out about her husband's 1987 confession because she could not bear lying anymore. She said they had only been dating a few months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as teenagers. The case of Rick and Gail Brink, who were found shot dead at the home, laid unsolved for more than 20 years before investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview the Wyngardens. Scroll down for video . Testimony: Pam Wyngarden broke down in court as she testified that her husband told her 25 years ago that he had killed his sister and her husband because he was jealous of their relationship . Struggle: She sobbed as she revealed she decided to speak out because she couldn't face lying anymore . At first, Mrs Wyngarden stuck to the story she had repeated for decades: That she and her husband were visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at the time of the killings. But as the investigation continued, the mother-of-four changed her story. 'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.' In court, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating. Emotional: Her husband, Ryan Wyngarden, sobbed and yelled that he was innocent of the crimes . Outburst: As his wife said they had been very in love 25 years ago, he shouted that they still are . 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""I shot and killed Rick and Gail"". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' Arrest: Wyngarden was arrested in January after investigators re-opened the cold case . When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one. As she testified, her husband, now 50, sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't.' As the testimony continues on Thursday, he will be placed in a separate room, from where he will watch the proceedings to avoid any further outbursts. The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding. In court this week, Mrs Brink recounted finding her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home. The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths. In the years after Wyngarden allegedly told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and would not allow her to have any friends, in fear that she would tell them, she said. Loss: Gail Brink was 22 when she was killed, and her husband Rick was 28. They had been married 18 months . Missed: Rick's parents found the couple shot dead at their home after he failed to turn up to work . She said their marriage was very dysfunctional, as her relationship had been with her father. The case fell cold as investigators found no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been victims of mistaken identity. The trial continues.

Honoured: Stephen Wright has received the Paul Foot Award for investigative journalism for his reporting on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation . Daily Mail journalist Stephen Wright has been honoured with a prestigious accolade for his 15 years of reporting on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation. Judges at the Paul Foot Award for investigative journalism created a Special Campaign Award to present him in recognition of his outstanding work. His initial investigation led to Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre famously branding the suspects ‘Murderers’, in a front page headline in February 1997. Wright then spearheaded the Mail’s Justice for Stephen campaign through to the trial and conviction of two of the original suspects last year. The judges praised Wright for his ‘dogged reporting’ and for ‘securing a number of scoops, and breaking significant stories to keep the case in the public eye’. They said: ‘This included reporting on the racist and violent pasts of the suspects and on police blunders, which led to the then home secretary Jack Straw ordering a public inquiry. ‘Stephen Wright highlighted the  need for double jeopardy laws to be reformed to allow three of Stephen Lawrence’s alleged killers (who had been acquitted) to stand trial again if new evidence emerged.’ The annual Award was set up by Private Eye and The Guardian in honour of the late investigative journalist, Paul Foot. Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said: ‘The Paul Foot Awards this year are a powerful post-Leveson riposte to all those who want to think only the worst of journalists. ‘The shortlist celebrates those whose great skill is to make the public really interested in what is really in the public interest.’ Stephen Wright's investigation led to the Daily Mail editor branding the suspects 'Murderers' on the front page and he spearheaded the Mail's Justice for Stephen campaign .

Jurors today were shown video of the alleged Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of the windows of her Maine exercise studio - the raciest evidence so far in the trial of Alexis Wright's business partner. Mark Strong's lawyers admit that the footage, which appears to be amateur porn Wright shot, is shocking, but they say it has no bearing on the case and that it will only bias the jury. Jurors also saw about two dozen pictures Strong captured on his home computer while he watched live Skype broadcasts of Wright allegedly having sex with johns in her Zumba exercise studio. Explicit: Prosecutors played a video of Alexis Wright, 30, stripping off and teasing construction workers across the street from her exercise studio . For all to see: The video played for jurors shows Wright stripping out of her towel while standing in the window of her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine . Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright and his lawyers concede he may have watched video of her having sex with other men - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged prostitution business . The grainy video footage played in court depicts a woman identified at Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, parading around her Pure Vida Studio wearing nothing but a towel. She describes how she is trying to get the attention of construction workers across the street a she stands in front of the windows of her business. 'I’m going to try and get them to come over and have some fun,' she says as she stands on a chair in full view of downtown Kennebunk. She drops her towel as she slowly tears a sign off the window. 'He’s taken notice. They’ve both taken notice. And now they’re watching.' Later, she appears to unlock the door a let a man inside, according to Seacoast Online. Strong, a married father of two, says he funded Wright's exercise . studio with a loan and acted as her business partner. He also admits that he had an affair with her and his lawyers concede that he may have watched her online as she had sex with other men. Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two, . allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex . with several men via live-streaming video over Skype . On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy . However, his lawyers argue Strong, a local real estate broker and private investigator, had no idea Wright was allegedly receiving money for the sex or that she was running a prostitution business. The 57-year-old faces 12 counts of promotion of prostitution and a single count of invasion of privacy. He has pleaded not guilty. Detectives say they recovered 13,000 still images from Strong's computer, many of them sexually explicit pictures that he captured from videos of Wright having sex with alleged johns. Prosecutors initially wanted to show 577 to the jury. 'This is visual surveillance of the prostitution itself,' Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan argued, according to the Portland Press-Herald. Defense lawyers strenuously objected before the material was introduced and continued to object after jurors saw the video and the pictures. They say Strong is just a 'voyeur.' Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges . 'It . may be Mr. Strong observed the sexual acts of Ms. Wright with other . people, but I don't think it shows promotion of prostitution,' Daniel . Lilley told the judge. 'These are all very sexual acts and very sexual positions.' Jurors also were given sheets with 21,000 text messages that Strong and Wright exchanged  between February 2010 and February 2012. Defense lawyers strenuously objected to the video shown on Wednesday, saying that it did not pertain to allegations to that Strong was involved in the case. On Wednesday, Justice Nancy Mills ruled that the prosecution should show only 100 of the photos to the jury - to illustrate the Wright invited multiple men into her studio for sex on multiple occasions. Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex . The video isn't the only time the jury heard about Wright's escapades involving a towel. Last week, a pizza delivery driver testified that she answered the door in a towel when he delivered spaghetti and meatballs to her. She then dropped the towel and handed him a $40 tip. Witness Dan Racaniello said he felt that Wright was 'coming on to him' and that he resisted her urgings.

Federal budget cuts have caused hundreds of illegal immigrants to be released onto the streets, a senior Republican claimed today. Many who entered the U.S. without papers have now been freed from their cells even though they face deportation because Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn’t have enough money to keep them there. Officials at the agency say that the move is in anticipation of the $85billion across the board budget cuts, which kick in on Thursday night. Shipping out? Fleet Week hangs in the balance as the region could be affected by sequestration - the automatic spending cuts imposed by the federal government set to take effect on March 1 . Travelers have also been warned to . expect delays of up to 90 minutes extra at airports because the . Transport Security Administration won’t be able to pay enough staff. Schools . could be closed, the economy could suffer, parks may be shut and hundreds of . thousands of workers could be laid off. Fleet Week could also be cancelled as a result of budget cuts, a blow to the thousands who look forward to the celebration of the Armed Forces each year. The . annual celebration, in which recently deployed . ships dock at major cities for a week, usually draws hundreds of . thousands of visitors to ports with celebrations and parades. The Navy's air display team, The Blue Angels, will also likely not perform as they normally do. Dark days ahead: Federal budgets cuts could lead to the cancellation of events such as Fleet Week where the nations military ships and aircraft visit cities around the country . The Army would lose $7 billion next year, the Navy more than $4 billion and Medicare payments to hospitals would fall by $5.6 billion. ABC News reported that President Obama will meet with top four congressional leaders  on Friday - John Boehner, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell - to work out a deal, but by the the cuts will already have kicked in. The most egregious sign of the crisis has already happened. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that it has turned to the supervised release of hundreds of illegal immigrants because it was cheaper than holding them in cells. The New York Times reported that the inmates released were being held at centers in Hudson County, New Jersey; Polk County, Texas; Broward County, Florida; New Orleans and from centers in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia and New York. Decision day: House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio challenged President Obama and the Senate to avoid the automatic spending cuts set to take effect in two days . ICE described those released as ‘noncriminals and other low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal histories’, but House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte was outraged. Goodlatte said: ‘It’s abhorrent that President Obama is releasing criminals into our communities to promote his political agenda on sequestration. ‘By releasing criminal immigrants onto the streets, the administration is needlessly endangering American lives.’ Transport Secretary Ray LaHood has warned that flights to major cities like New York and San Francisco - plus international arrivals - could be delayed by an hour and a half because of long lines at security due to lack of staff. Air traffic controllers may also be furloughed because the Federal Aviation Administration has to save $600 million, which will add to the problem. President Obama has been running a series of campaign style adverts across the U.S. detailing how the cuts will impact on communities. Among those worst hit will be the capital where elementary and high schools will lose $29 million in funding, 2,000 poor children will not be able to go to school and 150,000 military personnel will lose $7,500 a year in pay. No area of government will be left unaffected and across the whole of the U.S., a study from the American Association of School Administrators has found that half of all schools will have to lay staff off. Tough choices: The sequester, a series of severe budget cuts, is looming over lawmakers this week. The budget cuts are set to take effect on 1st March . One in 20 said they would have to close or consolidate their schools. Forbes analyst Robert Lenzner . predicts that the cuts could shave 1.1 per cent off of GDP at a time . when the economy is still only growing at two per cent. He has said: ‘When you subtract 1.1 . per cent from 2 per cent you get growth at best of 0.9 per cent– . definitely not enough to drive the unemployment rate down to the 6.5 per . cent level.’ The cuts were imposed because of a . failure on Capitol Hill to agree a deal to reduce the $16 trillion . national debt, which rose to such a level in the wake of the 2008 . recession. The total amount of spending cuts will be $1.2 trillion over ten years, split 50-50 between defence and domestic spending. The drastic measure was seen as an emergency provision designed to get Republicans and Democrats to act, but in the face of ongoing gridlock they are now set to come into effect. John Boehner, the House Speaker, has been blunt in his assessment of the failure and told Senators to ‘get off their ass’ and make a deal.","Hundreds of illegal immigrants reportedly being released because it's cheaper than holding cells is an 'abhorrent' move, says Republican Bob Goodlatte .

Police have identified a 22-year-old woman as a 'person of interest' in last week's slaying of an aspiring rapper who was shot and killed while driving his Maserati on the Las Vegas strip. Police said Tineesha Lashun Howard was riding in a black Range Rover with prime suspect Ammar Harris when he opened fire on the Maserati being driven by 27-year-old Kenneth Wayne Cherry Jr. before dawn on Thursday. Cherry, who performed under the name 'Kenny Clutch,' was mortally wounded and his silver sports car veered out of control, colliding with a taxi in an intersection at the heart of the strip - killing the cab driver and his passenger. Fatal attraction: Tineesha Lashun Howard, right, a new 'person of interest' in the last week's Las Vegas strip shooting, is pictured with Ammar Harris, left, the prime suspect . Harris, 26, has been the subject of a multistate manhunt since the incident, and police say he has a long criminal history that includes arrests for robbery, sexual assault, kidnapping and soliciting prostitution. Police believe Harris is 'involved in the sex trade,' said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police spokesman Officer Bill Cassell. Harris is described as having several tattoos, including a large black-eyed owl on his neck and small heart on his upper right cheek. Police officials described Howard as a 'missing and possibly endangered individual' from the Miami area. 'She's listed as a missing person,' Cassell said. 'How she went missing is part of the Miami Police Department's investigation.' Sought: Howard, of Miami, has been described as a 'missing and possibly endangered individual' Several photos released by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department showed Howard and Harris together in each others' arms. In one of them they are seen riding in a sport utility vehicle, possibly the Range Rover. The Range Rover used in the shooting, which bore paper dealer plates, has been impounded by police, but officials have not said where they found the luxury sport utility vehicle. No weapons were recovered from inside. Earlier on Tuesday, Las Vegas taxicab companies pledged $35,000 toward a reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Harris. Authorities say the dramatic shooting in a busy intersection of the desert resort city may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip. Manhunt: Police have released this photograph of Ammar Harris, prime suspect in the Las Vegas shootout . The new revelations came hours after a new picture of Harris was released as cops widen their manhunt. Capt Chris Jones, of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, said: 'We have him identified. Now the focus is on locating and apprehending him. We're getting help all over the place.' He is described as having several . distinctive tattoos, including a large black-eyed owl on his neck and . small heart on his upper right cheek. Police have also revealed that Harris, an alleged pimp, has a length criminal history, which includes charges of sexual assault, kidnap and robbery. Search: Las Vegas Police's Capt Chris Jones, left, and Lt Ray Steiber, right, have appealed for the public's help . The manhunt has been extended to the southeastern states, with police already searching Nevada, Arizona, California and Utah. It follows the shootout early on Thursday at the junction of Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road, near several world famous casino resort hotels, including The Bellagio and Caesars Palace. The driver of the taxi, Michael Bolden, 62, and his passenger, identified in local media reports as Sandi Sutton, from Washington state, were killed in an explosion after the Cherry's Maserati struck the vehicle. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said Harris is wanted for the murder of all three, and that officers were 'utilizing every available resource' to find him. Murder: Police are treating the three deaths following the shooting and crash in Las Vegas as murder . He warned yesterday that any members of the public 'harboring' Harris or helping him to evade the authorities could face charges themselves. Lt Steiber said: 'At this point Ammar Harris is the one responsible for the shooting and the murder of three individuals.' No weapons were found in the silver Maserati, police have confirmed, and Cherry, an aspiring rapper, did not return fire. Terrifying: Kenneth Cherry Jr. was shot dead and taxi driver Michael Bolden died when his vehicle exploded . Lt Steiber added: 'Right now, as far as we're concerned, Mr Cherry, he's the victim of a murder and that's what we're focused on.' Harris, who lived in South Carolina and Georgia, was convicted of marijuana possession in 2005 in Atlanta. In December, he was arrested in Miami for reckless driving and failure to produce a valid license. He also used the name Ammar Asim Faruq Harris when he was arrested last May in Las Vegas and charged with sexual assault, kidnapping and coercion with a weapon. Explosion: A fiery crash followed the shootout on Thursday, with Cherry's Maserati colliding with a taxi . His apparently brand new Range Rover has been impounded, but police have declined to say where it was found. Steiber said no guns were found inside. Authorities say the shooting may have stemmed from a verbal altercation in the valet area of the Aria Resort and Casino a few blocks away on the Strip. It took place less than a mile from where rapper Tupac Shakur was shot in September 1996. The 25-year-old had been riding in a BMW with Death Row Records co-founder Marion 'Suge' Knight after the two men had attended a Mike Tyson boxing match.","Came on same day as a photo shows heavily-tattooed prime suspect Ammar Harris .

"Concert organisers originally said they would be forced to pay as Winehouse fulfilled contract terms . Singer cancels forthcoming shows on tour . Says she can't perform 'to best of her ability' By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:59 EST, 21 June 2011 . Amy Winehouse has turned down payment for her shambolic concert in Belgrade, Serbia. The troubled singer was originally thought to be demanding full payment as, despite giving one of the worst shows of her career, she had fulfilled her contract by arriving on time and staying on stage for 70 minutes. Amy - who seemed dazed and lost as she stumbled around the stage - was booed off by angry fans after delivering barely recognisable versions of her hits. Scroll down for video footage of the performance... A let down: Amy Winehouse looked inebriated as she arrived on stage an hour late in Serbia, staggered about, slurred her words and was jeered by the audience . The furious concert organisers said today that they expected they would have to pay the singer in full because she kept to . the letter of her contract with them. 'She did it all according to the agreement. She arrived in Belgrade on time and stayed on stage for 70 minutes, so we can't do anything,' a spokesman for the promoters told local media. But a spokesperson for Winehouse told the Mail Online that she will not seek payment for the performance after all. The rep said that upcoming festival dates in Istanbul on Monday and . in Athens on Wednesday would be cancelled following the Belgrade show. Her next show is scheduled for . July 8 in Spain. Where am I? Amy looked lost and confused as she swayed in front of the microphone . The Back to Black star's management had . banned alcohol from every room on the floor of the Hyatt hotel she was . using in Belgrade in a desperate bid to keep her on the straight and . narrow. But her Saturday night performance was so dire that even the Serbian government has attacked her. Defence minister Dragan Sutanovac said on his Facebook page: 'Amy's concert was a shame and a huge disappointment. 'She is far from being a queen. She's . more like a patient of a rehabilitation clinic for drugs and an alcohol . addict. She needs serious medical assistance.' Concert organisers meanwhile are . trying to find where the singer obtained whatever it was that had made . her seem intoxicated - warning that they might seek compensation if it . turned out to be the hotel or someone related to the event that had . agreed to keep alcohol away from the star. What is she doing? To the amusement of her band, Amy bends over on stage to take off one of her shoes . Hello: Amy holds on to her guitarist who she went over and hugged as after being introduced onto the stage at Belgrade's Kalemegdan Park . A statement released earlier by Winehouse's management read: 'Despite feeling sure that she wanted to fulfill these commitments, she . has agreed with management that she cannot perform to the best of her . ability and will return home. 'She would like to . apologize to fans expecting to see her at the shows but feels that this . is the right thing to do.' An . hour after she was due to arrive on stage in Belgrade, after being . introduced by one of her backing singers, she staggered on and made her . way to the back to hug one of her guitarists. Wearing a short green and black dress . that accentuated her cosmetically-enhanced breasts, she sat down on one . of the speakers and adjusted her shoes while her concerned backing . singer asked if she was ok and steadied her back to her microphone. Are you ok? As she stumbled around looking lost, her backing singer grabbed her hand in concern . Amy, . 27, looked confused and then took off one of her shoes which she threw . on the floor before walking unsteadily over to her microphone. After missing her cue a couple of . times, she proceeded to deliver a half-spoken and mumbled version of her . song Just Friends, her last release back in 2008. Halfway . through, slurring her words which she had difficulty stringing . together, she told the crowd at the city's Kalemegdan Park: 'Let me . bring the band introduction.' But . then she tried to continue singing the song, smiling all the while, . seemingly oblivious of how she was coming across to her fans. Trying her best: At some points during the concert, Amy looked lucid and happy as she sang some of her biggest hits . After hugging herself and failing to . sing most of the song, she then came back in as the band finished, . looked surprised and then slurred 'Just Friends' into the microphone as . an astonished crowd booed and halfheartedly clapped. The . situation didn't improve much throughout the concert, as the Back to . Black singer disappeared off stage several times leaving her band . playing. And according to local press reports, the 20,000 fans described as a 'scandal' and a 'disaster'. Voluptuous: Amy's short green and black dress accentuated her cosmetically-enhanced breasts . Fans were also angry as may had paid about £35 a ticket which is a lot of money in a country where the average salary is about £274 a month. One fan angrily wrote on YouTube - where videos of her disastrous performance have been posted - that he was still mad at her. They fumed: 'She . started a show and turned her back to public (btw, for most of us it . was not that easy to give the money for ticket because of the economic . situation in Serbia) and that was just the beginning of her disrespect . and bizarre behavior. Unsteady: Amy hugged herself a lot throughout the gig as she swayed about . 'She did not sang one song from beginning to the end, Some of them she didn't even tried to sing. Not a fan anymore' Amy is due in Turkey tomorrow to play Istanbul's Kucuk Ciftlik Park and also has dates in Greece, . Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Poland, Hungary and Romania, finishing up on . 15 August at Iolanda Balas Soter Stadium, Bucharest. Earlier this month she checked out of The Priory Clinic at the suggestion . of her father, Mitch, over concerns she was drinking too much prior to . her live shows. Outrage: Fans, who had paid a lot of money to see her play, turned on the star afterwards and called the show a 'disaster' Her spokesman said: 'Amy Winehouse has completed . her assessment at the Priory Clinic in London and will continue as an . outpatient. 'She is now looking forward to playing shows around Europe this summer and is raring to go. 'She would like to send a huge thanks to all her fans for the messages . of support she has received over the last week and can't wait to see . them.'","Concert organisers originally said they would be forced to pay as Winehouse fulfilled contract terms .

Taxpayers face a £2million bill after plans to increase the amount that MPs contribute towards their gold-plated pensions were quietly dropped. The Treasury was expecting a 1.85 per cent rise in contributions to come into play this April – but yesterday the MPs’ expenses watchdog made the surprise announcement that the rise was being suspended. It means the taxpayer will be forced to plough even more money into MPs’ pensions to plug the gap, at a time when millions are having to tighten their belts to fund higher contributions towards their own pensions. MPs were expected to pay 1.85 per cent more into their pensions, but the expenses watchdog IPSA has postponed the increase leaving the Treasury plug the £2million gap . Almost all public sector workers are . facing contribution rises of up to 6 per cent, and for staff in the . private sector contribution rates are also going up. Chancellor George Osborne must now find the extra money to make up the shortfall . Despite this, the Independent . Parliamentary Standards Authority said it will put off any decisions on . members’ contributions until after it has considered the whole issue of . MPs’ pay and pensions in a report expected later this year. The decision means that policemen will be paying more towards their pensions than MPs by 2015. MPs’ pensions arrangements are among . the most generous in the country. They contribute an average of 13.2 per . cent of their £65,738 salaries into the schemes, which pay out after . they reach 65. In contrast, by 2015 policemen will be contributing 13.7 per cent towards their pensions. MPs have to pay into their scheme for . far fewer years than ordinary workers before getting a full pension. And . they benefit from a higher  taxpayer contribution to their pensions . than any other group in the public sector – almost 29 per cent compared . with 14 per cent for teachers and nurses. A 1.85 per cent rise in their . contributions was due to start this April but this will no longer happen . following IPSA’s decision yesterday. It is expected that the Treasury will . have to find £2million to plug the gap – at a time when frontline . services are being pared to the bone. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of . the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘MPs should be subject to the same . pension reforms they’re imposing on the wider public sector. Former pension adviser to the Treasury Ros Altmann said it was 'rather unusual' that MPs¿ contributions were not increasing when voters were feeling the pinch . ‘They say we’re all in it together, so . it’s only fair that politicians contribute more to their hugely . generous pension schemes to help repair our broken public finances.’ Last night Ros Altmann, former pension . adviser to the Treasury, said: ‘At a time when pensions are becoming . more expensive to provide, it is rather unusual that MPs’ contributions . are not increasing when they are everywhere else.’ IPSA said it deferred the rise so the . contribution rate could be considered alongside other aspects as part of . a wholesale review of pay and pensions. A spokesman said: ‘MPs’ pensions . certainly need looking at. And that is why we are in the middle of a . fundamental review looking at both MPs’ pensions and pay.’","Expenses watchdog stuns the Treasury with decision to suspend planned rise in contributions made by MPs .

An amateur prospector has discovered a once-in-a-lifetime find in the most unlikely of places - finding a huge lump of gold worth £200,000 in the Australian bush. Using only a handheld detector, the unnamed novice was amazed when he found the y-shaped nugget 60cm underground near the town of Ballarat in Victoria. Weighing 5.5kg, the discovery has delighted local experts who say that they have never encountered such a significant find. Scroll down for video . Struck gold: An amateur prospector found a 5.5kg gold nugget, expected to fetch £200,000 at auction, near the town of Ballarat, Australia . Goldmine: The nugget was discovered 60cm underground near the town of Ballarat, where gold has been sought by prospectors for decades, in Australia's Victoria state . The prospector was using a state-of-the-art detector, allowing him to locate the 'extremely rare' nugget in previously searched ground. But despite the enormity of the find, the man initially thought he had detected 'the bonnet of a car' before seeing a 'glint of gold'. Perhaps not quite believing his luck, friends revealed how the man kept cleaning the piece and 'the gold kept expanding and expanding'. Excitement: Ballarat Mining Exchange Gold Shop owner Cordell Kent said the man rushed home to tell his wife after the discovery and is planning to pay off bills with the funds . Ballarat Mining Exchange Gold Shop owner and dealer Cordell Kent said: 'I have been a prospector and dealer for . two decades, and cannot remember the last time a nugget over 100 ounces .

A former Playboy Playmate has ditched her lawyer just days before the start of her trial on charges that she tried to smuggle her Canadian boyfriend across the border into New York last summer. A federal judge in Syracuse granted Colleen Shannon's request on Tuesday to drop her lawyer, Mark Sacco, and gave her two weeks to hire a new one. It's not clear why she wanted new representation. The 34-year-old Los Angeles resident's trial on illegal immigrant smuggling charges was scheduled to start this week but has now been postponed. A new start date hasn't been set. New lawyer: A federal judge in Syracuse allowed Colleen Shannon,  pictured left and right, to drop her lawyer, Mark Sacco, and hire a new one . Shannon and her boyfriend, Robert Skojo, were arrested in August in Fort Covington, New York, after federal agents said he entered the U.S. illegally by boat through the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation, which straddles the border. Officials say Skojo has a criminal record in Canada. Skojo was convicted in Canada in 1990 of 'procuring sexual services' and 'living on the avails of prostitution,' the Post-Standard of Syracuse quotes court papers as saying. He was also convicted of drug charges in 1996 and 1999. Skojo began dating Shannon in 2011 after she DJ'd a party he hosted, according to the Post-Standard. Bunny: Shannon, pictured right with Hugh Hefner, was the centerfold for Playboy's 50th anniversary edition in 2004 . Smuggling: Shannon, pictured left and right, and her boyfriend, Robert Skojo, were arrested in August in Fort Covington, New York . The 2004 playmate, who now works as a disc jockey, was taken into custody after being charged with violating a federal statute prohibiting 'bringing in and harboring aliens'. U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped Shannon on August 15 at the Massena point of entry, where she'd driven alone in Skojo's 2005 Bentley, court documents said. Poser: Shannon even posed in her mug shot, pictured, taken in August . The newspaper reported that Shannon . declared that she had $9,800 in cash with her, which she said was from . her job as a DJ, but she couldn't prove Skojo had given permission to . drive his car. Shannon told the agents she was an actress and that she was driving to New York City to meet her agent. Border Patrol let her go, then notified agents with Homeland Security Investigations. Agents watched her drive to a hotel in Fort Covington hotel and Skojo met her there that night, the papers said. The couple were arrested arrested the next morning. Shannon claims she shouldn't be charged with alien smuggling because she didn't drive Skojo across the border. 'Instead, according to Shannon, she was simply picking up her boyfriend,' the prosecutor's court papers said. The former playmate faces 10 years in prison if convicted. In her 2004 Playboy profile, Shannon, who is from Alaska, said she was turned-on by 'positivity and supportiveness' while turn-offs included negativity and being a bad kisser. She said: 'Everyone is put here to do something. Your subconscious tells you the things that you love to do, but a lot of people put those things aside. 'I think if you stick to things you love, nine times out of ten, circumstances are going to go your way and you will live a happy life.'","A federal judge in Syracuse granted .

A close friend of Jodi Arias testified at her murder trial today that the woman she knew could not have committed such a brutal murder as the prosecution displayed graphic sexual photos of the suspect in an effort to debunk the witness's portrayal. Leslie Udy was called by the prosecution on Thursday in the trial of 32-year-old Arias who is facing the death penalty over the stabbing and shooting death of her on-off boyfriend Travis Alexander. The state called Mrs Udy to discuss the time she spent with Arias on June 5, 2008 - a day after Alexander was killed at his home in Mesa, Arizona. Scroll down for video . On trial for her life: Jodi Arias, pictured in court today wearing new glasses, faces the death penalty if found guilty of murdering ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander . Disbelief: Leslie Udy, a close friend of Arias, told the Phoenix court that she couldn't imagine a woman she knew to be gentle and softly-spoken committing such a crime . Mrs Udy testified that Arias admitted to her that she had looked through Alexander's cellphone as they chatted in her car before going to dinner at Chili's restaurant with a group of friends. The state witness told the jury that her husband had asked Arias about injuries to her hands and that Arias told him she had broken a glass at work and cut her fingers. On June 9, Udy said that Arias had called her sobbing to say that Travis had been murdered and that 'she couldn't imagine how someone could do that to him'. Mrs Udy said that Arias then called her at 2am the next night in despair at losing Alexander whom she described as her 'best friend'. Udy added that she had spoken to Arias on many occasions about her ex-boyfriend's death. Graphic: Witness Leslie Udy was shown graphic photographs taken of her friend Jodi Arias on June 4, 2008 by the prosecution to show that perhaps she did not know everything about her 'gentle' friend . Lasting images: A photograph of a naked Travis Alexander which is time-stamped June 4, 2008 - the day he died . Arias, looked on in the Phoenix court today, breaking down in tears . as her friend appeared on the stand. The murder suspect, who was dressed in a green shirt and wearing new glasses, wiped her nose and eyes with a tissue and let her hair fall over her . face. Mrs Udy said: 'The Jodi I knew was a very quiet, soft-spoken and gentle person. The person that I knew I couldn't imagine . they could do something like that.' The . prosecution then showed Mrs Udy photographs of Arias posing in sexually . explicit positions and asked if she knew about the images, to which the . witness replied 'no'. Close bond: The suspected killer (left) had dinner with her friend Mrs Udy at a Chili's restaurant on June 5 - the night after Alexander was murdered . Another image which appears to show Arias' foot alongside Alexander's bleeding body was also shown to Udy on the stand. The prosecution rested its case today. The jury was dismissed until the trial resumes on January 29 when the defense will present their case. On Wednesday, jurors had watched . a videotaped interrogation of Arias during which she insisted she . didn't kill him - but says if she had, she would have killed him . quickly and humanely. If found guilty of murder, Arias would become just the fourth woman on Arizona's death row. She . allegedly stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slitting his . throat from ear to ear, and shot him in the head around June 4, 2008, at . his Mesa home. His body was found five days later in his shower by . roommates. Twisted tale: Arias is seen during a videotaped interrogation with a detective where she denies killing Alexander but says that if she did, she would have done it quickly and humanely . She first told police she knew nothing of the killing. Later she changed her story and said two intruders burst into the home and killed him while she managed to escape. She now admits to the killing but claims she had to defend herself against an enraged and abusive Alexander. Jurors on Wednesday watched a . videotaped interrogation of Arias after her arrest. A detective grilled . Arias, explaining that all the evidence points to her. She insisted she . did not kill him. Mesa police detective Esteban Flores continued to press her on the tape. ‘You shot him in the head, then you got a knife and you stabbed him,’ Flores said. ‘Jodi, tell me the truth, please.’ Rage: Arias (right) is believed to have killed Alexander in a fit of jealousy (left) at his home in Mesa, Arizona on June 4, 2008 . ‘I did not kill Travis,’ Arias replied. However, she said if she were to have killed him, she couldn't have stabbed him. It would have been too cruel. ‘I don't think I could stab him. I think I would have to shoot him until he was dead if that were my intentions,’ Arias told the detective. ‘But I would have to wear gloves. ‘If I had it in me to kill him, the least I could have done was make it as humane as possible,’ she added. Jurors in the murder trial asked questions suggesting they had doubts about the . investigation into the murder of Alexander, ABC News reported. The jury submitted several handwritten questions to Judge Sherry . Stephens after the testimony of Detective Esteban Flores of the Mesa, . Arizona, police department. Some read: . 'When interviewing Mr. Alexander's roommates, did they ever show concern for his extended absence?' 'Did you ever check into their alibis?' Authorities . say Alexander was shot in the head with a .25-caliber handgun, the same . caliber gun Arias and her grandparents reported stolen from their . Northern California home about a week before the killing. Arias was . staying with them at the time. Crime scene: Photographs shown in the murder trial of Jodi Arias show the crime scene at Travis Alexander's home in Mesa, California after his body was found . Bloodied: Investigators described the 2008 crime scene as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen . Authorities . say they found sexual photographs in a camera inside Alexander's home . that place Arias there on the day he was killed. The photos, displayed for jurors this week during her trial in Phoenix, show Arias nude in Alexander's home, Alexander alive in the shower, then his dead body in the bathroom. Police say the photos are time-stamped on the day he was killed. Detectives say Arias' bloody palm print and hair also were found at the scene. None of the weapons used in the killing has been recovered. Prosecutors say Arias came prepared to kill the 30-year-old devout Mormon, businessman and motivational speaker, and neglected to call police after leaving behind a crime scene that investigators described as among the most gruesome they'd ever seen. They say she attacked him in a jealous rage after he broke up with her. She says she broke up with him after about five months of dating, but the two continued to see each other sexually. Arias' attorney, Jennifer Willmott, told jurors in opening statements that Alexander ‘lunged at Jodi in anger’ on the day he was killed, and she had to defend herself.","Jodi Arias, 32, is charged with murder of her on-again-off-again boyfriend Travis Alexander in 2008 .

"By . Sara Lawrence . PUBLISHED: . 19:39 EST, 5 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:29 EST, 6 June 2012 . Lying in a hospital bed, I watch as a nurse inserts an intravenous drip into my left arm. It stings a little, and almost immediately I notice a strong vitamin C taste  in my mouth, as if I’ve been  eating oranges. As the liquid level in the bag slowly sinks, I start to feel brighter, sharper and my jagged headache softens. Mixed bag: Sara Lawrence puts an extreme hangover treatment, which involves being attached to an intravenous vitamin drip, to the test . After 20 minutes, I look in my hand mirror and notice my bleary, bloodshot eyes have cleared, too. Despite this, I cannot help feeling a little guilty. You see, I’m not being treated for a serious illness — there are certainly no life-saving medicines in the drip. I am suffering nothing more serious than a hangover, and am hooked up to what has become known as the ‘party drip’ — a cocktail of vitamins designed to act as a quick-fix cure for a heavy night out. Many deluded devotees view it as a near- magic potion that allows them to binge-drink all night as often as they wish without any ill effects. The latest celebrity advocate is pop singer Rihanna, who tweeted a picture of her arm hooked up to a drip last month, after a night of partying. Though it was reported at the time that she’d been rushed to hospital after a night of excess, she was actually undergoing a medical procedure that has taken celebrity circles by storm. And, after finding a receptive market in Hollywood, the IV drips are becoming increasingly popular in Britain. Write caption here . But doctors and other experts warn that not only do the drips encourage dangerous levels of alcohol consumption, in the wrong hands they could put patients at risk of a range of side effects, from mild infections to potentially fatal anaphylactic shock (a severe allergic reaction). So far in Britain, the treatment is offered at just a handful of exclusive clinics and health clubs for more than £200 a time —but it is attracting a growing client base. Last year, Simon Cowell admitted he enjoys a weekly IV drip of B12, magnesium, vitamin C and, he says, ‘something for your liver’ — a procedure recommended to him by Dannii Minogue. ‘When you have it done, it’s an incredibly warm feeling,’ he said. ‘You feel all the vitamins going through you. It’s calming and gives you energy for a good few days.’ When I speak to another convert, air hostess Nicky Bailey, 32, she admits she uses a ‘party drip’ once a month. Partaker: Last year, Simon Cowell admitted he enjoys a weekly IV drip of B12, magnesium, vitamin C and, he says, ¿something for your liver¿ ¿ a procedure recommended to him by Dannii Minogue . She had her first £225 treatment in December at the EF Medispa near her home in Kensington, West London. ‘I was busy working and socialising in the run-up to Christmas,’ she says. ‘I was exhausted, run down and hungover, and needed hydrating and a good boost of vitamins to see me through the party season. ‘Normally, my hangovers last for 24 hours and my headache only starts to recede by the evening of the following day. ‘I feel hazy, with glazed eyes, a brain that feels like spaghetti and an inability to concentrate. ‘After the drip, I felt as if all the badness had been filtered out and I was clear again. 'My mind was sharp, the headache gone and I could even go shopping, something I never do the morning after.’ Far from worrying about the effect her hard-drinking lifestyle might be having on her health, Nicky sees the drip as her ticket to more partying. ‘I need to give my body something back because I take so much out of it,’ she says. ‘I’m going to Ibiza on a week’s holiday with friends next month and I’ve already booked my session for when I get back.’ An early advocate of the party drip is Heather Bird, 42, the founder of HB Health in Knightsbridge, a clinic that offers a variety of intravenous vitamin infusions. She started ‘dripping’ in 2000 and still uses them regularly. ‘I have trimmed my partying back over the past couple of years, but I used to be out every single night except Sunday,’ she says. ‘This year, I was flown out to Mexico for Philip Green’s 60th birthday party, which was amazing. I also had great fun with Simon Cowell and Kate Moss at Philip’s 59th birthday at Mosimann’s private dining club in Belgravia.’ Heather claims her body needs help to cope with the fast-paced lifestyle she enjoys — and the party drip offers a perfect solution. ‘I gave myself four days of dripping to keep up my stamina for the partying over the Jubilee weekend,’ she says. ‘My penthouse by Albert Bridge overlooks the river, so I was hosting parties non-stop and wanted to look and feel my best.’ But Dr Adam Cunliffe, principal lecturer in human nutrition at London South Bank University, says of the drips: ‘They’re a load of blithering nonsense. People should curb their excesses. ‘I am not aware of any studies that show a genuine physiological benefit. A celebrity endorsement is not evidence. ‘The idea that pumping yourself full of vitamins and minerals is going to redress the balance of  an unhealthy lifestyle is a lot of hocus pocus when there is no  medical, scientific or clinical research to back it up.’ Concerns: Doctors and other experts warn that not only do the drips encourage dangerous levels of alcohol consumption, in the wrong hands they could put patients at risk of a range of side effects . He believes most of the benefit people claim to feel is down to rapid rehydration. ‘The clinics are working on the assumption their clients are deficient,’ he says. ‘The other assumption is that an excess of vitamins and minerals has some kind of benefit when, in fact, if you are not deficient in something and are given more of it, it does pretty much nothing except be excreted through your urine.’ As for the potential dangers, Dr Cunliffe says: ‘If the procedure is done by a qualified medic who knows how to find a vein and uses clean needles, and the contents of the infusion are from a reputable pharmaceutical supplier, there’s no reason why it should be dangerous. ‘What is dangerous is a less than authentic set-up offering the service at a much lower price, maybe cutting corners in the process. 'People who want to do what the stars are doing, but don’t have the same money may be tempted into situations that don’t have high clinical standards. There would be all kinds of risks, including infection and anaphylactic shock.’ HB Health and EF Medispa, where I try the party drip, use qualified nurses overseen by a doctor. Jonathan Chick, professor of health sciences at Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, says: ‘Giving a drip has to be done with care — some people get a fluid overload, which is dangerous. ‘Also, in rare cases, some vitamin preparations can cause ana- phylactic shock. ‘A hangover is never dangerous, but a heavy session of drinking could be. If you cannot control your drinking, you may need to re-think your relationship to alcohol.’ Dr Mark Wright, a consultant liver specialist at University Hospital Southampton, is also scathing about vitamin drips. ‘Medically, . this is useless,’ he says. ‘What worries me is the idea that you can . spend now and pay later with your body — you cannot abuse alcohol and . expect this to work as a quick fix. Popularity increasing: So far in Britain, the treatment is offered at just a handful of exclusive clinics and health clubs for more than £200 a time ¿but it is attracting a growing client base . ‘I work with the British Liver Trust, and our message is you need to drink in moderation and ideally have three or four alcohol-free days each week. No amount of intravenous vitamins can change that.’ When I try the party drip, I give it a robust testing. I book an appointment at EF Medispa and have a heavy night at London’s Groucho Club the night before. I drink two Twinkle cocktails — a delicious, but potent mix of champagne, vodka and elderflower liqueur — before four large glasses of white wine and an espresso martini. I stagger out at 3am and barely remember the journey home. The next day I feel so fragile I can’t go to my regular early-morning spin  class. I feel shocking — headachy, nauseous and filled with an overwhelming sense of doom. Unable to face breakfast, I head off to EF Medispa. There is a menu of eight drips, which promise to boost your immune system, calm anxiety or speed up metabolism. I choose the vitality-booster treatment, a so-called instant  ‘pick-me-up’ containing vitamin C, B vitamin complex, and the minerals selenium, magnesium, zinc and chromium. Being hooked up to an IV line is associated with being ill in hospital, so using it to get over a hangover feels utterly wrong. The better I feel, however, the less I care. An irresponsible attitude, which makes me worry how easily others could become hooked on it. The bag takes 30 minutes to empty. When I walk out of the spa — whether it is all in my mind or not — I’m so energised that I power-walk the three miles home. I definitely feel better, though that may just be down to a ‘placebo effect’, rehydration and the passage of time. And I have to agree with Dr Wright  that this is a dangerous game to play. If party drips became  part of my routine, I know I would be inclined to treat my body like an amusement park rather than a temple. And the price to be paid for that is considerably higher than £225 a go.","'Party drip' containing cocktail of vitamins is proving popular as quick fix for hangovers .

But the rising star may have only been 15 at the time of the shoot, according to various sources. Model Ondira Hardin is at the centre of a new row over whether or not Vogue photographed her before she was 16. Vogue pledged in May to stop using models aged under 16 for print work in all international editions, as part of a new Health Initiative. But fashion news websites Fashionista and Jezebel have done some cunning calendar arithmetic and calculated that Hardin was possibly only 15 at the time of a group photo shoot featured in China's August edition.

Baby-snatch: 30-year-old Gabriela Osorio pleaded guilty to trying to murder a new mother and stealing her week-old daughter . A California woman desperate to have a baby who faked pregnancy for nine months and stabbed another young mother to steal her newborn daughter, will spend years in jail, she was told yesterday. Gabriela Osorio was sentenced to 24 years in prison over the brutal attack and kidnapping in Santa Ana, California, in May 2010, the Orange County Register reports. Osorio, 28, befriended the 26-year-old Hispanic victim and her week-old baby, bringing around gifts for the child. But unbeknown to her, Osorio had been faking a pregnancy for nine months. She told her boyfriend and family she had given birth two months before but her daughter remained in hospital with a medical problem. Desperate to cover her lie and to be a mother, she searched hospitals and baby clinics for a baby to kidnap before finding her victim. She turned up at the victim's home unannounced in May 2010 and attacked her - first attempting to suffocate her, then stabbing her three times in the ribs, shoulder and back of the neck . The victim bit off the top of Osorio's finger in the struggle and managed to make it outside, where she called for help. Her neighbors and brothers heard her calls and confronted Osorio, who was still armed with a knife. She threatened to harm the baby but handed the child over to a neighbor when police arrived. The troubled woman pleaded guilty, yesterday, to attempted murder, kidnapping of a child under the age of 14, first-degree residential burglary, criminal threats and false imprisonment by violence. She also admitted three felony counts of aggravated assault with a knife causing great bodily injury, according to a statement from the Orange County district attorney’s office.

The father of the Georgia high school student who died after he got trapped inside a roll of wrestling mats believes his son was murdered, it was revealed today. Lowndes High School student Kendrick Johnson, 17, became lodged inside the roll of mats, upside down, Lowndes County sheriff's officials have said. His body was found Friday morning in the high school's old gym after his family reported him missing Thursday night. Life cut short: Johnson was found Friday after going missing a day earlier. Initial reports said Johnson fell in after he reached for a shoe but authorities have not yet made an official determination. 'It's an open investigation,' said Lt. Stryde Jones from the Lowndes County . Sheriff's Office. 'We are interviewing students and reviewing . school security cameras.' Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, said his son was murdered. 'I want to express how did my son go missing during school hours in broad . daylight? 'We know our son was murdered while he was at Lowndes High . School. We do know that,' he told a local television station. The father is having a difficult time dealing with the passing of his son. 'How can you go on when you have a beloved child who wakes up everybody . in the house and makes a laugh out of everything, how can you go on? It's hard.' The teen's aunt, Anastasia Roe, said her nephew was a good student but ran into problems with another student last year, FoxNews.com reported. Grief: Johnson's father says its 'hard' moving on after his beloved son died. But an autopsy found no signs of a struggle, officials said. It is possible Johnson may have been reaching for a shoe that had fallen into the mat. A shoe was found at the scene, but it is not known whether it belonged to Kendrick. 'At some point, Kendrick Johnson either reached into the center of one of the rolled mats or fell into the center opening of the mat and became lodged,' sheriff's officials said in a statement. 'We feel like he was trying to reach a shoe that was down that hole,' the sheriff told the Valdosta Daily Times, adding that no one knows for sure why he reached into the mat 'but him and the good Lord.' The student was upside down in the mat, with blood rushing to his head and upper extremities, causing him to pass out, the sheriff said. Keeping a human body upside down for an extended period of time can be deadly, causing hemorrhaging, stroke and heart failure. Although investigators do not believe foul play was involved, the sheriff said he and his investigators will continue interviewing students and friends who have additional information.

More than 100 people have been shot, stabbed and possibly burned to death in the Syrian city of Homs this week in a suspected massacre by President Bashar al-Assad's troops. A monitoring group said women and children were among the 106 victims killed by forces who stormed Basatin al-Hasawiya, an impoverished district on the fringes of the city. The reports, which are not independently verified, potentially shed further light on the authoritarian regime's use of violence against its own citizens. Scroll down for video . Massacre: A human rights group has said President Bashar al-Assad's troops killed more than 100 people in a massacre this week in the Homs district of Basatin al-Hasawiya. The picture shows a previous attack on the city . Violence: The attack is being blamed on troops allied to Syria's embattled President Bashar al-Assad, pictured here making a public address last week . Around 60,000 people have been killed in the bloody civil war that has raged in the country for nearly two years between rebel forces and the state army loyal to President Assad. Rami Abdelrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said: 'The Observatory has the names of 14 members of one family, including three children, and information on other families who were completely killed, including one of 32 people.' Abdelrahman, a Syrian who has documented human rights violations in Syria since 2006 and now reports on killings by both sides of the 22-month-old conflict, demanded that the UN investigate the deaths. The deaths of 108 people, including nine children and 34 women, were also recorded in the town of Houla, Homs province in May 2011. U.N. monitors blamed the army and pro-Assad militia for the attack. Homs saw some of the biggest anti-Assad protests at the start of the revolt and heavy bombardment levelled whole neighbourhoods. Ruins: Pictures taken earlier this week in the city of Aleppo reveal the destructive nature of the violent conflict between state forces and the Free Syrian Army . The attacks killed thousands of people as the army attacked rebels who had moved into the city. The UN sent observers to Syria in April 2011 but after several attacks on their convoys they left in August, complaining that both sides had chosen the path of war. Abu Yazen, an opposition activist in Homs, said the rebel Free Syrian Army occasionally entered the farmlands of Basatin al-Hasawiya to attack a nearby military academy. 'Assad's forces punish civilians for allowing the rebels to enter the area,' he said . Another activist said it was unclear which group carried out the attack, but said some of the victims appeared to have been burnt after they were killed - something the opposition says is often done by the pro-Assad shabbiha militia. Brutal: The UN claims that approximately 60,000 people have died in the bloody Syrian conflict that has lasted 22 months . However, many houses had been torched during the raid, which could also explain the burnt bodies. The shabbiha are drawn largely from Assad's minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. Homs has seen some of the worst sectarian violence between Alawites and other minorities and Syria's majority Sunni Muslim population, who are leading the uprising.","Women and children among the 106 dead in Basatin al-Hasawiya district .

Joseph James said he knew something was wrong with his fraternal twin brother Johnathan James in August 2011, but he was terrified of doing anything. Joseph's step-mother Tina Alberson and his father Michael James, of both Dallas, Texas, face life in prison over charges that they caused 10-year-old Jonathan's death by depriving him of water.

More than half of parents believe coping with teenagers is far more testing than caring for a newborn baby, according to the study . New parents may think they have it bad with an endless stream of dirty nappies and sleepless nights to contend with. But little to do they know, the worst is yet to come. The hardest part of parenting is when a child first hits the age of 13, a new study has revealed. More than half of parents believe coping with teenagers is far more testing than caring for a newborn baby. They said that problems caused by surging hormones, indifferent attitudes and growing sexual awareness makes this period the hardest time of parenthood. The study, by parenting website Netmums, looked into the difficulties of bringing up children and the various issues parents have to face. Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums, said: ‘It’s easy to overlook that being a parent to a teenager is perhaps more testing than with a newborn. ‘It was quite comforting for me to learn other parents think 13 is the hardest age as it is almost like a re-birth of your children when puberty kicks in. ‘The change can seem it has occurred almost overnight, and the child you thought you knew has suddenly turned into somebody you don’t recognise. ‘I often liken the change to the sulky teenager Kevin Enfield in the comedy sketch by Harry Enfield - a young man becoming a werewolf once they reach 13. ‘But I think mums and dads are better at understanding the pressures of being a teenager more than their adolescent children realise.’ Almost a quarter (24 per cent) of the 1,000 mothers and fathers questioned said that their children were most troublesome at 13. And the biggest cause of arguments was found to be teenagers’ laziness. More than half of parents - 55 per cent - say teenage children not pulling their weight with household chores was a common cause for a row. While there are many happy aspects to bringing up children, almost a quarter of the 1,000 parents questioned said their children were most troublesome at 13 . Mrs Freegard, 44, added: ‘The difference between caring for a teenage child and a newborn is that parents have to be in charge in a completely different way. ‘Teens will try to push the boundaries and push buttons you didn’t think you even had. ‘Parents have to give their adolescent children room to find their feet given their new state of independence. ‘But it is all about compromise, parents still have to let the child know there is a line they can’t cross. ‘I often liken the change to the sulky . teenager Kevin Enfield in the comedy sketch by Harry Enfield - a young . man becoming a werewolf once they reach 13' -   Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums . ‘I think 13 might be the 15 of previous generations as puberty is hitting a little bit earlier these days.’ The study found that other tough issues which rear their heads at this age included children becoming concerned about their body image and depression. A worried 14 per cent admit that their teens are very ‘body conscious’ and are keen to change their body shape. Further, a third of parents admit their child slams doors and shouts at them at least twice a week, while four per cent worry their child suffers depression. Another major cause of concern is their children becoming sexually active. The research found that one in seven parents of 11 to 18-year-olds - 14 per cent - suspect their child has lost their virginity with 43 per cent believing their child had sex for the first time while under the age of consent. While new parents may find it hard to imagine, raising a teenager was found to be the hardest part of parenting . New technology plays a part in modern parenting as gadgets cause rows with 39 per cent of families. Also, due to the influence of social media, nearly half of parents think their children are worried about their popularity on sites such as Facebook. This may explain why 49 per cent of mums and dads believe their kids fret about ‘being cool’ and ‘fitting in’. The poll of parents in the UK found more important priorities like education and career paths were not high on the agenda for teens. In addition, after 13 the next toughest stages of parenting mother and fathers complained of, were all when children are in their adolescence - the ages of 11, 12 and 14. The research did however reveal that by the time children are 17 the relationship they have with parents improves considerably. Mother-of-three Jane Green, who has two children in their late teens, agrees that 13 was a tough age to deal with. The 53-year-old receptionist from Southampton, Hampshire, said: ‘They seem to undergo a change around that time in attitude and mood and other things enter their lives which weren’t previously an issue. ‘Their constant mood swings and laziness would often lead to arguments and them shutting themselves in their room for hours on end. ‘All of a sudden you find yourself worrying about things that had never been an issue before - such as sex and their social lives.","Most parents believe coping with teenagers harder than caring for newborn .

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today condemned an attack at Aleppo University in Syria that killed scores of students and warned that the deliberate targeting of civilians was a war crime. 'Such heinous attacks are unacceptable and must stop immediately. All combating parties in Syria must abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law,' Ban said in a statement. 'Deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian targets constitutes a war crime.' Two explosions at Aleppo's university on Tuesday killed at least 87 people, many of them students attending exams. War crime: United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has strongly condemned the attack on Syrian university students in Aleppo . The cause of the explosions was not clear but the Syrian government and opposition activists blamed each other. According to the United Nations, more than 60,000 people have been killed during a 22-month-old revolt against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which began with peaceful protests but turned violent after Assad's forces tried to crush the demonstrations. Mr Ban's statement came as suicide bombers driving vehicles packed with explosives blew themselves up near security targets in northern Syria, killing at least 22 people, state-run media and activists said. The near simultaneous attacks in the city of Idlib brought the carnage of Syria's civil war to a second major urban center in northern government-held areas in as many days. The Syrian army stepped up its operations against rebels in the north following the attacks, saying it killed and wounded dozens of 'terrorist mercenaries' today in Aleppo. Blame: A statement from the Syrian government, headed by President Bashar Al Assad, said the rebels were behind the attack . In a statement, it pledged to continue 'chasing the remnants of terrorists and cleansing the homeland of their dirt'. The government routinely refers to rebels fighting to topple President Bashar Assad as terrorists. There were conflicting reports about the number of explosions Wednesday in Idlib, where rebels control much of the countryside, while the regime remains in charge of the city itself. The state-run SANA news agency said two suicide bombers hit a pair of roundabouts in the city, killing 22 people and wounding 30. It said security forces foiled two other would-be suicide bombers in the surrounding countryside who were allegedly planning to target security forces and civilians. A Syrian government official, however, said three bombings struck a major highway and a roundabout in Idlib, killing 22 people. Toll: The UN says 60,000 people have died in the fighting in Syria so far. A Syrian rebel fighter stands guard in Saif al-Dawla district in the centre of Aleppo city in this photo taken on August 22 . The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported triple car bombings, but said they targeted official vehicles near the local security headquarters and a checkpoint. At least 24 people were killed, most of them regime forces, it said. The reports could not immediately be reconciled. There was no immediate responsibility claim for Wednesday's bombings, but Jabhat al-Nusra, an al-Qaida affiliated group, has claimed responsibility for suicide blasts and other attacks on Syrian government targets in the past. The Obama administration has labeled the group a terrorist organisation. Meanwhile, Syria's Ministry of Higher Education suspended university classes and exams nationwide a day after the massive blasts that rocked Aleppo University, setting cars alight and blowing the walls off dormitory rooms. It remains unclear what caused the explosions, which hit the campus as students took exams. SANA said classes and exams were suspended 'in mourning for the souls of the heroic martyrs who were assassinated by the treacherous terrorist hand'. The minister of higher education, Mahmoud Mualla, was quoted as saying that Assad had ordered the university to be re-built 'with the utmost speed'. The Foreign Ministry, in letters sent to the U.N. Secretary General and the President of the Security Council, called on member states to condemn the 'terrorist' crimes in Syria, including the killings of Aleppo University students. The deputy head of the main opposition coalition today criticised Western and Arab states for failing to make good on promises to help the group isolate the embattled president. Pledges of support from states had proven cosmetic and 'loose', the group's vice president George Sabra told Saudi-owned pan-Arab daily al-Hayat. 'There is no real political support coming to the coalition to help isolate the regime,' he said. 'The friends of the Syrian regime are providing it with the tools to kill and the friends of the Syrian people are giving the regime the time it needs.' World powers have shown little appetite for armed intervention in Syria. The opposition and the government have blamed each other for the university blasts, which marked a major escalation in the struggle for control of Aleppo - Syria's largest city and once the country's main commercial hub. Activists said forces loyal to Assad launched two airstrikes on the area at the time of the blasts, while Syrian state media said a 'terrorist group' hit it with two rockets. The scale of destruction appeared inconsistent with the rockets the rebels are known to possess. Russia - Assad's long-standing ally and arms supplier - condemned the Aleppo explosions. 'It is clear that this was a ruthless, bloody provocation, revenge by terrorists for significant losses they have sustained in the confrontation with government forces,' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The competing narratives about what caused the blasts highlighted the difficulty of confirming reports from inside Syria. The Syrian government bars most media from working in the country, making independent confirmation of events difficult. Both anti-regime activists and the government sift the information they give to journalists to boost their cause. And civilians stuck in the middle avoid talking to the media, fearing reprisals from both sides for speaking their minds. Aleppo has been the focus of a violent struggle for control since rebel forces, mostly from rural areas north of the city, pushed in and began clashing with government troops last summer. Carnage: This image, taken on Monday, shows people gathering around destroyed buildings after airstrikes hit areas in Aleppo . The university is in the city's west, a sector still controlled by the government. Both activists and the Assad regime said those killed in Tuesday's blasts were mostly students taking their mid-year exams and civilians who sought refuge in the university dorms after fleeing violence elsewhere. On Tuesday, Syria's UN Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari told a Security Council meeting on combating terrorism that 'a cowardly terrorist act targeted the students of Aleppo University'. He said 82 students were killed and 152 were wounded. Elsewhere in the country, the Syrian military stepped up attacks in the cities of Idlib, Hama and Homs, and seized hundreds of heat-seeking missiles from militants in the southern province of Deraa, state media reported. The World Food Programme said Syria's . government had authorised it to step up food aid to some 2.5 million . people going hungry, but did not say when it would be able to reach them all.","Ban Ki-Moon called yesterday's attack 'heinous' and unacceptable .

We all know someone in the office who could do with washing under their arms, but more than a million lucky Britons could go without deodorant... and remain daisy fresh. These fragrant folk don't produce smelly B.O (body odour) due to a genetic defect, researchers say. Despite this nearly eight out of 10 of them still wear deodorant because it is seen as the 'cultural norm'. It's the pits: Most of us have been exposed to appalling body odour at some point, but one in 50 don't smell . Scientists say they are wasting their money and a simple gene test would show purchasing the personal hygiene product is unnecessary. A study of 6,495 women found 117 - about one in 50 - carry a rare mutated version of a gene known as ABCC11 which means they do not produce any underarm odour. Although 26 said they do not use a deodorant 78 per cent do on all or most days, reports the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. Professor Ian Day, of the University of Bristol, said: 'An important finding of this study relates to those individuals who, according to their genotype, do not produce underarm odour. 'One quarter of these individuals must . consciously or subconsciously recognise that they do not produce odour . and do not use deodorant, whereas most odour producers do use deodorant. Although one in 50 don't need deodorants, 80 per cent of them still use them . 'However, three-quarters of those who do not produce an odour regularly use deodorants. We believe these people simply follow socio-cultural norms. 'This contrasts with the situation in North East Asia, where most people do not need to use deodorant and they don't.' The research was based on a sample of women who are part of the wider Children of the 90s study at the University of Bristol. People who carry the variant are also more likely to have dry, rather than sticky, ear wax and checking this is a good indicator of whether or not a person produces underarm odour. Researcher Dr Santiago Rodriguez added: 'These findings have some potential for using genetics in the choice of personal hygiene products. 'A simple gene test might strengthen self awareness and save some unnecessary purchases and chemical exposures for non odour producers.' Previous studies have shown there is a link between a genetic variant located in the ABCC11 gene and underarm odour. Some glands produce sweat which, combined with bacteria, result in underarm odour. The production of odour depends on the existence of an active ABCC11 gene. But the gene is known to be inactive in some people. About five per cent of people who produce an odour do not use deodorant.","Around one in 50 people carry a mutated gene that means they don't produce smelly body odour .

A terminally ill nine-year-old whose last wish was to break a world record for receiving the most Christmas cards before succumbing to his life-long battle with cystic fibrosis has died - but not before hitting his goal. Dalton Dingus, who inspired hundreds of thousands around the world to help him reach his goal, amassed more than 700,000 cards in his rural Kentucky home, more than tripling the old record. 'The cards give him something to look forward to. Something to get excited about,' Dalton's mother Jessica Dingus told ABC News before his death. On Saturday, the tiny boy honoured as a courageous junior deputy, junior firefighter and junior rescuer by his local police and fire department, finally lost his fight. Big accomplishment: Nine-year-old Dalton Dingus, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, received hundreds of thousands of Christmas cards from strangers across the world wishing him a merry Christmas . Outreach: The nine-year-old, pictured with his family here, had battled cystic fibrosis his entire life before amassing more than 700,000 cards in just a few weeks . Multiplying: In what started out as a few several hundred cards quickly multiplied with the family soon unable to contain them all in their rural Kentucky home . In a funeral service held on . Wednesday just a sample of the handmade and store-bought cards were . seen decorating the Bethlehem to Cavalry Apostolic Church in . Salyersvile. 'There were lots and lots of people . there,' Kathy Smithers who attended the service told ABC. 'Members of . the police department, and the fire department, and the sheriff. It felt . like the whole town was here.' But what remains to be seen if the . 9-year-old did in fact earn his name in the record books. The last official Guinness record for a Christmas card category in 1992 was for 205,120 cards by Canadian Jarrod Booth. The family's . application to the Guinness World Records has yet to be made according . to a spokeswoman. Guinness is also currently not monitoring attempts for receiving Christmas cards. Extras: Adding one more card to his wish, along with a present from Santa seated before him, Dalton opens and reads just one of his hundreds of thousands of cards . Plea: It originally started after a family . friend posted on Facebook asking for cards bearing warm wishes that his . parents, Jessica and Tommy, pictured, could put up in the home - and the . message went viral . Generosity: The youngster received more than half a million cards, which no longer fit in his family home . Loved: UPS brought him 30,000 on Christmas Eve alone. Volunteers handpick ones for him to read . All over: Boxes and boxes of the cards were collected for the boy from all over the word, some in languages he and his family couldn't read . Outpouring: Piles and piles of letters are seen in USPS boxes awaiting sorting . 'At this time, there has been no . formal record application made with Guinness World Records for this . particular attempt, so we are unable to speculate on whether or not it . would constitute a new record,' spokeswoman Jamie Panas told ABC. If the application is submitted, Ms Panas said they will consider re-opening 'a designation for his feat.' Cards seen stacked in the family's . garage and swamping the home have come from as far afield as Germany, . the Ukraine and South Korea in what his mother Jessica calls 'a Christmas miracle'. The . first few trickled in after a family friend wrote a post on Facebook . asking for messages of support that Jessica Dingus could place on the . mantlepiece for her sick son. But as cards started coming in from . neighbours and friends, the Facebook message began spreading across the . social network and was picked up by local media. With this boost came thousands more cards, including stacks hand-delivered by Miss Kentucky and Kentucky State Troopers. Show of support: A stack of the cards was hand-delivered to Dalton by Kentucky state troopers . Battle: Dalton relies on a mask to help him breathe. Doctors said he had just days to live in October, but his mother said the cards have helped him become like he was before the illness really took hold, right . On Christmas Eve alone, the postal . service delivered 30,000 letters and 1,972 packages, some of which were . crammed full with cards, David Walton, from the US Postal Service, told . ABC. In addition to these, services such as UPS and FedEx delivered hundreds more. There are so many that the cards could longer fit in the family's . home and the postal service could no longer fit them all into a truck. Instead, in another show of goodwill, a . local television reporter had started filling a trailer to bring all . the cards to Dalton's grandfather's church. There, dozens of volunteers were sifting through the thousands of letters, . opening each one and saving special ones to take Dalton to read himself. 'One little girl said she wished he was her boyfriend,' volunteer Debra Williams said. 'The big majority of the town has sent cards or is helping out. Everyone just wants to do what we can.' Extra hands: Requiring extra help to handle and sort all the letters, the youngster was soon aided by volunteers, several seen here . Outpouring: The number of cards he has received has easily overtaken the last record in 1992 of 205,120 . The youngster had stage four cystic . fibrosis, which makes it near impossible to breathe. He took 18 . different medicines each day and wore a face mask to help him breath. In October, doctors gave him just two to eight days to live, Jessica Dingus said. But 'he's doing pretty good now,' she said. 'It's just been the best Christmas ever. He's excited for the first time in a long time. He's smiling more. He's . laughing more, he's beginning to become how he was two years ago. 'I think just knowing people really do care for him, that the cards let him know people love him, it has all helped.' There is no time limit on when Dalton can stop receiving the cards, the Guinness spokesperson said.","Dalton Dingus, who suffered cystic fibrosis, began receiving cards from all over the world when a family friend put plea on Facebook .

Proud: David and Katy are the proud parents of a baby girl who was created with the help of their amazing sisters . Mother and daughter together: Katy and David  decided to call her Beatrix - the middle name of the nan whose bequest financed their treatment . ‘I cried when Lucy said she would still donate her eggs for me,’ she recalled. ‘It meant that, genetically, the baby would be linked to both me and David.’ But Lucy, who had a boyfriend, and no children of her own, decided against carrying the baby for her sister as well. ‘We knew she wouldn’t be a surrogate too because the baby would feel too much like hers,’ Mrs Slade said. ‘It would have been hard for her to have her first pregnancy and then hand the baby to me.’ The Slades, who live in a £400,000 . detached house in Romford, Essex, were reluctant to find a stranger to . act as a surrogate after hearing stories about women who demanded to . keep the baby at the last minute.

Joshua Gaffney died at home shortly after a drug was administered allegedly in the presence of mental health nurses Amanda Young and Petia Gummer . A patient died after being given an overdose of SIX bottles of medication - when he was prescribed less than a teaspoon, a report has found. Joshua Gaffney, 22, who should have received less than a third of a 15ml bottle, had 21 times the prescribed amount of the drug clozapine. He died at home in Yeovil, Somerset, shortly after the liquid was administered allegedly in the presence of mental health nurses Amanda Young and Petia Gummer. A post-mortem examination and toxicology report found Joshua died from 'acute clozapine toxicology' after being given 84ml instead of just 4ml. The nurses were arrested and charged with Joshua's manslaughter but the CPS have formally dropped the allegation. Joshua's devastated mother, Tina Marren, also of Yeovil, said she was ""shattered"" by the decision. She said: 'My son was my life and that was taken away. I will never give up until I get answers for Joshua. He was a wonderful, lovely person. 'I feel the authorities are treating Joshua as if he was not important. As a family we are so angered, hurt, and devastated.' Joshua, who was being treated for mental illness psychosis, died at his home in Yeovil after being visited by Miss Young and Mrs Gummer on February 8 last year. A post mortem examination and toxicology report later found the cause of his death was 'acute clozapine toxicity'. It states that Joshua was given six full bottles of the drug - equal to 4,200mg or 84ml when his prescribed dosage was 200mg or 4ml. The nurses, who work out of Summerlands Hospital in Yeovil, have been suspended by their employer Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. They are subject to separate investigations by the trust and regulator the Nursing and Midwifery Council, who have placed restrictions on them. A report of a condition of practice hearing for Mrs Gummer said: 'The panel noted that Mrs Gummer denies the allegations. 'However, having considered the serious nature of the allegations, which involved a gross inaccuracy in drug administration, the panel considered that there is a real risk of repetition of the alleged behaviour should Mrs Gummer continue to practise without restriction.' Joshua Gaffney's devastated family at his grave: From left: his aunt Kim, mother Tina, cousin Lee, and sister Jasmine with her baby Leo . A spokeswoman for the Nursing and Midwifery Council said investigations would continue and a panel would decided whether the nurses had a case to answer. She added: 'If this is the case there will be a substantive hearing by the conduct and competence committee.' The Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said it would conduct its own internal investigation following the decision not to pursue criminal charges. A spokesman added: 'The trust would like to express its sincere condolences to Joshua's family. The nurses involved in the incident remain suspended from work. 'The findings of this investigation will be shared with Joshua's family, the national inspectorate - the Care Quality Commission and the local Primary Care Trust.' An inquest into Joshua's death has been opened and adjourned by East Somerset Coroner Tony Williams. His family are now preparing their case for the coroner along with a solicitor and say they will fight for answers to Joshua's death. Joshua's aunt Lorraine Marren, 44, said: 'We as a family are not allowed to say everything we would like to say about what happened to Joshua as this could still jeopardise the ongoing investigations. 'We will not give up fighting until the whole story is out - not only for Joshua but for every other family out there who need to be aware of this terrible tragedy.' A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that the charges against the two nurses had been dropped. The two nurses worked out of Summerlands Hospital in Yeovil . She said: 'The CPS received material from the police in relation to the matter and provided them with early advice on their investigation. 'We did not, however, receive a full file of evidence in this case. 'The decision to take no further action was made by the police. Our thoughts remain with Joshua's family.' A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police added: 'We received extensive advice from the Crown Prosecution Service on this matter and we were guided to the fact that we would not succeed in a prosecution in this case.' Joshua's inquest is due to be reconvened later this year. Both nurses declined to comment through the Somerset Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.","Joshua died after given 84ml of clozapine instead of 4ml, post-mortem examination hears .

The prince today accompanied the Duchess of York - along with their two daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie - to the wedding of her stepmother, Susan Ferguson, 66. Mrs Ferguson married former soldier Sir Richard Swinburn, 74, in a ceremony for 120 guests at the 900-year-old All Saints Church, Dummer, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. A royally windy wedding!

The couple chose to marry by the old 1928 service - meaning the new Mrs Swinburn did not include 'obeying' in her vows - which was conducted by the Rev Christopher Walker, a retired Chaplain to the armed forces, and it is thought that the bride's son gave her away. The Duchess of York - whose father Major Ronald Ferguson died nine years ago - wore a knee-length purple dress with a mauve shawl and a deep purple velvet coat. She topped her elegant ensemble with a delicate feathered fascinator. Family day out: The Duchess of York with ex-husband Prince Andrew and their eldest daughter Princess Beatrice . Her daughters - legendary for the adventurous headgear they chose to sport to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2010 - opted to go bare-headed.

A devastated mother-of-two is suing the NHS after doctors misdiagnosed a spinal condition which left her disabled - when she sneezed. Debbie Thomason, 35, claims she suffered permanent damage when doctors mistook cauda equina syndrome - a serious spinal condition - for another back condition. She already suffered from the nerve condition sciatica, but had to be rushed to hospital in May 2011 after she sneezed and collapsed in excruciating pain at her Northampton home. Debbie Thomason is suing the NHS after bungling doctors misdiagnosed a spinal condition which left her disabled when she sneezed . Doctors at Northampton General Hospital failed to detect that nerves at the base of her spine had compressed as a result of her sneeze and she had developed cauda equine syndrome. The condition, which is triggered by the narrowing of the spinal canal, causes nerve roots to compress below the level of the spinal cord. This requires patients to undergo urgent surgery or risk paralysis. But delayed operating on Mrs Thomason's spine for eight days and despite two further operations when doctors finally diagnosed her condition, she can now only walk a few yards and has been left virtually housebound. She is now suing the hospital for clinical negligence, claiming her debilitating condition should have been picked up much earlier than it was. Write caption here . Mrs Thomason, who has had to give up her job as a foster mother as a result of her condition, said: 'I am absolutely distraught. 'My life has been completely shattered by the permanent damage to my spine, which I believe could have been prevented if I had received the care I urgently needed. 'I had had sciatica at the time but nothing like this. It was basically caused by a simple sneeze as I was coming out of my bathroom. 'I never dreamed it could lead to being disabled. I feel so angry that this has happened and that nothing can be done for me. Happier times: Mrs Thomason on holiday in 2005 with daughter Bethany and husband Darren . With son Jamie on holiday in 2007. She claims she suffered permanent damage when doctors mistook a serious spinal condition for her ongoing back pain . 'By taking legal action I hope to highlight my case to the trust and help to save other people from going through what I have. 'While it is too late for me, it may not be for someone else.' Her husband Darren, 37, has had to give up his job as a bricklayer to become a full-time foster parent and look after the couple's children Jamie, 15, and Bethany, 12. He is also a full time carer to Debbie who cannot bathe of dress herself and needs assistance going to the toilet. Mr Thomason said: 'It is so sad what has happened. Debbie loved nothing more than taking the kids out to the park and playing games and we also really enjoyed our family holidays. Mrs Thomason was rushed into hospital after she collapsed in excruciating pain when she sneezed at her home and rushed to Northampton General Hospital . 'Now we can't even go out. She is pretty much permanently bed-ridden and in constant pain. It is so upsetting to see. 'She did have sciatica, but it was just nothing more than mild back ache. It was undoubtedly the sneeze which caused this. 'It was a powerful sneeze and she was left on her hand and knees in agony. 'But we believe there were unacceptable delays after her condition was not spotted and this has resulted in her current predicament.' Debbie and Darren Thomason on their wedding day in 2002.

Jay Strand, aged 10, died of a suspected asthma attack at his home in Snaith, East Yorkshire. His mother claims an ambulance took half an hour to reach him . A mother claims her son died as ambulance staff took half an hour to reach him, and just a month away from hospitals tests for what she believes was a 'serious undiagnosed condition.' Ten-year-old Jay Strand died in his mother's arms from a suspected asthma attack. Mother Donna Hellewell, from Snaith, North Yorkshire, who has chronic emphysema and has had one lung removed, desperately tried to resuscitate her son herself as he lay dying, but was physically unable. He died on December 11. She now believes he may have had a much more serious underlying illness. She said: 'He came out of the bathroom and asked for his inhaler. Then he said ""mum I'm dying"" and he collapsed. He was here one minute and gone the next. 'I tried to resuscitate him but there was just nothing. I knew he was gone.' Ms Hellewell - who said the family has a history of serious lung problems - claims Jay was just weeks away from a hospital appointment made so doctors could investigate whether he had a more serious condition. She said she had begged with the hospital to bring the appointment forward over concerns for her son's deteriorating health, but to no avail. Miss Hellewell believes her son might still be alive if the appointment had been moved forward and that Jay did not die from an asthma attack but an undiagnosed lung condition. She said: 'I suffer from chronic emphysema and I had to have a lung removed 18 months ago. 'I kept going back to my nurse and telling her that Jay was really ill and needed the appointment brought forward but nobody would take me seriously.' She said Jay cried out for help and struggled for breath while it took an ambulance 30 minutes to arrive. She desperately began CPR after his mouth turned black. Jay had been due to undergo tests at hospital next month to determine if he had a more serious condition, his mother says. She said her pleas to bring the appointment forward over fears for her son's health were ignored . Ms Hellewell put a breathing mask on her son but he pushed it back, saying: 'Mum, I'm dying.' After ringing an ambulance twice, she said one turned up half an hour later but her son was already dead. It is still not known whether Jay suffered from an underlying condition, but his mother has vowed to find out. A Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation trust spokesman said it was unable to release details about Jay's condition. A spokesman said: 'We offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to Jay's family and we are carrying out a full investigation into the care he received. Jay's mother Donna Hellewell, who has chronic emphysema, believes her son may have had a more serious lung condition and has now vowed to get answers . 'We will, of course be keeping Jay's family fully informed throughout and we would be happy to meet with them to hear their concerns and answer any questions they may have.' A Yorkshire Ambulance trust spokesman said:  'Firstly and foremost we would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family at this difficult time. 'Representatives from the Trust have met with the family to discuss their concerns and answer any questions. The Trust is still looking into some aspects of the emergency response and has confirmed that it will continue to liaise with the family directly to share their findings relating to this incident. 'The Trust will see what lessons can be learned and what action can be taken in the future as part of our continued commitment to provide the highest quality clinical care to patients.' Jay was a popular pupil at Snaith Primary School and hundreds attended his funeral. He left behind a father Leigh, 44, sister Lucy, 12, and brother Daniel, 26.

Plans to build the world's largest wind farm at one of Britain's top tourist attractions are facing new opposition after protestors mocked up a video showing how the giant turbines will 'blight' the area. The controversial project will see 250, . 450ft turbines built a few miles off Britain’s heavily-protected . Jurassic Coast - each one taller than the Wembley Stadium Arch. The £3 billion farm will be visible to the millions of tourists who visit the Dorset and Isle of Wight coast every year - and tourism chiefs fear it will drive visitors away from the area, currently England's only natural World Heritage site. Scroll down for video . The farm will 'blight' England's only natural World Heritage site, say protestors . Giant turbines: A computer similation of how the windfarm will look . Although plans for the farm have not yet been submitted, a protest group has made a short 3D film of what it will look like. The results have left local tourism bosses and residents shocked. They fear the farm will be a blot on the landscape and put people off from visiting the area. The turbines, which will protrude 330ft out of the water, will provide enough energy to power 820,000 homes. Dutch energy company Eneco have earmarked a 76 square mile area of the English Channel for the Navitus Bay Wind Park. They have got permission from the Crown Estate, which owns the sea bed, but they will need planning consent from the government. Andrew Langley, of Challenge Navitus, . a group opposing the farm, is an engineer specialising is mathematical . modelling and has created the video showing what the windfarm will look . like. He said: 'I decided to create the video because I felt the public had not been well informed about the plan. 'Hundreds of hours of work have gone into making the video, we combined different software and used mathematics to do it. 'It . provided a better and more accurate interpretation than a static image . and I think that the movement, brightness, and contrast, make it more . convincing and realistic. 'When people have seen the animation they think ‘is it really like that?’ 'I think it’s a risk to tourism, it’s not particularly pretty and that will affect it. 'The farm will be next to two areas . of outstanding natural beauty and next to a World Heritage site, so my . opinion is that if they were to put the wind turbines in as the . animation shows then it would be an eyesore.' Towering: At 450 feet each turbine will be taller than the Wembley arch (440 feet) The turbines will be positioned about 10 miles off Bournemouth and eight miles off Swanage. Stephen Chappell, a member of Bournemouth Borough Council, was one of a number of local dignitaries for local authorities who were shown the video. He said: 'Everyone who saw it was shocked. 'My reaction was one of concern when I saw it. It is a lovely setting on our Dorset Heritage Coast and the wind farm will have a huge impact. 'It will adversely effect tourism. People do not want to see a whole load of these wind farms when they visit the coast. 'It will also have effect on the water leisure and marine industries and the impact on migrating birds, they will get killed in the turbines. 'The video montage showed quite clearly the dominance of the proposal, the hundreds of turbines would transform the area from a residential and leisure bay with a small fishing fleet into an industrial site of an unacceptable scale.' Colin Jamieson, of Dorset County Council, added: 'It is clear that the impact of the wind farm is far more significant than that shown in the Navitus documentation. 'Of particular interest is the scale of the proposal, the distance from the coastal vantage points. 'The video montage showed quite clearly the dominance of the proposal.' Conor Burns, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, has launched a petition calling for the turbines to be positioned out of view of the coast. Helen Cassini, consents manager for Navitus Bay, said: 'Eneco is unable to comment on the accuracy of the ‘Challenge Navitus’ videos as we are not aware of the methodology which was used to create them on the website. 'At the public exhibitions Eneco showcased its own visualisation montages to give people an idea of how the wind farm could look from various viewpoints along the south coast with these being developed by an independent specialist consultancy which adhered to Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) methodology for developing visual montages for wind farm developments.'

Rupert Murdoch today laid bare the scale of the U.S. investigation into his media empire as he revealed his embattled newspaper group is handing over tens of thousands of emails to phone-hacking investigators at the Department Of Justice. During a dramatic appearance before the inquiry into press ethics in London today, the tycoon said approximately 60,000 internal emails  sent by and to employees at his now-defunct News Of The World and The Sun newspapers had been passed to investigators in the U.S. He made his shock admission as two major shareholder . groups today called on Mr Murdoch to step down as chairman of New York-based News . Corporation due to the 'lax ethical culture' exposed by the media . empire's 'still emerging scandals'. Under pressure: Rupert Murdoch must step down as chairman of News Corporation due to the 'lax ethical culture' exposed by the media empire's 'still emerging scandals', two major shareholder groups said today . The U.S. investor, the Christian Brothers Investment Services has said: 'It’s time for News Corp to be run for the benefit of all shareholders, not just the Murdoch family.' In a statement published by the Leveson . Inquiry today, Mr Murdoch, 81, revealed that a standards committee at his News International group is passing the internal emails to investigators at the Department Of Justice, as well as police officers at Scotland Yard in London. It said: 'Since July 2011, [the team] has actively cooperated with the Metropolitan Police . as well as with the United States Department of Justice, turning over . evidence of alleged or suspected illegality, and responding to all . requests for information. 'This has led to the arrests of a number of News International employees.' The revelation that Mr Murdoch's British . business arm is cooperating with U.S. officials exposes the serious threat the hacking scandal is now posing . to News Corporation. Ongoing scandal: Protesters dressed as James and Rupert Murdoch outside the High Court in London yesterday . It will be seized upon by opponents of . Murdoch - both inside and outside the U.S. arm of his empire - who are . eager to remove him from his position of power. The phone-hacking scandal which has engulfed Murdoch's British newspaper empire first extended to the U.S. last month after it was claimed that 9/11 families may be among hacking victims along with a number of celebrities whose phones were allegedly hacked while on U.S. soil. The phone hacking scandal which has rocked Murdoch's newspaper empire in the UK looks set to taint his U.S. media operations. Lawyer Mark Lewis has previously won damages for celebrities against the News of the World in London and the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. He is now planning to take on News Corp in the U.S. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder launched an investigation last year after reports that News of the World journalists asked a New York private detective to hack into the phones of 9/11 victims -  which he declined to do. Mr Lewis will team up with Norman Siegel, a New York-based lawyer to represent 20 families of September 11 victims. Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell is expected to launch a lawsuit claiming his phone was hacked while in the States. A second suit is linked to the England football team - believed to be David Beckham who now lives with his family in Los Angeles. The third is described as a ‘Hollywood case’ as the person was in touch with a well-known celebrity which made him a target. The FBI was believed to have questioned actor Jude Law last year about allegations his phone was hacked while he was in the U.S. Princess Diana’s former butler Paul Burrell is expected to be one of the trio of individuals due to launch lawsuits claiming that their phones were hacked while they were in America. Last week a lawyer for phone-hacking victims in the UK flew to New York to meet the American attorney representing 9/11 families. Mark Lewis, the solicitor representing many celebrities who have won damages against the News of the World in London, said he is planning to launch three civil lawsuits over alleged phone-hacking against News Corp. Last Friday it was also revealed that James Murdoch could be hauled before a judge in the U.S. to answer questions about phone hacking. Rupert's son, the deputy chief . operating officer of News Corp, would be quizzed over whether payments . to hacking victims were part of a cover-up, said lawyer Mr Lewis. Mr . Murdoch quit as chairman of BSkyB in March and moved from London to New . York after becoming a ‘lightning rod’ for criticism over the scandal. Mr Lewis then last week revealed that . he has been contacted by people who accuse Fox News and The New York . Post, which are both owned by News Corp, of engaging in criminal . behaviour. The Murdochs' U.S. legal problems come as two major shareholder . groups today called on Mr Murdoch to step down as chairman of News . Corporation due to the 'lax ethical culture' exposed by the media . empire's 'still emerging scandals'. The Local Authority Pensions Fund . Forum (LAPFF), a British organisation whose members control £100billion . of investments, and U.S. group Christian Brothers Investment Services . (CBIS) have announced that they will file a joint motion seeking an . independent chairman to replace Murdoch. The . move is not the first time that LAPFF and CBIS have called on Murdoch, . 81, to quit, but the latest bid will be much more serious for the media . mogul. CBIS proposed he step down ahead of the most recent News Corp annual meeting last October. Under pressure: Lawyer Mark Lewis (left) has been investigating claims of phone hacking in the U.S. James Murdoch (right) appears at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in London yesterday . But the group was unable to rally . much support because it could only file a 'floor' resolution after . missing the spring deadline due to the phone hacking scandal, reports . the Daily Telegraph. This meant that only those in attendance at the . annual meeting could vote. By . announcing their intention now, the joint motion will be open for all . shareholders to vote on ahead of this October's annual meeting, instead . of just those at the Los Angeles event. Not over yet: Rupert Murdoch leaves the Leveson Inquiry in London today as phone hacking lawsuits were being prepared against his U.S. media empire . The development comes a day after News Corp suffered another tumultuous day at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in London. With . James Murdoch in the witness seat, the media empire disclosed emails . showing how Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt 'shared their objectives' to . take full control of broadcaster BSkyB. The damning dossier, which has led to . calls for Mr Hunt's resignation, showed the top Tory's aides engaged in . an extraordinary pact with News Corp to push the deal through despite . grave concerns from media watchdogs. The sensational cache, which reveals . 'absolutely illegal' information was being freely exchanged between . government and big business, was published by the Leveson Inquiry on the . eve of Rupert Murdoch's testimony to the hearings today. James Murdoch yesterday told the Leveson Inquiry that a typed 'emoticon' after this email meant the 'illegal' reference was a joke.","Standards committee working for tycoon is trawling through emails sent by and to employees at now-defunct News Of The World and The Sun .

A woman has spoken of the horror she felt on discovering her late husband was in fact her father. Valerie Spruill, 60, from Doylestown, Ohio, only made the horrifying discovery through a DNA test after her husband Percy had died. Spruill, who has three children and eight grandchildren, is now telling her story in an attempt to find her other siblings from her father. Secret: Valerie Spruill, 60, from Ohio, discovered her husband was in fact her father after he died . 'It needs to be told, because children need to know where they come from,' she told the Akron Beacon Journal. 'And I know it hurts, because I have been devastated by this.' The confusion began because she was looked after by her grandparents from 3-months-old. Her mother Christine was one the 'night ladies' - as she called them - who . testified in the 1980 trial of Summit County Probate . Judge James Barbuto, who was eventually convicted of sex charges. Valerie's mother and father got together when he was just 15 and the number of children they had is unclear, but she is aware of six brothers. She was cared for by her grandparents and her mother visited, although Valerie thought she was a family friend. Aged nine, she was devastated when she found out that Christine - who died in 1984 - had been her mother. It also meant the man she thought was her father was in fact her grandfather. But she was not told who her real father was and Valerie later met and married Percy. Percy, who was born in Mississippi, worked in Akron as a truck driver and a parking-lot attendant. He died in 1998 after a brief illness at the age of 60, but for years, she had heard bizarre rumours about their relationship. She finally learned the truth about her marriage from an uncle after Percy died, and confirmed the relationship with a DNA test after finding his hairs on a brush in their room. She does not know for certain that he was aware he had married his daughter, but she said she strongly . believes he did know but was simply . afraid to tell her. Since his death, Valerie, who is retired, has been seeing a therapist to help her deal with the horrifying revelation. Valerie has fought through serious . health problems, including a lengthy hospital stay, which she believes were only brought on by the stress of . discovering the traumatic family secret . She is hoping her story may help her reach additional siblings she didn’t know existed.

Prince Charles has earned more than £1 million from people dying without a will in the past six years, it has emerged. Financial accounts published by the Duchy of Cornwall - the private estate which funds the public, charitable and private activities of Charles and his family - reveal he earned £552,000 from the unusual power this year alone. Under constitutional law dating back to medieval times, the Prince of Wales is entitled to the estates of people who die without a will in Cornwall, but for the past 40 years he has decided to donate the money to charities. Boost: Prince Charles has earned more than £1 million from people dying without a will since 2006. He earned £552,000 from the unusual power this year alone. Prince Charles is pictured with the Duchess of Cornwall . In Britain, dying without a will, known as ‘dying intestate’, means money left by the deceased goes to the Government. But in Cornwall, their property passes to Prince Charles in what critics say amounts to the Royal overseeing a secret fiefdom. Accounts that go back to 2006 published on the Duchy’s website disclose total earnings of £1.019 million. Graham Smith, chief executive of the campaign group Republic, which is calling to abolish the Duchy said: 'Prince Charles has absolutely no right to that money. It is a ridiculous situation. 'Anywhere else in the country that money goes into the public purse but in Cornwall it goes into his pocket. It needs to stop.' 'Secret fiefdom': The seaside fishing village of Port Isaac, Cornwall. If Cornish residents die intestate, their property passes to Prince Charles . As the Duke of Cornwall, Charles has several little known rights and powers, including the right to veto Westminster legislation. One of these is Bona Vacantia - from the Latin meaning vacant land - the right to claim the estates of people who die without heirs in the county. Under the Charter of Edward III, the eldest son of the ruling monarch inherits the title of the Duke of Cornwall. The title comes with the land and income of the Duchy of Cornwall - some 132,000 acres of land, much of it in Cornwall. The Prince’s annual income as Duchy of Cornwall was £18.3 million last year - the majority earned from residential and commercial property rents on the land. The Prince's annual income as Duchy of Cornwall was £18.3 million last year, the majority earned from residential and commercial property rents on the land. Pictured is the Cornish fishing village of Polperro (left) and (right) some land owned by Charles . According to the Duchy website, all money derived from people dying without a will is donated to charity through the Duke of Cornwall’s benevolent fund. A Duchy of Cornwall spokesperson said: 'The Prince of Wales decided almost forty years ago that the bona vacantia funds should be given to charity.' Charles pays income tax voluntarily at the highest rate, netting the Inland Revenue around £4.5 million last year.","Financial accounts published by the Duchy of Cornwall reveal he earned £552,000 from the unusual power this year alone .

The shooter didn't pause or panic as he turned and left Woodward to die in a pool of his own blood - he simply got into a waiting Lincoln MKX getaway car and fled the scene. Police found the car, which was a rental, in Queens on Wednesday and talked to the couple who had rented it. The Post reports that detectives don't believe the two were in the vehicle at the time of the shooting, but may have loaned it to the assassins. Woodard grew up in privilege in Los Angeles. His mother, Sandra Wellington owns the once-successful United International Mortgage. Other family members are well-connected lawyers and entrepreneurs, the New York Times reports. Mrs Wellington is married to the ex-boyfriend of former soap star Tonya Pinkins, who claims the family is involved in criminal business dealings. Ms Pinkins, who starred in 'All My .

Police on Tuesday refused to comment on . whether they are investigating Woodard's mother's business in connection . with the shooting. Ms Wellington could not be reached for comment on the allegations Wednesday night. Woodard attended the private Campbell Hall high school, where he was a star basketball player. He was a member of the exclusive invitation-only Jack and Jill of America society, which caters to upper-class black families. Family: Woodard, seen here with his five-year-old daughter, came from a wealthy family - but continued his hard-partying lifestyle until his death . For college, he went to Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, a $55,000-per-year private school. Family members say he was a second-year law student at the University of West Los Angeles School of Law, another private school. In college, he drove a Range Rover, friends told the Times. More recently, he had his eye on buying a Mercedes-Benz CL63 AMG, a luxury car with a base price of $153,000. Friends say he worked as a party and nightclub promoter. At clubs he threw around large chunks of money on expensive booze and private tables - partying with actors and athletes. He once bragged about getting beaten up by the bodyguards for the R&B prince Usher, the Post reports. Sadet Kolo, 36, who was skateboarding near the victim told the New York Daily News: 'It came out of nowhere. I turned around and saw a man next to me, on the ground. I called 911 and told him ""Hang on. Help is on the way"" Intent: The gunman is seen in khaki pants and a dark top loitering next to the grey car as he waits for his victim to come walking down the street . Woodards neighbors often complained about the noise from his raucous parties. However, . beneath the seemingly charmed life, friends say, Woodard has a darker . side. He continued to party hard into his 30s, even as his friends began . to settle down. Woodard also has a five-year-old daughter. Woodard also had a lengthy criminal record - at least 20 arrests. He was busted several times for stealing from upscale grocery stores - including in 2009 when he was arrested for robbery after struggling with a guard. He also had cocaine arrests. In the summer, Mrs Wellington's company, United International Mortgage, had its lending power revoked by California regulators. The company is also the target of numerous lawsuits alleging fraud and breach of contract. Friends say Woodard had a girlfriend in New York, but no one knows why he was visiting the city.

'Unsophisticated': Jason Rochford was caught after police found his mobile phone and used it to call his mother . An 'unsophisticated' armed robber was tracked down by police after he dropped his mobile phone and police called his mother. Jason Rochford, 40, has been jailed for five years for threatening staff at Darlington Building Society in Stockton-on-Tees with a knife before running off with £2,500. He dumped his trousers and a coat close to the scene, but he had left his mobile in one of the pockets. Police searched his phone and found an entry for 'mam' and they rang her. They turned up at his house and found most of the cash he stole hidden in the kitchen. Rochford's lawyer described the career criminal as 'unsophisticated' and said he was in debt to a menacing person. He . got drunk and took ten sleeping pills before he armed himself with a . knife and approached the lone cashier, barged a customer out of the way . and passed over a bag. He said 'give me the money' before holding the six-inch weapon close to the worker's face, adding: 'I mean it.' Rochford fled from the scene with the money, and discarded his hat, jacket and jogging bottoms nearby. Hours later, a man spending £20 notes in a nearby supermarket told staff tell-tale details of the 4.30pm raid. He said the robber had discarded his clothes in Silver Street - just off the High Street - to get rid of evidence. Defending Rochford, Andrew Turton said he had given it so little thought he did not realise his DNA would be on the bag.

He committed the offence out of fear for himself. He was under pressure.' Rochford, from Stockton, who has 83 offences on his record, was jailed for five years after admitting robbery and having an offensive weapon. Judge Spittle told him he had terrified the cashier and customer with the 'substantial' knife and his unpredictable, drunken demeanour. 'I want you and anyone else to know that those who go and commit offences of this nature and arm themselves with a weapon will get greater punishment,' he said.","Jason Rochford dumped clothes nearby with his phone in one of the pockets .

"By . Rebecca Evans . PUBLISHED: . 19:04 EST, 16 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:42 EST, 18 December 2012 . Plastic banknotes are set to be introduced in Britain, replacing the paper money used for more than 300 years. The radical overhaul could see the more durable, waterproof and harder-to-counterfeit polymer sterling notes in circulation within three years. The Bank of England has put out a £1billion tender from 2015 for the printing of notes at its press in Debden, Essex. Paper money could be replaced within three years after being used for more than three centuries . Part of this process demands that bidders are able to cope with the change from paper to plastic from the start of the contract. Since 2003, the contract has been held by De La Rue – one of only two makers of polymer notes. The company, which prints more than 150 currencies, has just produced new plastic banknotes for the Pacific island of Fiji. Plastic notes were first introduced in Australia in 1988 as a measure against counterfeiting. They have proved a  success, and are apparently particularly popular with surfers who are able to keep money in their pockets without it disintegrating. Other countries to issue polymer notes include New Zealand, Romania, Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Vietnam. In Northern Ireland, a plastic fiver was introduced in 1999 to mark the Millennium. The Bank's chief cashier Chris Salmon has already said plastic notes were being looked at as a possibility to replace paper money . Plastic notes last much longer than cotton fibre-based paper ones. For instance, an Australian $5 bill lasts about 40 months, against six months for a £5 note. Polymer notes are more hygienic as they absorb fewer bacteria, harder to tear or crease – making them easier for vending machines – and waterproof, even able to survive being put in the washing machine. A key feature is a clear window, which normally contains an ‘optical variable device’ that splits light into its component colours and is extremely hard to counterfeit. Plastic notes can also contain holograms. They are also more environmentally friendly as fewer need to be produced and they can be recycled. However, they are considerably more expensive to produce and would create an initial cost as ATMs and vending machines would have to be adapted to accept them. The Bank’s chief cashier Chris Salmon had already revealed it was investigating the possibility of polymer or plastic-coated banknotes. It is understood that the Bank will initially introduce lower denominations, such as the fiver, which are in wider use so become dog-eared more rapidly. De La Rue’s chief executive Tim Cobbold said: ‘If you think about the life of a banknote, it takes quite a hammering. 'It’s being folded, it’s being crunched, it’s in and out of wallets and it could be in the wet or dry.’ But financial expert David Buik, of the retail and trading services firm Cantor Index, believes the conversion to plastic notes should not be rushed. ‘I think it’s something that needs to be more carefully thought out,’ he said. ‘Money laundering is a huge problem and if the security measures introduced could be used to make notes more traceable, then that would be very good. ‘But it needs to be applied internationally, the major countries all need to be singing from the same hymn sheet.’ A spokesman for the Bank of England said: ‘No definite decisions have been taken yet but the Bank is considering all options.’","Overhaul could see environmentally-friendly  notes introduced from 2015 .

He uploaded a photo of the pair on Facebook, with the caption 'Miss Alabama @_KatherineWebb stopped by to say hello today.' Webb's career is going from strength to strength after ESPN's cameras lingered on her during the Crimson Tide's rout of Notre . Dame on January 7 and announcer Brent Musburger commented on her looks to the . extent that the network had to offer an apology to viewers. She tweeted that the Big Apple trip was to meet clients. 'Mtngs all day with clients in the concrete jungle! #NYC Hanging with my cool agents from New York Model MGNT,' she wrote today, adding, '..meeting @realDonaldTrump next!' The catch up comes after Trump, who co-owns the Miss Universe Organization, took to Twitter the day after the game to . say he would be offering Webb a place as a judge at the next Miss USA . Pageant - also sparking rumors she might appear on his show, Celebrity . Apprentice. Twitter: 'Great time with @realDonaldTrump today,' Katherine Webb, right, wrote on Twitter, adding: 'Showing some of his goodies laying around in his office!' Is she next?

It was revealed yesterday that the 23-year-old will be back in front of the cameras ahead of the NFL's title game, serving as a correspondent for 'Inside Edition.' The gig is in the lead up to next month's Super Bowl in New Orleans. Webb calls the temporary job at 'inside Edition' 'an honor and a dream come true.'

The show . said on Wednesday that she'll start work January 28. 'Inside Edition' is . syndicated by CBS Television Distribution but not part of CBS' coverage . of the Super Bowl, which Webb won't be involved with.

A . week ago, the beauty queen let slip on Twitter that she is also set to . feature in Sports Illustrated, sparking speculation she could be . appearing in the coveted swimsuit edition.

If . she does feature in the swimsuit edition, she would join an impressive . list of supermodels including Elle Macpherson, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, . Cindy Crawford and Naomi Campbell. And judging Miss U.S.A is not the only new job offer she has received since the football game. The high-profile projects come despite Webb previously shunning interviews following her appearance in the stands on January 7. Webb told TMZ that . she cancelled eight interviews scheduled for last Thursday because she is . concerned her relationship with McCarron will simply be seen as a . 'celebrity status' thing. 'I want it to be about me and him,' she said. 'He's a guy I can see myself having a real future with.' Who's that girl? Miss Webb, quickly became an internet sensation after appearing on camera on Jan. 7 . Focus: Miss Alabama Katherine Webb has cancelled interviews so that her relationship with Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron is viewed as sincere, rather than as a celebrity stunt . She insisted that McCarron had not . asked her to cancel the interviews, after TMZ had earlier reported that . he was upset about being overshadowed by his girlfriend. The . website had reported that the quarterback was unhappy that media . outlets were ignoring his spectacular win over Notre Dame last Monday, and . giving coverage to her instead. But . other sources said the sports star just wanted to keep his private life . out of the public eye, and wants his team's accomplishments to be . recognised instead. Webb became an internet hit after her appearance at the Miami stadium, sparking fawning comments from sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Musburger. 'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you . get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old commentator Brent Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 'What a beautiful woman.' 'Wow!' former Ohio State quarterback Kirk Herbstreit added. 'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.' 'If . you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw . it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married . to his wife Arlene for 50 years. Fan: Miss Universe co-owner Donald Trump offered for Miss Webb to become a judge at Miss USA . Crowned: Katherine Webb during her reign as Miss Alabama at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas . With some media commentators and viewers branding their comments 'creepy', ESPN was forced to apologize the following day. 'We . always try to capture interesting . storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss . Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test. However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far . and Brent understands that.' But the reigning Miss Alabama simply said she was 'flattered' by their remarks. 'If he had said something along the . lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, . that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show after the game. 'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.' But as well as Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger. Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed' 'On . one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what . that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I . think they need to give Brent a break.' Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening. And ever since, her phone has been ringing off the hook, Trump told Page Six. 'She . was forced to change her phone number,' Trump said. 'She was getting . thousands and thousands of calls. Katherine has to stay grounded now . that she's become a big star.' Webb . was in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was . drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and . calls, but to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise. 'I know she's good looking,' McCarron . said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I . guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with . me.'

Shazed Ali, 26, fooled shoppers at a busy train station branch into handing over their cards by pretending there was a problem with them. The law graduate would then hold the cards up to the pinhole camera he had concealed inside the drinks carton so it could record their details, Birmingham Crown Court heard. A WHSmith sales assistant secretly recorded customers' credit card details using a camera hidden inside a carton of Ribena . The court was told that he captured information from 20 unwitting customers at the Birmingham New Street branch before his scam was rumbled. Ali then used the stolen card details to buy low-value items which went unnoticed on his victims' bank statements. He even had one purchase - a £20 memory stick - delivered to a neighbour's house to avoid detection. But the fraudster was caught out when he tried to buy a laptop - causing the concerned cardholder to alert police. At a preliminary hearing a district . judge said Ali, from Saltley, West Midlands, had committed a 'horrific . breach of trust' and described his offences as 'sophisticated' with 'a . degree of pre-planning'. But he was spared jail on Tuesday after a judge heard that he had no previous convictions and his girlfriend was pregnant. Birmingham Crown Court was told that he captured . information from 20 unwitting customers at the Birmingham New Street . branch (right) before his scam was rumbled . Ali, who pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud, was slapped with a community order, 100 hours of paid work and ordered to pay £475 court costs. Financial Investigator DC Michael Irwin, said: 'His trick was to claim there was a problem with the card and ask to see it, once the shopper handed it over he'd slyly hold it next to the carton so the pin-head camera could record the card numbers. 'We know that he successfully bought a computer memory stick valued at £20 and had it delivered to a neighbours' address, he may well have made other low-value fraudulent thefts that card holders have simply not spotted on their statements. 'People are generally trusting, you can understand why no-one was suspicious anything underhand was going on as this man worked for a well-known high street store. 'Our advice is to always be very protective of your card details, it's advisable not to physically hand over your bank card when paying and certainly not to let it out of your sight.'","Shazed Ali, 26, filmed shoppers at a busy train station branch in Birmingham .

The unique bacteria can cause pneumonia, intestinal and urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. In one outbreak at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, seven deaths were attributed to the 'superbug' after a New York Woman who came to the hospital for a lung transplant while infected. Drug resistant: CRE's may live in the intestines and lungs and may cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other diseases . The victims included one 16-year-old boy. Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, are bacteria that are unique in that they are resistant to most antibiotics. They typically live in the soil or water. Patients infected with the bacteria are typically not symptomatic, but can develop pneumonia, kidney and bladder infections, and bloodstream infectioins. They began appearing in the U.S. roughly ten years ago, and have since spread to at least 41 states. There is no effective treatment yet available for the bacteria, which can linger in the body more than a year, and mortality rates hover at 40 to 50 per cent. The infections are associated with mortality rates of 40 to 50 per cent. The rise means health care providers must 'act aggressively to prevent the emergence and spread of these unusual . CRE organisms,' the CDC said. 'From the perspective of drug-resistant . organisms, (CRE) is the most serious threat, the most serious challenge . we face to patient safety,' Arjun Srinivasan, associate director . for prevention of health care-associated infections at the Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention, told USA Today. It can take over a year to be rid of CRE bacteria, with one study determining the average patient requiring 387 days for it to be out of their system. 'We're working with state health departments to try to figure out how . big a problem this is,' Srinivasan said, noting that his . agency can pool whatever incidence data states collect. 'We're still at a . point where we can stop this thing. You can never eradicate CRE, but we . can prevent the spread. ... It's a matter of summoning the will.' Enterobacteriaceae flourish in the soil, water, and the human gut. A 'superbug,' CRE has a high level of resistance to antibiotics. Sterile: The CDC is recommending that any doctors who treat patients with a superbug be tested themselves and refrain from treating patients not infected . Disturbingly, the patients are not . symptomatic, as the bug waits in the body until the immune system is . compromised and an infection sets in. The first known U.S. case was . detected at a North Carolina hospital in 2001, and since then CRE's have . been detected in at least 41 other states. Many cases still go unrecognized until its too late for the patient. Since the first known case, at a . North Carolina hospital, was reported in 2001, CREs have spread to at . least 41 other states, according to the CDC. And many cases still go . unrecognized, because it can be tough to do the proper laboratory . analysis, particularly at smaller hospitals or nursing homes. People diagnosed with a CRE infection . usually get it after taking antibiotics and undergoing significant . medical treatment for other conditions. Also in the news last summer was an outbreak of CRE in eight patients - the largest outbreak in the U.S. so far. None of the patients in the initial outbreak died. Resistant: CRE's are resistant to treatment and doctors must be aggressive in watching for the infections . The hospital was able to detect the outbreak early largely due to stringent surveillance protocols. The CDC said most CRE cases were 'isolated from patients who received . overnight medical treatment outside of the United States.' There are CDC guidelines to deal with the infection in the center's 2012 CRE toolkit. If you share a room with a person with a CRE infection you should be screened immediately. Health care providers who treat infected patients should also be examined. They should not treat non-infected patients after treating infected ones. Health care facilities must also be made aware of any CRE infected patients being transferred to their care.","At least seven deaths were traced to the infection in an outbreak at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center last year .

David Cameron's aim of slashing the number of people coming to Britain recovered a major boost today, with new figures showing net immigration fell by a third in just a year. The Prime Minister and Home Secretary Theresa May want to cut net migration from non-EU countries to less than 100,000 before next election in 2015. New figures show the net flow of migrants to the UK in the year to June 2012 was 163,000, down 34 per cent from 247,000 in the previous year. A net immigration fell from 247,000 in the year to June 2011 to 163,000 in the year to June 2012, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said . The decline was driven by a drop in . the number of immigrants coming to Britain, which fell from 589,000 to . 515,000, while the number of migrants leaving the country rose from . 342,000 to 352,000, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. There . was a ‘significant’ decrease in the number of immigrants arriving from . New Commonwealth countries, which includes African countries such as . Botswana, Kenya and Malawi and Indian subcontinent countries such as . Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. A group of influential MPs reacted angrily today to the Government's refusal to remove foreign students from its target. Despite ministers trumpeting a fall in net migration, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee said it was wrong that international students were included in the target to reduce non-EU migration to the tens of thousands by 2015. ‘The Government should listen, think again and change course,’ the committee said. The decline in net migration was driven by a drop in the number of immigrants coming to Britain, which fell from 589,000 to 515,000, while the number of migrants leaving the country rose from 342,000 to 352,000. Some 197,000 foreign students arrived in the period, down 17% or 42,000 from 239,000 in the previous year, while the number of visas issued for study - 209,804 - was 20% lower. In a report last year, the BIS Committee said the inclusion of international students in net migration figures risks undermining a world-class export market. But in an official response released yesterday, the Home Secretary said all the UK's major competitors include students in their net migration figures. The BIS Committee said: ‘The Government's response was late, woefully short on detail and fails to take account of recent developments. ‘It seeks to underplay the urgency of the problem and thus excuse the failure to act decisively to address this serious matter. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'We are bringing immigration back under control, with net migration cut by nearly a third since the general election. 'But Labour have opposed all the tough reforms which have achieved this.' He added that under Labour immigration was 'out of control' with net migration into the UK topping 2.2 million. He added: 'The fact they oppose all the steps we are taking to reform the routes of migration shows that they have learned nothing from their past mistakes. 'Our tough reforms are having an impact in all the right places - we . have tightened the routes where abuse was rife and overall numbers are . down as a result. ‘We . will continue to work hard to bring net migration down from the . hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this . Parliament and to create a selective immigration system that works in . our national interest.’ Some . 117,000 immigrants from New Commonwealth countries arrived in the UK in . the year to June, down 30 per cent or 51,000 from 168,000 in the . previous year. A total of 62,000 immigrants arrived . from countries which joined the EU in 2004, including Poland, the Czech . Republic and Lithuania, down 27 per cent or 24,000 from the previous year. The . most common reason given for migrating to Britain remains study, the . ONS said, with 197,000 foreign students arriving in the period, down 17% . or 42,000 from 239,000 in the previous year. The number of visas issued fell 10% or . 57,106 to 507,701 in the year ending December 2012 - the lowest . 12-monthly total since comparable data was first published in 2005. Within the figures, this included 209,804 visas issued for the purpose of study, a fall of 20%. And 173,000 people migrated to the UK for work, which was down 10% from 194,000 in the previous year. Home Secretary Theresa May and Prime Minister David Cameron want to reduce net migration from non-EU countries to less than 100,000 before next election in 2015 . Immigration minister Mark Harper hailed the figures as proof tough reforms were working . The figures come as the Government toughens its stance on immigration with a range of new measures as it aims to bring down net migration to the tens of thousands. UK Border Agency officials will conduct interviews with more than 100,000 student visa applicants from ‘high-risk’ countries outside the EU to crack down on bogus students. And a ‘genuine entrepreneur’ test has been introduced to tackle the rising number of foreign nationals attempting to enter Britain by fudging their bank accounts and setting up fake businesses. Sponsored visa applications rose 3 per cent in the university sector, but fell 62 per cent, 69 per cent and 14 per cent for further education, English language schools and independent schools respectively. Labour's Chris Bryant, the shadow immigration minister, said: 'Net migration is falling but public concern is rising. Labour supports strong controls to bring immigration down. 'But these figures demonstrate that the Government is not focussing on the kind of immigration that worries people the most. 'The Government is doing nothing to tackle illegal immigration. The data today shows another fall in deporting people who have broken the rules and another reduction in people being stopped at the border. 'And they are not doing enough to tackle the impact of migration on jobs and housing. Until the Government addresses what most concerns people, anxiety will continue to grow.'","Net migration in year to June 2012 was 163,000, down from 247,000 in 2011 .

Debra Denison chatted with day care workers as they helped load her two grandsons into her van. It had been a day full of smiles and cupcakes for two-year-old Alton Perry, who was celebrating his birthday, and nothing seemed amiss, said Nikki Salaun, the director of the Kidds & Co. day care. But instead of taking the children home as planned, Denison vanished on Tuesday and left behind a suicide note. After a frantic search, she and her grandsons, two-year-old Alton Perry and 6-month-old Ashton Perry, were found shot to death in an apparent murder-suicide. Debra Denison is believed to have shot to death her two-year-old and six-month-old grandchildren before turning the gun on herself. Here she is pictured with Alton, who was found dead in the car alongside his little brother Ashton and his grandmother . Victims: Ashton (left) and Alton (right) Perry were found dead in a minivan at Lake of Isle in Preston, Connecticut yesterday. It was Alton's second birthday . 'We've all gone over it in our . heads,' Salaun said. 'Did she say something that we could have picked up . on? But no, there was nothing alarming.' Relatives said Denison had struggled . with mental health problems, and had attempted suicide in 1989 and 1990, . but family and friends were left struggling to understand what could . have prompted the violence. 'She would go along and have seasons . where everything was A-OK, and other times when she would be depressed, . running to the doctor and getting prescriptions,' said Marcia White, a . paternal great-grandmother of the slain boys. 'She seemed to be doing . well.' The boys' parents told WVIT-TV that . Denison had split personalities and family members told WFSB-TV that she . had bipolar disorder. According to the Hartford Courant, her . second husband filed for divorce in 1989 and the file includes . documents that say Denison attempted suicide at least three times and . was committed to the psychiatric ward at The William W. Backus Hospital . in Norwich for more than a month in early 1990. Documents in the file indicate she . struggled with alcohol, committed crimes and was found by a judge to be . not competent to care for her children. The bodies of 47-year-old Denison and . the boys were found in a car parked near Lake of Isles in Preston, in . the southeastern corner of Connecticut, a town over from the boys' day . care center in North Stonington. Denison had been to the day care before and was on a list of people authorized to pick up the children. Scene: A picture from today shows the state boat launch at the end of Lake of Isles Road in Preston, Connecticut where state police say the three bodies were found . Brothers: Alton Perry, left, and Ashton Perry, 6 months old, right, were taken from their daycare by their grandmother Tuesday afternoon; today was Alton's second birthday . Denison's daughter, Brenda Perry, the . boys' mother, had worked at the center several years ago. She now works . at a local school and her husband, Jeremy, was a landscaper, Salaun . said. Salaun and day care center co-owner . Christine Hare had attended Perry's baby showers and weren't surprised . when she enrolled her boys there in October. 'Those boys were her world,' Saloun said. 'She coveted her family. Those boys were everything.' Alton, with his piercing blue eyes, was always smiling behind his ever-present pacifier, Hare said. He was nicknamed 'the greeter' at the . day care because he always went to meet visitors at the door while . other children hung back. Their mother had brought in . mini-cupcakes for the toddler room to celebrate his birthday. She told . staff that Denison would be picking up the children. Salaun and Hare said that they were . aware Denison had some mental health issues in the past but that she was . friendly and talkative on Tuesday. 'Brenda obviously put her on the list . thinking she would be OK,' Hare said. 'We go with the parents. We can't . override their wishes. Obviously, if she had come here obviously . distraught, we would have intervened.' After helping Denison to her van with the children, the staff discovered she had taken the wrong car seat. Brenda, the mother of the pair, posted: ''God has two beautiful angels helping him now' Facebook pictures of the boys' parents Jeremy and Brenda Perry with Alton when he was much younger . When they couldn't reach her by . phone, they alerted Perry, who contacted police. The bodies were found . at around 9:30pm on Tuesday, about two hours after state police issued a . statewide Amber Alert. As state police were searching, they learned that Denison had left her home armed with a revolver and they found a suicide note. Investigators have not released Denison's suicide note, but it is believed to have said that God spared her 13-year-old son. Denison was supposed to pick up her teenage son, Jason, before she headed to the day care to pick up her grandsons. White, the great-grandmother, said . Denison picked the children up alone Tuesday even though their mother . asked her to bring along another relative. White says Denison's . struggles with mental health were well known and Perry told Denison the . boys were too much for her to handle. White said Perry told her that Denison asked to pick the boys up to be with Alton on his birthday. 'She was apparently very convincing,' said White, who expressed frustration that a gun was apparently . available inside the house despite Denison's mental health history. She . said the gun belonged to Denison's husband. Denison also had a 13-year-year-old . son who wasn't with her Tuesday afternoon. In her suicide note, she said . in part that God was watching over him Tuesday, White said. What exactly she meant by that, and her motive for the killings and suicide, remain unclear.

A man who answered the door at the . family home on Wednesday declined to comment, and a man at the address . listed for Denison said the family is asking for space. Denison's criminal record appeared . clean. She had two convictions for minor driving offenses, said Peggy . Muckle, a clerk at New London Superior Court. She was fined $35 in 2003 for . following too closely and, in 2004, she pleaded guilty to reckless . driving, but a judge didn't require her to pay the $100 fine. Denison and her husband, Jance . Denison, have had financial problems over the past several years, . including a $5,926 state tax lien put on their home last month. There were several other liens on the .

Vicar Daniel Watts was conducting a sermon via power point when the 'page three style' image flashed up on the screen . A church has been forced to apologise after a vicar accidentally flashed an image of a naked woman to the congregation during a Power Point sermon. Vicar Daniel Watts was conducting the presentation at St Mark's Church, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, on Sunday evening when the 'page three style' image flashed up on the screen. It was said the image caused panic in the room and Mr Watts, a married father of two, hurriedly tried to remove it from view. An anonymous parishioner described the image as 'pornographic'. Now St Marks's has said sorry for the mistake, which happened in the middle of the 'In The Mix Sunday Session' which from 5pm to 6pm, was billed as a 'cafe style teaching and discussion for adults and children.' St Mark's claims the 'inappropriate' image was shown during a Power Point presentation to 50 adult members at the weekend and put it down to a 'technical glitch'. The presentation was being delivered in a meeting room by overall group leader, Mr Watts, as part of a separate teaching section . The self-proclaimed 'Only Fool and Horses' fanatic who enjoys 'sampling local ale' - is associate minister for young people at St Mark's. The church said no children were present, and few people had noticed the error. A statement read: 'A separate teaching section was being held for about 50 adult members of the 5 o'clock service at St Mark's church last Sunday in a meeting room and a Power Point presentation was shown. 'It appears that a technical glitch accidentally caused an inappropriate image from the internet to appear momentarily on the screen, of a 'Page 3' type. 'This was clearly not intended but was so fleeting it was not spotted by the leader of the teaching session and very few people seem to be have been aware of it. 'No-one made any comment or complaint at the time or after the service, but if anyone was offended we of course would like to apologise for this unfortunate occurrence.' But an anonymous and concerned parishioner present at the meeting claiming the appearance of the image caused 'panic' in the room.

'He must have been using an iPad or something similar. One of the icons showed a pornographic picture. 'It appeared to show a naked lady. A lot of people noticed it and were quite shocked. 'There was a bit of panic, he was clearly trying to get it down. It was just so inappropriate, there were young children about.' The church website explains Rev Watts was born in Dorking, Surrey, and grew up in a village near Gatwick. After working as a church-based Youth and Children's worker for 10 years in Surrey and Kent, he spent two years at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, before he was ordained in 2006. He lives with wife Julia and their two children. He was today unavailable for comment. Mr Watts, who is not the vicar of St Mark's but the associate minister for young people, had taken the adults out of the church and into a separate annexe in the building, leaving the children in the church proper. Canon John Carter, spokesman for the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds, explained that normally the children leave the church and go into the annex, but once a month this is reversed.

The mother of slain high school student Lauren Astley cried on the witness stand today as she was asked to identify her daughter's ex-boyfriend, Nathaniel Fujita, as part of his murder trial. Fujita, now 20, is charged with killing Astley in July 2011 shortly after she had broken up with him and 'humiliated him'. Astley's mother, Mary Dunne, was one of the witnesses who testified on Thursday, talking about how in the months leading up to the killing, Fujita had changed from his outgoing former self into a withdrawn and aggressive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Emotional : Mary Dunne, Lauren Astley's mother, becomes emotional during her testimony at Nathaniel Fujita's murder trial at Middlesex Superior Court today . Breaking down: Suspect Nathaniel Fujita also began sobbing during Mrs Dunne's testimony and he held his head down during much of her time on the stand . She told of how she had to ask him to leave Astley's graduation party just weeks before the killing after he left her daughter in tears. Fujita had shown up drunk and became . upset when his ex-girlfriend refused to talk to him. He got so angry he . shoved a tent pole and almost knocked it over. Victim: Phone records show that 18-year-old Lauren talked to Nathanial several times before going to meet him after she finished work at the local mall . 'I told Nathaniel that he needed to settle down, he and Lauren were no longer dating, that this was her graduation party and she deserved to enjoy herself,' Mrs Dunne said. He didn't pay attention to her order, however, and Mrs Dunne had to then call his mother and ask her to pick him up. One of the most emotional moments in the tense trial came when- in keeping with standard court procedure- Mrs Dunne had to point out where Nathaniel was sitting in the courtroom. 'He's at the defendant's table in the middle seat with his head down,' she said, pointing to the former football player who was sobbing throughout her testimony. Fujita, 20, is accused of luring Astley to his Massachusetts home on July 3, 2011, strangling her with a bungee chord and slashing her throat open - though his lawyers argue the murder took place in a fit of insane rage after they broke up. Following Mrs Dunne's testimony, the prosecution put their case to rest, but the jury still has to wrigh all of the information they have heard about the manner in which Astley died. Being strong: Mrs Dunne held back tears while she looked at a picture of her 'only daughter' when she took the stand on Thursday . Tough: Mrs Dunne has been a constant presence at the trial and has gotten predictably emotional . On Wednesday, the chief medical examiner testified that Lauren's killer left a four-and-a-half-inch-long 'gaping-wide wound' and then sliced her neck with a serrated knife numerous times. 'There were many  incised wounds to the . neck. In certain areas, there were multiple, very close, almost . parallel incised wounds. There were what I would consider a lot of . them,' Dr Henry Nields said. 'I believe she was alive after the . ligature had been removed,' Nields said, suggesting Astley died slowly . over 'a matter of minutes' from a combination of slash wounds and . suffocation. During the . testimony, Fujita, 20, lowered his head and appeared to weep, covering . his face. Later, his mom, Beth Fujita, sitting in a row behind her son, . sobbed uncontrollably. Fatal: Nathanial Fujita (right) killed his girlfriend Lauren Astley (left) just months after they ended their three-year relationship . Family: Nathaniel Fujita's parents sob and huddle together in court as their son bow his head in front of them while the medical examiner testifies about the murder of Lauren Astley . Accused: Nathaniel Fujita wept in court yesterday as a medical examiner testified that Lauren Astley was still alive after she was partially strangled and 'died slowly over a matter of minutes as her throat was being cut' The pictures of the 18-year-old victim were so grisly, jurors were given a packet of photos to look at - rather than have them displayed on an overhead projector, as they have with other evidence. According to the Boston Herald, Judge Peter M. Lauriat warned them not to be swayed by their impact: 'Your verdict must not in any way be influenced by the fact that these photos may be unpleasant and graphic. 'Mr Fujita is entitled to a verdict based solely on the evidence, and not one based on pity or sympathy for the deceased.' The defense opened their side of the . case with the questioning of Fujita's aunt, who said that mental illness . runs in the family and that her nephew had slipped into a deep . depression after the break up. They are trying to prove that Fujita suffered from a brief psychotic episode and killed Astley during that time. Joyce Saba told the court that two of . Fujita’s great uncles suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. One uncle, . who Saba said had been a police officer, believed that the CIA was . listening to him through the television, Boston.com reported. Fujita’s younger sister was hospitalized in a child psych unit in 2010, Saba testified. Sobs: Nathaniel Fujita hunches over as autopsy photos of Lauren Astley are shown to a jury during Fujita's murder trial on Wednesday . It emerged yesterday that Fujita did . an internet search about whether or not water erases finger prints and . looked at pictures of himself shirtless.
