"(CNN) -- In a case that drew heavy media attention overseas, a Sarasota, Florida, jury Wednesday convicted a teen in last year's killings of two British tourists. Shawn Tyson, 17, received two mandatory and consecutive life sentences after being convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, said Dennis Menendez, chief information officer for the 12th Judicial Circuit. Tyson was tried in the April 2011 shooting deaths of James M. Cooper, 25, of Warwick, and James Thomas Kouzaris, 24, of Northampton. The jury deliberated for about two hours. The defendant showed no emotion when the verdict was read. Witnesses testified the pair had spent an evening drinking when they got lost and walked into the Newtown housing project in north Sarasota, CNN affiliate WWSB reported. Tyson planned to rob the men, who begged him to let them go, according to witnesses. The bodies were found with wallets and money, WWSB said. The defense argued prosecution witnesses who implicated Tyson either were not credible or made deals, according to WWSB. The teen, who was tried as an adult, was not eligible for the death penalty because of his age, Menendez told CNN. The teen suspect lived near the crime scene, a police report said, and he had been arrested earlier in April on a charge of aggravated assault with a handgun. The victims were believed to be friends who recently graduated from college and were in Sarasota to celebrate. British media covering the trial included Press Association, BBC and Sky News, according to Menendez. Friends of Cooper and Kouzaris spoke before the sentencing, and their families broadcast videos about the victims. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","17-year-old convicted of killing two British tourists .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Pilkington was rejected by Manchester United as a youth player, and Alex Ferguson claims he doesn't even remember the player's time at Old Trafford. But the 24-year-old made a point to the veteran manager on Saturday, scoring the only goal as his Norwich team knocked United off the top of the English Premier League. Norwich's 1-0 home win left United a point behind rivals Manchester City, who earlier thrashed Aston Villa 5-0. ""We've been a bit more ruthless and we're putting our chances away; maybe we could have had another one at the end to make it a bit more comfortable,"" said Pilkington, whose 60th-minute header inflicted United's third league defeat in 12 matches and lifted Norwich up to 13th. ""It's a great day for Norwich and it's a massive win for us. We've been performing well over the last couple of weeks and we showed today that we could beat the team that is probably the best in the league."" United went into the match without England striker Wayne Rooney, who was ill, and could not continue a remarkable run of come-from-behind victories. ""They deserved the win just because they worked so hard for it,"" Ferguson said. ""The players are used to making comebacks and we're always a threat in the last minutes of matches. We had a lot of half-chances but it just wasn't our night."" Manchester City face an early European exit if Wednesday's home clash with Real Madrid ends in anything but victory, but the EPL champions picked up a morale-boosting win as Argentine forwards Sergio Aguero and Carlos Tevez scored twice each against a Villa side who dropped into the relegation zone. David Silva opened the scoring before halftime, while Tevez and Aguero both netted from the penalty spot once as City remained the only unbeaten team in the division. ""For us it is very important we start to play well and in the last two games we have scored six goals with our strikers,"" said manager Roberto Mancini. ""I think we have been missing their goals."" Third-placed Chelsea's title hopes continued to fade with a 2-1 defeat at this season's surprise team, West Bromwich Albion. Roberto di Matteo's side have now failed to win in four league games, and this setback came in the Italian's first return to the club that sacked him in 2009. Chelsea's defeat at the same ground in March ended the reign of manager Andre Villas-Boas, and his assistant Di Matteo stepped up to take charge and preside over a historic first Champions League title. The London club's chances of progressing to the last 16 of this season's European competition could hinge on getting a result from Tuesday's trip to Juventus in the penultimate match of the group stage. West Brom moved up to fourth to continue the fine start made by new manager Steve Clarke, who spent four years at Chelsea as assistant manager to first Jose Mourinho and then Avram Grant. Chelsea, missing injured captain John Terry, went behind to Shane Long's 10th-minute header but midfielder Eden Hazard leveled six minutes before halftime. However, Nigeria forward Peter Odemwingie nodded the home team ahead just five minutes after the break from a cross by Ireland striker Long as West Brom held on for a sixth win from seven at the Hawthorns. Everton dropped to fifth after a 2-1 defeat at Reading that lifted the promoted team out of the bottom three on goal difference. Striker Adam Le Fondre scored both goals in Reading's first top-flight win since May 2008, after Everton led through Scotland forward Steven Naismith. Everton went into the match without influential veteran Phil Neville, who has been ruled out for up to two months following knee surgery. Arsenal closed on the top four with a dramatic 5-2 north London derby win against Tottenham, who had Emmanuel Adebayor sent off after giving the visitors the lead against his former club. The Togo striker netted his first goal for Spurs this season from close range but then saw red after a two-footed lunge on Santi Cazorla. Arsenal took full advantage as defender Per Mertesacker headed in, fellow German Lukas Podolski scrambled a second and France forward Olivier Giroud also scored before halftime. Spain midfielder Cazorla made it 4-1 before Gareth Bale reduced the deficit but England international Theo Walcott boosted his hopes of a new contract as he ensured a repeat of last season's scoreline. Spurs dropped to eighth, two points behind their rivals and one behind seventh-placed West Ham -- who host Stoke on Monday. Swansea claimed 10th place with a 2-1 win over Newcastle, who went into the match threatening legal action against Senegal's national federation after Papiss Cisse was refused permission to play. The striker did not travel to Niger for a midweek friendly due to a back injury, so Senegal invoked FIFA's five-day rule that stops players from missing internationals and returning immediately to play for their clubs. ""I love playing for my country and would only withdraw from a squad -- for either a friendly or competitive game -- for a genuine reason,"" Cisse said. ""I am fully supportive of the position my club has adopted in this matter and am sorry that the Federation seem to doubt my honesty and integrity. I will now consider if I wish to continue to captain my country."" Spanish striker Michu and Canadian Jonathan de Guzman put Swansea ahead before a late consolation from Cisse's compatriot Demba Ba -- the forward's eighth league goal this season. Liverpool moved up to 11th with a 3-0 win over Wigan as Luis Suarez continued his goalscoring run -- and again ran into controversy. The Uruguay striker netted a double to move to the top of the EPL charts with 10, but was accused by Wigan manager Roberto Martinez of stamping on David Jones. ""The first finish is probably the real clinical one and a sign of a top player,"" Martinez said. ""He was very fortunate because it was a stamp which the referee didn't see, and that wasn't the sign of a top player."" Queens Park Rangers lost 3-1 at home to second-bottom Southampton, leaving Mark Hughes' team four points adrift at the foot of the table as the Welshman battles to save his job.","Manchester City move to top of English Premier League with 5-0 win over Aston Villa .

"(CNN) -- They just don't get it. Two months after playing partisan chicken with the debt-ceiling limit and leading directly to a U.S. downgrade, our dysfunctional divided Congress was at it again -- carelessly bringing the country to the brink of a government shutdown. This time the debate was over disaster-relief spending. Republicans wanted to ensure that any extra money needed for FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Irene would be matched by cuts in spending elsewhere. The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the House bill as a form of extortion and so the stalemate continued through the weekend, bringing FEMA within days of being insolvent. Ultimately, the two parties came to an agreement that funded FEMA but simply kicked the prospect of a government shutdown to right before Thanksgiving. It used to be that at least a disaster could unite Congress to think beyond party politics. But we are living in a time where extreme measures are used every day. The threat of a government shutdown is seen as negotiating leverage. Threat of filibuster has gone from a rare event to a routine parliamentary procedure. There is no question why Washington is broken. The two parties have become so polarized they seem unable to reason together. Special interests threaten to eclipse the national interest. Hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from being able to solve the serious problems we face. That was the unambiguous message Standard & Poor's sent the United States with its downgrade in August that specifically cited an atmosphere of partisan gamesmanship. It was echoed by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke -- a Bush and Obama appointee -- in remarks at the Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming. We have a political crisis, which is compounding the fiscal crisis. This is not an elite concern, but a problem increasingly recognized by everyday Americans far away from the Beltway. ""Members of Congress are intelligent but they have no common sense,"" Darlene Swithers of Pennsylvania recently told The New York Times. ""They fight too much. They should be put in a corner and take a time out and start working together as a team. I'm so sick of hearing Republicans this and Democrats that."" This is the articulation of the impulse that led 77% of Americans to tell CNN that Congress acts like ""spoiled children"" rather than responsible adults. This latest flirtation with a government shutdown just shows how tone-deaf Congress has become. House Republicans played politics with disaster relief and felt that they would be rewarded by their base if they do so. Their all-or-nothing mindset leads them to the logic that Democrats will be to blame for a shutdown if they simply refuse to do what Republicans demand. What's doubly dumb about this particular battle is that it is over relatively small change -- some $2.5 billion in disaster relief at a time when a bipartisan joint super committee is struggling to find a minimum of $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction. President Obama and Speaker John Boehner and 35 senators have encouraged the super-committee to go bigger -- to $4 trillion in deficit and debt reduction -- the amount almost achieved by so-called grand bargain that failed to materialize in August. Bipartisan committees like Bowles-Simpson and the Gang of Six -- as well as a plan proposed by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan -- also set out different paths to a $4 trillion savings, bringing us to a more sound fiscal footing. We know what such a step will require: spending cuts and some revenue increases, best achieved with tax reform and entitlement reform. The far right opposes any tax increases while the far-left opposes any entitlement reform. But there should still be room to reason together. For example, one solution would be to cut tax rates but close select loopholes, allowing higher revenue to be raised from lower rates. Unfortunately, some folks on the far-right have decided that raising revenue at all will be considered a tax-hike and a violation of the anti-tax pledge. That all-or-nothing logic threatens to doom the deliberations that democratic republics depend on. It doesn't have to be this way. For most of the 20th century, congressional voting patterns were clustered toward the center -- the presence of conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans allowed for creative across-the-aisle coalitions. But in the past two decades, as the parties have become more ideologically and geographically stratified, the capacity for coalition building has decreased. The rigged system of redistricting and closed partisan primaries have helped further polarize the process as centrists are pushed out of both parties. Likewise, in the past divided government has not meant dysfunction. America accomplished the Marshall Plan and the National Highway System under divided government during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. The achievements of the Reagan era came with liberal Democrat Tip O'Neill at the helm of the House of Representatives. The two men disagreed deeply on political philosophy, but they had the capacity to disagree agreeably, sit together and tell stories at the end of the day. (And not incidentally, Reagan and O'Neill were able to form a bipartisan commission to help fix social security in the 1980s by requiring both parties to jump in together). Even Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich found ways to work together despite intense personal dislike, achieving welfare reform and turning deficits into a surplus. But now, politics is increasingly seen as ideological blood sport and a zero-sum game. The parties are willing to politicize disaster relief and bring our nation to the brink of default. They oppose even bipartisan plans for fear that the other side might gain politically. Trust is eroded and replaced with the demonization of disagreement. This approach is fundamentally incompatible with the facts of divided government, which requires some degree of compromise based on defining common ground and then building on it. Some hyper-partisans in Washington are simply looking to the next election to solve these problems. But the problem of extreme partisanship is bigger than one election. During this cancer in our body politic will require a cultural change. It will require actively supporting responsible voices in both parties. It will require pushing for policies like redistricting reform and open primaries. There need to be procedural reforms in congress as well -- for example, ending the special interest weapon of ""secret holds"" and requiring that filibusters be conducted in person. In a larger sense, we need to rediscover some forgotten wisdom from the founding fathers. As Thomas Jefferson said in his first inaugural address, after a bitterly hard-fought campaign, ""every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle."" We need to remember what President Lyndon Johnson used to say: ""I am an American, a Texan, and a Democrat -- in that order."" We have been through much tougher times as a nation before and emerged stronger. The danger today is that this crisis is self-inflicted and self-indulgent. The parties need to remember that they are not the purpose of our politics -- and even though they might be polarized, the vast majority of the American people are not.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Police in India summarily execute prisoners, torture and threaten suspects and arrest people without reason, a leading rights group said Tuesday. Human Rights Watch says individial officers are not to blame for abuses. India's police have largely failed to evolve from the repressive forces they were designed to be under Britain's colonial regime, according to a new report by the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch. ""While 60 years later, much of India is in the process of rapid modernization, the police continue to use their old methods,"" the group said. Officials at the Federal Home Ministry -- which is responsible for the police -- offered no immediate comment. The report cited abuse and threats as a primary tactic for investigating crime and enforcing the law in India. It said the system rather than individual officers or commanders was partly to blame. ""The institutional culture of police practically discourages officers from acting otherwise, failing to give them the resources, training, ethical environment and encouragement to develop professional police tactics,"" it said. The Federal Home Ministry will study the report before responding, said R.K. Sharma, its deputy secretary dealing with human rights issues, but some former police officers agreed that the force had yet to modernize. Nikhil Kumar, former police commissioner of New Delhi and head of an association of retired officers from the Indian capital, charged that almost all Indian states had been reluctant to carry out police reforms. State chief ministers, he said, had rejected any moves aimed at granting greater autonomy to the police for fear it would loosen their control over the force. ""The police inherited a colonial legacy. In the last 60 years or so, they should have come out of it, but this hasn't happened. What has happened is that British masters have been replaced by Indian masters,"" Kumar remarked. The legal basis for much of India's state and federal police services is a law dating back to 1861, which was drafted in the wake of an 1857 uprising against British rule. India gained its independence from Britain in 1947. Kumar said a national police commission had recommended scrapping the 1861 law some 30 years ago, but said it had not been acted upon except for what he called ""small changes."" Top serving officers from Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, states HRW used for its field research, refused comment on the report. ""I have to study it first,"" Karnataka police chief Ajay Kumar Singh said. Brij Lal, additional director general of police in Uttar Pradesh, gave the same response. Successive governments for decades have failed to deliver on promises to hold the police accountable for abuses and to build professional, rights-respecting police forces, HRW said. ""Colonial-era police laws enable state and local politicians to interfere routinely in police operations, sometimes directing police officers to drop investigations against people with political connections, including known criminals, and to harass or file false charges against political opponents,"" it added. Moreover, abysmal conditions for police officers also contribute to violations, the report noted. Low-ranking officers often work in difficult conditions and are required to be on-call 24 hours a day, every day, it said. ""They often lack necessary equipment, including vehicles, mobile phones, investigative tools and even paper on which to record complaints and make notes,"" the HRW said. The 118-page report, ""Broken System: Dysfunction, Abuse and Impunity in the Indian Police,"" is based on interviews with more than 80 police officers of varying ranks, 60 people who said they were victims of police abuse, and numerous discussions with experts and civil society activists. ""It's time for the government to stop talking about reform and fix the system,"" said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director, in a statement.","Human Rights Watch accuses Indian police of abuses .

"New York (CNN) -- Vaclav Havel died Sunday in the Czech Republic he helped build. A few months ago, I wrote an appreciation as a way of marking his 75th birthday. The sentiments, of course, still stand and I'm glad I didn't wait until his death to write it. We have lost a hero of our times, a friend of freedom, who lived his life with integrity and sent forward ripples of hope into the world. He will be missed and remembered. ... Draw up a compelling character representing the arc of the 20th century and it might look like this -- a child whose homeland is conquered by the Nazis and then occupied by communists; a playwright, essayist and dissident turned state prisoner of conscience turned leader of a victorious nonviolent revolution over a totalitarian dictatorship. He culminates his career as president of his newly liberated nation. This is the life of Vaclav Havel as he celebrates his 75th birthday. In a time of Arab Springs still unfolding and uncertainty about what will emerge in the place of those Mideast dictatorships, Vaclav Havel's life story takes on renewed relevance. The revelation of Havel's leadership wasn't just the triumphant nonviolence of the Velvet Revolution -- it was his bracing honesty, which was itself a revelation. Read the opening lines of his first inaugural address to the Czech people: ""My dear fellow citizens ... I assume you did not propose me for this office so that I, too, would lie to you."" This is the hallmark of Havel's writing -- challenges to power rooted not in imperious ideological rhetoric but harder-to-dismiss, human-size truths. Take a look at his most enduring essay, ""The Power of the Powerless,"" written behind the Iron Curtain in the darkest days of the 1970s. In this classic call for everyday citizens to recognize their power to change their world, Havel uses the example of a Soviet-era grocer placing a state-sponsored sign in his store window with the slogan: ""Workers of the world, unite!"" ""If the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan 'I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient;' he would not be nearly as indifferent to its semantics, even though the statement would reflect the truth,"" Havel wrote. So why does he do it? ""The sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low foundations of his obedience, at the same time concealing the low foundations of power. It hides them behind the facade of something high. And that something is ideology,"" Havel wrote. ""Ideology offers human beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them."" The power of those words ultimately helped inspire a revolution of citizen resistance to the totalitarian state. It may yet inspire more uprisings -- because beneath his appeal is not a vision of a utopian alternative, but the more basic human-scale virtue of civic responsibility, both for yourself and future generations. Havel's experience with the Nazis and Communists taught him the lesson that utopian dreams often end in nightmares. Consequently, Havel has cautionary words for the overheated acolytes of perpetual revolution and retribution. ""Violence is well-known to breed violence, which is why most revolutions have degenerated into dictatorships, devouring their own offspring,"" he wrote, ""not knowing that they were digging their own graves and confining society in a vicious circle of revolutions and counter-revolutions."" There is this enduring wisdom as well: Havel's vision of an anti-totalitarian state ended up looking a lot like liberal capitalist democracy, with an emphasis on preserving pluralism and the uniqueness of a community. Havel was not allergic to the responsibilities of self-government, but instead embraced the mantle of authority in his own quixotic manner, never pretending to be perfect, leading by the power of his example rather than the example of his power. In office, he was a clear voice arguing for the West's efforts to intervene militarily to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. At a time when many nations seemed confused, unable to see the conflict with moral clarity, Havel helped keep the Western world focused on our commitment to ""never forget."" Retired from office and often wrestling ill-health, Havel continues to write. Because he is one of the few recent world leaders who is primarily an author and artist, it is probably best to let his words speak for themselves on a few more varied subjects. -- On purposeful politics: ""True politics, worthy of the name â€” and the only kind I will practice â€” is the politics of service to one's neighbor. Service to the community; service to those who will succeed us ... If you are modest and do not lust after power, not only are you suited to politics, you absolutely belong there."" -- On globalization: ""An amalgamation of cultures is taking place. ... We are in a phase when one age is succeeding another, when everything is possible and almost nothing is certain."" -- On hope and persistence: ""The only lost cause is one we give up on before we enter the struggle."" -- On a keeping a sense of humor: ""Anyone who takes himself too seriously always runs the risk of looking ridiculous; anyone who can consistently laugh at himself does not."" We sometimes wait until people have passed to honor them appropriately. This seems like an avoidable oversight. If you're inspired to learn more about Vaclav Havel, pick up one of his many books, from collections like ""Open Letters"" to interview collections like ""Disturbing the Peace"" to ruminations and recollections in books like ""Summer Meditations"" and the most recent, ""To the Castle and Back."" In an uncertain, always evolving world, I am certain of this: Vaclav Havel's words and example will endure and continue to provide inspiration, lighting a path forward, reminding us that history takes place in the here and now and that we all contribute to making it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon celebrates the life of Vaclav Havel, who died Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Does the David Petraeus extramarital affair pose a threat to national security? The scandal reinforces the risks of age-old intelligence-gathering landmines -- be careful what you say and where you say it. But analysts doubt national security was compromised. ""Petraeus' potential exposure to blackmail, and the dangers associated with the use of nonofficial e-mail accounts that he needed to keep the affair secret, made this a potential national security issue,"" said Stephen Biddle, a professor of political science and international affairs at The George Washington University. Petraeus probe includes top general in Afghanistan . ""The FBI concluded that this was only potential, and that no meaningful security breaches had actually occurred, but the affair created a risk that could have been exploited in the future."" Petraeus resigned last week from the head of the CIA after admitting an affair with a woman later identified as his biographer, Paula Broadwell, 40, a fellow West Point graduate who spent months studying the general's leadership of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The revelation came during an FBI probe of another matter, and it led to the shocking fall of the celebrated and revered four-star Army general, who once ran the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The affair came to light during an FBI investigation of ""jealous"" e-mails reportedly sent by Broadwell to a U.S. Central Command volunteer named Jill Kelley, a government source familiar with the investigation told CNN on Monday. Timeline of the Petraeus affair . Kelley received the worrisome e-mails in May, an official said, describing the messages as along the lines of ""stay away from my guy,"" but not explicitly threatening. According to a source with knowledge of the e-mails, the messages accused Kelley of untoward behavior with some generals at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, where Kelley did volunteer work. The e-mails detailed the ""comings and goings of the generals and Ms. Kelley,"" said the source, who declined to speak on the record because of sensitivity of the investigation. Among those believed to be referenced in the e-mails was Petreaus. Because parts of Petreaus' schedule were not public, the e-mails raised questions about whether the sender of the e-mails had access to his private schedule or other sensitive information. Kelley, 37, and her husband Scott released a statement saying they have been friends with Petraeus and his family for more than five years, and asked for privacy. Opinion: Petraeus adultery no big deal . Robert Baer, a CNN contributor and former CIA operative, said the situation is troubling because Petraeus could have innocently told Broadwell secrets he shouldn't have in casual conversation. Also, in a speech at the end of October, Broadwell suggested the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, took place because the United States was housing Libyan prisoners there -- a theory, she noted at the time, that had not been vetted yet. The claim by Broadwell has since been discounted by administration officials. Baer said it's rare in a relationship that a person wouldn't cross the line and say things he or she shouldn't have said. But ""my gut is there's nothing there,"" he said, and that Petraeus didn't say anything he shouldn't have to Broadwell. Opinion: 5 things we've learned from Petraeus scandal . Nevertheless, he said, the ""potential is big here for policy and security implications."" ""It's a spy agency's worst nightmare,"" he said. ""They've let an outsider in, which is always a terrible error."" As for the morality of the situation, Baer said extramarital relations do happen when the Army and the CIA go to war. The Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex . ""I would be more worried if he were asexual,"" Baer said of Petraeus. ""It shouldn't distract from his legacy."" Retired Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, for whom Broadwell once worked and who knows Petraeus, said he doubts security protocols were breached despite what seems an unlikely indiscretion on the part of Petraeus. A senior U.S. intelligence official said an extramarital affair by a CIA officer is not automatically considered a security violation. Analysis: Will national security scandal create national security risk? ""It depends on the circumstances,"" the official said. The official also said Broadwell did not have a security clearance from the CIA. Another official said Broadwell, who is an officer in the Army reserve, did have some kind of security clearance and that there are no issues with Broadwell having unauthorized access to classified information. ""I do not know how she got that information,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, referring to Broadwell's October speech. ""We should find out."" Panetta makes first comments on Petraeus' affair . Feinstein said she would investigate why the FBI investigation that uncovered the extramarital affair did not notify oversight committees about its investigation into Petraeus after the bureau determined he was having a secret and risky extramarital affair. Fran Townsend, a former Bush Homeland security adviser and CNN national security contributor, agrees the situation lends itself for the potential that security would be breached. ""Is there the potential? Yes of course. I think there's no indication that there's a problem here. There's no indication this involved classified material from him to her."" She also said she thinks that Broadwell is ""playing the journalists' game."" ""If she's in an intimate relationship with the CIA director, he's not her only source."" And, she might have heard the October remarks, made at the University of Denver, in passing from someone else. Kurtz: How Petraeus courted the press . As investigators try to determine who said what to whom, it might end up as a ""he said, she said."" And as a result, nothing will be firmed down or resolved. ""I worry about the distraction that this now becomes for Congress and the media,"" Townsend said. Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor, said there are always potential worries about having appropriate relations and the potential of spies. In this situation, Petraeus is ""very experienced"" and knows about security clearances. Broadwell has scores of military contacts and is an author and academic. But what if someone burglarized her house, for example, and found classified information there. Could she be blackmailed? ""That's the worry,"" he said.

"UTTAR PRADESH, India (CNN)  -- An Indian police office grabs two fists-full of a suspect's hair; twists and then lifts until the suspect's feet dangle off ground. The suspect: A 6-year-old girl accused of stealing 280 rupees or about 6 dollars. The incident resulted in one officer being fired, another suspended. Charges against the girl were dropped. It was all caught on tape in February of this year. Harcharand Singh and his wife. Mr Singh says their son, accused of thief, died in police custody. Two years earlier in another Indian state another caught on tape moment. A police officer watches as a crowd beats an accused thief. Then the policeman binds the suspect and ends up dragging him behind a motorcycle leaving large raw patches of skin on the suspect's body. The accused survived the thrashing. Two officers were fired in the incident but were later reinstated by a panel that blamed the crowd. Brutal police tactics are all too common in India according to the latest report by Human Rights Watch in India. Naureen Shah with Human Rights Watch says the report is based on interviews with 80 police, 60 alleged victims and other experts. ""The police are taking the law into their own hands."" Shah says. ""They are acting as a vigilante force and they're saying this is a bad guy instead of building a case against him we're going to kill him, we're going to take these harsh measure cause it has to get done."" ""Police administration are meant to protect, but they are becoming predators."" Harcharand Singh says. He is the father of a suspect he says died in police custody. Singh and his wife are dirt poor and partially blind. They sit on a bed with tears in their eyes as they speak about losing their son Pradeep. They say police hauled Pradeep away one night accusing him of being involved in a car theft and shooting. Days later they say he died in police custody. Police refused to comment on the case or the report. ""We are scared."" Mother Ram Vati Singh says through tears. ""What else can we do? We have no money so that we can leave or put up a fight with the police."" The case was one of dozens highlighted in the Human Rights Watch report used as yet another example of what they say is out of control police behavior.  Watch a report on abuse cases » . But the report also revealed something else. The terrible conditions police work and live in. Many live in police stations for days even months at a time unable to go home to see their families because they are expected to be on call 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Some work and live in tents in scorching temperatures. Their bathroom facilities are often wretched. Their cooking facilities sometimes made up of bricks with fire wood. The number of cases and pressure to solve them is intense. Police also say they are short staffed. One police official told us in his jurisdiction there are 70 police for a population of 250-thousand people, something CNN is unable to independently confirm. There are no computers for reports so police officers fill everything out by hand. Some departments even run out of paper to write the reports according to the Human Rights Watch report. Former Delhi Police Commissioner Ved Marwah says the conditions are dire. ""The policemen are treated very inhumanly and that's why he gets desensitized and brutalized by his living and working conditions an by his interaction with the common citizen and with his superiors and that desensitization is reflected in the way an average policeman deals with the public at large."" Marwah says. Marwah says there is also interference from politicians in police investigations. ""Politics plays a very negative role."" He says.

"(CNN) -- Reports of a possible cease-fire in Gaza brokered by Egypt emerged Tuesday, but without a more farsighted approach that addresses the dysfunctional dynamic within Palestinian politics, any truce is unlikely to be any more durable than previous ones. This latest Israeli offensive marks the sixth major military operation against Gaza since Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers in 2005, and the first since the massive military campaign known as ""Cast Lead"" four years ago. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was headed to the region Tuesday to join Egypt's negotiations for a truce. Egypt -- as the only other party with a direct stake in Gaza's stability and one of the few capable of talking directly to all key actors -- is best placed to play the role of peacemaker. There will be cease-fire. But events in Gaza have strained already tense relations between Egypt and Israel, prompting Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy to withdraw his ambassador in Tel Aviv while dispatching his prime minister to Gaza in a show of solidarity with Hamas. With the Obama administration openly siding with Israel, U.S.-Egyptian ties have also been damaged. Opinion: Message of Gaza violence -- Hamas can't be ignored . Israel says its offensive is aimed at ending rocket attacks from Gaza once and for all. Hamas wants to see an end to the five-year Gaza blockade and the reopening of its borders. In reality, neither Israel nor Hamas is likely to get what it wants because neither side appears to have a clear endgame. There is no way to eliminate Hamas. And even if its rocket-launching capabilities are destroyed, which seems unlikely, this war will only fuel its drive to rearm, just as it did after Cast Lead. Until the underlying grievances of both sides can be addressed, we should only expect the cycle of violence to continue. Like Israel, Egypt has an interest in reining in Hamas and preventing weapons smuggling from its territory into Gaza, which further destabilizes the already volatile situation in the Sinai. Despite the strong ties between the Muslim Brotherhood-led government in Cairo and Hamas, itself a Brotherhood offshoot, the Egyptians are unhappy with Hamas' moves in both Gaza and the Sinai. For any truce to hold, it must also include other stakeholders, namely Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Hamas is likely to emerge from this most recent conflict militarily weakened but politically strengthened, earning the respect and sympathy of both Palestinians and Arabs across the region. For Abbas, however, the opposite is true. The crisis has highlighted his powerlessness and growing irrelevance, even sparking new anti-Abbas protests in the West Bank. Abbas and his Fatah-dominated leadership in the West Bank have little to show for their rule except 20 years of failed negotiations and a feckless and bankrupt authority. But the fact that Egypt is also the primary mediator in internal Palestinian talks aimed at healing the split that has crippled the Palestinian Authority since the brief civil war of 2007 presents an opportunity to rehabilitate Abbas while reining in Hamas. Despite its record of violence, Hamas has also shown it can govern effectively and play pragmatic politics. The natural tension between governance and resistance is also reflected in the internal struggle between hard-liners and pragmatists within Hamas. Opinion: 'Pillar of Cloud' spreads dust of war across Middle East . Egypt, along with pro-Hamas governments such as Turkey and Qatar, would like to wean Hamas from its relationship with Iran, which supplies it with weapons and other support. The Israeli offensive makes this more difficult, however, and will only embolden the most militant elements within Hamas. Linking Palestinian reconciliation to a cease-fire arrangement will also give the Egyptians an additional leverage point over Hamas. Any cease-fire will of course have to bring an end to rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza or anywhere else as well as tougher action by Egypt on weapons smuggling through the Gaza tunnels. But for this to work, Hamas (not to mention ordinary Gazans) must also get something, particularly with respect to the blockade. Because neither Israel nor Egypt trust Hamas to police the border, reopening Gaza's border crossings will require a return of Abbas' Palestinian Authority there. But because this requires Hamas' consent, it can only happen in the context of Palestinian reconciliation and the re-emergence of a unified coherent Palestinian polity. In this way, not only does everyone get something, each actor has a stake in the others getting something as well. Such an arrangement will be extremely difficult but not impossible. One primary obstacle is Israeli and U.S. opposition to Palestinian reconciliation or anything that might be seen as strengthening Hamas. This self-defeating policy has been disastrous for Palestinians and Israelis alike as well as a spectacular failure (which may also help explain Israel's offensive). Hamas has more international legitimacy than ever, while the blockade of Gaza is crumbling bit by bit. While Abbas' Palestinian Authority teeters on the verge of financial ruin, the emir of Qatar is showering Hamas with hundreds of millions of dollars. The crisis is only intensifying this trend as Gaza plays host to one Arab leader after another. In the end, Palestinian unity may be the only way to save Hamas from itself and rescue Abbas from political oblivion. Fatah and Hamas do not have to share the same policies or even be in the same government, but they do have to find a way to share the same political space. In other words, they do not have to play on the same team, but they do have to agree on the rules of the game. Some will argue that bringing Hamas into the game would deal a fatal blow to the peace process with Israel. Yet even without Hamas the peace process is already dead. In any case, we will never know since a weak, ineffective and unrepresentative Palestinian leadership by definition will have neither the mandate to negotiate a conflict-ending peace deal with Israel nor the ability to implement it. The idea that Israel could negotiate with one set of Palestinians while making war on another, always questionable, is now totally untenable. Opinion: New dangers in familiar Gaza violence . Such a ""grand bargain"" will not be easy, and is certainly not without risks. But the risks of continuing to ignore realities are far greater. The extent to which Israel and the Palestinians, along with the United States and its allies, understand this will determine whether this will be the last Gaza war or simply a prelude to the next one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Khaled Elgindy.","Khaled Elgindy: Any Gaza truce won't last without a more farsighted approach .
Elgindy: Reality is Hamas is here to stay, and grievances of both sides must be addressed .
Conflict makes Hamas politically stronger, while Palestinian Authority is weak, he says .

"(CNN) -- Lazio moved up to second place in Serie A on Saturday with a 1-0 win at Sampdoria. A first-half goal from Brazilian midfielder Anderson Hernanes was enough for all three points as a clutch of teams look to keep touch with leaders Juventus.

"(CNN) -- Globetrotting Chelsea bounced back from their defeat in the FIFA Club World Cup final to Corinthians with a resounding victory in the League Cup at Leeds. Rafael Benitez's side ran out 5-1 winners at the second tier outfit, having trailed 1-0 at halftime, thanks to goals from Juan Mata, Branislav Ivanovic, Victor Moses, Eden Hazard and Fernando Torres. Having arrived back in London from Japan on Monday after their defeat in FIFA's showpiece club tournament, Chelsea progressed to the last eight on a rain-soaked night Yorkshire. Luciano Becchio gave Leeds -- European Champions League semifinalists back in 2001 -- a first half lead but Spain's Mata equalized early in the second half. Two goals in two minutes took the tie away from Leeds as Ivanovic nodded home from a corner before Moses' shot from outside the area found the net. Hazard finished calmly in the game's dying stages when sprung through on goal and the Belgian then teed up Torres for his sixth goal in five games. Benitez, who replaced the sacked Roberto Di Matteo in November, told Sky Sports: ""The team was quite good in first half; there were some situations where the keeper played pretty well. ""The players were a little tired but the reaction was amazing. We were looking for character and the reaction was so good, there were a lot of positives in this game."" Asked whether he felt more settled in the job after a difficult start Benitez replied: ""I was comfortable from the first day. I will try and do my best until the end.""

"(CNN) -- Hector ""Macho"" Camacho, the famed Puerto Rican boxer, is clinically ""brain dead,"" a doctor said Thursday. A gunman shot him in the face two days ago while he was seated in a black Ford Mustang in front of a bar in his hometown of Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Camacho, a former lightweight and junior lightweight champion, was in the passenger seat of the car, sitting next to a man who was shot twice and killed, police said.

"(CNN) -- Miroslav Klose maintained his status as Lazio's lucky charm on Saturday, keeping his side in the Italian title race and denting the hopes of Inter Milan with a late winner against the second-placed visitors. The veteran Germany international netted his 10th league goal this season and his 14th overall, firing home a low right-foot shot in the 82nd minute. Neither club nor country have lost when the 34-year-old has found the target in a period stretching back to the February 16 Europa League defeat by Atletico Madrid. Saturday's 1-0 victory put his Rome-based side level on points with third-placed Napoli, who host Bologna on Sunday. Inter stayed four points behind leading champions Juventus, who will try to move further ahead with a home victory over mid-table Atalanta on Sunday. ""Klose showed that he's world-class -- hats off to him for the finish -- but we didn't deserve to lose,"" said Inter coach Andrea Stramaccioni. ""Lazio were excellent in the first half but I don't think I've seen a team come here and cause them as many problems as we did in the second half. We might not have deserved to win but we certainly didn't deserve to lose."" Inter twice hit the woodwork before conceding, with Fredy Guarin driving a low shot onto the base of the upright. Lazio goalkeeper Federico Marchetti tipped Antonio Cassano's curled attempt onto the same post and dealt with Yuto Nagatomo's follow-up. Earlier, Udinese snatched a 1-1 draw at home to Palermo thanks to an 89th-minute equalizer from captain Antonio Di Natale. The striker netted his 10th goal in Serie A this season to lift his side up to eighth, while Palermo stayed just above the bottom three. In Spain, Malaga moved to within four points of third-placed Real Madrid with a 2-0 victory at Sevilla. Manuel Pellegrini's team, through to Thursday's last-16 draw of the European Champions League, took a 49th-minute lead through Argentine defender Martin Demichelis. Sevilla had Federico Fazio sent off for a foul on Joaquin with 20 minutes to play, and Portuguese midfielder Eliseu doubled Malaga's lead from the resulting penalty. Earlier, Real Sociedad moved up to eighth after a 0-0 draw at Granada, while Athletic Bilbao went 11th with a 1-0 at third-bottom Mallorca. Seventh-placed Getafe drew 1-1 with Osasuna.

"(CNN) -- An American doctor rescued in Afghanistan this month has thanked those who helped free him, offering special gratitude to the family of a young SEAL killed during the operation. Dr. Dilip Joseph and two other staff members for the international aid group Morning Star Development were kidnapped by armed men on December 5 as they returned from a rural medical clinic in eastern Kabul province. The raid to free Joseph came several hours after the other two were released. Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas D. Checque, 28, of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, was killed during the operation. ""I would like to take this moment to thank the U.S. and Afghan forces for putting their lives on the line to rescue me. I can appreciate the difficulty of this particular operation and deeply value the sacrifice of one of their own servicemen for the success of this mission,"" Joseph said in a statement posted Friday on the Morning Star website. ""My heart goes out to the family of the fallen hero for his service, commitment and courage. He will remain a legacy for me and my family for generations to come,"" Joseph said. While the Defense Department said only that Checque belonged to an ""East Coast-based Special Warfare Unit,"" a U.S. official said the man was a member of the Navy's Special Warfare Development Group, more commonly known as SEAL Team Six. The elite unit is the same one that took part in the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The official didn't know whether the SEAL who died was involved in that operation. U.S. officials provided few others details about the rescue effort. Tribal leader Malik Samad and district chief Muhammad Haqbeen told CNN that Joseph and an Afghan doctor were abducted near the village of Jegdalek in the Sarobi district, just outside Kabul. The International Security Assistance Force said Taliban insurgents kidnapped the men. Samad and Haqbeen identified the kidnappers as smugglers. Checque joined the Navy in 2002 after graduating from high school, according to a brief service record provided by the Defense Department. After attending recruit training in Illinois and advanced training in Virginia, he entered the SEAL program in April 2003. Joseph has worked with Morning Star for three years. He serves as its medical adviser, and travels frequently to Afghanistan, the agency said. He is now back with his family in the United States. ""I have been traveling to Afghanistan for the past several years in the hope of making a difference for this country and her people. I still hold Afghanistan in great regard and will continue to pray and hope for its' peace and long-term stability,"" said Joseph.","Dr. Dilip Joseph and two others were abducted December 5 in eastern Kabul province .

"(CNN) -- Robin van Persie scored after just 33 seconds as Manchester United maintained their slim advantage at the top of the English Premier League Wednesday with a 1-0 win over West Ham. The Old Trafford faithful had barely settled in their seats when the Dutch striker picked up a pass from Michael Carrick and saw his shot deflect off James Collins to loop over visiting goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. It was the quickest goal of the EPL season and left United a point clear of neighbors and defending champions Manchester City, who won 2-0 at Wigan. United have fallen behind in many games this season before recovering and manager Alex Ferguson was delighted by their defensive display. ""If we can keep clean sheets more often than not it will a good foundation to challenge for the title,"" he told Sky Sports. Recalled Mario Balotelli gave City a second half lead at Wigan before James Milner sealed the three points with a thumping strike from outside the penalty area. Balotelli's performance earned scant praise from his manager Roberto Mancini. ""I think Mario can do better. He scored one important goal but can continue to improve. For me, he did not play very well,"" he told Sky Sports. Rafael Benitez is still searching for his first win and first goal since taking charge of Chelsea as interim manager following the sacking of Roberto Di Matteo. His side were held 0-0 at home by West London rivals Fulham, off the back of the same result against Manchester City Sunday. It left Chelsea seven points adrift of leaders Manchester United in third place in the standings and Benitez was again subjected to barracking by home supporters unhappy at his appointment. West Bromwich Albion slipped back to fourth with a first defeat in five games, beaten 3-1 at Welsh side Swansea. Spanish midfielder Michu scored his eighth EPL goal of the season to put Swansea ahead and they were two up inside 10 minutes when Wayne Routledge netted. Routledge added his second and the home side's third just before the interval, but there was still time for West Brom to pull one back when on-loan Romelu Lukaku scored in injury time at the end of the half. Tottenham Hotspur took closer order in fifth with a 2-1 home win over Liverpool at White Hart Lane. Aaron Lennon was set up by Gareth Bale for an early opener for Spurs. Bale then put the home side two clear after just 16 minutes when he crashed home a deflected free kick. In the second half, the pair were involved in a bizarre incident as Lennon smashed a clearance into Bale's face and it found its way into the Tottenham goal, but Liverpool could not force an equalizer. Everton and Arsenal are just behind them in sixth and seventh after they shared a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park. Theo Walcott put the Gunners ahead in the first minute, but Belgian international Marouane Fellaini curled home a leveler midway through the first half. Newcastle's miserable recent run continued with a 2-1 defeat at Stoke while Southampton remained in the drop zone after a 1-1 draw at home to Norwich. It was referee Mark Clattenburg's first match in charge since being cleared of racially abusing Chelsea's John Obi Mikel.","Robin van Persie scores after only 33 seconds for Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- The hidden costs of football were revealed as the English Premier League released figures showing that its clubs spent over $123 million on agents' fees between October 1 2011 and September 30 2012. That's an increase from the previous year's figures where an estimated $115 million was paid out by clubs. Premier League champions Manchester City were the biggest spenders, splashing out nearly $17 million. Manager Roberto Mancini added significantly to his squad before the 2012-13 season with the arrivals of Jack Rodwell from Everton, Javi Garcia from Benfica and Matija Nastasic from Fiorentina. That number is fractionally up on the previous year's figures, which saw City spend just under $15.5 million. While cash-rich City might have been expected to be leading the table, Liverpool's second place ranking comes as something of a surprise. Fair play? Football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap . The Anfield club spent around $13.8 million on agents' fees, with much of that coming from the reported $40 million it paid out for Fabio Borini and Joe Allen in August. Relegation-threatened Queens Park Rangers spent the third highest amount. The west London club has yet to win a single league game this season and appointed Harry Redknapp as its new manager last week after dispensing with the services of Mark Hughes. Rangers paid around $10.9 million to agents with former boss Hughes signing a host of players including Brazil's Julio Cesar from Inter Milan, Real Madrid's Esteban Granero and Ji-Sung Park from Manchester United. Tottenham ($10.5 million) and Chelsea ($10.3 million) are also at the top end, while Premier League newcomers Southampton spent just over $1 million. Arsenal insist $240 million windfall is 'all about football' According to the figures, Manchester United paid $5.7 million, which was down from $7.1 million the previous year. Of the newly-promoted clubs, West Ham United leads the way, racking up figures of $7.1 million, while Reading came close to hitting the $3.5 million mark. Arsenal ($8.8 million) and Newcastle ($5.6m) were also significant contributors.","Premier League clubs spent $123 million of agents fees between October 1 2011 and September 30 2012 .

"(CNN) -- English football's battle against racism took an unexpected turn on Saturday as police announced an investigation into an alleged altercation between a Serbian player and an opposition fan at a Premier League match. Manchester City's Aleksandar Kolarov reportedly clashed with a supporter who was waving an Albanian flag during the game at Newcastle. ""Northumbria Police has received a report of racist language having been used at the St James' Park stadium during the Newcastle United vs. Manchester City match today,"" the police said in a statement. ""Northumbria Police takes such allegations extremely seriously and enquiries are ongoing into the incident."" Serbia international Kolarov was born in the capital Belgrade. His country has long been in dispute with Albania over the Kosovo region, where war broke out in 1998. The defender was warming up on the sidelines before coming on as a first-half substitute when the argument occurred, according to the UK Press Association. Neither club was prepared to comment on Saturday, the Press Association reported. Manchester City did not immediately respond to CNN's request for a statement. It was the second match in a row involving City where non-footballing controversy has overshadowed on-pitch action. Last weekend's Manchester derby was marred by a coin attack on United player Rio Ferdinand, a pitch invasion by a supporter and arrests of other fans for alleged racist abuse. The Kolarov incident came two days after Serbia was fined $105,000 by UEFA following complaints of racial abuse from England players during an Under-21 match in October. It is the latest in a series of racism controversies going back more than a year, involving top players such as Chelsea's former England captain John Terry and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez. Referee Mark Clattenburg was accused of racially abusing a Chelsea player in October before being cleared. City bounced back from Sunday's 3-2 home defeat to beat Newcastle 3-1 and keep the pressure on leading club Manchester United. Striker Sergio Aguero and midfielder Javi Garcia put City 2-0 ahead before Demba Ba reduced the deficit with his 11th league goal this season, then Yaya Toure wrapped it up from Kolarov's cross. Kolarov did not complete the match, being substituted with 18 minutes to play. Manchester United stayed six points clear of Roberto Mancini's second-placed defending champions, beating Sunderland 3-1. Robin van Persie returned to the top of the scoring charts with his 12th EPL goal and 15th overall since signing from Arsenal in August, while midfielder Tom Cleverley made it 2-0 in the 19th minute and Wayne Rooney followed up his double against City with his seventh in the league in the second half. Struggling Sunderland rallied with a 72nd-minute goal from former United striker Frazier Campbell, but Alex Ferguson's team held on to guarantee they will be top of the table come Christmas -- and the title has gone to the team in that position for the past three seasons. It was an eventful day in the Premier League as Queens Park Rangers moved off the bottom with the club's first win in 17 games, winning 2-1 at home to London rivals Fulham to extend new manager Harry Redknapp's unbeaten run to four matches. Both goals came from Morocco midfielder Adel Taarabt, who was sold to QPR by Redknapp in 2010 when he was boss of Tottenham. Fourth-placed Everton drew 1-1 at Stoke, but may lose eight-goal midfielder Marouane Fellaini to suspension if the Belgian is punished for a headbutt that the match official did not see. ""We will take the punishment if it is given for it,"" Everton manager David Moyes said. ""I have told him in the dressing room that it is not acceptable -- I won't accept it as a manager that he does that."" Norwich moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at home to third-bottom Wigan. Aston Villa moved away from the relegation zone with a 3-1 win at Liverpool as Belgium international Christian Benteke scored twice, with the other goal coming from fellow young striker Andreas Weimann. Captain Steven Gerrard scored a late consolation as Liverpool's three-match winning run ended, leaving Brendan Rogers' team 12th -- five points behind Merseyside rivals Everton.","Police to investigate incident of alleged racist abuse of a fan by Premier League player .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund's German title defense suffered a big blow on Saturday with a controversial 3-2 home defeat by Wolfsburg. It left Jurgen Klopp's third-placed team, seeking a third successive Bundesliga crown, 14 points behind runaway leaders Bayern Munich. The match turned in the 35th minute when referee Wolfgang Stark ruled that Marcel Schmelzer handled the ball on the line, despite it appearing to hit him in the leg. Stark sent off the Dortmund defender and awarded a penalty that Diego converted to level the score at 1-1. ""I've looked at it again later and unfortunately it was an error of perception on my part,"" Stark told reporters. ""I'm sorry, that should not happen. The penalty and the red card were a mistake on my part. That's annoying."" Klopp was left to rue the consequences, as struggling Wolfsburg went on to win with goals from Naldo and Bas Dost -- whose shot had earlier hit Schmelzer. ""We were 1-0 ahead and Wolfsburg had no chance and then comes the game-winning move. It was a brutal decision,"" Klopp told reporters. Bayern won 2-0 at Augsburg to move 11 points clear of second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who travel to Hanover on Sunday. Thomas Muller opened the scoring six minutes before halftime with a penalty, his eighth goal in the league this season, after Gibril Sankoh handled Toni Kroos' pass.

It was a lead he never relinquished, despite the best efforts of Woods and, in particular, Oosthuizen -- the South African had a chance to force a playoff on the final green, but missed his birdie putt. The win sees McIlroy replace American Nick Watney at the top of the FedExCup points standings while in finishing third, Woods passed another milestone in his remarkable career. The 14-time major winner picked up $544,000, helping him become the first player to surpass $100 million in PGA Tour earnings.","Northern Irishman shoots a final round 67 to claim a one stroke victory .

"(CNN) -- Golf's European Tour has been forced to cancel October's Andalucia Masters. The Spanish event, formerly known as the Volvo Masters, has been a fixture on the European circuit since the first staging of the tournament in 1988, but Spain is currently in the grip of recession. Tour chief executive George O'Grady expressed his disappointment that the October 18-21 event, won by Spaniard Sergio Garcia in 2011 and which is staged at the Valderrama golf club, has been called off at such late notice. ""We have been long term partners with the Junta for over 25 years,"" O'Grady told the Tour's official website, referring to the region of Andalucia's government. ""In that time we have seen together with many other events, the Volvo Masters staged in Andalucía from 1988-2008, two American Express World Golf Championships, won by Tiger Woods in 1999 and Mike Weir in 2000, and the jewel in the crown, the 1997 Ryder Cup. ""We have worked together to promote the region, and the Junta de Andalucía and the European Tour have enjoyed an exceptionally strong and committed long term partnership."" Despite the setback, O'Grady hoped the Valderrama tournament could return to the European Tour's calendar in the future. ""We feel the disappointment not only for our members and all committed to broadcasting and reporting this tournament and the region on a global scale, but also for the many visitors, especially from northern Europe, who coincide their vacations with the tournament. ""We will work with the Junta to rectify this situation both now and in the future."" When Valderrama staged the Ryder Cup in 1997, Seve Ballesteros' European Team beat the U.S. 14 ½ - 13 ½. The 39th Ryder Cup match will take place later this month at the Medinnah Country Club in Illinois.","The European Tour announce the cancellation of the Andalucia Masters .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rory McIlroy continued his superb form on the PGA Tour with a eight-under-par 64 to share the lead in the BMW Championship at Crooked Stick Thursday. McIlroy came into the third leg of the FedExCup playoffs off the back of his win at the Deutsche Bank Championship and was in no mood to rest on his laurels, firing seven birdies and an eagle in the first round against a single bogey. The 23-year-old from Northern Ireland rolled home a six-foot birdie putt on the ninth, his final hole, to join U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson, Bo Van Pelt and Canadian Graeme DeLaet in the clubhouse lead. Playing partner Tiger Woods drained a long birdie putt on the par-five hole to be one back on 65 as the pair treated the galleries in Indiana to a real treat. BMW Championship latest scores . McIlroy has not looked back since claiming the final major of 2012 at the U.S. PGA Championship, and his friendly rivalry with Woods is becoming a feature of the season. The pair were interviewed together after their rounds and 14-time major winner Woods was fulsome in his praise of the young pretender to his throne. ""This is the next generation, he's a really nice kid and the game of golf is in good hands,"" the American said.

"(CNN) -- UEFA has exchanged ""initial thoughts"" with Europe's top clubs about revamping its two major competitions. One idea up for discussion is to double the European Champions League in size to include 64 teams as part of a proposal which would see the second-tier Europa League scrapped. ""We exchanged initial thoughts, but the discussions are to follow,"" a spokesman for the European Club Association (ECA), which represents 207 European clubs, told CNN in a statement. ""For the time being there's nothing concrete. ""As a principle, ECA is happy with the competition structure as it is,"" added the spokesman. ""However, we are open to discuss changes or improvements in light of the 2015-18 competition cycle. We will get together with UEFA at some point to discuss."" The Europa League has become very much the poorer relation of the two competitions with Europe's governing body earning about Â£800m more from the Champions League. And while Chelsea made Â£49m by winning the Champions League in 2012, Europa League winners Atletico Madrid earned just Â£8.5m in prize money. ""We're discussing it,"" UEFA president Michel Platini told French newspaper Ouest France. ""We will make a decision in 2014. Nothing is decided yet. ""There is an ongoing debate to determine what form the European competitions will have between 2015 and 2018."" Formerly known as the the UEFA Cup, the Europa League has been much-maligned since it was rebranded in 2009. A prolonged qualification process means a team reaching the Europa League final might have played as many as 20 games, in addition to domestic fixtures. Breakaway ""Super League"" Often high-profile clubs take the decision to play second-string teams in the competition, preferring to focus on their domestic league and the chance of qualifying for the Champions League. Earlier this season, UEFA asked managers and players to refer to the Europa League as ""prestigious"", ""rich in heritage"" and ""dramatic"". In the Ouest France interview, former French international Platini also dismissed the idea of Europe's biggest football clubs, such as Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester United, forming a breakaway ""Super League"". ""It's a question that is regularly brought up,"" said the UEFA president. ""I can't see how it could work outside the UEFA framework. Who will referee them? In what stadiums will they play?"" Meanwhile Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis is to join the ECA's executive board after David Gill, CEO of the Gunners' Premier League rivals, decided to stand down from the European club organization. Gazidis will replace Gill on the UEFA Professional Football Strategy Council, with the United executive concentrating on his candidacy for election to the UEFA Executive Committee in the coming year. ""I am pleased to welcome Ivan Gazidis on the ECA executive board,"" ECA chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said in a statement. ""His experience and distinct football knowledge will add a lot of value to ECA and European club football as a whole,"" added the German international striker, who is also chairman of Bayern Munich.

"(CNN) -- With his baby boy dangerously ill and several hours' flight away, Peter Hanson was not in the best frame of mind to be playing a golf tournament. Should he go back to the U.S. or stay in Europe and take the risk of further complications for one-year-old Tim, who was being treated for a respiratory virus at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, Florida? Assured by his wife that there was nothing he could do to help, the Swede remained in the Netherlands and pulled off an emotional victory with a sensational shot at the final hole of the KLM Open on Sunday. ""When he was put into hospital on Friday, I was panicking. He was not good for 12 to 14 hours there and as a parent that makes you feel very vulnerable,"" the 34-year-old told the European Tour website. ""I just wanted to go back home and look after the family, but my wife convinced me to stay. They were in good hands; there was nothing I could do and she was telling me that, but when your kids get sick you don't think straight."" However, he held it together enough to sink a huge eagle putt on the final hole to win his fifth European Tour title by two shots from Spain's Pablo Larrazabal and Scotland's Richie Ramsay at the Hilversumsche course. ""It's always a nice feeling, but especially this week with how things have been with my son being a little bit ill,"" said Hanson, who will play for Europe against the U.S. at the Ryder Cup this month. ""He has managed to get over that and he's getting better and better, which is the most important thing."" Hanson, who also has membership of the PGA Tour this season, had looked like missing out when, trailing Larrazabal by one shot, he drove into the trees at the 16th hole. ""I had a little gap between the two trees and I needed to hit it through that with a bit of draw. Sometimes you have to take a chance and a risk and luckily it was my day,"" said Hanson, who pocketed the $380,000 first prize to be eighth in the Race To Dubai standings. ""When we get a chance to lift these trophies, something just clicks in your head. I was just trying to stay focused. ""This was needed. It's been a bit of a slow summer for me, so this came at a perfect time to get confidence back and feel ready for the Ryder Cup."" Ramsay birdied three of the last four holes to match Hanson's final-round score of 67, but was just short of repeating his victory at last week's European Masters in Switzerland. ""On the last hole I was thinking I could hole my eagle putt and have a little run around the green but he got in first,"" he said after taking home $200,000 to go 17th in the money list with almost $1.2 million this season. ""It didn't happen for me this week but I'm proud that I gave it a go. The last three weeks have been great. Sixth, a victory and second.

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rory McIlroy has put himself in pole position to win the $10 million FedEx Cup jackpot by claiming his second successive playoff event on Sunday. The Northern Irishman followed up last Monday's win at the Deutsche Bank Championship by winning the BMW Championship by two shots, despite bogeying his last hole at Crooked Stick in Indiana. It was the 23-year-old's third win in four starts, a run which started with his second major triumph at last month's PGA Championship. He has pocketed more than $4.2 million from those victories and $7.8 million on the PGA Tour this season. It is a far cry from earlier this year, when he missed three halfway cuts in four events, including his U.S. Open title defense, and then tied for 60th at the British Open. BMW Championship final scores . ""I'm just on a great run at the moment,"" said McIlroy, who became the fourth player to win two playoff events in the same year. ""I'm playing well, I'm confident -- just hope to keep it going. ""It's great to be able to win events like this where the quality of the field is so good."" McIlroy will lead second-placed Tiger Woods by more than 3,000 points going into the deciding Tour Championship at Atlanta starting on September 20, when the top 30 players from the playoffs will line up.

He went into the final round tied for second with European Ryder Cup teammate Lee Westwood, one shot behind veterans Mickelson and Vijay Singh. McIlroy shot a five-under-par 67, while Westwood carded 69 and Mickelson 70 to share second on 18-under 270.

"(CNN) -- Javier Hernandez grabbed a dramatic late winner as Manchester United beat Newcastle 4-3 in a pulsating Boxing Day encounter at Old Trafford. The Mexican's 90th minute strike, combined with a 1-0 defeat for reigning champions Manchester City at Sunderland, left United seven points clear of their neighbors at the top of the table. He was drafted into the starting line-up in the absence of Wayne Rooney, who was injured in a training session and will be sidelined for up to three weeks with a knee ligament problem. But United trailed three times to an enterprising Newcastle, who took the lead as early as the fourth minute through James Perch. Home defender Jonny Evans drew them level in the 25th minute, but three minutes later was involved at the other end in a controversial own goal. Danny Simpson's shot struck the Northern Irish international and deflected into his home net, but it was initially ruled out because Papiss Cisse was in an offside position. Referee Mike Dean then consulted with his linesman and reversed the decision, leaving Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in a furious exchange with officials. United took until the 58th minute to draw level with Patrice Evra on target again with a low shot, but Newcastle responded with their third goal. Former United winger Gabriel Obertan set up Cisse to sweep home to give them a 3-2 lead but again it was short lived. Robin van Persie saw his shot saved by Tim Krul but was on hand to sweep home the rebound. The points looked to be shared until Michael Carrick found Hernandez with a clever pass and the striker scored on the half volley. Ferguson was delighted by the fighting spirit showed by his team in what could prove to be key moment in the title race. ""The statement was our performance, that was a championship winning performance,"" he told Sky Sports. Meanwhile, City were coming unstuck at Sunderland, with their former player Adam Johnson scoring early in the second half, his shot eluding Joe Hart to creep in. Chelsea took closer order in third, four points behind Manchester City and with a game in hand, with a 1-0 win at Norwich. Spanish star Juan Mata scored the only goal of the match for a side fast improving under Rafa Benitez. They had thrashed Aston Villa 8-0 Sunday and Villa's woes continued in the late kick off as a Gareth Bale hat-trick saw Tottenham Hotspur win 4-0. Jermain Defoe scored the other goal for Tottenham, who moved back into fourth position with the thumping away win. Everton also kept up their challenge for a Champions League place and have the same points tally as Tottenham after an earlier 2-1 home win over Wigan. Second half goals from Leon Osman and Phil Jagielka put them in command before Arouna Kone's late consolation for struggling Wigan. West Bromwich Albion are also on 33 points in sixth place with a 2-1 win at Queens Park Rangers, who slipped to the bottom as Reading secured a point in a 0-0 home draw with Swansea. In the late evening match, Stoke continued their fine recent run with a 3-1 win over Liverpool, who had led through an early Steven Gerrard penalty.","Manchester United beat Newcastle 4-3 in a Boxing Day thriller .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congress approved a $9.7 billion Superstorm Sandy aid package on Friday following delays over fiscal cliff bickering, warnings of dwindling federal funds and swirling controversy over millions of dollars for unrelated projects. The measure passed the House, 354-67. The Senate did so unanimously and without debate. It was the first legislative action of the new Congress, which picked up the Sandy package after the previous session on Tuesday shelved a vote on a much larger assistance plan for storm victims, infuriating New York and New Jersey politicians. Lawmakers from both houses will weigh in on $51 billion in additional Sandy aid on January 15. But that larger portion will likely face much closer scrutiny in a Congress anticipating more acrimony over spending and debt in coming months. House leaders initially balked at immediate consideration of a big spending bill just after concluding the excruciating negotiations around the fiscal cliff. House Speaker John Boehner preferred to wait a few days at least before holding a vote on a Sandy bill. The original storm legislation also included what some Republicans saw as congressional ""pork,"" or money for unrelated pet projects. Budget hawks viewed the extra funding as wasteful in an era of record deficits. Some lawmakers and taxpayer interest groups teased out $8 million for cars for the Homeland Security and Justice departments, $2 million for the Smithsonian to repair roofs, $150 million for fisheries, and $100 million for repair of Head Start facilities. ""It's perceived to be free money. It goes around the budget caps that are ever tightening. Traditionally we haven't offset disaster funding, but that doesn't mean that some of these things should be in there,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan budget watchdog. ""It's honey for the flies."" But New York Republican Rep. Peter King rejected criticisms of pet projects, or earmarks. ""Those reports were totally false,"" King said on CNN. The Senate Appropriations Committee said the broader aid package was designed to provide funding for any federally declared disaster last year, not just Hurricane Sandy. Conservative groups, such as the Club for Growth, urged House members to oppose Friday's scaled-back bill that included more than $9 billion to help the government pay flood insurance claims. Congress faced strong pressure to boost the debt-ridden flood insurance program, which is the primary option for that type of coverage for U.S. homeowners and businesses. It has been under severe financial pressure for years from payouts related to big storms like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Federal Emergency Management Agency told Congress on Tuesday the flood insurance program was nearly out of money to compensate storm victims and required new authority to borrow more money to meet its obligations. ""Congress should not allow the federal government to be involved in the flood insurance industry in the first place, let alone expand the national flood insurance program's authority,"" the Club for Growth wrote on its website. Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling said flood insurance claims needed to be met for victims who paid their premiums. ""But madam speaker, here is the tragic reality -- the national flood insurance program is broke. It is beyond broke. It is now taxpayer bailout broke,"" he said on the House floor. Rep. Peter King blasts his own party . Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the storm-struck region, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, unleashed a firestorm of criticism at House Republicans for not addressing the measure as originally planned on Tuesday. ""New Jersey deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display,"" Christie said, adding, that this is ""why the American people hate Congress."" GOP civil war over Sandy relief . Later, closed-door meetings between House Republicans from the Northeast and Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor got the aid package back on track with Friday's vote on flood insurance and a promise to address the rest in coming weeks. But Ellis said that tempers may flare anew when Congress debates the next portion, including the question of unrelated storm expenses. ""We have to do the scrutiny. It won't be pretty. There'll be some hurt feelings,"" he said. Opinion: GOP's obstructionism is suicide strategy . CNN's Ben Brumfield and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW: Senate approves bill following House passage .

"(CNN) -- Louis Oosthuizen delivered a masterful third-round display to take control of the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton, Massachusetts on Sunday to put the South African on the cusp of his first win in the U.S. The South African shot a super 63 as he reeled off nine birdies, including a tournament record of seven in a row from the fourth, to move to 19 under par. That birdie blitz enabled the 2010 British Open champion to move three shots clear of world number one McIlroy, who hit 67, with Tiger Woods (68) tied for third with fellow American Dustin Johnson (65). ""Probably the start anyone would dream of on that front nine,"" said Oosthuizen, who once shot a round of 57 at a course near his birthplace of Mossel Bay, South Africa.

"(CNN) -- Chelsea's onfield successes this year have led to the European soccer champions' first financial profit during the nine-year reign of owner Roman Abramovich. The Russian billionaire has bankrolled the English Premier League club since buying it for a nominal fee in 2003, posting big losses every year since then as he has sanctioned spending sprees to sign some of the sport's biggest players. Last year ended in a loss of £67.7 million ($108 million) but the figures up to June 30, 2012 reveal a profit of £1.4 million ($2.2 million). Chelsea also announced on Friday that it had made a record turnover of £255.7 million ($407 million) -- which it said is the fifth largest of any European club. That was a boost of £33 million ($52 million) from last year, driven by the club's first UEFA Champions League title and a profit on player sales of £28.8 million ($46 million). The latter figure came despite offloading players such as Didier Droga, Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou on free transfers while spending big on Juan Mata and Romelu Lukaku in that period. In comparison, Premier League rival Arsenal -- which has a more prudent transfer policy -- made a profit of £30.6 million ($48 million) on turnover of £243 million ($386 million) in figures released in September. Another key element in Chelsea's finances is that £166.6 million ($265 million) of intergroup debt was capitalized into equity -- effectively personal loans to the club written off by Abramovich -- to leave the club debt free. Chelsea is one of the clubs under the financial spotlight following the implementation of UEFA's new financial fairplay rules, which require teams to be self sufficient and limit the amount that benefactors such as Abramovich can spend with no expectation of return. If they don't meet these targets, which are being phased in over a number of years, then clubs face expulsion from top European competitions. ""The big challenge is always to have a successful team on the field that wins trophies and to make a profit at the same time,"" said Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay. ""The objectives have been set across the whole business, from the Academy to Under-21s and all the way through to the first team. ""Our club philosophy is built on success. We had that success on the field this year, as we were the first London team to win the UEFA Champions League, and we enjoyed it off the field as well and this helps us inject financial investment into the team."" Chelsea has also sought to boost its income streams, signing a three-year global energy deal with Russian corporation Gazprom in July while also taking full control of its digital media operations. ""We're in favor of Financial Fair Play,"" manager Roberto di Matteo told reporters on Friday ahead of this weekend's home clash with Liverpool. ""We're doing everything in our power to comply with the new rules, and this is great news for the club. ""For the first time, we've been able to achieve a profit -- also thanks to the success on field, but off field as well, with new sponsor deals and also the transfer market. ""Going forward, I think that puts Chelsea in a strong position to remain competitive at domestic level but also international level."" It has been a mixed season so far for Chelsea, with impressive onfield performances marred by racism controversies. Captain John Terry has just completed a four-match ban for abusing a black opponent a year ago, while the club has lodged a complaint against EPL referee Mark Clattenburg over alleged racist remarks made to Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel. A Chelsea fan has also been arrested for making an alleged monkey gesture towards a Manchester United player during last week's English League Cup match at Stamford Bridge.","Chelsea announces profit of $2.2 million for the period ending June 30, 2012 .

But it had hoped to at least pick up the consolation of making it through to the Europa League, especially with Ajax facing Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. English Premier League's hidden costs revealed . But that dream was left shattered as the English Premier League champions were given a reality check. Boss Roberto Mancini will now look ahead to Sunday's Manchester derby after his team became the first from England to not win a single group game in the competition. ""We lost our qualification tonight,"" he told reporters. ""We lost it before tonight, we tried (to qualify) but we're missing more players. We had the chance to score but if in these moments you don't score it's difficult to win. ""We are not in the Europa League, and for this we should be disappointed."" Elsewhere in Group D, Kaka scored the 28th Champions League goal of his career to become the all-time leading Brazilian goalscorer in the competition. The Real Madrid star was on target during his side's 4-1 win over Ajax with Cristiano Ronaldo and a brace from Jose Callejon completing the rout. Kaka's strike takes him past former Barcelona star Rivaldo, who had led the way with 27 goals to his name. Messi and Ronaldo battle for Ballon d'Or . Ronaldo's effort was his 61st goal of 2012, one more than last year, and his seventh against Ajax in the Champions League. The win means Real qualify in second place behind Borussia Dortmund. In Group A, Paris Saint-Germain claimed a 2-1 victory and top spot against Porto with both teams already having qualified for the next stage. Thiago Silva and Ezequiel Lavezzi were on target for the home side with Jackson Martinez netting for Porto, which finishes second in the group. Dynamo Kiev was forced to play through a snow storm during its 1-1 draw at Dinamo Zagreb. Both teams were led off the field with just 11 minutes on the clock as a blizzard forced the game to be halted. After a 17 minute delay, it was Kiev which looked like emerging victorious thanks to Andriy Yarmolenko's strike on the stroke of halftime. But a 90th minute penalty by Ivan Krstanović, Dinamo's first goal of the competition, rescued a point for his side. Fans cemetery: From the cradle to the grave service provided by Schalke .

"(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia leads The Barclays, first leg of the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs, after Saturday's excellent third round that puts him firmly in contention for the title. American Nick Watney is two strokes behind after a round of 71. A win at Bethpage would see Garcia top the FedEx cup points table. Live scores from Bethpage .

Recent US PGA champion Rory Mcilroy sits two under par after his third round of 69 helped him recover from his poor second round. Read about Bethpage Black's vengeful course . Garcia hit a number of birdies to finish two ahead of the chasing pack, but it was a tremendous shot from the long grass on the tenth that stood out as Garcia chipped on to the fairway after hooking his shot well wide. The fine recovery helped the Spaniard rescue a bogey, when things could have been much worse. Garcia needs to finish well at Bethpage as he has already announced that he won't play at next week's Deutsche Bank Championship so that he can enjoy some rest before September's Ryder Cup. Watney hit five bogeys to undo a good start. After three birdies in the first five holes he struggled on the back nine to leave him even at the end of his round. Woods managed back-to-back birdies on the seventh and eighth to leave him one under. However, two bogeys on the back nine, after a fine birdie on the 13th, left the American one stroke over for the day. The highlight of Woods' round was a 53 feet 1 inch putt on the eighth that helped him birdie the par three hole. The delightful put was the American's longest of the year.

"(CNN) -- Former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova became the first big name seed to exit the star-studded WTA tournament in Tokyo as she fell victim Tuesday to unheralded Croatian Petra Martic. Fourth seed Kvitova was well below her best in the second round match at the Pan Pacific Open and three double faults in her opening game to lose serve left the Czech on the back foot. Martic, who has been sidelined by injury, took full advantage to take the first set and after claiming the first game of the second to love, was always in command. A 6-4 6-4 win was the biggest of her fledgling career and followed a remarkable first round victory over Andrea Petkovic of Germany, where she trailed 6-0 1-0 before recovering to win in three sets. Kvitova, who will now head early to Beijing for her next tournament, admitted she had been outplayed. ""She has a big serve and it is tough to push her. She kept me on the defensive and running a lot, and that's not my game,"" she told the official WTA Tour website. ""She played so well today, very aggressive,"" Kvitova, 22, added. World No.2 Maria Sharapova also faced an early exit when she trailed British qualifier Heather Watson by a set, but she hit back in typical style to grind out a 6-7 6-3 6-4 win in over three hours. . ""I was not consistent enough. I had opportunities to win the first set and I didn't,"" said Sharapova. But former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki continued her more impressive recent form with a 7-6 6-1 dismissal of Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova. Dane Wozniacki took her first WTA Tour title in more than a year in Seoul last week as she bids to re-enter the top 10 after a recent slump. Current No.1 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus also looked in fine fettle after her U.S. Open heroics where she lost a superb final to Serena Williams. She beat Tamira Paszek of Austria 6-1 6-1, while defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland saw off Jelena Jankovic of Serbia 6-2 7-5.

"(CNN) -- World No.1 Victoria Azarenka lived up to her to billing with a tenacious three set victory over Maria Sharapova to reach the U.S. Open final against 14-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams who dispatched Italy's Sara Errani in two sets late Friday. Azarenka recovered from a set and a break down to win a grueling battle against the Russian third seed after two hours 42 minutes on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows. The Belarus star had continuously pressed on the Sharapova service in the decider and finally made the breakthrough in the 10th and final game. A first match point was saved by 2006 champion Sharapova, but reigning Australian Open champion Azarenka worked another opening with more determined play to win the match 3-6, 6-2, 6-4. ""To come back was pretty difficult because Maria is a terrific fighter,"" she told Sky Sports after her win. ""I just had to try to stay focused and when I had the opportunity I had to set it up,"" she added. Azarenka will take on Serena Williams in the final after the American made fast work of her semi-final defeat of Italy's Sara Errani. Williams knocked out underdog Errani in just over one hour, 6-1, 6-2. ""I just try first set to be a bit more on the defense, to receive a bit more far away, and play her high balls and try to make that game -- then was not so good, so I changed and try to be a bit more aggressive,"" said the 25-year-old Errani. ""In any case, it was very difficult,"" she added. Wiliams is the only player left in the women's 2012 singles draw not to have dropped a set, matching the record of men's defending champion Novak Djokovic. In last year's U.S. Open, Williams beat Azarenka in the third round, 6-1, 7-6 (5). The fourth seed has a 9-1 head-to-head advantage against the Belarussia over the course of the careers, including wins in the 2012 Wimbledon and Olympic semifinals. ""I don't have anything to lose,"" said Williams. ""I feel like I'm going up against I personally think the most consistent and the best player this year, being Victoria Azarenka... it will be a good challenge for me.""

"(CNN) -- Spain will face a testing tie in the opening round of the 2013 Davis Cup after being drawn against Canada. The five-time winners, who will take on the Czech Republic in this year's final from November 16-18, defeated Canada in the only previous meeting between the two nations back in 1991.

Spain defeat U.S. to reach Davis Cup final . ""Canada was one of the strongest opponents we could have drawn, not only for the quality of the team led by Milos Raonic but also for the fact that we are the away team and only a week after the Australian Open,"" Corretja told the Spanish Tennis Federation's website.

"(CNN) -- Formula One championship leader Fernando Alonso believes the race for the drivers' title has tipped in Ferrari's favor. Ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, the 31-year-old Alonso leads the standings by 24 points despite not getting past the first corner in Belgium last weekend. ""We know in some races the McLaren will look strong and win the race and in some races we will be strong and win the race, and in some others it will be Red Bull,"" said Alonso, who will be fit for Ferrari's home race at Monza after recovering from injuries sustained in a spectacular crash at Spa on Sunday. ""I think in this combination and this mix of different winners we will have the advantage."" Title leader Alonso fit for Monza after Belgian Grand Prix horror crash . Two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel capitalized on the chaos of the Spa pileup to finish second at the Belgian GP and move ahead of Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in the overall standings, cutting Alonso's advantage by 10 points. But the Spaniard believes his competitors have less room for error with eight races to go in the F1 season. ""The position that we have in the championship now, we can afford one mistake, we can afford one bad race, but the others cannot, so I think the pressure is with the others at the moment,"" he told CNN. ""The car I know is 100% also without any big damage. We had to change 90% of the car but it is ready. I think it won't have any impact on the Monza race and that's important, and hopefully we will recover some points."" Button wins in Belgium in race marred by spectacular first corner crash . Alonso viewed six drivers -- Red Bull's Vettel and Webber, Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus, as well as McLaren's Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button -- as threats to his chances of a first crown since he won for the second successive year with Renault in 2006. ""In the next two or three races that will become two or three contenders, so I think it is a very crucial part of the championship now,"" he said. Alonso hopes that home advantage will give Ferrari an added edge at Monza. ""For the team it's extra motivation, for the mechanics and the supporters and all the people that are in our team,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga crashed out of the U.S. Open in the second round Thursday, beaten 6-4 1-6 6-1 6-3 by Slovakia's Martin Klizan. France's Tsonga put up a lackluster display to become the first major casualty of the final grand slam of the season. Tsonga, who reached the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows last year, was due to face Britain's Andy Murray at the same stage this year, his exit potentially easing the path of the Olympic champion. Murray will face Feliciano Lopez in the third round after the Spanish veteran beat compatriot Pablo Andujar 6-4 6-1 6-7 3-6 7-5 in a five-set epic. World No.52 Klizan was reaching that stage of a grand slam for the first time and will face either 32nd seed Jeremy Chardy of France, who beat Murray in Cincinnati, or Australia's Matthew Ebden. He stunned Tsonga with a display of attacking tennis and quickly took a one set lead. Tsonga looked to have restored confidence in the second set until Klizan restored his advantage in the third. The Slovakian opened up a 4-0 lead in the fourth set and although Tsonga broke back to reduce the lead to 4-3, he closed it out in style.

"(CNN) -- Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher will reach the 300-race milestone when he competes in this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps. The 43-year-old German is the second driver in F1 history, after Brazil's Rubens Barrichello, to achieve the feat and will be hoping for an upturn in his fortunes in his Mercedes. A superb podium finish at the European Grand Prix has been mixed with retirements in six of 10 races this season and Schumacher is confident he can turn it around on his favorite circuit. ""Spa is like my living room; for me, it's clearly the number one race track in the world,"" Schumacher told the official F1 website. ""It's uncanny how I always seem to have special moments there -- my debut, my first win, a world championship victory and many great races. ""We delivered a good performance in Spa last year; I'll be doing everything possible to drive a strong race,"" he added. Schumacher's first appearance in F1 came at Spa in 1991 for Jordan before he moved to Benetton to win successive titles in 1994 and 1995. He switched to Ferrari the next year and won five further titles with the famous marque before retiring in 2006. His return in 2010 with Mercedes has not seen him add to his 91 GP wins, but he remains determined to carry on competing. ""I'm proud to be just the second driver in the history of the sport to reach this milestone,"" he said. Barrichello made 326 Grand Prix appearances before retiring at the end of 2011.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has already denied Andy Murray his first grand slam title once, and the world No. 2 will again stand in the Olympic gold medalist's way in Monday's U.S. Open final. Djokovic kept his title defense alive with a commanding performance against David Ferrer on Sunday, rebounding after dropping his first set of the tournament to win their delayed semifinal 2-6 6-1 6-4 6-2. The Serbian had struggled in Saturday's strong winds and trailed 5-2 when play was halted, but he was unstoppable in more benign conditions as he reached the final for the third year in a row. ""It's a huge relief to get through this match. David's a great competitor, he's one of the fittest guys on tour and he never gives up,"" Djokovic told reporters after a match lasting two and a half hours -- 90 minutes less than Murray's win over Tomas Berdych on Saturday. ""We were all praying for less wind today. He handled the wind much better than I did but I came in today as a different player and I'm just really happy to get to another grand slam final."" U.S. Open latest scores . Djokovic lost his first grand slam final at the 2007 U.S. Open but was able to quickly bounce back with his breakthrough win in Australia just months later. Murray, however, lost the 2008 New York final, in Melbourne in 2010 and 2011 -- the first of those against Djokovic -- and then at Wimbledon this year. However, he beat Djokovic and Roger Federer on the way to victory at London 2012 and is now seeking to end a run that has seen that duo and Rafael Nadal win 29 of the past 30 majors. ""I don't think there is any clear favorite,"" said Djokovic, who has an 8-5 edge over Murray in their career meetings. ""He's looking for his first title, I'm sure he's going to be very motivated. I hope we can come up with the best tennis for this crowd."" Murray has the backing of high-profile fellow Scots Sean Connery and Alex Ferguson. ""That's the first time I've met Sir Alex and first time I met Sir Sean, as well,"" Murray said after the James Bond actor and Manchester United football manager gatecrashed his post-match press conference on Saturday. ""So that's obviously nice to have their support. Hopefully they'll be back for the final, as well."" Ferrer is still waiting to play in his first grand slam final after 40 attempts. The Spanish fourth seed, who also reached the semis at Flushing Meadows in 2007, served out for the first set on Sunday but then lost five games in a row. Djokovic won the first four games of the fourth set against the French Open semifinalist as he won through to his ninth grand slam final. The 25-year-old will be looking to cap a season in which he won the opening major but then failed to become the first player since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles when he lost to Rafael Nadal in the French Open final. Djokovic then surrendered his No. 1 ranking when he lost in the semifinals at Wimbledon and Roger Federer won a seventh title on the hallowed grass courts of the All England Club to match Pete Sampras' Open era record and afterwards surpass the American's landmark number of 286 weeks at the top of the rankings. Djokovic cannot return to No. 1 even if he retains his title, despite Federer's quarterfinal exit against Berdych -- his earliest at the hard-court tournament since 2004. He will be looking for revenge against Murray after failing to win a medal at London 2012, losing to Juan Martin del Potro in the bronze playoff, and is in strong form on his favored surface after last month winning the Toronto title and reaching the final in Cincinnati.","Second seed Novak Djokovic wins through to U.S. Open final for third year in a row .

The Honda rider snatched first place on the grid by 0.018 of a second in the dying seconds of qualifying, ahead of compatriot Jorge Lorenzo on the Yamaha and Britain's Cal Cal Crutchlow who finished third. Pedrosa's 41st career pole puts him in prime position to close the gap on Lorenzo in the overall standings. The 26-year-old, who is seeking to win a first MotoGP title, currently trails Lorenzo by 13 points with only six races (including San Marino) left this season. Germany's Stefan Bradl will start Sunday's race in fourth, while Spain's Alvaro Bautista on the Honda finished qualifying in fifth. Valentino Rossi equalled his season's best performance in qualifying, finishing sixth. The Misano circuit was officially renamed the ""Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli"" earlier in the year as a mark of respect to the rider who was killed at the Malaysian Grand Prix in October 2011. The Italian lived a short distance away from the circuit in Cattolica. On Thursday, riders from all three classes assembled on the grid to complete a lap of the circuit on bicycles to pay tribute to the Honda rider who was just 24 years old when tragedy struck.","Spanish rider pips his compatriot Jorge Lorenzo to pole by less that two hundredths of a second .

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa sealed pole in Sunday's Indianapolis Grand Prix in a qualifying session marred with a number of heavy crashes. Yamaha Factory Racing's Jorge Lorenzo took second ahead of Monster Yamaha Tech3's Andrea Dovizioso. The first red flag of the session came after Casey Stoner suffered a suspected torn ankle ligament when he went off early in the session. Ducati's Nicky Hayden was thrown from his bike at the same corner as Stoner later in the day. The American was briefly unconscious at the side of the track, causing another red flag while he received medical attention. Valentino Rossi will start 11th after a disappointing session.

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both opening practice sessions Friday for the Hungarian Grand Prix. The 2008 world champion has had a miserable run of late in the race for the F1 title, but showed his class with a time of one minute 21.995 seconds in the afternoon runs before the session was hit by rain. As the circuit became more treacherous, the British star stayed out to set fast laps before being pulled in by his team. The conditions claimed seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who lost the front wing of his Mercedes as he went off on Turn 11 of the Hungaroring at speed. ""I just locked up and run out of road,"" he told the official F1 website. ""By hitting the tires, I lost the front wing, but other than that, nothing is damaged on the car, I believe. It was the kind of incident that happens when suddenly a shower hits the dry track,"" Schumacher added, . The German star clocked a best time of one minute 23.160 seconds, but another former champion, Kimi Raikkonen of Finland was second best in his Lotus in one minute 22.180 seconds. ""We were second fastest which was good, and we've managed to improve the setup on my car over the last few races so I've been pretty happy with it,"" said Raikkonen. Bruno Senna in his Williams was third fastest with the Ferraris of Felipe Massa and championship leader Fernando Alonso fourth and fifth fastest. Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel was only eighth best in the Red Bull, with teammate Mark Webber, Alonso's nearest challenger, back in 14th. Hamilton was quickest in the morning runs ahead of teammate Jenson Button as McLaren look to build on the improved performance of their car in Germany last weekend in the race at Hockenheim won by Alonso.","Lewis Hamilton fastest in both opening practice sessions for Hungary GP .

"(CNN) -- For even the sport's most ardent fans, Formula One can be confusing -- it is governed by a set of ever-evolving rules dominated by talk of technical specifications. So if you are a sports enthusiast who is considering checking out the race action when the 2012 season begins in Australia on Sunday, it is more than likely you will have a few questions. Posers such as, ""How long can a race go on for?"" Or, ""Why do they use so many tires?"" Or maybe even, ""Why does the front of the car look so weird?"" Some of the changes are more technical, the main one involving exhaust diffusion -- a big bone of contention in the past two seasons. In the gallery above, CNN has attempted to explain and simplify the host of rule changes which have been brought in ahead of the new campaign so you can fully appreciate all of the elite motorsport's thrills and spills.","The 2012 Formula One season begins this weekend with the Australian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- When U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk made his closely-watched walk up the 45 Capitol steps Thursday, his progress was slowed more by all the well-wishers than by the fact that he had to re-learn how to walk this past year. The 53-year-old Republican from Illinois suffered a massive stroke last January. He underwent three separate brain surgeries at Northwestern University Hospital. Then he started an intensive kind of physical therapy at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, including a nine-week long mobility study. ""It's impressive to watch him, especially when you have a guy who was so impaired when he began,"" said George Hornby, a research scientist and director of research for RIC's AbilityLab, the unique program which treated Kirk. After enrolling in a research study, he soon began walking about 3,600 steps a day. Senator makes emotional return to Capitol after stroke . ""It was a very high-intensity program and we kept pushing him. We even had him on the StairMaster -- even I hate doing the StairMaster at the gym,"" Hornby said. Overall, the exercise regimen could be difficult for even the most able-bodied person. But by July 12, Kirk was able to walk without a cane or harness. In November, he even walked up 37 stories to get to the top of Chicago's tallest skyscraper for a fundraiser. Kirk's inability to walk at first following his stroke is typical. Only 37% of survivors are able to walk in their first week after suffering a stroke, according to a Duke University study. Even patients with mild to moderate impairment experience falls. Some 73% of stroke patients fall at least once due to the stroke's lingering effects, according to the study. People with less mobility can experience increased vascular risk factors due to lack of exercise that can lead to diabetes or even further strokes. In the past, doctors weren't entirely sure how much stroke patients should push themselves physically. Still today, only half of the 800,000 people who suffer strokes annually receive any kind of rehabilitation, according to Janet Bettger, a stroke expert at the Duke University School of Nursing. But studies show there is an immediate need for physical therapy and exercise. ""There was a time when we didn't think people should try moving right away, and there was a time when we weren't sure people really should be pushing themselves physically,"" Bettger said, ""but we've seen people make remarkable progress with therapy."" Robotic system may help stroke patients . Research suggests rehabilitation work should start in the acute care hospital as early as 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. ""That's where we see the best outcome and the most opportunity because the brain is still adapting to the injury then,"" Bettger said. Each stroke is different, so therapy must be tailor-made to that individual. Kirk's stroke impacted the right side of his brain, which affected his left arm, left leg and the left side of his face. He underwent therapy that targeted the mobility of his arm. Speech therapy improved the challenges he had talking because of the impact the stroke had on his face. And then there was his intensive walking therapy. The walking program was different than standard physical therapy, according to Hornby. In standard physical therapy, a patient does a lot of stretching and then goes through different physical steps like sitting and standing before they try and walk. ""In this case we said, 'Forget those stepping stones. Let's go ahead and walk him and all the posture and control will get better,' "" Hornby said. ""It was a novel approach and it worked."" Kirk was an extremely determined patient. Not all are, according to Hornby. ""If people are not horribly determined, though, we have ways of tricking them. People are motivated differently. It's not unlike being a coach on a sports team -- you just have to relate to a person and figure out what gets them moving, but the important thing is to get them moving."" Physical rehabilitation can't ""cure"" a person completely. Kirk will continue to use a four-pronged cane like the one he used on the Capitol steps. He will use a wheelchair for longer distances. But Bettger said the attention paid to Kirk's story should help other stroke patients. ""After intense therapy, I've seen some people ski and run marathons,"" Bettger said. ""Seeing immense progress like this should give people real hope.""","U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk walks up 45 Capitol steps .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has warned his team not to get carried away by this season's remarkable turnaround in form. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will take a 34-point lead over Red Bull's Mark Webber into Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix despite having almost written off the Scuderia's title chances in preseason. After early misgivings over the 2012 car, the Spaniard now has three successes from 10 starts -- two of them in the last three grands prix. Webber, with two victories, is the only other driver to have topped the podium more than once. Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa is back in 14th overall with only 23 points, meaning second-placed Ferrari trail Red Bull by 53 points in the manufacturers' standings after last Sunday's race in Germany. ""I am concerned, more so than the day after Valencia (when Alonso won his second race of 2012),"" Montezemolo said on the Ferarri website ahead of the final race before Formula One's month-long break. Latest Formula One standings . ""I see very strong opponents: McLaren has made great progress, Red Bull is very strong, Sauber had a race pace that was a match for ours and Lotus is very strong at times. ""Therefore, we have to be very careful. After we had a difficult start to the season, maybe our rivals did not expect to see Ferrari capable of fighting back this strongly, but now they will redouble their efforts to beat us. Therefore, we must stay very focused and continue our efforts to improve continuously."" Alonso was third at the Hungaroring last year as Jenson Button gave McLaren a fifth victory in seven years at the circuit, which is one of the slowest on the F1 calendar. ""It's going to be tight again. It's a very short circuit, and as we saw this year, in two- or three-tenths there are eight, nine cars,"" Alonso said on the F1 website. ""In Hungary we need to make a perfect preparation again, a perfect qualifying, because you can be starting in 12th or 13th if you make a little mistake, so we need to approach the race in the same way we did the last couple, try to maximize what we have in Hungary and hopefully bring in some new parts that can help us. McLaren chief: F1 teams must unite . ""At the moment our car seems okay in all areas, there are not weak points, as maybe we had at the beginning of the season when we were suffering a little bit on traction and top speed. Now I think that we are okay on that. ""In Hungary with these slow-speed corners, I don't see any problem with the car. We should be competitive there."" Button returned to form with second place at Hockenheim, and McLaren hope that last weekend's upgrades will make the team even more competitive at a track where Lewis Hamilton won in 2007 and 2009 -- and former drivers Kimi Raikkonen (2005) and Heikki Kovalainen (2008) also triumphed. ""The race pace certainly enabled Jenson to stay in touch with the Red Bull and Ferraris,"" said managing director Jonathan Neale. ""So on that day, on that circuit, in those conditions we were there or thereabouts. I don't think that we are dominant and we need to continue to work very hard. But we're pleased with it."" Button also won in Budapest for Honda in 2006 for the first victory of his career, after Raikkonen took pole position for McLaren. ""(Last year) I celebrated my 200th grand prix there on the Saturday evening with some of my oldest friends and colleagues in the paddock and I went on to win on Sunday. It was the perfect weekend,"" the Englishman recalled. ""There's every reason to believe we can get another good result this year. Our pace at Hockenheim gives us cause for encouragement -- it's just that, as always, we'll need to run flawlessly through qualifying and the race if we're to be in the hunt at the end."" De Villota discharged from UK hospital . Red Bull's two-time defending world champion Sebastian Vettel was second in Hungary last year, and is aiming to bounce back from last weekend's disappointment at Hockenheim when he was demoted to fifth for an illegal late overtaking move on Button. However, the UK-based Austrian team will need to make adjustments after ruling body the FIA deemed Red Bull's engine mapping to change the aerodynamics of the cars and therefore be illegal. ""The track is one of the slowest on the calendar, but as a driver you shouldn't underestimate it as there are a lot of opportunities to make mistakes,"" the German said. ""It can be very hot and that means the track can be very demanding physically. In addition, the surface has many bumps which shake you around a lot."" Rain is forecast for Friday's practice sessions, but the weather should be hot and sunny for qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday. ""A twisty and slippery circuit will often put more heat through the tire than a fast and flowing layout as the tire is moving around more -- particularly when the ambient temperatures are high,"" said Paul Hembery, managing director of F1's sole supplier Pirelli. ""Having said that, in Hungary last year we saw some wet weather, so it's important not to make any assumptions. Consequently, we are still lacking some information about the performance of our slick tires under race conditions at the Hungaroring."" Meanwhile, Marussia test driver Maria de Villota has left hospital in her native Spain and will return home to recover from the crash in Britain that cost her an eye. ""The patient's general conditions are good, which allowed us to release her,"" her website reported on Thursday. ""In the last six days, she has been treated by specialists of the plastic and neurological surgery services, and the ophthalmology department, who will continue to follow her as she will need to undergo periodical checks and treatments. ""From a neurological point of view, the patient does not present any deficit and does not need any surgery."" De Villota, one of two women contracted to an F1 team this year, collided with a stationary support truck after completing her first lap at her first test outing for the UK-based Russian marque.","Ferrari's Fernando Alonso leads F1 world championship ahead of Hungarian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer crashed out of the U.S. Open after a surprise defeat at the hands of Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych, ending the world No. 1's hopes of winning a record sixth title in the professional era. Berdych won 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 3-6 6-3 in under three hours in Wednesday's evening session to reach the semifinals for the first time at Flushing Meadows. ""I just didn't come up with the goods tonight,"" said Federer, in quotes carried on the official tournament website, after his first match in four days following a walkover against American Mardy Fish. ""He probably created more than I did, and that's why he ended up winning."" Sharapova to face No. 1 Azarenka in U.S. Open semis . Federer made his earliest exit in New York since 2003 and now has an 11-5 record against the 26-year-old -- who beat him at the 2004 Olympics and at Wimbledon in 2010, when he went on to lose in the final. Berdych will face Olympic champion Andy Murray in the last four, after the Scot came back from a set down to oust giant Croatian Marin Cilic, winning 3-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 6-0. Cilic, who will be left to rue a number of missed opportunities, surrendered a 5-1 lead in the second set. This proved to be a turning point for the resurgent Murray, who finally found his rhythm as his confidence grew. All of a sudden, he had answers to the 12th seed's massive serve and booming forehand as he breezed through the next two sets to earn a place in the semis. The match had been moved from the main Arthur Ashe Stadium to the Louis Armstrong court, and 2008 U.S. Open finalist Murray struggled in front of an initially small crowd against a player who beat him at the same tournament three years ago. ""You have to be able to create your own atmosphere when you're on the court, but I did play better when the crowd filled up,"" said Murray, still seeking his first grand slam title after losing to Federer in July's Wimbledon final. ""It's a quicker court. When you switch from one court to the other, it can take time to get into a rhythm. I have never played particularly well on that court."" Earlier, 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro brought the curtain down on Andy Roddick's glittering career by beating the home favorite in four sets in their rain-delayed fourth-round match on Arthur Ashe. Roddick, the last U.S. male to win a grand slam when he triumphed in New York in 2003, announced last week that it would be his last tournament. The former world No. 1 met his match against the seventh-seeded Argentinian, who will play defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. When play resumed after being tied at 6-6 in the first set from Tuesday, Roddick took the tiebreaker but he could make no further progress against the 23-year-old Olympic bronze medalist. There were no breaks of service in the second, but Del Potro took the tiebreaker and then proceeded to dominate, completing a 6-7 (1-7) 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 6-4 victory. Roddick was visibly emotional in the final game on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court and received a huge ovation from the crowd as he bowed out. ""Playing the last five games was pretty hard. Once I got down a break, I could barely look at my (players) box,"" Roddick said. ""I don't know what the emotions are. I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I normally feel like I can grasp things pretty quickly and clearly. I certainly don't feel that way right now."" World No. 2 Djokovic had easier progress, as his opponent Stanislas Wawrinka was forced to retire when trailing by two sets and 3-1 in the third. The Swiss 18th seed complained of feeling ill as the rain-delayed match came to a swift conclusion. ""It's an unfortunate situation that happened with him, but I felt that I was hitting the ball well in the last two sets before that happened,"" said Djokovic, who reached his sixth successive U.S. Open quarterfinal, having dropped just 20 games in four matches. ""Hopefully I can keep that going for the next match."" His fellow Serbian, eighth seed Janko Tipsarevic, reached the last eight at Flushing Meadows for the second straight year as he eased past Germany's No. 19 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-2. He will next play Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer, who has been in equally fine form in the final grand slam of the season.","Top seed Roger Federer loses against Tomas Berdych in U.S. Open quarterfinals .

Citizens performed at least 67 minutes of public service on his birthday, a reference to the number of years he devoted to helping others. Mandela's impact has extended far beyond the borders of his own country. After he left office in 1999, he was involved in international situations ranging from conflicts in Africa to the Mideast. In January 2000, he addressed the United Nations Security Council, appealing for help in ending the brutal civil war between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis in Burundi. In December 2003, he participated in the signing of the Geneva Accords for peace in the Middle East.

"(EW.com) -- Despite the arrival of two holiday heavyweights, ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" retained the top spot at the box office for the third weekend in a row. Warner Bros.' $250 million fantasy prequel was held out of the top spot from Tuesday until Thursday by ""Les Miserables,"" but over the traditional weekend frame ""Hobbit"" dipped only 11 percent to bring in $32.9 million, and its domestic total now stands tall at $222.7 million. After 17 days, ""The Hobbit"" is performing well ahead of 2001′s ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" which had earned $189.3 million at the same point in its run (though that number climbs to about $260 million after accounting for inflation), but it still trails the 17-day cumes of ""The Two Towers"" ($243.6 million), and ""The Return of the King"" ($272.8 million). Notably, those films did not have 3D or IMAX surcharges boosting their totals. This is not meant to imply that ""The Hobbit"" is underperforming. Like so many modern Hollywood tentpoles, The Hobbit's strong business overseas is the main component of its success. On Friday, the film smashed through the $600 million mark worldwide, and by the time the ball drops, its worldwide total will likely have surpassed $700 million. That's a treasure that would impress even Smaug. In second place, ""Django Unchained"" galloped away with a terrific $30.7 million over the Friday-to-Sunday period, bringing its total to $64 million since its Christmas day debut. The Quentin Tarantino-directed Western, which The Weinstein Co. says cost $87 million to produce, has performed remarkably well for a controversial, R-rated film in a season often dominated by family-friendly/inspirational tales. Last year, many blamed a poor release date for the lackluster performance of ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" which settled for $102.5 million total, but ""Django's"" fantastic opening week counters those assumptions. GET EW ON YOUR TABLET: Subscribe today and get instant access! Given its robust debut, ""Django Unchained"" will very likely become Tarantino's highest-grossing film ahead of 2009′s ""Inglorious Basterds,"" which earned $120.5 million total. Weinstein has every reason to believe it will reach that level. Not only was Django's $10,195 per theater average (from 3,010 theaters) the best in the Top 10, it earned an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade from polled audiences, which were 56 percent male. After winning Christmas day and spending its first three days atop the box office, ""Les Miserables"" finished the weekend in third place with $28.0 million. Universal's $61 million adaptation of the beloved operetta (which is, in turn, an adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel) has earned a terrific $67.4 million in its first six days (plus another $48.7 million internationally), and although it has exhibited some frontloadedness due to up-front excitement from passionate fans, its ""A"" CinemaScore grade (and ample awards buzz) should help it hold up in the weeks to come. ""Les Miserables"" has already outgrossed the last December-released musical, Nine, which flopped with just $19.7 million in 2009, and it will quickly surpass ""Dreamgirls,"" which opened in December 2006 and scored $103.4 million total, as well. Only time will tell whether ""Les Mis"" can match the impressive $170.7 million total of Chicago, which began a platform release in December 2002 and rode a wave of awards attention to box office glory, but for now, its prospects don't look miserable at all. Fox's Billy Crystal/Bette Midler vehicle ""Parental Guidance"" survived poor reviews and earned a not-bad $14.8 million over the weekend — the exact same amount it earned in its first three days of release. After six days, Guidance has earned $29.6 million against a modest $25 million budget, and with an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade and a dearth of family-oriented competition, it should hold up nicely in the new year. Paramount's $60 million Tom Cruise thriller ""Jack Reacher"" rounded out the Top 5 with $14.0 million, marking a 10 percent drop from its inauspicious debut. After ten days, the novel adaptation has earned a rather unimpressive $44.7 million. 1. The Hobbit — $32.9 million . 2. Django Unchained — $30.7 million . 3. Les Miserables — $28.0 million . 4. Parental Guidance — $14.8 million . 5. Jack Reacher — $14.0 million . In milestone news, ""Skyfall"" reached the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office this weekend.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Novak Djokovic dropped just five games as he progressed to the third round of the U.S. Open on Friday. The Serb needed only one hour and 39 minutes on court to see off Brazil's Rogerio Dutra Silva in straight sets (6-2 6-1 6-2), but said the scoreline didn't reflect the battle. ""It was very windy so it was very important to stay focused, but I played great. Even if the scoreline doesn't indicate it, it was a tough match,"" Djokovic said. ""It's important to get a day's rest and work on some things in my game and get ready for the next challenge,"" Djokovic added. That next challenge is likely to be 31st seed Julien Benneteau of France who plays U.S. teenager Dennis Novikov later on Friday. Benneteau's compatriot Richard Gasquet also coasted through his second round match beating America's Bradley Klahn 6-3 6-3 6-1. Earlier, America's Steve Johnson booked his place in the third round with a four-set (6-7 7-6 6-3 6-4) win over Latvia's Ernests Gulbris, as did fourth seed David Ferrer. The Spaniard, a semi-finalist at Flushing Meadows back in 2007, was a comfortable 6-2 6-3 7-6 (14-12) winner over Dutch qualifier Igor Sijsling.

"(CNN) -- Victoria Azarenka reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open for the first time after battling past defending champion Samantha Stosur in three sets Tuesday. The world No. 1 lived up to her status with a 6-1 4-6 7-6 (7-5) victory over the seventh seed from Australia in a match disrupted by a 75-minute rain delay. ""We both showed some excellent tennis,"" said Azarenka, who has the best record on hard courts this season with a 30-2 winning margin in WTA Tour events. ""You could feel the pressure all the time. We really both gave it all. We fought really hard, making each other run like crazy."" She will play either French 11th seed Marion Bartoli or Maria Sharapova of Russia, who started playing the second quarterfinal before rain ended the rest of Tuesday's schedule. ""To be in the semifinals of the U.S. Open for the first time is incredible. I don't want to stop. I want it bad. I'm going to do absolutely everything I can here,"" said Azarenka, who had beaten Stosur in straight sets in their previous six meetings. ""She really pushed me to dig deep. She kept coming back really strong and keeping me back, and I wasn't getting as many opportunities -- I just kept telling myself, 'Don't be a chicken, come on, just go, go for your shots.' "" Azarenka was two breaks ahead in the first set when the showers hit Flushing Meadows, but did not take long to close it out when the players returned. But Stosur, who sensationally beat Serena Williams in last year's final, was not going to relinquish her crown easily and gained an early break in the second set. Belarus star Azarenka broke back immediately, but dropped her service gain to trail 4-3 and could not recover. It was the first set she had lost in the final grand slam of the season. The final set saw Azarenka twice lead after breaks, but with tension mounting Stosur twice retrieved the breaks to set up a tiebreaker. Again Azarenka pulled ahead to a 4-0 lead, but showing signs of nerves she gave up the advantage as the champion leveled at 5 points each. But a clever drop volley on the next point set up Azarenka for match point and she was soon celebrating victory after nearly two and a half hours of quality tennis as Stosur hit a return wide. Third seed Sharapova will need to show the resilience she displayed in her previous match against Nadia Petrova if she is to progress to the semifinals in New York since she won the title in 2006. The French Open champion dropped her serve twice against Bartoli to trail 4-0 when play was halted. However, she has won 23 of 24 matches that have gone to three sets since the start of 2011, including 11 this year. Bartoli, who beat former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in the previous round, has never got this far in the tournament in 10 previous attempts, with her best showing having been reaching the fourth round in 2007 and 2008. Wednesday's remaining last-eight clashes will see Wimbledon and Olympic champion Williams take on fellow former world No.1 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and an all-Italian clash between Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci. French Open singles finalist Errani will become the world's top-ranked doubles player on Monday, while her partner Vinci will be the new No. 2 after they reached the semifinals with victory against Germany's Julia Gorges and Czech Kveta Peschke. They will replace former joint No. 1s Lizel Huber and Lisa Raymond of the U.S. -- whose title defense ended in round three. Errani and Vinci are battling for the honor of being the first player from their country to reach a singles semifinal at a grand slam other than the French Open.","Victoria Azarenka battles past defending U.S. Open champion in New York .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray is focused on winning his first grand slam title, but the Olympic tennis champion is facing new distractions following his success at London 2012. ""Yeah, it's been a bit weird, with people hanging out in front of my hotel room, taking pictures,"" the world No. 4 said after becoming the first player to reach the third round of the men's draw at the 2012 U.S. Open. ""Some ask strange questions: What did I think of Prince Harry's hotel photos? What do I think about the Crown Jewels?"" ""I said, no comment. It's a little different than what I'm used to, but it's fun."" Murray, seeded third in the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal, defeated Croatia's Ivan Dodig on Wednesday for his second successive straight-sets victory in New York this week. Clijsters' singles career ends after shock U.S. Open defeat . The Scot will next face either 30th seed Feliciano Lopez or his fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar. ""It was better than the first round, that's for sure. I moved better than I did in the first match and served better, and I was able to dictate more of the points because of that. I was much happier with the way I played,"" said Murray who lost in the 2008 final at Flushing Meadows. Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer won his opening match in three sets, beating big-serving world No. 34 Kevin Anderson of South Africa. Ferrer, who reached the semifinals in 2007, faces into a second round meeting with 78th-ranked Dutch debutant Igor Sijsling. ""It was not an easy match with Anderson,"" Ferrer said. ""He's a really good player. He has very strong first and second serve. I'm happy, because I played well in my first round."" American ninth seed John Isner won a tough first-round encounter with experienced Belgian Xavier Malisse, winning 6-3 7-6 5-7 7-6 in just under three hours as the fourth-set tie-break went to 13-11. ""I wish I could make it easier on myself but I tend to not do that, as a lot of people know,"" said Isner, a quarterfinalist last year. He will next face another seasoned campaigner in Finland's Jarkko Nieminen, who also reached the last eight back in 2005. Seventh seed Juan Martin del Potro booked a second-round clash with young American Ryan Harrison after defeating France's Florent Serra. The Argentine, U.S. Open champion in 2009, battled to a 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 victory in two and a half hours against his 116th-ranked opponent, who has never got past the second round in New York . The 20-year-old Harrison, who lost his first-round match last year, matched his 2010 debut achievement by beating Germany's Benjamin Becker in straight sets. Serbian eighth seed Janko Tipsarevic became the seventh man at this year's tournament to win after dropping the first two sets, having faced a shock defeat at the hands of world No. 129 Guillaume Rufin. Tipsarevic, whose quarterfinal achievement last year was his best result at a grand slam, finally triumphed in three hours 37 minutes against the 22-year-old Frenchman. He will next face American Brian Baker, who continued his fairytale comeback by winning his first match at the tournament since his last appearance seven years ago. The former second-ranked junior player had multiple surgeries which wrecked his career, and had been coaching tennis at Belmont University when he decided to return to the professional tour this year. Baker, who made it to the second round at the French Open and the last 16 at Wimbledon, beat Czech Jan Hajek in straight sets in the opening match of his home slam. ""I had some nerves. I don't think it was probably the prettiest match ever. A win is a win,"" said the 27-year-old, now ranked 70th despite still studying for a business degree and continuing his coaching role at Belmont. ""I think just getting out and not having played the U.S. Open in seven years and having expectations and having a lot of friends and family just gives you ... I mean, it's good nerves. ""I think it helps you focus a little bit more and want it a little bit more, but it was exciting time to be back after so much time off."" Veteran German 21st seed Tommy Haas, a three-time quarterfinalist, lost to Latvia's Ernest Gulbis, while Russian No. 28 Mikhail Youzhny also blew a two-set lead as he was beaten by Luxembourg's Gilles Muller. Muller, who reached the last 16 in 2011, earned a clash with Australia's former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, who is expected to retire after the tournament. Hewitt, the 2001 champion and a three-time semifinalist, beat young German Tobias Kamke 4-6 6-2 6-1 6-4.","Andy Murray becomes first man through to third round at the U.S. Open .

"(CNN)  -- A pair of giant trimarans are battling for line honors in the Rolex Fastnet Race, one of yachting's classic offshore races. Loick Peyron's Maxi Banque Populaire was leading fellow French entry, the Seb Josse-skippered Gitana 11, by eight nautical miles as they rounded Fastnet Rock off south-west Ireland and headed for the finish in Plymouth in south-west England. Maxi Banque Populaire is considered the world's fastest offshore boat with massive 140-foot long hulls, much bigger than the 77-feet of Gitana 11, so the relatively small gap between the two was a surprise. At Fastnet rock, which was reached early on Monday morning, there is approximately 250 miles to the finish. The two leaders were being tracked by trimarans Veolia Environnement of France and Switzerland's Race for Water, which has round the world yachtswoman Dee Caffari as a key crew member. A record fleet of 314 starters set sail from Cowes on the Isle of Wight Sunday, battling it out for overall and handicap honors in their various classes. Rolex Fastnet Race official website . Peyron and his team reached The Needles within an hour, sailing at speeds of over 20 knots. It is the largest fleet since the 303 in the ill-fated 1979 race when the competitors were caught up in a vicious storm and 15 died. Restrictions on the size of the fleet were introduced in the wake of that tragedy. The Fastnet Race is the Royal Ocean Racing Club's flagship event and held every two years. The 608-mile course goes along the south coast of England, across the Celtic Sea to the Fastnet Rock before returning around the Scilly Isles to the finish in Plymouth. The race record of 44 hours 18 minutes is held by Mike Slade's Icap Leopard 3, set in 2007.","Leading trimarans round Fastnet Rock in yachting's classic Fastnet Race .

"(CNN) -- Once labeled the richest football club in Britain, Scottish champions Glasgow Rangers are now on the brink of extinction. The club that boasts a record 54 league titles and 60 domestic cups since being formed in 1872 has sunk to the lowest ebb of its illustrious 140-year history. Already in administration and with a potential tax bill of $118 million, the genuine prospect exists that Rangers -- one half of the Old Firm rivalry with Glasgow neighbors Celtic -- could be about to fold, inflicting irreversible damage on the Scottish Premier League. So if a football club with as proud a history as Rangers can come so close to the precipice, how likely is it that the disease of financial mismanagement will claim other high-profile scalps across Europe? Football's rising costs . According to football finance expert Simon Chadwick, many clubs on the continent are similarly stretched as they grapple with soaring wages and transfer fees -- and a failure to make the most from their assets. Chadwick, a professor of Sport Business Strategy at the UK's University of Coventry, says the next five years could be critical in shaping the long-term future of football in Europe, as cash-rich clubs in Russia, China and the Middle East compete for the globe's best players. ""There are two common elements to what is happening in Europe,"" he told CNN. ""The first one is revenue generation. A lot of clubs simply don't have a notion of the ways in which they could alternatively generate revenue other than tickets sales. ""The other element is cost control, and obviously that relates to player transfer fees and wage costs. If there was moderation in the industry generally, if salary costs and transfer fees could be moderated in some way, that would ease clubs' financial problems. ""Increasingly you've got clubs in China, in Russia and in some parts of the Middle East that are paying huge transfer fees and huge wages. In many ways it's very difficult for clubs to control their costs because many of the mechanisms are outside their control."" Driven by debt . Chadwick's assessment of the general health of Europe's clubs is bleak, with teams in Italy, Spain, Belgium, Holland, Portugal and even Germany -- the one league held up as a beacon of financial integrity -- struggling. Even two of the biggest clubs on the continent, Spanish duo Barcelona and Real Madrid, who drive huge wealth and success, are operating on a huge debt base. ""Whilst Barca and Real are massive revenue-generating entities, their costs are very high,"" Chadwick said. ""The most obvious elements are transfer fees and salaries. As a consequence of that, if you look at the two of the biggest three club debtors in the world they are Barcelona and Real Madrid. ""Outside Barcelona and Real there is no conception of the need to manage their organizations better, to manage their businesses better or commercialize in any way. In terms of revenue generation and cost control, a lot of Spanish clubs are operating in the dark ages."" The German Bundesliga is renowned as being a model competition, where the football fan is king. Supporters retain a majority stake in their club, tickets prices are affordable, wealth is distributed far more equally than in other leagues and wages are kept under control. Chasing Champions League cash . But Chadwick points to the example of Schalke, a club that finished in the top three in Germany four times in the past seven years but is now grappling with the debts incurred through building a new stadium. The Royal Blues are desperately hoping that qualification this year for Europe's top club competition, the Champions League, will prove a timely boon to their bank balance. ""Schalke is in a very precarious financial position but many people say German football is a role model for financial propriety and good management -- it's not. There are problems all over Europe,"" Chadwick said. He sees Dutch outfit Feyenoord, regarded as one of the Netherlands' big three sides alongside PSV Eindhoven and Ajax, as a club facing a typical, modern-day predicament. ""Feyenoord are in a much more precarious position than PSV and Ajax for the simple reason that they are not qualifying for Europe and yet they are still very ambitious,"" Chadwick said. ""The big challenge for Feyenoord is to go for Champions League football and get it really soon, otherwise their business model is not sustainable. Then they will have to develop a business model that is consistent with being a solvent member of the Eredivisie, but basically mid-table plodders."" A global power shift? With European football at a crossroads, UEFA's new Financial Fair Play (FFP) initiative could prove a masterstroke of timing. The rules, which aim to force clubs to live within their means, are introduced next year. ""FFP could be the moderating force in the labor market but one of the big issues is that the football labor market is no longer dominated by the Europeans, it is now a global labor market,"" Chadwick said. ""When you've got the likes of (former Chelsea striker) Nicolas Anelka on a reported $268,000 a week in China and Samuel Eto'o on reported $553,000 a week in Russia, this is fueling the inflationary spiral. ""As we see in any market, resources flow to where the returns are greatest. I think we're potentially on the cusp of a real shift in global power in football simply because clubs elsewhere in the world can afford to pay for the likes of Anelka and Eto'o."" Scottish giants in jeopardy . Should European clubs need any reminder as to what despair can emerge from chasing success on the field, they need only look at Rangers. The Glasgow team's slide into administration relates to an unpaid tax bill of $14 million, incurred after businessman Craig Whyte bought the club in June 2010, but they are also being pursued by the UK government, which says an astonishing $118 million is owed in back taxes. A tribunal is due to rule on the case this month, and if Rangers lose, they could be wiped off the map forever. ""If Rangers were to go into liquidation it would be absolutely unbelievable,"" Scottish football expert Graham Spiers told CNN. ""I've been writing about this story for the last 18 months and I still cannot believe it. ""The club would probably be reborn in some kind of way, but just facing the fact that for a period in history Rangers might cease to exist does seem unbelievable."" A two-team league? Much of the interest aroused by the Scottish Premier League is based on the intense rivalry between Rangers and Glasgow neighbors Celtic, a divide along sectarian lines that is famous around the globe. But officials at Celtic, a club proud of its Catholic and Irish heritage, insist they feel no sympathy with their Protestant bedfellows, and can continue to thrive even if the blue half of Glasgow goes under. Whether the league could is another matter, given that no club other than Rangers or Celtic has won the title since Aberdeen's triumph in 1984. ""The thing Scottish football does have is this brand called the Old Firm and whether you call it car crash television or not, everybody is attracted to it,"" Spiers said. ""Celtic fans are stupidly dancing on the grave of Rangers, because Celtic need Rangers. Celtic are greatly diminished if their great rivals disappear. If one of the Old Firm was taken out and shot at dawn it would greatly diminish the other half."" At one stage this season, Rangers led the league by 12 points. But a run of poor form, combined with the 10-point deduction incurred for falling into administration, means Celtic are now 21 points clear and certainties for the title. Ironically, the Hoops could wrap up their 43rd league title at Ibrox in the Old Firm clash on March 25.","Rangers' financial plight casts doubt on stability of clubs elsewhere in Europe .

"(Financial Times) -- A stand-off between two titans of finance, the Bank of Italy and the Vatican, has forced tourists to abandon their visits to the Sistine Chapel -- unless they have cash in their pockets. Italy's central bank has blocked all electronic payments through cash machines and by credit cards in Vatican City following the world's smallest state's failure to fully comply with international anti-money laundering rules. The incident raises further questions about the transparency of the Vatican's finances. Its efforts to adopt international standards in combating money laundering and terrorist financing were given a mixed assessment last July in a study of its financial system. Deutsche Bank's Italian division, which runs a network of cash machines for the Vatican, was refused authorisation from the central bank to continue operating its services within the walled state from the start of the year. The Vatican is not included in the European Commission's ""white list"" of states that fully comply with international standards against tax fraud and money laundering. In a tightly worded statement, Father Federico Lombardi, head of press relations at the Holy See, said the use of the cash machines inside Vatican City was ""at the point of expiry"". ""Discussions are under way with other providers and we foresee that the interruption to credit card services will be short."" A person familiar with the matter said a new provider could be announced on Monday. A report by Moneyval -- Council of Europe experts who examine measures to counter money laundering -- last year passed the Vatican in nine out of 16 core recommendations. It said the city state had to address important issues to demonstrate that a fully effective banking regime existed in practice, signally that it could be a lengthy process before the city state met the standards necessary to be accepted into the white list of countries. A message on the Vatican Museums website apologises to visitors for any inconvenience, blaming ""reasons beyond the control of the directorate of museums"".

"(CNN) -- McLaren boss Martin Whitmarsh has called on Formula One's notoriously argumentative teams to unite and guarantee the future of the sport. F1's commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone told CNN that the teams had agreed a deal until 2020 to replace the existing Concorde Agreement, which expires at the end of this year, but it has yet to be formally put in place. ""My fear is that at the moment the deal hasn't been done and therefore it adds some volatility to the situation,"" Whitmarsh said on the official F1 website. ""At times Formula One has lost opportunities because of inner frictions. We create dramas out here between us rather than saying, 'Hey, this is a fantastic sport, a world sport, and we should all work together and point in the same direction.' "" Whitmarsh revealed that most of the teams had signed individual contracts, but he warned that a new Concorde deal was needed to tie in motorsport's ruling body the FIA and dispel rumors of a breakaway competition. Ecclestone: I'll run F1 until I die . ""We must to come to the point of saying Formula One is big and important to all of us, so in large areas we should be aligned, and if we just can put aside our individual differences and focus on what we all want -- for example to be successful in America -- then that reflects on all of us,"" he said. ""I hope that there will be a Concorde Agreement that ties it all together because at the moment there are individual contracts. If we were not happy with our contract we wouldn't have signed it, but the danger is that if we all have individual contracts that is probably not aligning us and bringing us together. ""The Concorde is a tripartite agreement -- teams, commercial rights holder and FIA. It has never been perfect, but it's a model that before we abandon it we should be very cautious. Why reinvent something if it functions? Let's use it."" McLaren, Ferrari and Red Bull are expected to be represented on F1's new extended board but Whitmarsh said the English team would not take part until all have signed up. ""I don't think that it is a secret anymore that nine teams have signed the contract -- and I really hope that the silver team next door (UK-based Mercedes) will sign very shortly and it will be then that we will take up our board position,"" he said. ""We'd like to see that all the teams have signed before we join the board. I think it has to be clear that anyone joining this board isn't there to represent their team interests but try to contribute to Formula One and take a broader view. ""It is a phenomenally interesting opportunity. We have to come together more effectively -- then we can make it an even better sport in the future."" Mayor of London open to capital grand prix . Whitmarsh is head of the Formula One Teams Association, which was involved in a bitter row with Ecclestone and the FIA over the future of F1 before finally signing the last Concorde Agreement in 2009. Ferrari, Red Bull and Sauber pulled out in December 2011, raising the prospect of fresh division among the teams. McLaren and Ferrari are the two most successful teams in F1 history, but Whitmarsh said he was confident they could overcome their differences for the good of the sport. ""I have a very good relationship with Ferrari. We've known them for 30 years now and have been fighting them on the track, in the pit lane, in the paddock, in FIA meetings, in court -- everywhere,"" he said. ""I respect that Ferrari is the biggest brand in Formula One. And for McLaren to say that is not something that comes easy. But it's a fact. ""And the second largest brand in Formula One is McLaren. Maybe in 50 years we will be bigger than Ferrari, but at the moment I respect what they represent. Of course we want to beat each other -- that will never change -- but consent should be possible."" Alonso extends lead with victory from pole in Germany . Ferrari, without a world title since 2008, has been dominant this year as Fernando Alonso has overcome the Italian marque's early-season performance problems to lead the championship with three victories from 10 races. McLaren made a strong start as Jenson Button won the opening grand prix, but then had to wait until the seventh in Canada for the next success when Lewis Hamilton came home first. The two former world champions are well off the overall pace. Hamilton trails by 62 points in fifth while last season's runnerup Button is 86 points adrift in seventh ahead of this weekend's Hungarian Grand Prix, after which there will be a month-long break.. McLaren's lack of race pace has led to speculation that Hamilton will not sign a new contract, but Whitmarsh is confident the English driver will continue his career-long association with the team. ""Based on what I've been told and what I've observed, Lewis wants to stay with this team and McLaren very much wants Lewis to stay,"" he said. ""Maybe we are over-comfortable with each other, but we haven't had the urgency to resolve that contract issue, so we all said, 'Okay, let's sort it out in the break.' And we are only one week away from the break. I suspect that we can resolve it during that period and come back with clarity for the rest of the season."" Latest F1 standings . McLaren's hopes of a first constructors' crown since 1998 seem slim, trailing Red Bull by 70 points and second-placed Ferrari by 17 at the halfway point . ""There is a tough development battle going on. Right now you have to say that Ferrari is the most improved team,"" Whitmarsh said. ""I think it is also fair to say that sometimes we have severe problems with the tires. I would not say that there is anything wrong with the tires, it's just that we are right at the knife-edge and sometimes it falls the wrong way. ""There is no doubt that tires have an enormous effect this year -- probably too much in my view -- but, on the other hand, for the fans it has been an incredibly intriguing season so far."" Whitmarsh believes the unpredictability of results -- there were an unprecedented seven winners from the first seven races -- has made the sport more appealing as it looks to enter new markets. ""We have to connect to younger people, who have got lots of entertainment options apart from sitting in front of the television,"" he said. ""Formula One is a world sport, of which there are only two -- soccer and Formula One -- so it is fantastic to see what's been achieved over the last 30 years. And we should be aiming to do it again in the next 30 years. ""I hope we can capture the imagination in North America. They are such a huge market, they love cars, and we are the premier motor racing in the world. So when we can provide them with entertainment -- and we have a product that is massively exciting -- then I'm sure we can make it.""","McLaren principal Martin Whitmarsh hopes teams will sign new Concorde deal .

"(CNN) -- Tennis pro Andy Roddick will retire after the U.S. Open tournament, a spokesman for the International Tennis Federation said Thursday. Roddick, who turned 30 years old on Thursday, is the last American man to win the New York grand slam, in 2003. ""I just feel like it's time,"" the former world No. 1 told reporters after making his announcement. ""I don't know that I'm healthy enough or committed enough to go another year. I've always wanted to, in a perfect world, finish at this event -- I have a lot of family and friends here,"" Roddick said, according to a recording of his news conference posted on the U.S. Open's website. ""I've thought all year that I would know when I got to this tournament. When I was playing my first round, I knew."" Roddick, now ranked 22nd, won his opening match at Flushing Meadows and was to play Australia's Bernard Tomic in the second round on Friday. The hard-court event, the last of the tennis season's four majors, conclude September 9. ""Andy has been an outstanding ambassador for our sport and our country, always carrying himself with the character and class that define a champion,"" said U.S. Tennis Association board chairman Jon Vegosen. ""In addition to representing the U.S. on the world stage, he was a Davis Cup stalwart and standout."" Roddick exits early at French Open . The 2003 U.S. Open victory was his only grand slam win, while he lost in the final in 2006. Roddick was also a three-time runner-up on the grass courts of Wimbledon, but his main attacking weapons have been less potent in recent years due to a series of injuries and changes in tennis that have taken the emphasis off power serving. In 2003, Roddick was the youngest American and the second youngest overall to finish No. 1 in the history of the ATP rankings since 1973. In 2004, he won four titles and led the U.S. to the first Davis Cup final since 1997 by going 6-2 in singles, and he recorded the world's fastest serve at 155 mph in the Davis Cup on September 24, the ATP said. Last year he captured his 30th career title on the ATP World Tour in Memphis to increase his title streak to 11 consecutive years, the ATP said. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Roddick explained his decision. ""I've always, for whatever my faults have been, felt like I've never done anything halfway,"" he said. ""It's probably the first time in my career that I can sit here and say I'm not sure that I can put everything into it physically and emotionally.

"(CNN) -- As Manchester City's delirious fans spilled onto the pitch to revel in their team's remarkable English title win on Sunday, the celebrations also kicked off thousands of miles away in Abu Dhabi. In one cafe in the United Arab Emirates capital, some fans stood and danced, one even leaped onto a table, while others simply smiled contentedly as they puffed on their shisha pipes. City's dramatic 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers was beamed to an estimated global audience of 4.7 billion in a powerful advert for just why Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan splashed out $320 million to buy the English Premier League club in 2008. The title was won at the Etihad Stadium. The players wore shirts emblazoned with the Etihad Airways logo -- the Abu Dhabi-based airline. The title-clinching goal was scored by record $62 million signing Sergio Aguero in the dying seconds of the game. It was, in short, the brightest indicator yet of the Middle East's growing influence within European football. ""For a lot of the people here, they say that they didn't even follow the Premier League until Manchester City was bought by the Abu Dhabi group,"" reported CNN's Leone Lakhani in Abu Dhabi, ""so you can imagine they've been extremely happy with the results the entire year. ""It elevates the country's emergence as a major sporting power."" Owner Sheikh Mansour, a member of the country's ruling family, wasn't at the stadium on Sunday -- he has been to only one match at the Etihad -- and hasn't yet commented on the club's first title win in 44 years. But it was Sheikh Mansour who invested more than $600 million on players like Aguero, Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez, and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors Manchester United to the title on goal difference. The incredible images on Sunday delivered the message on his behalf. Etihad Airways, which carried a message of congratulations to City on its website on Monday, reportedly paid more than $600 million for stadium naming rights and shirt sponsorship over 10 years, but the benefits are huge. ""When you win national and international titles, the exposure to a very, very relevant target audience for us couldn't be better,"" Peter Baumgartner, chief commercial officer of the airline, told CNN. While so many European countries are in financial difficulties, it isn't just Abu Dhabi taking advantage of football's global appeal. Dubai airline Emirates has a high-profile stadium and shirt sponsorship deal with Arsenal, and the Dubai-based Royal Emirates Group took over La Liga club Getafe last year. Getafe managed an 11th-place finish in Spain, seven places behind the league's other Middle Eastern-owned club, Malaga. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nassar Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, bought out Malaga in 2010 when the modest club had never finished higher than seventh in the top flight. Veteran Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy helped the club to a fourth-place finish this season and a place in the Champions League qualifiers. Emboldened by the country's shock winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has since worked on spreading its influence across Europe. Qatar Sports Investment (QSI) reportedly paid $220 million over five years to put the Qatar Foundation name on Barcelona's shirt , but it is in France where the tiny natural gas-rich nation is really making its presence felt. QSI took over Paris Saint-Germain last summer, hoping not just to awake a sleeping giant of the French game but to create a new European powerhouse. ""This is our strategy to bring PSG on long term to be one of the biggest in the world,"" club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told CNN in March. To that end, PSG brought Brazilian Leonardo on board as sporting director, paid a French record $56 million to sign Javier Pastore and hired Carlo Ancelotti as coach. PSG might miss out on the league title -- trailing Montpellier by three points with one game remaining -- but the potentially exciting end to the season at least justifies al-Jazeera's investment in the Ligue Un domestic television rights at a reported â‚¬510 million a year until 2016. Al-Jazeera also has the international rights to the league, as well as most of the UEFA Champions League rights in France from 2012, and there are even suggestions that the broadcaster could make a bid for the UK rights for the English Premier League. It is all designed to establish Qatar as a global sporting power, which the country hopes will be confirmed in 2022 when it hosts the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world. The growing appeal of Qatar's domestic league has also been highlighted in recent times, with former Spain and Real Madrid striker Raul swapping German Bundesliga side Schalke for Al-Sadd in the Qatar Stars League. For now, though, it is Abu Dhabi in the spotlight as it joins the blue half of the city of Manchester in joyous celebration.","Manchester City's title win celebrated in Abu Dhabi, home of the club's owners .

Third seed Sharapova was taken to three sets by the 2007 Wimbledon finalist, who had raced to a 4-0 lead in the first set when their quarterfinal match was halted by rain on Tuesday. Bartoli duly closed out the opener, but Sharapova fought back to claim the match 3-6 6-3 6-4 after two and a half hours. She has now won 12 successive times in matches that have gone to three sets since her third-round defeat in New York last year, and 24 out of 25 since the start of 2011. ""I think the rain delay gave me some time to think about things,"" the French Open champion said. ""I came out so flat yesterday, and she was playing so well. I just played a bad four games, but I knew the match wasn't over and had a chance to come back and turn things around."" Sharapova will be seeking revenge for her thrashing by Azarenka in the final of the opening grand slam of the season in Australia, but has lost four successive matches in straight sets to the Belorussian on hard courts. ""Tough challenge,"" she admitted. ""She beat me in Australia quite easily and I would love to get my revenge at a grand slam."" The Russian reached the last four at Flushing Meadows for the first time since 2006, when she claimed the second of her four grand slam successes. In June she beat Sara Errani in the final at Roland Garros to complete a full set of the majors, and she could potentially face the Italian again in a title match in New York. However, the 10th seed must get past the imposing figure of Serena Williams, who needed less than an hour to dispose of fellow former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic in the closing quarterfinal. The American, seeking her fourth U.S. Open title but first since 2008, demolished the Serbian 6-1 6-3. ""I felt much better moving,"" said the Wimbledon and Olympic champion after winning 26 of her 29 first-serve points and firing 12 aces. ""I was excited I'm moving faster. Feels good. I felt solid. ""I feel like I'm going to get more focused and serious and start playing 'Serena tennis' in the next couple of rounds, if I get to play two rounds. That's my goal."" Errani has lost all three meetings with the 14-time grand slam champion, with two of those on hard courts in 2009. She became the first Italian to reach a grand slam semifinal outside of the French Open after beating compatriot, best friend and doubles partner Roberta Vinci 6-2 6-4. ""A quarterfinal with your best friend is difficult,"" Errani said. ""There was a lot of tension. We know each other very well and have played together many times. ""Normally when we walk out on the court we go together and we speak -- today was a bit strange, especially to see her on the other side of the net."" They have reached the semifinals of the doubles event in New York, and next week Errani will be ranked as the format's top player for the first time, with Vinci No. 2. ""It's the best year of my life. I'm playing very well and my ranking is very high,"" said the 25-year-old, who has won four singles titles in 2012. ""I just go on the court, fight the best I can and that's it -- and by winning more matches I get more confidence, and with that you go on the court thinking you can win more than before."" Meanwhile, 12th seed Ivanovic was able to take positives from her defeat, having reached the last eight of a grand slam for the first time since her breakthrough victory at the 2008 French Open. ""Overall I'm very satisfied,"" said the Serbian, who had never before featured in the New York quarterfinals and who at one stage dropped out of the top 50. ""I played some really good tennis to get into this position, and even tonight I felt I was striking the ball so nicely on both sides. That's something I've worked hard for. It's a big step for me.""","Maria Sharapova battles past Marion Bartoli in U.S. Open quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- While much attention focused on whether Andy Roddick could delay his retirement by beating fellow former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro, one of tennis' quiet achievers slipped into the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday. David Ferrer has spent much of his career in the shadow of Rafael Nadal, but the 30-year-old joined his absent compatriot in becoming only the second Spaniard to reach the last eight of all four grand slams in a calendar year since the start of the professional era in 1968. ""I'm very happy for that,"" the world No. 5 said after overcoming multiple rain delays to beat French 13th seed Richard Gasquet 7-5 7-6 (7-2) 6-4. ""This season is the best of all my career. I'm playing consistent all the year."" Ferrer reached the semifinals in New York in 2007, but had not gone past round four again until now. However, he made it to the semifinals at Roland Garros in June and also the last eight at January's Australian Open and Wimbledon in July. He will next face either eighth seed Janko Tipsarevic or Germany's No. 19 Phillip Kohlschreiber, who trailed the Serbian 5-2 in the opening set before rain halted their fourth-round match. Former world No. 1 Roddick, who will quit after the tournament, was locked at 6-6 with 2009 U.S. Open winner Del Potro, having won the first point of the tiebreak when they went off the court. The winner of that fourth-round match will face either defending champion Novak Djokovic or Swiss 18th seed Stanislas Wawrinka. That clash was even less advanced when the weather intervened, with Serbian second seed Djokovic leading 2-0 in the opening set as he bids to match Ferrer, Andy Murray and Roger Federer in having reached at least the quarterfinals of all this season's slams. Olympic champion Murray will take to Arthur Ashe Court against Croatian 12th seed Marin Cilic in their last-eight clash when the Roddick-Del Potro match is over. World No. 1 Federer will play Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych in Wednesday's evening session, needing just three more wins to clinch a record sixth title in the Open era. However, the Swiss will potentially face a semifinal rematch with Murray, who he beat in the 2008 final. They shared the honors in the two tournaments at Wimbledon this year. Ferrer, meanwhile, is hoping that his moments of fortune so far will translate into a first grand slam title. ""I think I have luck in important moments because I was set-points down in the second set (against Gasquet),"" he said. ""The first round with (Kevin) Anderson I was also three set-points down. With (Igor) Sijsling in the second round also the same. So I think in important moments I played good, but of course I had luck.""","David Ferrer has now reached quarterfinals of all four tennis grand slams in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Spanish golfer Sergio Garcia captured his first U.S. PGA Tour title in four years on Monday, earning himself a place in Europe's team for next month's Ryder Cup. He overcame a rain delay which put a halt to Sunday's play to win the Wyndham Championship, beating South African Tim Clark by two strokes in Greensboro, North Carolina. A victory was essential to push the 32-year-old into the top-10 ranked European players who automatically qualify for the team to face the United States. He now stands in sixth place and cannot be pushed out of those spots. Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, Graeme McDowell, Paul Lawrie, Francesco Molinari, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Peter Hanson were already in the team to travel to Medinah at the end of September. European team captain Jose Maria Olazabal also has two wildcard picks for the tournament, with Ian Poulter expected to take one of those places. ""We'll see when the team comes out, but I think my chances are a little better now,"" Garcia said. Garcia was one of 38 players who had to return to the course to complete their final round on Monday. He had a less than solid restart when a bogey dropped him into a tie with Clark, who was cheered on by a partisan local crowd who supported him because he once attended the local university. But Garcia came back in style. He birdied four holes out of five to put some space between him and the field. At the 13th hole it looked like he was on course for the victory. A chip to within a foot of the hole left him an easy put for another birdie. An impressive bunker shot got him out of trouble and kept him on track for the win at the 15th. Not even a bogey on the 18th could spoil the celebrations, even though it meant he had slipped a shot to card a final-round 66 for an 18-under-par total of 262. Clark finished one shot clear of Bud Cauley in third, while there was a three-way tie for fourth between Americans Chad Campbell and Jimmy Walker and Sweden's Carl Petterson on 14 under. Garcia's victory was his first on U.S. soil since he won the 2008 Players Championship, and eighth overall. It also helped bury some ghosts of his previous visit to the Wyndham Championship in 2009, when he held a share of the third-round lead but eventually finished fourth. It doubled his prize money this season on the PGA Tour to $1.8 million from 13 starts, and lifted him up 69 places to 33rd in the FedEx Cup standings ahead of this week's opening playoff event, The Barclays. Clark also continued his climb, up to 54th from 109. The top 30 players qualify for the Tour Championship finale. Jason Dufner finished the regular season second behind Tiger Woods after his seventh-placing at Greensboro, with PGA Championship winner Rory McIlroy third. Garcia used a local caddy after parting with his usual bagman after this month's PGA Championship, where he missed the cut. ""Caddies are great, but sometimes I feel like I depend too much on them,"" Garcia said. ""Instead of making a decision myself, I would wait for the caddy to make a decision for me and then maybe I don't feel comfortable with that and still try to do it. ""I wanted to start making decisions for myself, right and wrong. Not all my decisions were good this week. But at least I was pretty much 100% committed to most of my decisions, and that was nice to see.""","Spanish golfer is guaranteed a place in the European team to play at Medinah, Illinois .

"(CNN) -- Italy's soccer players can heal the ""suffering"" caused by the country's match-fixing scandal by winning Euro 2012, says AC Milan star Alexandre Pato. The Brazilian forward, who has played in Serie A since he was 17, says an Azzurri victory in Poland and Ukraine could rejuvenate Italian football following a year blighted by corruption allegations. The team's Euro 2012 preparations were disrupted by a police raid on their training base four days before the start of the tournament, as several prominent football figures were arrested in connection with a match-fixing and betting investigation. The scandal prompted manager Cesare Prandelli to admit his team could pull out of the competition, but instead they have thrived and will face Germany in the semifinals on Thursday. ""What happened with the match fixing and the betting, it was really bad. Italian football has suffered a lot and we as players have suffered a lot,"" said Pato, who moved to Milan from Brazilian club Internacional for $32 million in 2007. ""But who knows... Italy in Euro 2012 can turn it around so that Italian football can change and come back to world-class standards."" The ""suffering"" described by Pato struck at the very core of Prandelli's team, which beat England in a penalty shootout on Sunday to reach the last four. Football culture: Who are you? Warrior or tika taka technician? Full-back Domenico Criscito pulled out of Italy's squad on May 29 after being questioned by officials probing gambling markets linked to fixing results of matches in Serie A. Nineteen others were arrested, 11 of them players in Italy's top division, in the ongoing investigation by magistrates in the city of Cremona. The arrests were the latest in a long-running saga that has severely damaged Italian football. Seventeen people were arrested in a similar swoop last year, including former Lazio star Giuseppe Signori and ex-Italy striker Cristiano Doni, who was subsequently banned from the game for three and a half years. The allegations initially centered on the lower Italian football leagues but the latest police sweep indicates that suspicion has also fallen on the most high-profile teams. Italy reach semifinals after penalty kicks drama . Meanwhile, Pato believes that on the pitch Italy's current squad can compete with Europe's best sides -- and possibly cause an upset against the highly fancied Germans. ""Most people didn't expect Italy to get this far,"" said the 22-year-old, who will be representing Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics. ""Germany and Spain are really strong. Portugal has surprised me; they have Cristiano (Ronaldo) who is playing really well. But I'm going to root for Italy to get to the final, and I hope they can win it."" It wouldn't be the first time the Italy team had triumphed in the face of adversity. The Azzurri won the 2006 World Cup in the wake of the Calciopoli match fixing scandal, which saw Turin giants Juventus relegated to the second tier and stripped of two league titles. The repercussions of the latest corruption investigation are uncertain, but a repeat performance from the national side would go a long way to lifting the shadow hanging over one of Europe's great football nations.","AC Milan star Alexandre Pato says Euro 2012 can save Italy's tainted reputation in football .

"BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (CNN)  -- Three hours before the game, the car park outside the rugby stadium in Bloemfontein, seems to be filled with more ""braais"" (barbecues) than cars. Black players such as Bryan Habana typify the new multiracial Springboks. It is a typical, even iconic, white South African scene. At first glance, off the field, it might appear that nothing has changed in South African rugby -- the sport that came to symbolize white domination -- since the days of Apartheid. Most of the spectators are white, Afrikaans and guzzling brandy and coke. On their ""braais,"" they are cooking the local favorite ""boerewors"" -- a distinctive local farmer's sausage. But appearances can be deceiving. On the field, history is being made. South African rugby has changed. And the game's most ardent fans -- in the heart of Afrikaner country -- don't seem to mind. Facing Wales, South Africa's rugby team -- the reigning world champions -- took to the field with a new black coach, Peter de Villiers, and seven black players out of a team of 15 --- the most black players ever. Fourteen years after democracy, it seems South Africa's messy post-Apartheid race relations are slowly being worked out on the sports field. ""This is a new era. It changes the face of rugby. Historically and politically it's always seen as a white preserve. But the appointment of Peter de Villiers is a huge change in terms of mind set,"" South African rugby president Oregan Hoskins told CNN. Is South African sport doing enough to tackle the legacy of Apartheid? Have your say . The man at the heart of this rugby revolution is easy to miss. Amid the thick necks and even thicker thighs of a Springbok training session, de Villiers is the short, slight man who seems to have perfected the art of disappearing into the crowd. In fact, the largest thing about him is his bushy moustache. It took us months to pin him down for an interview and he already has a reputation for dodging the media. I couldn't figure out if he was nervous or just deeply suspicious of the press. But when I met him, I realized he doesn't really care what people read or write about him. He's deeply religious. The whole interview is peppered with references to God or the Bible and he makes a point of saying that his life is certainly not going to be defined by him being the Springbok coach. That said, he admits that ""since my childhood I've wanted to be a Springbok. To be a part of the set-up. But politics didn't allow us."" He says he was a good player -- but as a colored man he was barred from the white rugby set-up. In fact, during Apartheid, black and whites were not allowed to play sport together or against each other. The races were separated in all spheres of life. Fourteen years since those days, has the sport managed to transform itself from white domination to a multi-racial institution? Yes, say the fans. White, Afrikaans and by now tanked up with brandy and coke, we could not find one person who resented the new black Springboks. One group of burly men who were braai-ing Springbok meat on kebabs, told us: ""It is our team, we have to support them -- Don't think it bothers anyone as long as we can see them win."" And that's probably the point. South Africans are a competitive hard-nosed bunch; they hate to see their side lose. So as long as the world champions are winning, the supporters will love them -- white or black. To complicate matters further, three of the Springbok's black players are Zimbabweans. Not South Africans. But nobody seems to mind the ""foreigners"" either.","In South Africa, rugby union was once symbolic of white domination .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- It's 6.30 a.m. on a rainy morning in New Delhi. Modern School is closed for the summer, but its sports fields are bursting with energy. Around 30 boys, between the ages of seven and 17 are running around, some swinging bats in the air, others practicing their bowling. They come here five days a week to attend a cricket coaching camp. ""Cricket takes commitment,"" says the star student here, 17-year-old Arjun Gupta. The row between India's Harbhajan Singh (left) and Australia's Andrew Symonds has turned the spotlight on ""sledging"" in cricket. Gupta is passionate about the game. He's already representing the state of Delhi in the under-17 category. He dreams of playing for his country one day. His coaches, Uday Gupte and Navin Chopra say he has the talent to do that. He also has the right attitude. ""Cricket is played by a gentleman,"" says Gupte, adding that the sport requires tremendous discipline, both on and off the field. Some question whether cricket still deserves that reputation -- after an incident on the cricket pitch in January escalated into a bitter racial row between India and Australia. The incident took place during a test match in Sydney. Indian player Harbhajan Singh allegedly called Australia's Andrew Symonds ""big monkey"" -- an allegation the Indians did not take lightly. The incident created unprecedented controversy in both cricket-loving countries. But there was no conclusive proof that Singh racially insulted Symonds, says Chetan Chauhan, who was the manager of the Indian cricket team at that time. India threatened to quit the tour if Australia found Singh guilty of racial vilification. Eventually Singh pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of using abusive language. The International Cricket Council overturned an initial three-test ban, replacing it with a financial penalty and the tour went on. Six months later, the so called 'monkey"" incident is still a sensitive issue in India. Few believe Singh said the word monkey -- and even if he did -- they doubt he meant it as a racial insult. In India, the word monkey has a different context, explains Chauhan. ""It's used to describe someone who has extra energy, or is cheeky."" Exactly what went on or which words were used during a heated exchange between Singh and Symonds is still unclear. What the incident did, though, is turn the spotlight on ""sledging"" in cricket -- which until then, was a sport known for its tolerance and civil on-the-field behaviour. Should ""sledging"" be banned? Have you say . ""There are two types of sledging,"" points out former cricket player, Imran Khan. ""One is when in the heat of the moment players exchange hot words, swear at each other. There is this other sledging that I think should be stamped out, which is pre-planned and where it's almost clinical that somehow players plan to go and upset players by being abusive or saying things that are deeply offensive which would get a negative reaction.""  Watch Imran Khan discuss sledging in the sport » . Players, professional and amateur, admit that some form of sledging takes place on the field. But cricket legend Colin Croft warns the ICC must step in when the attacks go too far. ""All sportsmen at the top of the game, because they work harder, the adrenaline is pumping, they are going to try to get you off your game and sledging is I suppose intended to do that,"" he says. ""But when it becomes too personal, too cultural, you've got to be very careful and that's where the ICC should come in and say, 'Look, if you cross a certain line you're gonna be put out of the game.' Simple as that."" Cricket has its own code of conduct, says Chopra, one of the Modern School coaches, adding it's never too early to start teaching aspiring cricketers the etiquette of the sport. ""If some incident takes place, I tell my students, just avoid it. Don't answer back with your mouth. Get back at them with your game."" Arjun Gupta says he tries to follow that advice. And that his fellow students and he live by one golden rule when playing cricket matches. ""Off the field, we are friends,"" he says. His coaches say that's what makes him a gentleman.","Cricket has reputation as a sport ""played by gentlemen""

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney returned with a goal to send England through to the quarter finals of Euro 2012 as Group D winners. Rooney's second-half header saw Roy Hodgson's England leapfrog France, who crashed to a 2-0 defeat against Sweden but still limped through to the last eight. Rooney, who had missed a glorious first-half chance to break the deadlock, headed in from close range after goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov had spilled Steven Gerrard's cross. Yet the real post-match talking point centred on a call for goalline technology as co-hosts Ukraine saw a Marko Devic shot apparently cross the line before being scrambled away by John Terry. It was a cruel end to Ukraine's tournament and a lucky break for England, who held on to secure a quarter-final clash with Italy while France face Spain. England 1-0 Ukraine . The co-hosts needed a win to progress and made a positive start. But while Ukraine undoubtedly dominated the first half, it was England who had the best chance of the opening 45 minutes. John Terry picked out Ashley Young with a fantastic cross-field pass and Young's centre expertly picked out the run of his Manchester United team-mate Rooney, only for the striker to plant his header harmlessly wide. To say Rooney looked rusty on his return would be a huge understatement. His touch was poor and so was his hold-up play, betraying his absence from the tournament so far, but his movement off the ball remained encouraging for Hodgson's side. But it was not just their returning striker who struggled for England; their general play was sloppy and Ukraine's greater urgency and desire meant they bossed the game. Right-back Oleg Husyev displayed plenty of the attacking instinct that he shows on the right wing for Dynamo Kiev and caused Ashley Cole and England all sorts of anxieties. But, for all their intent, Ukraine failed to create any real threat to Joe Hart's goal. Instead, it was England who took control of the game three minutes into the second half -- and this time Rooney's movement paid handsome dividends. Captain Gerrard created the opening, cutting inside and hitting a firm cross that clipped off Selin and Khacheridi to send the ball squirming out of goalkeeper Pyatov's grasp and allow Rooney to run free and head home from close range. On the hour, Ukraine wasted a glorious chance to level when Andriy Yarolenko's searching cross found Milevskiy, who appeared offside but managed to plant his header over the bar from close range. Two minutes later, the co-hosts were controversially denied an equaliser when Milevsky set up Devic, whose shot was parried well by Hart but looped up and goalwards. John Terry raced back and acrobatically hooked away, though the effort looked to have clearly crossed the line. There was still time for Hart to spectacularly palm away Konoplyanka's shot, the impressive Joleon Lescott scrambling the loose ball clear, as England weathered the co-hosts' storm to climb to the top of Group D. Upwards and onwards. France 0-2 Sweden . Second-half goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Sebastian Larsson saw Sweden end their Euro 2012 campaign with victory, but Erik Hamren's side still finished rock-bottom of the group as France limped through as group runners-up. The Swedes, beaten by Ukraine and England in their opening two games, dominated the first half and were unlucky not to take the lead when Philippe Mexes' slip let in Ola Toivonen who rounded keeper Hugo Lloris but shot against the outside of the post from a tight angle. Larsson shot over the crossbar as Sweden threatened again but they finally took a deserved lead on 54 minutes when Ibrahimovic spectacularly volleyed home following another spell of pressure. Captain Lloris kept France in contention when he beat away a Wilhelmsson cross and, from the resulting corner, twisted spectacularly to tip over Olof Mellberg's close range flick. That finally prompted a spell of French pressure, but the closest they came was a Karim Benzema shot that dragged across the face of goal as Sweden comfortably held on. In fact, the Swedes doubled their money in the closing minutes to complete a deserved win. Samuel Holmen scuffed his shot, but the effort bounced back off the crossbar and fell invitingly for Larsson to smash home with another spectacular Swedish finish. Ukraine's defeat meant that France still reached the last eight, where they will now face European champions Spain.","Wayne Rooney's goal seals England a 1-0 win over Euro 2012 co-hosts Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- The Williams sisters cruised into the second round of the U.S. Open but their fellow former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki became the highest-profile casualty of the women's draw in New York. Wimbledon and Olympic champion Serena Williams defied windy conditions to thrash fellow American Coco Vandeweghe 6-1 6-1 in just 55 minutes on Tuesday to set up a match against experienced Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez. ""The match was so weird, the conditions were so tough, I couldn't really play my game. She couldn't really play her game. It's not the best opportunity to grade yourself,"" said fourth seed Williams, who also beat 2008 U.S. Open girls' champion Vandeweghe in the final of the Stanford tournament in July before heading back to Wimbledon for London 2012. Serena won the U.S. Open for the third time in 2008, and older sibling Venus is seeking to match that feat. The 32-year-old, unseeded after falling to 46th in the rankings after being diagnosed an auto-immune disease this time last year, began her bid by beating compatriot Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-3 6-1. ""There comes a point when you have to start realizing you can't play through everything,"" said Williams, who next faces a tough test in the form of German sixth seed Angelique Kerber. ""For me that's been just about a year, year and a half that I've finally gotten smart."" Wimbledon semifinalist Kerber, who beat Venus in Madrid and then at the Olympics, thrashed Britain's Anne Keothavong 6-2 6-0. ""I have to put a lot of balls in the court and execute my game well if I want to win against her,"" Williams said. Wozniacki has dropped from the top of the rankings to ninth since last year's U.S. Open, and the Dane's hopes of winning a first grand slam title seem further away than ever. She reached the New York final in 2009, but on Tuesday lost 6-2 6-2 to 96th-ranked Romanian Irina-Camelia Begu to suffer her second successive first-round exit at a grand slam. ""I think it's a temporary issue,"" said the 22-year-old, who played with a strapped knee after pulling out during hersemifinal at last week's New Haven tournament. ""Hopefully it will get better quickly. It's frustrating to have some injuries, but it happens to everyone. It's just about moving on."" Begu, who turned 22 on Sunday, was the WTA Tour's newcomer of the year in 2011 but has dropped from a career-high ranking of 38th. She will next play 58th-ranked Spaniard Silvia Soler-Espinosa, who reached the third round last year. Former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone was the other big name to depart on Tuesday as the Italian 22nd seed lost to American teenager Sloane Stephens -- touted by many as the natural successor to the Williams sisters. Stephens will next play 141st-ranked German Tatjana Malek, who reached the second round in New York for the first time. The 19-year-old has surged up the rankings to 44th, building on her third-round achievement at last year's U.S. Open with a similar showing at Wimbledon and a last-16 appearance at Roland Garros. Polish second seed Agnieszka Radwanska needed just 54 minutes to dispatch Russian debutant Nina Bratchikova 6-1 6-1. The Wimbledon finalist has lost in the second round at Flushing Meadows for the past three years, and this time faces unseeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro -- who reached the last 16 in 2011. ""I'm just very happy that I could give it my best in the first match. It's always difficult for the first match,"" said the 23-year-old, whose younger sister Urzsula lost to Italian 20th seed Roberta Vinci. ""It's always a bit harder because the people expect you to play well and go far in the tournament. But I'm just trying not to really think about pressure and just do my best."" Former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic beat Ukrainian Elina Svitolina 6-3 6-3 to set up a clash with Sweden's Sofia Arvidsson. The Serbian 12th seed has never been past the fourth round in New York, her worst showing at the four grand slams. ""My big goal is to break the fourth round and get into quarterfinals. Obviously that's something I'm working hard. It's not easy, but I really tried to focus on taking it one match at a time, because sometimes when you get overexcited it doesn't really work for you the way you hope for,"" she said. American 21st seed Christina McHale exited, losing 6-4 4-6 6-3 to 20-year-old Dutch debutant Kiki Bertens, while Austrian No. 29 Tamira Paszek and China's No. 32 Peng Shuai also departed.","Serena and Venus Williams reach second round at the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- Greece striker Giorgios Samaras says the team's players are blocking out the political overtones of Friday's Euro 2012 quarterfinal against Germany. The Gdansk contest has been billed in some quarters as a Eurozone grudge match, amid tensions between the two nations over German Chancellor Angela Merkel's tough stance on austerity measures affecting the Greek people. But Samaras says the soccer squad has developed a siege mentality amid the media hype surrounding the game. ""What's going on between Greece and Germany politics wise -- I really don't care. We as footballers need to stay out of this story and stay focused on the football game only,"" Samaras told CNN. ""We are so focused on our football game that we don't care what's going on outside the hotel. We try to stay compact, like a team, stay together like a family, and if there are problems or something we try to avoid everything."" However Samaras revealed that the Greek players were not immune to the economic problems in the country, where national elections were held this week. ""I think it affects everyone in Greece,"" said the 27-year-old Samaras. ""Just because we are football players does not mean we don't have problems."" With politics and economics serving as a backdrop to Friday's quarterfinal, the Celtic forward also admitted it had been a source of pleasure to the Greece squad that they had brought joy to the fans that are following the team, whether in Poland or back home. ""After the game against Russia, people were partying in the streets with Greek flags. They have a smile on their faces and we feel proud. ""We don't play for ourselves or for the money. We play for the national team, we play for history and for the 11 million people back home,"" said Samaras. The Celtic striker and his teammates provided a lift to their troubled nation by sealing a surprise 1-0 victory over highly fancied Russia in last weekend's group decider. It was the latest against-the-odds Euros triumph for the shock 2004 champions, and Samaras believes Greece's phenomenal team spirit is the secret to their string of unlikely successes. ""It's something sometimes you can't explain. It's so strong. We care about each other outside the pitch and that's going onto the pitch. I think that's the strength we have as a team,"" he said. ""We don't have personal egos in the team. We don't have a superstar -- sometimes the superstars are a little bit outside the team.""

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Thirty years ago, the mention of a social ball would have made most Chinese cringe -- it was regarded as a typical derivative of capitalism. However this year, Shanghai hosted its first International Debutante Ball, and an invitation to the high-society event is becoming the new status symbol in the city. Ricky Gong, 39, a Shanghai-born beauty contest organizer, was one of 150 guests who sipped champagne under chandeliers at the invitation-only event held in January. ""The ball was elegant, noble and very ceremonial,"" he says. ""It had a very strong upper-class feeling."" Now, a second ball is on its way. In the West, a debutante ball is the ""coming-out party"" for daughters of the rich, famed and powerful. In the Shanghai Waldorf Astoria's colonial-style ballroom, Gong witnessed 13 ladies making their debut into high society, donning traditional white gowns and dripping with RMB 60 million (US$9.5 million) worth of jewelry and tiaras. This is one of Shanghai's most luxurious venues. A dinner for two could easily run to RMB 1,000 (US$158), about one-third of the monthly salary of an average Chinese person. Gong says he enjoyed it. ""The event is good for shaping the elite class of socialism,"" he explains. ""Our society needs elites like (the debutantes) to help build positive social morality and establish correct values."" Up until the mid-1980s, Communist China regarded farmers and workers as the noblest people of all. ""In today's mainland China, there are only two renditions of the high society: money and power,"" Gong comments. Chinese socialite Vivian Chow Wong, 66, is the brains behind the ball. The daughter of late Peking Opera master Zhou Xinfang, the homegrown dame will host her next cotillion at the Peninsula Shanghai in January 2013. ""(I brought the ball to China because) I think the time is right,"" says Wong, who moved to Hong Kong with her family in 1959 and has since studied and lived in Asia, Europe and North America. With the exposure of mainland girls taking part in other debutante balls in the West, Wong reckons there is room for one in China ""where the girls are striving to have a certain quality of life other than brand names and materialistic things."" The first Shanghai International Debutante Ball did not invite any ladies from the mainland (13 debs aged between 16-25 came from Britain, Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan), but eligible daughters of the Communist Party elite or ""red princesses"" have waltzed at Le Bal des DÃ©butantes, the annual Debutante Ball in Paris, for the past decade. Wan Baobao was the first to attend the Parisian event in 2003. The Beijing-born jewelry designer is the granddaughter of Wan Li, who, among other titles, served as the former vice premier of the State Council in the '80s. Wan's debut was followed by Chen Xiaodan in 2006, whose father governs the China Development Bank. Chen's grandfather, Chen Yun, was a founding member of the PRC and a high-ranking official in the country until the late 1980s, according to Want China Times. And, Jasmine Li, a young debutante said be the granddaughter of a current member of the Politburo Standing Committee, was reported to have attended the Paris Debutante Ball in 2009. ""Many people on the Internet have raised questions about the attendance of Chinese debutantes such as Wan and Chen,"" says Rachel Lu, 31, editor from Tea Leaf Nation, an English language blog focusing on the social media reaction to Chinese news. ""(Netizens said) their ancestors were Communists or Red Army. Strictly speaking, they can't be the 'Chinese royalty,'"" adds Lu, who hails from Chengdu and graduated from Harvard Law School. In a country that deposed its last emperor, Pu Yi, one century ago, many are questioning the meaning of the ""upper class"" in today's society, continues Lu. China-based etiquette trainer Lawrence Lo thinks China needs five to 10 years to mature for a debutante ball. ""It is not the right time yet and too early for social acceptance of such occasions since there is still not an established environment that advocates such exclusive activities,"" says Lo, 39, who owns a boutique etiquette consultancy in Shanghai. The lack of strong candidates is another challenge. ""A qualified debutante will take years of personal training and development,"" adds Lo. ""China has seen its economy growing at a very rapid pace in the last 10 years, but soft skills lag behind its current development."" Wong reveals that two or three debs from the mainland, who she met after January, will attend her next ball. She stresses her debs don't necessarily need to have a wealthy family or a strong lineage (""though a strong lineage helps""), but they must have the elegance, quality, and style of a modern woman. This entails a proper family upbringing and preferably education in the West. In addition, they must have a ""good family background."" ""Good family background in today's China means a family without any scandals, such as corruption,"" says Wong. Lu says the Shanghai International Debutante Ball has yet to receive attention from Chinese netizens due to the lack of mainland debs in the first one, but if the future selected ladies are princelings, this could cause controversy. ""However, people will be more tolerant if they turn out to be daughters or granddaughters of pure businessmen."" This sharp reality hasn't escaped organizer Wong, who claims that her debutante ball ""will have nothing to do with children of Chinese government officials."" She adds, ""I personally prefer girls from private enterprises because that makes life easier for everybody.""","Chinese socialite plans to host first debutante ball for mainland girls in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Italy striker Antonio Cassano has apologised for apparent homophobic comments he made in a Euro 2012 press conference. The outspoken striker's comments came after he was asked about an Italian TV personality's claim that there are two gay players in the current Italy squad. Cassano is reported to have responded: ""If they're queer, that's their problem. I hope there aren't any queers in the national team."" The Milan striker's comments were largely laughed off at the time, but sparked outrage among gay rights groups. Those reactions prompted an apology on Tuesday, with Cassano issuing a statement which read: ""I'm sincerely sorry that what I said has sparked controversy and protests from gay associations. ""Homophobia is not a sentiment I feel. I didn't want to offend anyone and I certainly didn't want to call into question anyone's freedom of sexuality. ""I only said it wasn't my problem and I wouldn't allow myself to judge others. Everyone deserves respect."" Campaign group the Gay Centre in Italy had hit out at Cassano's original comments, using an Italian slang phrase for doing something stupid that plays on Cassano's name. ""Cassano says 'cassanate' (stupid things) about gays, showing his arrogance and irresponsibility,"" said spokesman Fabrizio Marrazzo in a statement. ""Unifying sport and homophobia gives a dangerous message, especially to the young,"" he added. Despite gay sportsmen making public their sexuality in other sports, there are no high-profile gay footballers in Europe's major leagues. Gay rights groups have called for someone to step forward and make known their sexuality and last year Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer told Bunte magazine: ""Those players who are homosexual should say so. That would take a load off their minds."" Former Nottingham Forest forward Justin Fashanu is the only English footballer to have come out, later in his career. He killed himself in 1998, aged 37, after being questioned by police in the United States about an alleged sexual assault on a 17-year-old boy. Another British athlete, former NBA star John Amaechi, came out but only after he had ended his basketball career. Former Wales rugby union international Gareth Thomas came out at the end of his career but said he had not done so earlier as he did not want to be known for his sexuality rather than his sporting prowess.","Italy striker Antonio Cassano apologizes for apparent homophobic comments .

"(CNN) -- Euro 2012 hosts Ukraine were brought back down to earth after their opening match heroics as France clinched a 2-0 victory in stormy Donetsk. Play in the Group D match was suspended for 58 minutes as spectacular torrential rain and forked lightning put the players' safety at risk. When the teams returned to the field, the French made their superior technical ability count as clinical second-half strikes from Jeremy Menez and Yohan Cabaye sealed a comfortable win. In Group D's other game, England won a thrilling contest against Sweden to dump the Scandinavians out of the tournament. Soccer Live: Euro 2012 day 8 as it happened . Young striker Danny Welbeck hit a brilliant winner 13 minutes from time after Sweden briefly led through Olof Mellberg's double strike. Andy Carroll and Theo Walcott were also on target for England in the 3-2 triumph, their first ever competitive victory over the Swedes. Ukraine 0-2 France . Group D favorites France proved too good for hosts Ukraine in a rain-affected Euro 2012 clash in Donetsk. After a huge thunderstorm caused play to be suspended for almost an hour during the first half, Jeremy Menez and Yohan Cabaye struck after the break to seal victory for Laurent Blanc's side. The game begun amid torrential rain and within five minutes of kick-off, Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers ordered the teams off the field as thunder and treacherous forked lightning engulfed the Donbass Arena. The continuation of the match looked in doubt as large puddles of water began to form on the pitch but 58 minutes later, the teams re-emerged to clearer skies. Ukraine, despite the cacophonous roar from the crowd that greeted their every thrust forward, found it tough to cope with France's slicker passing and movement. Home goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into a wonderful save with his feet to deny Menez, before batting away a Phillippe Mexes header. Veteran striker Andriy Shevchenko, a two-goal hero in Ukraine's opening match against Sweden, again looked the hosts' most potent threat. He saw one rasping strike palmed away by Hugo Lloris and then sent a thunderous long-range effort whistling inches over the bar shortly after the break. But just as Ukraine were finding their rhythm, France swept up the field and broke the deadlock. After some fine interplay between Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, Menez cut inside Yevhen Selin and drilled a shot in at the near post. Three minutes later, Cabaye latched on to Benzema's pass and buried an effort past Pyatov from 15 yards. The goals completely deflated the Ukrainians, who escaped going further behind when Cabaye blasted against the post after a mesmerizing spell of French possession. The win stretches Le Bleus' unbeaten run to an imposing 23 games and it also made a bit of history. It is, incredibly, the first time they have won a European Championship match without either Zinedine Zidane or Michel Platini in their side. England 3-2 Sweden . England striker Danny Welbeck's sumptuous late winner settled a topsy-turvy match as Sweden were sent crashing out of Euro 2012. The Manchester United man's cheeky backheel sealed the points for England after Olof Mellberg's brace for Sweden had threatened to derail their more illustrious opponents. It was a sweet, if nerve-jangling, victory for the English, for whom Sweden had become something of a bogey team in international tournaments. But where England failed in Euro 1992 and the World Cups of 2002 and 2006, they succeeded in Kiev to put themselves in a strong position in Group D. A point in their final pool match against Ukraine, in which the talismanic Wayne Rooney returns from suspension, will be enough to see England into the quarter-finals. Roy Hodgson's side were on top in the first half and their pressure told when Steven Gerrard sent an inch-perfect cross into the box for Carroll to plant a trademark bullet header past Andreas Isaksson. But Carroll's wild challenge on Kim Kallstrom then produced the free-kick that led to Sweden's somewhat scrappy equalizer. Zlatan Ibrahimovic hit the set-piece against the wall before his miscued volley fell to Mellberg, whose shot was parried by Joe Hart only to bounce off Glen Johnson and over the line. The Scandinavians, needing a win, then went in front when Mellberg rose unmarked to head home his second goal from Sebastian Larsson's free-kick. But England hit back when an Ashley Young corner was cleared straight to Walcott, whose 20-yard strike deceived Isaksson and flew into the middle of the net. Substitute Walcott was then instrumental in England's third goal, racing to the byline and cutting the ball back for Welbeck to flick home a stunning backheel.","France beat hosts Ukraine 2-0 in rain-lashed Euro 2012 clash .

"(CNN) -- Germany inflicted a second successive Euro 2012 defeat on the Netherlands when one of football's great rivalries was renewed on Wednesday. These two nations have a fierce history, punctuated by on-field battles that the legendary German captain Franz Beckenbauer claimed had cost him ""years of my life."" This latest encounter was no classic, largely because Joachim Low's Germany dominated for the vast majority. Two superb first-half goals from Mario Gomez took his tally for the tournament to three and put the Germans in complete control. Robin Van Persie pulled a goal back as Netherlands improved in the second half, but Germany comfortably held on for a second successive victory at this tournament. Portugal's earlier last-gasp win over Denmark means that nothing is yet decided in Group B. However, Germany need only a point against Denmark to reach the quarterfinals, while the Netherlands need something of a miracle to progress. Netherlands 1-2 Germany . Striker Gomez scored two stunning goals to earn Germany a deserved win and heighten expectation that Low's side can win this European Championship. The Germans took control of a crucial game when Gomez brilliantly collected Bastian Schweinsteiger's pass and spun to slide home a clinical finish. It was 2-0 before the break as Gomez scored an even better goal. Again Schweinsteiger was the provider, his pass allowing Bayern Munich clubmate Gomez to escape rookie defender Jetro Willems and fire across goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg and into the far corner for his 14th goal in his last 16 international games. The Dutch were, briefly, ranked the number one team in the world as recently as August but they looked a poor imitation of the side that reached the World Cup final in South Africa two years ago. But a game between the two highest scoring teams in the qualifying campaign was always set to see goals and Van Persie's brilliant strike 17 minutes from time breathed life into an ailing game. The Arsenal striker's touch had previously deserted him at this tournament, but he suddenly looked deadly as he spun away from Sami Khedira and smashed a superb shot past Manuel Neuer with his weaker right foot. Germany's young side suddenly looked vulnerable, but limited the Dutch to long-range efforts that failed to trouble Neuer again. Portugal 3-2 Denmark . Substitute Silvestre Varela rescued Portugal with a stunning late winner to give Paulo Bento's side real hope of reaching the quarterfinals of Euro 2012. Forward Nicklas Bendtner appeared to have denied Portugal a crucial victory as he struck twice to wipe out a 2-0 lead. Cristiano Ronaldo missed a glorious chance to restore Portugal's advantage but substitute Varela had the final say with a remarkable winner. Fabio Coentrao's left-wing cross invited a volley but Varela swung wildly with his left foot and completely missed, only to spin and smash home the loose ball with his right. It was a remarkable finish to a remarkable game and it left Portugal and Denmark locked together on three points each after two Group B games. Bento's side urgently needed a win after losing their opening game to Germany, one of the tournament favorites, and they swept into a two-goal lead to take control of the tie. Real Madrid defender Pepe, who had hit the bar against Germany, had a change of luck to open the scoring, timing his run to perfection to flick home a near-post header from Joao Moutinho's corner. Striker Helder Postiga doubled the lead when he steered home Nani's low center, but Bendtner's close-range header gave Denmark hope before halftime. The Arsenal striker pounced again 10 minutes from time when he headed home Lars Jacobsen's cross -- his sixth international goal in just five appearances against Portugal. Those are the sort of statistics more usually associated with Ronaldo, but the Portugal captain had an off-day, missing two clear chances before substitute Varela spared his blushes.","Germany beat Netherlands 2-0 in latest renewal of one of football's great rivalries .

"(CNN) -- Andriy Shevchenko has told CNN Sport's Pedro Pinto that the Euro 2012 finals in his native Ukraine will be his final major football tournament, and he is determined to end his international career on a high. The 35-year-old Dynamo Kiev striker, who is widely regarded as the greatest Ukrainian player of all time after a celebrated 18-year career with Kiev, AC Milan and Chelsea, is looking forward to next year's showpiece -- and believes co-hosts Ukraine will stage a tournament to remember. ""This will be my final international tournament and I believe everything has been done perfectly to prepare for it,"" Shevchenko told CNN. ""There is a great responsibility on the team to perform well, because our supporters and the whole of the country are expecting us to do just that. Poland and Ukraine primed for Euro 2012 kick off . ""It will be hard for us and it will be an achievement just to get out of the group stages and through to the quarterfinals, but I am personally dreaming of reaching the final!"" he added. Shevchenko has scored 46 goals in 105 appearances for his country -- and he is not nervous about leading his side out in the finals, despite the weight of a nation's expectations on his shoulders. ""I have already experienced captaining us at the World Cup finals in Germany in 2006 and it will be equally as important to be captain in 2012. ""We are playing at home, with full stadiums and passionate fans. It will be very special moment for me."" Captaining his country in a major international tournament on home soil will be a fitting end to a wonderful career for Shevchenko, who is among the greatest forwards the world has ever seen. Shevchenko is best remembered for his time at AC Milan, where he scored 175 goals in seven seasons -- the second most prolific striker in the famous Italian club's history -- as well as helping the club lift the Champions League title in 2003. It is something Shevchenko is naturally very proud of. ""When I was a child, it was my dream to be a professional footballer. When I was 14 I visited Milan's San Siro stadium and remember thinking how unbelievable it was,"" said Shevchenko. ""From then onwards I vowed that one day I would be playing there -- and I am very proud that I achieved this and also for everything else I have managed to achieve in football.""","Andriy Shevchenko is the widely recognized as the greatest player in Ukrainian football history .

"(CNN) -- Germany's Tommy Haas upset Roger Federer in straight sets to win the ATP tournament on the grass courts of Halle Sunday. Federer was bidding for his sixth title at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament but had no answer to his 34-year-old opponent, who won 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 in front of his home fans. It was Haas' second Halle title after winning in 2009 and his 13th on the ATP Tour. He has made a remarkable recovery after hip surgery which sidelined him for 14 months and he started 2012 outside the top 200 in the world. His victory will see him rise to 51st in the rankings and he is set to be a dangerous outsider at Wimbledon. ""This has been one of the best weeks of my career, but I reckon I won't really appreciate what's happened until this evening,"" he told the official tournament website. ""If someone had said to me beforehand that I was going to beat Roger Federer, probably the best player of all time, I would have thought they were mad!"" Federer, coming off a semifinal loss to Novak Djokovic at the French Open, took a 3-1 in the opening set but proceeded to lose three successive games as Haas broke back. The German took a close tiebreaker and a single break to lead 5-4 in the second set left him serving for the title. When Federer hit a return long it was Haas who raised his arms in triumph after 95 minutes of gripping action. Federer, who will now head to the third grand slam of the season bidding for a seventh Wimbledon crown, was magnanimous in defeat.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Over the past month, video has emerged from the Syrian city of Homs showing killings and other atrocities apparently committed by security forces in neighborhoods that have opposed the government. CNN has obtained footage that is among the most disturbing yet -- about a dozen family members killed in one house in what appears to be sectarian brutality. CNN is confident of the video's provenance. The images show a group of nine men crouched as they move across rooftops, then crawl through a hole smashed in a wall to reach a house on a sectarian fault line that runs through Homs. ""We're rescuing the bodies of the martyrs,"" a man's voice says on the video. About a week earlier, the men received information that a Sunni family had been killed, but it took them this long to launch their mission. When they reach the house, they come across a grisly find: the body of a woman lying face down on the carpet. In an adjacent room, they find more bodies next to each other in a corner, as though they had been trying to hide. One of them, a child, lays with his face frozen in fear, mouth open and arms outstretched. On his chest leans another body, its head covered in a khaki-colored cloth. A third body, with its head covered in a black cloth, leans against the second. Beside the pile of bodies, about a foot above the slumped third body, the white wall is splattered red. ""Let the world see,"" a voice exclaims on the video. ""Look at this massacre in just one house."" The man curses the Shias, the Alawites and President Bashar al-Assad. Syria is a nation with a Sunni majority governed by a minority Alawite, an offshoot sect of Shia Islam. The video is said to have been shot in the neighborhood of Sabeel last month. ""Oh, look, people, look,"" says one man, overcome with emotion as he too curses the regime -- and the world. The camera pans to show more bodies in the bathroom. Suddenly, from another floor, a whimper. The men are stunned, and coax a child out of a dark room where he must have been hiding for days. The child, in a red, hooded sweatshirt, comes into view, crawling over a body in the doorway to reach the men, who greet him with open arms. The men say they do not know who killed the boy's family or why. But they do know, they say, that the killings were a sectarian massacre carried out by thugs allied to the regime. CNN has attempted to reach the Syrian Foreign Ministry for reaction but there was no answer. The Syrian government has in the past blamed armed gangs for such attacks.","The video shows the bodies of a family in Homs .

"(CNN) -- Andrei Shevchenko enhanced his iconic standing as a Ukrainian national hero as he sparked scenes of national celebration with a match-winning double in Kiev. The home fans were thrilled when their all-time leading goalscorer was somewhat surprisingly included in Oleg Blokhin's starting line-up. And their joy at seeing their hero in action escalated to delirium as the striker scored twice in the second half to give his side a win in their opening game. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had fired the Swedes in front, but Shevchenko levelled within three minutes and quickly added a second to send the co-hosts to the top of Group D. Earlier, group favorites France and England had shared a 1-1 draw in Donetsk. Defender Joleon Lescott headed England into a first-half lead, but his Manchester City team-mate Samir Nasri levelled for France before half-time. France 1-1 England . Samir Nasri rescued a point for France in Donetsk after his Manchester City team-mate Joleon Lescott had fired England into a first-half lead. Lescott became the first Manchester City player to score in a European Championships finals when he headed home Steven Gerrard's free-kick on 30 minutes. But having waited 52 years for one goal, City quickly supplied another as Nasri dragged France level again. Florent Malouda's searching run allowed Franck Ribery to tee-up Nasri for a clinical strike from the edge of the penalty area that flew past his City team-mate, Joe Hart, six minutes before half-time. The draw extends France's unbeaten international run to 22 games, while England remain unbeaten after three games under new coach Roy Hodgson. Hodgson sprung a surprise by including Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in his starting line-up, the 18-year-old winning only his third cap. The youngster and his England side settled well and Hodgson's side should have been in front when James Milner went past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris but fired into the side netting with the goal wide open. But when Manchester City man Milner was fouled by France's Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, Lescott exacted swift punishment by heading home Gerrard's free-kick from close range. The lead only last nine minutes, though, as France his back with a well-worked goal that finished when Nasri fired a low right-foot shot beyond Hart's reach. Ukraine 2-1 Sweden . Ukraine's talismanic striker, Andrei Shevchenko, lit up Group D with a second-half double to defeat Sweden. The co-hosts' record goalscorer was their hero once again as he took his tally of international goals to 48. But none of the previous 46 will have been more important than this golden double in the Olympic Stadium. After a lack-lustre first-half Sweden's own striking icon, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, brought the game to life when he turned home Kim Kallstrom's pass to put Sweden in front. But the goal sparked a response from Ukraine, who struck twice within 10 minutes to turn the game around. Andriy Yarmolenko was the supplier on both occasions, first cutting back to whip in a left-foot cross that saw Shevchenko react quickest to head home an equalizer. Six minutes later, Yarmolenko floated a left-foot corner to the near post where Shevchenko escaped Ibrahimovic's marking to glance home a header and put the co-hosts in front. Shevchenko left to a huge ovation when he was substituted 10 minutes from time, but the Ukrainian celebrations were nearly silenced in stoppage time. First, Johan Elmander fired over the crossbar after combining brilliantly with Ibrahimovic, then defender Olof Mellberg shinned over the bar with just seconds remaining.","Ukraine striker Andrei Shevchenko scores twice to seal 2-1 win over Sweden .

"Fuzhou, China (CNN) -- The framed photos that adorn Crystal Wang's expansive office are a who's who of China's leadership. In one President Hu Jintao is shaking her hand, while Premier Wen Jiabao smiles next to her in another. But she looked most relaxed and radiant in a photo taken with Vice President Xi Jinping, seen in China as Hu's heir apparent and currently visiting Washington. ""I feel very comfortable talking to him,"" said the president of the Newland Group, a high-tech firm based in the southeastern city of Fuzhou. ""He's very kind."" It was Xi's help some 20 years ago that first turned Wang's vision into reality. In 1993, when Wang and her partners were struggling with red tape to set up a software startup, she went to see Xi, then the city's Communist Party chief. ""He was far-sighted and realized that China's economic development would have no solid foundation without its own enterprises or innovation,"" Wang recalled. ""He gave us his full backing."" Firm tone, diplomacy in Obama-Xi meeting . When Xi later became the governor of Fujian -- Fuzhou is the provincial capital -- Wang said he continued to support Newland, visiting the company numerous times, as it grew from a one-desk operation to a mini-empire that employs hundreds of engineers and scientists across the country. In a shiny showroom, Wang proudly pointed to examples of the latest technology developed by Newland, whose portfolio now covers software design, digital television and green technology -- all areas championed by Xi. ""I'm a businesswoman and he's a high-ranking official. I should've felt the status gap between us but I never did,"" she said. ""He was such a good listener, paying attention to our ideas and nurturing young entrepreneurs like us."" Wang's ascent coincided that of Xi, who rose through the ranks during his 17 years in Fujian. As a politician Xi spent more time in this coastal province than any other places -- and analysts say his policy focus and governing style here may offer some clues to deciphering a largely enigmatic figure. Son of a Mao-era revolutionary hero and a pro-economic reform statesman, Xi is one of the so-called ""princelings"" -- children of top Communist leaders. The 58-year-old vice president has kept his head down and worked the system, spending most of his post-university years in the provinces before returning to Beijing in 2007. For a long time, the best-known aspect of Xi's life was his wife, a famous folk singer who used to perform before millions on state television. ""We don't know much about him. We don't know what he really thinks,"" said James McGregor, former chief executive of Dow Jones in China and a long-time observer of Chinese politics. ""But one thing you'll see is he's going to be tough -- I think he's going to be tough with a smile on his face."" Such an assessment echoes that of senior U.S. officials who, after meetings between Vice President Joe Biden and Xi in China last summer, described the leader-in-waiting as ""tough."" But they appreciated Xi's emphasis on Sino-U.S. relations as a policy priority and viewed him as someone America could do business with. That Xi supported entrepreneurs like Wang -- first in Fujian and later in neighboring Zhejiang, the province that boasts China's most vibrant private sector -- may also be an encouraging sign for those who feel increasingly left behind by China's economic growth model that seems to favor state-owned conglomerates. A welder's wish . Two hours' drive from Wang's sprawling corporate campus, economic models and foreign policy seem far removed from the minds of residents in Xiabaishi, a seaside town where rows of fishing boats in fading paint are moored by the shore and rusty machinery sits idle in shipyards nearby. Local media has reported that, under Xi's leadership in the late 1990s, officials moved more than 16,000 poor fishermen and their families who had lived on boats into government subsidized housing, and found land-based jobs for many of them. More than a decade later, however, poverty remains visible throughout Xiabaishi. Some fishing families still sleep on their boats, while others cram into ramshackle slums on the coast. Even the lucky ones who live in houses have to brave bitter cold winds blown in through cracks in the brick walls. An old woman weaving fishing nets by her doorway said she has never heard of Xi. Her neighbor agreed -- the last leader both appeared aware of was former President Jiang Zemin, Hu's predecessor who retired a decade ago. Interrupting the women, a young man nearby indicated he certainly knows who Xi is. Xie Yingling doesn't remember much about Xi's time in Fujian, but the 32-year-old unemployed welder has a clear message for the future leader. ""I want a job,"" he said. ""Nobody wants to hire people like me -- high school dropouts in our 30s -- here or in big cities."" When the shipbuilding industry was booming, Xie said he earned as much as 200 yuan (US$30) a day. Now he can barely afford to buy a bowl of noodles, which costs 3 yuan (50 U.S. cents) at local restaurants. ""When the shipbuilders went out of business, we lost our livelihood,"" he said. The bleak scene in Xiabaishi -- and many other towns like it -- may not fit nicely into the image depicted by American politicians of a rising superpower that increasingly poses economic and military threat to the United States. But analysts say it is part of a China that Xi is going to inherit -- and he and his comrades will have to tackle the myriad of problems, especially the widening income gap in a slowing economy, before mass discontent brewing beneath the surface explodes. Aware of a poorer and angrier segment of population back home, Xi may be ready to talk tough during his meetings with U.S. officials this week, particularly on the economic and trade front. ""He's still talking to an audience in China,"" said McGregor, the China observer. ""That's the constituency that matters to him, especially in a transition time."" Back in Xiabaishi, a small crowd gathered in a barbershop had nothing but praise for their former governor, complete with tales of his visit to a flooded village nearby. A poster depicting China's current top Communist leadership -- nine men who effectively rule the country -- was pinned on the wall, with the sixth-ranked Xi almost in the middle. ""He's going to be the big boss,"" one man offered in a hushed voice, pointing to Xi. From Fujian to Washington, almost everyone seems to know that much -- but the rest remains anyone's guess.","Xi Jinping,seen in China President Hu Jintao's heir apparent, is currently visiting the U.S.

"(CNN) -- UEFA has decided not to make a charitable donation to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster as part of the social projects it has opted to support during Euro 2012, which is being co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland. A botched reactor safety test at Chernobyl in Ukraine -- then part of the Soviet Union -- set off the worst nuclear accident in history, with the radiation effects of the 1986 explosion about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II, and nearly 14 times greater than the disaster last year at the Fukushima plant in Japan. ""There are no plans to make donations to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster,"" UEFA said in a statement given to CNN. ""However, children from Chernobyl disaster regions in Ukraine and Belarus have received an invitation, extended by UEFA President Michel Platini, to attend one of the Euro 2012 matches. There will be a total of 125 children attending the match in Kiev on June 19 between Sweden and France."" The chairman of the Chernobyl Children's Trust Simon Walsh described UEFA's decision as paying 'lip-service' to the victims of Chernobyl. ""This is a hugely significant tournament and a unique opportunity to highlight the ongoing consequences of the Chernobyl disaster,"" said Walsh. ""Hundreds of thousands of children in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia are still affected today. Ironically, charities from the 16 nations participating in the Euros are working in the affected regions, trying their best to mitigate the consequences of Chernobyl with very limited resources. ""This could have been a golden opportunity to raise both awareness and funds for the 'Children of Chernobyl' while simultaneously giving much-needed credibility and kudos to UEFA and Michel Platini."" More than 200,000 people were evacuated following the disaster, never to return. A 2005 report by ""The Chernobyl Forum"" (the most comprehensive to date) estimated that more than five million remain in what have been termed ""contaminated territories,"" and 250,000 live in ""highly contaminated territories."" Figures released by UNICEF in 2010 showed that more than 20% of adolescent children in Belarus, which neighbors Ukraine, suffered from disabilities and chronic illness. Belarus absorbed 70% of Chernobyl's fallout. ""Twenty-six years after the Chernobyl catastrophe, hundreds of villages and towns remain radioactively contaminated and millions of people, many of whom are children, live in these areas,"" said Walsh. ""These children and their families have had to adapt and 'forget' about the radiation as they have no choice but to live where they are. Popular pastimes like collecting berries and mushrooms and walking in the forest are forbidden in contaminated areas but as time progresses the radiation signs are often ignored."" Walsh added: ""The government is now systematically declassifying villages and towns as contaminated,"" added the Chernobyl Children's Trust chairman. ""This is not based on any scientific evidence and entire towns and villages that may well still be radioactively contaminated are now being classified as 'clean' and 'safe' to live in. ""This is purely economical as families living in the 'zones' are entitled to certain 'privileges' -- a free holiday in a different part of the country for children, once a year and a meager allowance for the family."" UEFA, which made a net profit of $312.5 million during Euro 2008, is to make a contribution of $3.75 million to its RESPECT campaign -- RESPECT Diversity, RESPECT Fan Culture, RESPECT Inclusion and RESPECT your Health. The RESPECT Diversity project is being run by Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). Two FARE international monitors will attend each match during Euro 2012 to identify racist behavior and far-right banners. Former England defender Sol Campbell has warned fans not to travel to Poland or Ukraine following a BBC documentary accusing football fans from the two countries of racism and also questioned why both nations were awarded the tournament in the first place. UEFA says the profits for the 2008 tournament were used to finance all its youth and women's competitions until 2012, its complete refereeing and coaching programs and some of its administrative costs.","The 1986 Chernobyl disaster was the worst nuclear accident in history .

"(CNN) -- Former England defender Sol Campbell has told CNN World Sport he is baffled by England coach Roy Hodgson's decision to omit Rio Ferdinand from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament. Hodgson insisted he had decided to exclude the 33-year-old Manchester United center-back from his 23-man squad for purely footballing reasons. But Campbell, who won 73 caps and played in three World Cup campaigns for his England, thinks Hodgson's call has more to do with off-field concerns. Former England captain John Terry has been included in the squad, despite awaiting trial on charges he racially abused Rio's brother Anton during an English Premier League match in October. Terry denies the allegations. Did Manchester City win the title -- or did United lose it? Terry was stripped of the captaincy over the affair, leading to the resignation of Fabio Capello, and Campbell is convinced the ongoing court case involving the Chelsea player was a factor in Hodgson's decision. ""I don't know what's gone on,"" he told CNN. ""I don't know the conversation Roy Hodgson has had with John Terry or Rio Ferdinand. That's going to probably be kept quiet. ""But I think it did play a small, or a big part in it, because you're away for four to six weeks together, (Roy is) probably thinking, maybe something might happen at the camp. ""But you can't say for football reasons Rio Ferdinand shouldn't be going because he's experienced, he knows how to play football, he's an excellent defender, he's been fantastic for his club and country, especially in the last three months."" Hodgson said his conversations with both players would remain private though he did reveal Ferdinand was gracious and wished England well for the competition. Of Terry Hodgson, the former Liverpool manager, said: ""I realized that when I selected him there would be people who would raise eyebrows but that's the decision that I've made, that's the decision I shall live with."" Manchester City sorry for Tevez's 'Fergie R.I.P.' banner . Ferdinand took to social networking site Twitter to express his disappointment at missing out, saying: ""Absolutely loved playing for England. To say I'm gutted is an understatement of the highest order."" Campbell believes Ferdinand's vast experience on the international stage will prove a big miss for Hodgson's side. ""I can't believe it,"" he told CNN. ""He's played the last 10, 12 games for Manchester United, he's played excellently, he's fit as a fiddle. ""You need all your experienced players in a tournament like this. If you want younger players who are coming in and learning their way around international football, start with them in a campaign, at the beginning of your qualifying. ""Start not at the end, when you need the most experienced players at the tournament. Rio knows his way around all these tournaments. You need characters like that."" Campbell, who played in six consecutive major tournaments for his country between 1996 and 2006, did back Hodgson's decision to hand Steven Gerrard the captain's armband though. The Liverpool skipper has 90 caps to his name since making his debut in 2000 and Campbell said: ""I'm surprised Stevie didn't become captain sooner. ""He's always seemed to be overlooked but he's an excellent captain for his club, Liverpool, and I'm sure he'd be excellent for England.""","England coach Roy Hodgson omits Rio Ferdinand from Euro 2012 squad .

"(CNN) -- Williams have become the first of the 10 current Formula One teams to confirm their entry for the 2010 world championship. Williams have become the first of the current F1 teams to confirm their 2010 world championship entry. With the deadline for entries closing on Friday, Williams have been forced to act, making it clear their position in no way undermines the unified efforts of the Formula One Teams' Association in their ongoing debate with governing body FIA with regard to next year's proposed rule changes. On Sunday, the teams handed FIA chief Max Mosley a letter in Monaco demanding he scrap the 2010 rules, notably the budget cap and the prospect of a two-tier championship, in return for their commitment to the sport through to 2012. That was despite the fact Mosley had earlier claimed that progress was being made in the on-going dispute. Despite the continued furor, and with the clock ticking towards the deadline, Williams have had to step forward. ""We can confirm we have submitted our entry for the 2010 Formula One world championship,"" confirmed Williams chief Adam Parr to Press Associations Sport. ""We have done that, because we have a contract with Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management, and also with the FIA, called the Concorde Agreement. ""We extended that for five years up until the end of 2012. Bernie has honored his obligations to us under that agreement. We have been paid in full for our participation. We feel morally and legally obliged to honor our side of that contract. ""Secondly, we are a Formula One team. We don't do anything else. It is something we have been doing for 31 years. It is very important for our employees, sponsors and fans to know we will be in Formula One for next year and many years to come."" Parr is eager to stress Williams have not broken ranks with FOTA, that the team remains fully committed to the organisation and their efforts to build a relationship with the FIA for a better F1. ""We joined FOTA last year, and we're absolutely committed to FOTA,"" insisted Parr. ""FOTA has done a tremendous job in many ways, such as reducing costs and helping Brawn GP get through their difficult times over the winter. ""A lot of credit for that must go to (Ferrari president and FOTA chairman) Luca di Montezemolo, as well as the other teams for their support. ""We want FOTA to continue their discussions with the FIA, who have made huge concessions, more than I thought possible. Max Mosley has been very conciliatory. But what we have here is a marriage. It's too important for everyone for that to break up."" With Ferrari the leading team in taking the fight to the FIA, the next few days are crucial to the future of the sport. Parr added: ""We have 10 teams all committed to Formula One. ""But the FIA is right in saying it is both necessary and opportune to create the opportunity for a number of new teams to come into the sport. ""In that context we cannot delay the entries. We are trying to be reasonable and find a sensible solution.""","Williams are first of the 10 current Formula One teams to confirm 2010 entry .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations is holding a summit this week in Rio de Janeiro on global sustainable development, but, incredibly, family planning is not on the agenda. How can the summit ignore this elephant in the room? When the world's population hit 7 billion in October, experts warned that if nothing is done, the global population could grow by another 3.5 billion by 2050. Still, many of the world's women are without the resources to plan their families' growth effectively -- a major factor in stemming the tide of global population expansion. Clearly, the world's growing population and the significant challenges it poses must be central to any discussion of sustainable development at the U.N. Earth Summit, also called Rio+20, taking place Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Negotiators hammering out the terms for discussion in Rio failed to link the summit's sustainable development goals to the concerns, needs and desires of women worldwide -- particularly to the role that family planning could play in easing the burdens posed by population growth. We know that when women have access to voluntary family planning services, supplies and information, society sees enormous gains in each of the three pillars of sustainable development -- human development, economic growth and environmental sustainability. Without it, families, communities and natural resources are extraordinarily burdened. Experts estimate that more than 215 million women around the world want to delay or space childbirth but are not using modern contraception. In fact, meeting this need would cost $3.6 billion per year, a small amount when you consider the enormous benefits. Providing modern contraception also has the potential to stem population growth and relieve human pressure on the environment and natural resources. We urge governments and global agencies at Rio to make this a priority. We are at a moment in history where we still have time to make a difference. It is essential that the global discussion in Rio not be blind to the potential solutions that access to voluntary family planning could offer to many of the world's problems. Our goal is not to control the population: It is to empower women and families, giving them a say over when they will bring another child into this world. We know that when a woman can plan the size of her family, she is healthier, more likely to finish her education, join the labor force, become more economically productive and engage in politics, thus more effectively shaping the future of her family and her country. We also know that when governments invest simultaneously in voluntary family planning, public health and education, countries can benefit from the ""demographic dividend"" seen in the Asian Tiger countries. Frustratingly, instead of recognizing these links, Rio negotiators so far have sidelined them. Every second, every day, every year we fail to address demand for reproductive health and family planning services. Lives are lost and girls' opportunities to thrive and contribute to their country's development shrink. These are real people. We know that universal access to voluntary family planning services would prevent 150,000 maternal deaths and 25 million abortions every year. This is an issue all governments and negotiators should agree upon if we are serious about sustainable development. Today, opposition to voluntary family planning can only be attributed at best to outdated thinking, and at worst to a desire to undermine women's rights. If the motto of the Rio conference is to be realized, that is, to build ""the future we want,"" leaders must step up and call for universal access to reproductive health and voluntary family planning for women everywhere who are denied this right. Consider the wider benefits to our planet. Providing women with the desired cost-effective, low-tech family planning services would not only dramatically reduce pressure on natural resources, increase supplies of food and water, decrease the risk of conflict over other scarce resources and improve ecological health, but scientists estimate such services would cut carbon emissions by up to one-quarter of what's needed to slow climate change -- an outcome equal to ending deforestation around the world, or increasing 40-fold our reliance on wind power. My 15 colleagues and I on the Global Leaders Council for Reproductive Health, most of us former national leaders, call on our fellow leaders and negotiators not to ignore the elephant in the room. They must find the political will to make reproductive health fundamental to implementing sustainable development as a major outcome at Rio. At stake are the very goals the conference is meant to embrace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jenny Shipley.","Jenny Shipley: Rio summit on sustainable development must address population growth .

"(CNN) -- Embarrassing defeats, criticism from fans and former players, a major health scare for its long-serving chairman -- Arsenal's season is not getting any easier. The English Premier League club's stalwart figurehead Peter Hill-Wood is recovering in hospital after suffering a heart attack the day before Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at home to Swansea. It left the 13-time English champions 10th in the 20-team EPL after 15 games, continuing Arsenal's worst start to a season since 1994. Hill-Wood had been suffering pneumonia and was taken ill at home on Friday, the London side's website reported on Sunday. ""He is making a good recovery. The club wishes Peter a full and speedy return to health and our thoughts are with him and his family at this time,"" read a statement on Arsenal.com. The 76-year-old has been Arsenal's chairman since 1982, following in the footsteps of his father Denis and his grandfather Samuel, who twice held the role in spells between 1929 and 1949. ""Even if u are not a fan of #Peter Hill-Wood ... wishing him full recovery. He & his family gave so much to #Arsenal in the past!"" one Arsenal supporter wrote on Twitter. Manager Arsene Wenger and the club's board are coming under increasing criticism from fans, who are unhappy that top players such as Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas have been allowed to leave in recent years. Emmanuel Eboue, who was sold to Turkish side Galatasaray last season, also made his feelings known on Twitter after the Swansea defeat . ""Why have we destroyed the club we love so much. The set of players we have now are like chicken fillet. #Arsenal board have abused the fans,"" the Ivory Coast international said. ""Some of the players need to be stoned off the pitch. No brain, no passion, no soul. The Arsenal glory days are fading fast. We need help. ""The only way to put pressure on the board is by fans not coming to the stadium. Low revenue would worry the board and put pressure on boss."" One of the club's celebrity fans, CNN's Piers Morgan, also had harsh words for Wenger -- the club's longest serving manager, with 11 trophies since he joined in 1996 but none since 2005. ""That was the single worst performance of Wenger's reign. It's over -- he must go before he wrecks his great legacy,"" Morgan wrote on Twitter, where he has set up the hashtag #WengerOut. ""Wenger must go, for his sake and for the club's."" Wenger's team have already qualified for the last 16 of the European Champions League, but the Frenchman is looking for a morale-boosting result in Tuesday's final Group B game away to Greek side Olympiakos. ""It's important for us. Away from home, I'm not too concerned,"" the 63-year-old said. ""We look like we play a little bit with the handbrake at home. It's not fluent. There might be a psychological component in there as well. ""At home we have not produced the performances since the beginning of the season that you would expect from us, and that is where we have to find the solution."" Arsenal announced last month that major sponsor Emirates had agreed a new $240 million deal until 2019 for shirt rights and 2028 for stadium naming, but that money will not be available for Wenger to bolster his squad until midway through next year. When asked if he had plans to make major signings in the January transfer window, Wenger kept his cards close to his chest. ""I believe the support from the board is there to spend the money if we find the players,"" he said. Another manager under pressure is Martin O'Neill, whose Sunderland team remained just a point above the relegation zone after losing 2-1 to Norwich in Sunday's only Premier League fixture. The former Aston Villa, Celtic and Leicester boss, who was a European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest as a player, was frustrated after the result left his side with just two wins from 14 games. ""We started off very tentatively -- the first goal we conceded was poor and the second was even worse,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""We should have taken something from the game. It's very frustrating to come away with nothing.""","Arsenal chairman recovering in hospital after suffering a heart attack on Friday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Hypocritical. Contemptible. Dishonest. ""Obamaloney."" The rhetoric, charges and counter-charges flew fast and thick Tuesday as the presidential election campaign continued on its sharply negative trajectory. New advertisements by each side prompted caustic responses from the other as name-calling and finger-pointing dominated the debate less than three months before the November vote that pits President Barack Obama against certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney. A day after Obama coined the phrase ""Romneyhood"" to describe policies by Romney that Obama said tax the poor to help the rich -- or Robin Hood in reverse -- Romney fired back by creating his own word -- Obamaloney -- to accuse the president of making things up. ""He is serving up a dish that is in contradiction to the truth,"" Romney told Fox News. Meanwhile, a Romney ad that began airing Tuesday accused Obama of seeking to undermine work requirements in a bipartisan welfare reform law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. White House spokesman Jay Carney rejected the claim, telling reporters that the ad was ""categorically false"" and ""blatantly dishonest."" ""This administration's policy will strengthen the (welfare) program by giving states the opportunity to employ more effective ways,"" Carney said. Learning from Teddy Roosevelt . Following a weekend imbroglio over Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's claim that a former Romney associate told him Romney paid no taxes in past years, the campaign has veered into a political mud pile that emphasizes dirtying the opponent first. The tactics are part of the big-picture efforts by both sides to frame the election in terms favorable to their man. For Romney, that means portraying Obama as a failed president unworthy of a second term. For Obama, that means depicting the former Massachusetts governor as a champion of the wealthy class and special interests. Reid's unsubstantiated claim, based on an unidentified source, was intended to keep alive the push by Democrats to force Romney to release more of his past tax returns than the two years disclosed so far -- his 2010 filing and an estimate for 2011. Romney says he will make public the final version of last year's return. Democrats know that whatever any additional returns show, they can highlight the details of tax breaks and other accounting maneuvers by the multimillionaire Romney to bolster the perception they seek to exploit that he represents society's fat cats. Republicans responded by attacking Reid's credibility, and by extension, the president's also. Reid's tax attack puts GOP in a bind . Romney called on Reid to disclose his source or shut up, insisting he paid lots of taxes in past years, while top party spokesmen and surrogates called Reid a liar and said he was carrying out the attack at the request of the White House. Obama advisers, benefiting from the continued focus on the matter, denied they were behind Reid's push. ""There is a way to resolve this dispute ... which is for the governor to follow a tradition that was established by his own father many years ago of presidential candidates releasing multiple years of his tax return,"" White House spokesman Carney chimed in Tuesday. Carney referred to the decision by George Romney, the former Michigan governor who released 12 years of his tax returns when running for president in 1968. Mitt Romney says he has complied with the law and won't release any further returns that would only get distorted by Democratic attackers. Why political conventions still matter . Earlier Tuesday, a Romney ad on welfare changes by the Obama administration claimed they would ""gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements."" ""Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check,"" the announcer says. ""And welfare-to-work goes back to being plain old welfare."" The changes, which would allow states greater flexibility in administering their welfare-to-work programs, were in a directive issued last month by the Department of Health and Human Services. At the time, some Republicans claimed the new rules amounted to a ""gutting"" of work requirements for welfare recipients, which were a central element of the bipartisan welfare reform law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. The fact-checking website PolitiFact.com said Tuesday that the Romney ad distorted the intent of the welfare changes and gave it its harshest ruling of ""Pants on Fire."" In addition, Clinton issued a statement saying the Romney ad was wrong. Carney responded with unusually strong language at his daily briefing. ""This advertisement is categorically false and it is blatantly dishonest,"" Carney said. ""This administration's policy will strengthen the program by giving states the opportunity to employ more effective ways."" He also called Republican criticism of the changes ""hypocrisy,"" pointing to past support from Republican governors -- including Romney -- for waivers to the federal requirements. In addition, Carney said, Republican governors in Nevada and Utah already are seeking waivers under the administration's program. Obama's re-election campaign, meanwhile, accused Romney of ""not telling the truth."" ""The truth is that the president is giving states additional flexibility only if they move more people from welfare to work - not fewer,"" Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a statement. "" ... By falsely attacking a policy that both he and his Republican allies have supported for years, Romney is once again flip-flopping on a position he took in Massachusetts, and demonstrating that he lacks the core strength and principles the nation needs in a president."" Wilson: Who's behind threat to cut defense? Romney campaign Policy Director Lanhee Chen insisted that Romney has remained consistent in supporting work requirements for welfare recipients. Chen's statement said that as Massachusetts governor, ""Romney vetoed efforts to weaken work requirements and he pressed repeatedly to instead strengthen them and bring them in line with federal standards."" Also Tuesday, a super-PAC supportive of Obama released a new ad tying Romney to the death of a former GST Steel worker's wife after her husband lost his job when the plant closed down. Romney's former private equity firm, Bain Capital, acquired GST Steel in 1993, but the company went bankrupt in 2001, two years after Romney ceased day-to-day oversight of Bain. The ad by Priorities USA Action features Joe Soptic, a former worker at the Kansas City-based steel plant, as he tells the story of how he lost health insurance benefits when the plant shuttered. He then says his wife passed away from cancer after that. Soptic's wife died in 2006. ""I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he's done to anyone, and furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned,"" Soptic says. Voter ID lawsuits could delay results . Romney's campaign issued a harsh reaction. ""President Obama's allies continue to use discredited and dishonest attacks in a contemptible effort to conceal the administration's deplorable economic record,"" Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said in a statement. Expect more of the same. Last week, CNN reported that Priorities USA Action has reserved $30 million this fall for broadcast and cable time. And on Tuesday, a major fiscal conservative group that has spent tens of millions of dollars on ads critical of Obama revealed it will spend at least $7 million for new spots starting Wednesday in 11 battleground states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Martin: Let all Ohioans vote early . Americans for Prosperity, which is partially funded by the influential Charles and David Koch, said it will rotate different ads and messages over the next three weeks in the campaign that could cost as much as $27 million. The billionaire Koch brothers are high-profile figures in the Republican Party who support conservative and libertarian causes. Backers of Americans for Prosperity, the pair of industrialists are expected to spend tens -- if not hundreds -- of millions on Republican causes this year. CNN's Dana Bash, Ashley Killough, Kevin Liptak, Paul Steinhauser and Alex Mooney contributed to this report.","Campaigns and supporters of President Obama, Mitt Romney trade caustic barbs .

"(EW.com) -- The ""Cougar Town"" team kicked off the winter Television Critics Association press tour by serving mimosas to a ballroom of bleary-eyed critics. Sure it's only 9 a.m., but this is the alkie-friendly Cougar Town on stage so let the party begin. Here's six notable quotables from the panel, with the Cougar Town team pledging Courteney Cox cleavage, some barechested Josh Hopkins and a ""naked day"" episode. -- Co-creator Bill Lawrence expressed more appreciation for TBS rescuing the show for a fourth season, along with some playful knocks on his former network ABC.

""Go to New York and you'll see the [ABC] Don't Trust the Bâ€” posters they're right next to ours."" -- Lawrence and the cast repeatedly emphasized that fans shouldn't notice any difference in the show compared to previous seasons. ""I want them to notice no difference,"" Lawrence says. EXCEPT... ""One difference is Courteney did declare this year the year of her cleavage,"" he says. Adds Cox: ""You will not see one scene where I don't show my boobs."" Lawrence also joked, ""the big difference is we've shifted from Brian Van Holt not wearing his shirt all the time to Josh Hopkins not wearing his shirt all the time.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge threw out Lance Armstrong's lawsuit against the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency with great force and speed Monday, blasting the seven-time Tour de France champion in a sharply worded ruling. Armstrong filed the case Monday morning in his hometown of Austin, Texas, in a bid to halt a doping case against him. In his brief order, U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks wrote that the case was full of legally irrelevant claims ""included solely to increase media coverage of this case"" and stir up hostility toward the USADA. ""This court is not inclined to indulge Armstrong's desire for publicity, self-aggrandizement, or vilification of defendants, by sifting through 80 mostly unnecessary pages in search of the few kernels of factual material relevant to his claims,"" Sparks wrote. He urged the cyclist to re-file his lawsuit without ""any improper argument, rhetoric, or irrelevant material."" ""Contrary to Armstrong's apparent belief, pleadings filed in the United States District Courts are not press releases, internet blogs or pieces of investigative journalism,"" the judge added in a footnote. ""All parties, and their lawyers, are expected to comply with the rules of this court, and face potential sanctions if they do not."" French Tour de France cyclist arrested . In a statement issued late Monday, Armstrong lawyer Tim Herman said he would ""conform my conduct precisely"" to the judge's order. ""When Judge Sparks speaks, I listen,"" Herman said. ""It doesn't change the legal issues involved or any of the relief that we seek."" Mark Fabiani, another Armstrong attorney, said the suit could be re-filed as early as Tuesday. The USADA has accused Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs. The 40-year-old cyclist, who is now competing in triathlons, had asked the court to file an injunction against the USADA by Saturday, the agency's deadline for Armstrong to either contest the charges or accept sanctions. Armstrong maintains he has never tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs and said the USADA and its CEO, Travis Tygart, are out to get a ""big fish"" to justify the agency's existence. ""Defendants have charged Mr. Armstrong with unspecified doping violations and seek to try him through USADA's self-created, self-regulated and self-operated process that it has rigged to ensure that it cannot lose,"" the lawsuit says. ""USADA's kangaroo court proceeding would violate due process even if USADA had jurisdiction to pursue its charges against Mr. Armstrong."" In June, the agency announced that it was opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. In a statement issued in response to the lawsuit, Tygart said the agency ""was built by athletes on the principles of fairness and integrity."" ""Like previous lawsuits aimed at concealing the truth, this lawsuit is without merit and we are confident the courts will continue to uphold the established rules, which provide full constitutional due process and are designed to protect the rights of clean athletes and the integrity of sport,"" he said. The 40-year-old Armstrong has said the Union Cycliste Internationale, the international governing body of cycling, is the ""only organization permitted to assess the evidence."" He said he has taken at least 500 drug tests in his cycling career without failing one. Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong . Armstrong faces a lifetime ban and could be stripped of his Tour de France victories if found guilty by the USADA. Armstrong won the Tour each year from 1999 to 2005, most of those for a team sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service. He retired twice from cycling, -- first in 2005, for four years, and again in 2011. The USADA is a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. In a June letter to Armstrong, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the agency said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were ""fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions."" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles. The letter accused Armstrong and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011. If there is a hearing, riders will testify that Armstrong used EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone and masking agents, and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005, according to the letter. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting in May 2011, in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton, who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself, says he first saw Armstrong use EPO in 1999. ""I saw it in his refrigerator,"" Hamilton told the news program. ""I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times."" In February, Justice Department prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong has won two half-distance Ironman events this year, and he is suspended from World Triathlon Corporation competitions. The world championships will be held in October in Hawaii. He was a U.S. triathlon champion as a teenager. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","""When Judge Sparks speaks, I listen,"" Armstrong lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Walk into Lisa Nasser's kitchen most evenings and you're greeted by rich aromas that indicate an exceptional cook is at work on a delicious creation. Colleen Doyle, editor of the ""What to Eat During Cancer Treatment"" cookbook, prepares tuna-bean salad. Cooking is Nasser's passion, but she left the kitchen and the cooking to others for six months in 2006 when she, like her mother before her, learned she had breast cancer. Numerous rounds of chemotherapy left her spent. ""I didn't have the energy to go shopping, bring in the food, prepare the food. I needed to rest, to sleep,"" she recalls. Nasser's experience isn't unique. According to the American Cancer Society, more than a million Americans will undergo cancer treatment this year. For cancer patients, nutrition is especially important, but many find that they are too tired to cook, or the food tastes bad, or they are too nauseated to eat, or they have painful mouth sores -- or all of the above. To coincide with National Breast Cancer Awareness month in October, the American Cancer Society has released a cookbook called ""What to Eat During Cancer Treatment."" Colleen Doyle, registered dietitian and editor of the cookbook, says the book is full of recipes and eating strategies that patients with all types of cancer can adopt to help deal with the unpleasant side effects of treatment. Chemotherapy, radiation and drug therapies often leave patients with nausea, diarrhea, constipation, mouth sores, taste alterations and unintentional weight loss. ""One of the things we did was organize recipes by the symptoms that they might be experiencing,"" Doyle says. ""A lot of cancer patients going through chemo -- no surprise -- feel nauseous around those times when they are getting chemo. And so we talk to them about eating foods that are kind of bland; think about avoiding really spicy foods, any kind of Mexican foods, things with lots of flavors, things with lots of herbs and spices.""  See recipe samples from the cookbook » . That certainly was the case with Nasser. ""I wanted pasta or rice dishes, anything that was bland,"" she says. Doyle says it's also helpful to eat small frequent meals when battling nausea and to recognize that for some, the odor of cooking foods can be unsettling for the stomach. ""If you have somebody who cooks meals for you, it might be helpful for you to be in a totally different part of the house when they're cooking if you're going through a period where the smell of food really bothers you,"" says Doyle. Nasser was fortunate enough to have friends and neighbors deliver meals to her house. Once her nausea started to subside she was able to be more adventurous in what she ate. ""I remember calling a friend saying I wanted grape leaves. I remember wanting that tart lemony flavor and only hers were going to do it,"" she recalls.  Watch Doyle cook in the kitchen » . It turns out that tart, strong flavors help with another nagging symptom of cancer therapy: altered taste perception. Like Nasser, some patients experience a metallic taste that will not go away. For others, food might seem tasteless, as if the taste buds have stopped working. For those problems, the cookbook offers recipes like tuna-bean salad that help wake up the taste buds and mask the metallic taste. ""This dish is full of lots of different flavors: strong flavors in the red peppers, the onion, the celery and the tuna itself. ... It also has a real tangy vinaigrette that can help kind of [push] that flavor quotient up a bit,"" says Doyle. Doyle also suggests marinating meats in Italian salad dressings, or mustard or barbecue sauce, and trying strongly flavored foods such as cranberries, sauerkraut or pickled vegetables. Cooking with glass pans instead of metallic cookware and using plastic utensils instead of silverware might also make a difference. Patients undergoing cancer treatment can also suffer bouts of constipation or diarrhea. One of the best strategies to ease constipation -- a common side effect of chemotherapy, anti-nausea and pain medications -- is to eat foods high in fiber, such as vegetables, fruits (including dried fruit like prunes, raisins or apricots), beans and nuts. What if diarrhea is a problem? ""There's a real concern about becoming dehydrated. So be sure you're drinking plenty of fluids and that those fluids don't have caffeine,"" says Doyle. Broths, diluted juices, sports drinks -- even Popsicles or gelatin -- can help get some liquid into the system. Foods such as applesauce, rice and bananas can help slow down the digestive tract, as can oatmeal and canned peaches or pears. Avoid greasy, fried or very sugary foods because they can be irritants. Thanksgiving marks four years since Nasser's days of chemotherapy drips and intravenous needles. Her health today is excellent and neighbors are once again making excuses to stop by during dinnertime in order to bask in the inviting aromas and sample the rich sauces bubbling up from deep pots on her stove top. Nasser, who didn't have the benefit of the cookbook when she was sick,  hopes to use her copy only as inspiration and not as a tool for providing relief from the side effects of cancer treatment. ""Hopefully I won't need it for that. And if I do, I'll now know what to do,"" she says.","For cancer patients, nutrition is important, but many have a hard time eating .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just hours after taking office, the new House of Representatives reinstated a team of ethics investigators that had faced what seemed like a certain death due to lawmakers' inaction. Overshadowed by the recent fiscal cliff hubbub, lawmakers from the last session had neglected to decide whether or not to renew the Office of Congressional Ethics. Last week, CNN reported on the concerns among public interests groups that lawmakers were purposely trying to kill the OCE through their inaction to avoid future ethics investigations. The House on Thursday night voted in new rules to reauthorize the OCE, and also added language that would allow members -- whose terms were set to expire -- to continue on the board. The OCE is considered to be one of the most important watchdogs in Washington. It's the only quasi-independent government body that's sole mandate is to formally investigate members of Congress. It was formed just four years ago when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others declared they wanted to ""drain the swamp"" of scandals and corruption in Washington. Among the biggest scandals that prompted action was that of Jack Abramoff, a former lobbyist, who admitted in 2006 to illegally showering gifts on officials in exchange for favors. The probe into those allegations led to convictions or guilty pleas for 20 lobbyists and public officials -- including a member of the House and several aides to congressmen. Other scandals included those tied to former Reps. Tom DeLay, Mark Foley, William Jefferson and Duke Cunningham. Since its creation in 2008, the OCE has launched more than 100 investigations of lawmakers, raising serious questions about possible congressional misdeeds. In about one third of its investigations, the OCE found that House ethics, and sometimes federal laws, were likely violated. Those 37 cases were referred to the House Ethics Committee for further review. House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic leader Pelosi had previously said they would reauthorize the OCE and appoint new members. But the issue was recently overshadowed by the down-to-the-wire fiscal cliff negotiations. In many of its hard-hitting investigations, the OCE has confronted legislators about their actions, raising sensitive questions about possible conflicts of interest, financial reports, missing financial information, and even questions about the legality of some lawmakers' actions. There are other watchdogs for ethics within the Congress -- the House Ethics Committee, and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics. But these internal committees are often criticized for doing almost nothing because they are in the awkward position of investigating their own members and close colleagues. By contrast, the OCE is an outside body, widely seen as being objective. It is made up of experts, including some former members of Congress, who are nominated and approved by Boehner and Pelosi. However, the OCE cannot take disciplinary action against the lawmakers it finds are likely to have violated ethics or federal law -- so it has to refer its most serious investigations to the House Ethics Committee. Out of the 37 cases it received from the OCE, the House Ethics Committee meted out formal punishment only on two occasions. Supporters of the OCE say it has helped put a spotlight on lawmakers' conduct. ""The OCE has forced members of Congress to take ethics more seriously,"" said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who now directs Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). ""It has forced the (House) Ethics Committee to act and has let all members of Congress know that they're not going to be able to skate by like they have for so many years, with unethical conduct just going on."" But critics say it sometimes casts too wide of a net in its investigations. ""They accept anonymous complaints made by anonymous individuals and then have the resources to conduct an investigation which can become a fishing expedition,"" said Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia. Rep. Brad Miller, D-North Carolina said he believes there should be a way for the American public to raise issues about the conduct of their representatives in Washington. But, he added, ""Some of what the OCE has sent to the Ethics Committee was actually really flimsy. I mean, conduct that if you have any idea what the real world is like, you would know was not ethically questionable or if it is, everything that happens in politics is ethically questionable."" And if the accusation is referred to the Ethics Committee, Miller said that's ""like torture"" for lawmakers. ""It's like being charged with a crime,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Rep. David Wu of Oregon will not seek re-election and ""is considering all options"" regarding whether to serve out the rest of his term, Wu's communications director told CNN Monday. ""He (Wu) will consider those options and make a decision in due course,"" said Erik Dorey, declining to elaborate on a possible time frame. Wu, facing mounting calls for his resignation, gave no indication Monday that he planned to step down. A spokeswoman in his Portland office refused to comment on alleged sexual advances toward an 18-year-old or discuss the congressman's future. On Friday, the Oregonian newspaper reported that the daughter of a fund-raiser of Wu's accused him in May of unwanted sexual advances that allegedly occurred in November. Citing anonymous sources from inside the congressman's office, the Oregonian said the woman, who the paper declined to name, left a voice-mail message at Wu's Portland office alleging aggressive advances by Wu. According to the newspaper, the woman was 18 when the alleged incident, which was never reported to police, took place. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi is asking for an ethics investigation of Wu, a seven-term congressman and a Democrat. ""With deep disappointment and sadness about this situation, I hope that the Ethics Committee will take up this matter. I will send a letter to the Ethics Committee tomorrow asking them to formally initiate a review of this matter,"" Pelosi said in a statement Sunday. Meanwhile Wu said in a written statement given to CNN, ""This is very serious, and I have absolutely no desire to bring unwanted publicity, attention or stress to a young woman and her family."" In Wu's home state, Republicans and some of Wu's fellow Democrats responded to the allegations by calling for him to resign. ""Our stance and the stance of all Oregonians is that David Wu should step down,"" Allen Alley, the chairman of the Republican Party of Oregon, told CNN. ""We need a representative on their 'A-game' and David obviously is not."" Oregon Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian, a Democrat, said in a statement, ""David Wu should do the right thing and step aside now."" Avakian had previously announced plans to run against Wu when he is up for re-election next year. David Robinson, who lost against Wu in the Democratic primary last year, said he was pushing for the Democratic Party of Washington County to approve a vote of no confidence for Wu in a meeting on Wednesday. ""I have been e-mailing and calling all day and believe we have the votes to pass it,"" Robinson said. He acknowledged it was not clear that Wu would step down even if the county Democratic Party called for him to do so. Wu has faced and weathered allegations of impropriety before. In February, the Oregonian reported that shortly before his re-election in November 2010, Wu was confronted by campaign staff over his erratic behavior and use of medication. At the time the staffers tried and failed to have Wu seek hospitalization, the newspaper reported. ""To address my behavior and its consequences, I sought professional medical care and continue to obtain professional help from my doctor,"" Wu later said in a statement. ""I fully acknowledge that I could have dealt with these difficult circumstances better, and I remain focused on being a good father to my children and a strong representative for the people of Oregon.""

"New York (CNN) -- In the Ultimate Universe of Marvel Comics, Peter Parker -- the original alter ego of Spider-Man -- is dead, and his replacement is a half-African-American, half-Latino teenager named Miles Morales. Wednesday, a new book -- Ultimate Comics Fallout #4 -- debuts, and the world will get to see the new web-slinging super hero. The book will be a glimpse into the Ultimate Comics universe after Peter Parker, when a new, multi-racial Spider-Man arrives on the scene. ""He swings into action, kicks butt, and when he pulls back his mask, there is another face there,"" said Axel Alonso, editor in chief of Marvel Comics. ""When the opportunity arose to create a new Spider-Man, we knew it had to be a character that represents the diversity -- in background and experience -- of the 21st century,"" Alonso said. ""We have a president of mixed heritage; in fact, I'm of mixed heritage, this is just the world we live in,"" he continued. With Spider-Man one of Marvel's most iconic super heroes, the simple fact that Peter Parker will no longer be the man in the Spider-Man costume will be enough to turn heads, regardless of his ethnic background. ""The key thing is (that) the 'wow' factor goes without saying,"" Alonso said, but he believes Miles Morales will be loveable and recognizable to long-time fans of Spider-Man, as well as relatable to a whole new demographic of readers. ""Miles is on the same journey of self discovery (as Peter Parker), he's nerdy, is good at math, and lives with his parents in Brooklyn,"" he said. Peter Parker, a white orphan from Queens, died in Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #160 fighting his arch-enemy, Green Goblin. ""He died a hero, he died fulfilled,"" Alonso said. ""He's really dead too, not come-back-to-life dead,"" he added, referring to the occasional propensity in the comic-book genre for reviving supposedly dead characters. Ultimate Comics Fallout #4 will only be a preview of the new Spider-Man, according to Alonso. He will be the main character of a new series called Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #1, which debuts in September, Alonso told CNN. He said this new series will explain how Miles Morales took over for Peter Parker, introduce his family, and let the reader get to know him better as a character. iReport: ""I'm not feeling a Black/Latino Spider-Man"" Spider-Man is one of Marvel's most recognized heroes around the globe, according to Alonso. He first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962, created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. Since then, Spidey, as he is often called, has appeared in several animated and live-action television shows. Spider-Man comic strips have appeared in syndicated newspaper comic strips and many films for the big screen. Marvel released the first Ultimate Marvel imprint of comic books in 2000. The Ultimate imprint is an alternate world from Marvel's regular universe, where Parker is still alive and fighting. ""The Ultimate Universe is known for its aesthetic and its attitude,"" Alonso said. ""It is responsible for a lot of comic book innovation.""","A new Spider-Man debuts Wednesday with Ultimate Comics Fallout #4 .

"(CNN) -- A Royal Dutch Shell oil-drilling barge that ran aground last week off southern Alaska arrived at a harbor Monday with no sign of any fuel leaks, an incident-response team reported. The 266-foot-diameter Kulluk arrived at Kiliuda Bay, off Alaska's Kokiak Island, about 10 a.m. (2 p.m. ET) after being towed some 45 nautical miles in the previous 12 hours, according to the team, which includes representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell, the state of Alaska and the Kodiak Island government. The rig will remain in the harbor and connected to support vessels while it is assessed, the team said. Salvage crews refloated the 266-foot-diameter Kulluk on Sunday night and began towing it a few hours later, according to the incident response team. The rig ran aground off uninhabited Sitkalidak Island, about 200 miles south of Anchorage, after tug crews towing it had to cut it loose on December 31 during a storm that whipped up 24-foot waves. The Coast Guard had evacuated the rig the previous day amid a severe storm as it was being towed back to its winter home in Seattle. The rig had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope. As much as 150,000 gallons of ultra-low sulfur diesel and about 12,000 gallons of other petroleum products are on board the Kulluk, a double-hulled steel vessel with a helicopter landing pad and tower in the middle designed for drilling in Arctic waters. Infrared cameras on a boat accompanying the rig as it was being towed detected no signs of leakage early Monday, according to the unified incident response command, which includes the Coast Guard, Alaska's state environmental conservation department, a drilling company and Kodiak Island officials. Earlier assessments also indicated the rig was in good condition and posed no environmental hazard. While it was being towed, the Kulluk was accompanied by a Coast Guard cutter and two oil-spill response ships, the incident response team said. ""Monitoring by the oil spill response vessels escorting the tow confirmed that there were no signs of a discharge of oil during the transit,"" the team said in a news release. Shell's Arctic exploration plans caused widespread concern among environmentalists and were held up after BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the BP well that erupted off Louisiana, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling in the North Slope area.

"(CNN) -- Even by Bubba Watson's unpredictable standards, his decision to pull out of this month's Players Championship to spend more time with his family is an unusual one. The Masters champion revealed he is skipping one of golf's biggest tournaments -- often referred to as the fifth major, with $9.5 million total prize money -- to spend quality time with wife Angie and their recently adopted two-month-old son. ""I've decided to pull out of the Players. I need to spend more time with Caleb and Angie, plan to take at least a month off. The Players is one of the best weeks of the year but bonding with my son and wife is what it is all about right now,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Sorry to disappoint fans but the Players has one of the best fields all year, tourney is more than fine without me,"" Watson said in another tweet. It seems the prestigious PGA Tour event -- boasting a whopping $1.7 million prize for its winner -- wasn't enough to tear Bubba away from baby. ""I feel blessed and excited that I get to spend quality time with Caleb and Angie in the next few weeks. I am lucky to play golf for a living, it allows me to pick my own schedule,"" he tweeted. Wells Fargo Championship leaderboard . The 33-year-old, who earned the nickname ""Wacky Watson"" for his oddball home videos on YouTube, will miss the Players for the first time since his debut in 2007. The American has missed the cut in three out of five trips to TPC Sawgrass, and recorded his best finish back in 2009 when he tied for 37th. Watson's decision has been backed by the U.S. circuit's governing body. ""We respect Bubba's decision in light of the unique and life-changing circumstances of the past month,"" said PGA Tour executive vice-president of communications Ty Votaw. ""His focus on his family is admirable, as was his decision to honor his commitment to the Zurich Classic of New Orleans as defending champion. We look forward to having him back on the tour soon."" Watson admitted ahead of last month's Zurich Classic that he'd rather be at home than defending his New Orleans title. It has been his only tournament since winning the Masters with a miraculous shot from the woods and onto the green in a playoff against South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen. Fresh from the media whirlwind that surrounded him since winning his first major at Augusta, Bubba failed to live up to the hype, finishing 18th at TPC Louisiana. He decided to miss this week's $6.5 million Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina, where some of golf's biggest names returned to action on Thursday. Former world No. 1 Tiger Woods was tied for 56th after the opening round, having shot one-under-par 71. The American, who won the tournament in 2001, was six shots off the lead shared by his playing partner Webb Simpson. Ryan Moore and Stewart Cink also carded seven-under 65 to be a shot ahead of a group of five players. World No. 2 Rory McIlroy's tactic of taking a long holiday before the tournament did not yield immediate results.

"(CNN) -- Senegal's Demba Ba scored twice on a dream debut as English FA Cup holders Chelsea won 5-1 at Southampton in their third round tie Saturday. Ba was one of the first big signings of the January transfer window and immediately proved his worth after his new side had fallen behind to their English Premier League (EPL) counterparts through an early Jay Rodriguez goal at St Mary's. He equalized as he touched home Juan Mata's shot before Victor Moses made it 2-1 and Branislav Ivanovic headed a third. Ba's second and his team's fourth after an Eden Hazard assist sealed victory, which was rounded off by a penalty from Frank Lampard late on. The FA Cup is football's oldest cup competition, dating back to 1871, and Chelsea have a superb recent record in the competition, winning four of the last six stagings, including a 2-1 win over Liverpool at Wembley to lift the famous trophy last year. Interim manager Rafa Benitez, criticized for resting key players as they lost 1-0- to QPR in midweek, was delighted Ba led the way as they got back on track. ""It is always important for a striker to score goals, but more than just the goals was his contribution for the team,"" Benitez told ITV Sport. Ba's former side Newcastle United became the first high profile team to exit a competition famous for upsets. They were beaten 2-0 at second flight Brighton, who had also put them out last year. Goals in each half from Andrea Orlandi and Will Hoskins put the skids under Alan Pardew's men, who have slipped alarmingly down the EPL in recent weeks and have a lengthy injury list. A sorry afternoon was rounded off when striker and captain Shola Ameobi was sent off for a second yellow card. The other big upsets saw non-league Luton put out second flight Wolves, while Cardiff, who look set for promotion to the EPL, were beaten 2-1 by lowly Macclesfield. EPL leaders Manchester United, the record 11 time winners of the competition, were also close to going out at West Ham in the late kick off. They trailed 2-1 at Upton Park after a pair of headed goals by James Collins, but the prolific Robin van Persie, on as a late substitute, equalized in injury time. The Dutchman converted after a superb crossfield pass from veteran Ryan Giggs. Tom Cleverley put United ahead in the 23rd minute, but new Hammers signing Joe Cole provided two fine crosses for Collins to give the home side the lead. Tottenham Hotspur, among the favorites for the competition, thrashed third flight Coventry 3-0 at White Hart Lane. Spurs were shocked by Coventry in a famous 1987 final, but there was to be no repeat as United States international Clint Dempsey scored twice in the first half. Gareth Bale, returning after suspension, grabbed the other to confirm his fine form for the side managed by former Porto and Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas. EPL champions Manchester City also eased through with a 3-0 home win over Watford. Mario Balotelli, under the spotlight after his training ground tussle with manager Roberto Mancini, came off the bench to set up the third for Marcos Lopes. In Spain, La Liga resumed after a Christmas break and Deportivo La Coruna made a great start under new coach Domingos Paciencia with a 1-0 win over fourth-placed Malaga. A second-half Luis Pizzi strike took the off the bottom of the standings. Leaders Barcelona are in action Sunday. In Serie A, Lazio cut the gap on leaders Juventus to five points with a dramatic 2-1 win over nine-man Cagliari. Abdoulay Konko's 79th minute strike equalized Marco Sau's opener for Cagliari before a late penalty from Antonio Candreva sealed the three points. Cagliari had goalkeeper Michael Agazzi and midfielder Andrea Cossu sent off in the penalty incident.","Demba Ba double as FA Cup holders Chelsea win 5-1 at Southampton .

"(CNN) -- About 130 trained mountain rescuers returned before dawn Sunday to search for a skydiver who went missing three days ago in the mountains east of Seattle, a spokeswoman for the King County Sheriff's Office said. ""We don't know if he's on the ground. We don't know if his parachute deployed, and he's stuck up in a tree somewhere,"" Sgt. Cindy West said. Sunday's search began at 5 a.m., she said. Kurt Ruppert, of Lake City, Florida, was reported missing Thursday by two friends after he failed to show up at a landing zone, authorities said. Ruppert was making his second jump from a helicopter above Washington's rugged Cascade Mountains when he went missing, they said. Authorities believe Ruppert jumped from an altitude of about 6,500 feet while wearing a special jumpsuit known as a ""wingsuit,"" which allows a person to soar and glide before deploying a parachute. Searchers used the trajectory of the helicopter and cell phone signals from Ruppert's phone to narrow down the rescue area. Authorities did not say how they determined the cell phone signal, and it was not clear whether he attempted to use it or if authorities were able to track the signal another way. Two friends who shared the price of a helicopter rental with Ruppert did not see whether his parachute opened on his second jump, authorities said. Ruppert was not dressed for enduring Washington's cold overnight climate in the mountains. ""We still consider this a rescue mission,"" West said. ""We realize that it is cold outside. But we are hoping he is alive and his parachute got stuck in a tree or something."" CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Sunday search began at 5 a.m., police say .

"(CNN) -- A small Polish wild horse that was used in Nazi experiments during the 1930s has become the center of wetland regeneration efforts across parts of Europe. The rare Konik breed is one of Poland's least known ecological exports and is believed to be descended from the Tarpan; a prehistoric horse that roamed wild in Europe until the end of the 19th century and whose last known individual died in a Russian zoo in 1909. Marek Borkowski, President of the Białowieża Forest Trust, says the group's breeding program has helped to stock reserves in Britain, France, Germany and the Netherlands with small herds that graze on the woody stems of invasive bushes allowing indigenous growth to re-establish itself -- sometimes after decades and even centuries of agricultural use. ""Once farming stopped in these marshlands, bush began to grow, which limits the habitat for many marshland birds that need the open space,"" says Borkowski. ""The horses graze on the bark and seedlings of these bushes, which limits its growth, allowing the marshland to survive."" Borkowski says that the horses mirror the natural fauna that would have roamed the area in prehistoric times, helping to return land to its pristine condition. ""They are the closest breed to the original wild horse of Europe -- the type we see painted on caves in Spain and France 20,000 years ago,"" he says. ""But because of Neolithic farming they were pushed out of most Europe except for small pockets in Poland, Russia and the Ukraine."" Send in your photos from Poland . In one of the strangest stories of pre-war Poland, the Konik came to the attention of biologists in the 1930s who saw that horses in the Białowieża forest in Poland retained certain features of the Tarpan. Polish biologist Tadeusz Vetulani noticed that semi-wild horses used by peasants in Bialowieza Forest displayed the Tarpan's mousey dun color, their coats turning to white in winter, another Tarpan characteristic. While many regard America's mustang or the Australian brumby as a wild horse, zoologists say that strictly speaking these are really feral domesticated horses. Vetulani launched a re-breeding program, mating horses with strong Tarpan-like characteristics, in an attempt to regain the lost breed of horse. At the same time, the breed came to the attention of Lutz Heck, the director of Berlin Zoo who, along with his brother Heinz, the head of the Munich Zoo, began a re-breeding program. Heck was a committed Nazi and zoologist whose efforts to ""re-breed"" extinct species such as the prehistoric ancestor to the modern cow the Aurochs, received support from senior Nazis such as Hermann Goering. While the re-breeding of extinct species by mating animals of similar characteristics is regarded as impossible by modern science, the Nazis experimented with a program aimed at resurrecting prehistoric animals that reflected Nazi claims to racial purity. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, many of the horses in the breeding program of Vetulani were stolen and brought to Germany. The horses met a grisly end, most probably eaten by a hungry populace, along with many of the animals in Berlin and Munich zoos, in the closing stages of the Second World War. ""The best animals were taken to Germany and we don't know exactly what happened to them. It was only after the Second World War we started from scratch again,"" says Borkowski. ""The Nazis didn't take all the animals,"" he says. ""They didn't know the war would end the way it ended so they only took the best specimens. Later, well of course, they were busy with other things so there were still some horses left."" Bison thrive in primeval Polish forests . John Wilson, the nature warden for Blean Woods at Kent Wildlife Trust, says the Konik -- first introduced to Britain in 1995 -- has been an instant hit with ecologists and conservationists. ""We've currently got them on the site of an old dairy; land which we say has been 'agriculturally improved' with herbicide or fertilizers,"" he says. ""That lush green grass, however, makes it more difficult for the rarer, more specialized plants to flourish and eventually they disappear."" The Konik are perfectly adapted to a variety of harsh environments, from wetlands to open forests, requiring little veterinary care for problems such as hoof rot that might afflict other horse breeds in similarly wet conditions. The grazing is introduced to take the nutrients out of the ground to take it back to a state where it's unimproved,"" says Wilson. ""That takes a lot of time and a lot of grazing."" Green hay from sites where indigenous plants grow is then spread on the site after grazing in the hope that some of the native species will establish themselves in the soil. The horses breed well and flourish without the need for the kind of intervention that so fascinated Nazi scientists, says Wilson. ""The Nazis were very interested in the whole idea of racial purity,"" he adds. ""It seems it didn't just extend to human being, but to beasts as well.""","Rare konik breed of pony revived in Poland and exported across Europe .

"(CNN) -- The state of North Carolina filed an appeal Friday to a judge's ruling that license plates with the words ""Choose Life"" on them are unconstitutional because the state does not offer an alternative for supporters of abortion rights. The state filed its appeal without comment through the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, according to court documents. The action comes less than a month after U.S. District Court Judge James Fox ruled: ""The State's offering a Choose Life license plate in the absence of a pro-choice alternative constitutes viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment."" The ruling was praised by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had filed a lawsuit in 2011 to stop the specialty plates. The ACLU called Friday's appeal ""unfortunate."" ""It's unfortunate that the state has chosen to prolong what is really a very clear-cut First Amendment issue,"" said Chris Brook, legal director of the ACLU's North Carolina Legal Foundation. ""The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has consistently ruled that any time the government creates an avenue for private speech, it cannot restrict that avenue to only one side of a contentious debate."" The bill for the license plates passed in 2011. The legislation also mandated that money raised from the sale of the specialty plates would go to a nonprofit group that supports crisis pregnancy centers, CNN affiliate WRAL reported. During the fight to get the bill passed, North Carolina lawmakers voted down amendments that would have created alternatives for abortion-rights supporters such as ""Trust Women. Respect Choice,"" the affiliate reported. The ""Choose Life"" plates are available in 29 states, according to Choose Life Inc., a nonprofit that helps states that want to sell these specialty plates.

"(CNN) -- Italian prosecutors will press charges against at least one person after racist abuse during a soccer game prompted AC Milan players to walk off the field in the middle of a game. Police and stadium cameras have identified a 20-year-old man and prosecutors expect to identify more people to charges, prosecutor Mirko Monti told CNN. AC Milan's Kevin-Prince Boateng, the main target of the abuse, kicked a ball into the stands, tore his shirt and led his team off the field Thursday in a rare protest against racist behavior by soccer fans. Boateng was one of several black Milan players, along with M'Baye Niang, Urby Emanuelson and Sulley Muntari, who were the targets of racist abuse in the friendly against Pro Patria. Boateng, who was visibly upset by the chanting, picked up the ball and kicked it into the crowd. After the incident, Boateng tweeted: ""Shame that these things still happen... #StopRacismforever."" Fan group calls on team not to sign black players . ""We are disappointed and saddened by what has happened,"" Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri told reporters. ""Milan play for the right to respect all players. We need to stop these uncivilized gestures. ""We are sorry for all the other fans who came here for a beautiful day of sport. ""We promise to return, and we are sorry for the club and players of Pro Patria, but we could not make any other decision. ""I hope it can be an important signal."" Italian Football Association president Giancarlo Abete also hit out at the unsavory scenes and announced an investigation into the incident. Abete said in a statement on the Italian FA website: ""No sanction or measure can erase the disdain for an unspeakable and intolerable episode. ""We must react with force and without silence to isolate the few criminals that transformed a friendly match into an uproar that offends all of Italian football."" Eto'o: We can't wait until a black player gets killed . Boateng is not the first footballer to take a stand over racist abuse. Former Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o threatened to leave the field back in February 2006 after being subjected to racist abuse and pelted with bottles during a game against Real Zaragoza. The Cameroon forward, who now plays for Anzhi Makhachkala, tried to walk off only to be persuaded to remain by then manager Frank Rijkaard. And in 2011, Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos walked off the field after a banana was thrown at him during a Russian league game. Carlos, who was 38 at the time, was playing for Anzhi in the city of Samara in the Caucasus region. The Brazilian is now Anzhi's team director. After picking up the banana, Carlos walked off the field visibly upset before sitting on the bench. This season matches across Europe have been punctuated by repeated outbursts of racism. Ahead of the European Championship finals in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA president Michel Platini had urged players to allow the referee to deal with the problem of racist abuse, and stressed that officials could stop games if necessary. Platini: Referees will deal with racists . ""It is a referee's job to stop the match and he is to do so if there are any problems of this kind,"" said Platini . However UEFA has come under criticism for the punishments it has handed out regarding racist abuse. UEFA appeals Serbia sanctions . In December UEFA appealed the decision of its own disciplinary committee after the Serbian Football Association was fined $105,000 for improper conduct by Europe's governing bogy following allegations of racist abuse during the under-21 game with England. That fine was far less than that handed out to Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner, who was forced to pay $125,800 for exposing boxer shorts with the logo of an online betting company during the European Championship Finals. Last year, Manchester City officials were infuriated after the club was fined $40,000 by UEFA for taking to the pitch late for a Europa League game -- $13,000 more than Porto's sanction for fans' racist abuse during a game against the English team. Milan's squad captain Massimo Ambrosini gave his backing to Boateng's actions, insisting a ""message had to be sent against uncivilized people."" New 'dark age' for English football, or a new dawn? ""I am sorry for all those who were at the stadium but a strong message had to be sent,"" said Ambrosini. ""AC Milan will make an effort to go back to Busto Arsizio especially for the children and for those who have nothing to do with racism but a message had to be sent against such uncivilized people."" AC Milan director Umberto Gandini added on Twitter: ""Very proud of the Milan players who decided to walk off the pitch today for racist abuse from few idiots! No racism, no stupidity!"" Milan returns to league action on Sunday against Siena. Pato . Meanwhile, World Club Cup winners Corinthians has announced it has agreed a $19.6 million deal with Milan for Brazil striker Alexandre Pato. The 23-year-old, who joined Milan in 2007 from Internacional, scored 63 goals for the Italian giant during his five-year stint with the club. But his career has been hampered by injuries in recent years, with the forward managing just 11 appearances last season and seven so far this campaign. ""In the coming days, Pato, who will wear the number seven shirt, will undergo a medical and then sign a four-year contract,"" said a club statement. Milan confirmed the deal on its official website: ""AC Milan can announce that Alexandre Pato has been sold outright to Sporting Club Corinthians Paulista."" In an open letter on the club's website, Pato said: ""I wish to salute and especially thank everyone. From the president to the many people I worked with in these unforgettable years at Milan. ""I am going to Brazil, to Corinthians, so I'll have the opportunity to play consistently. It will not, however, be easy to forget Milan. ""I will always be tied to this jersey, the club colors and all the Rossoneri fans. Above all at this moment my thoughts and my biggest thanks go to them.""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The family of an Indian woman who died after a savage gang rape would like to see a new hospital, named after her, to keep her memory alive. Her brother told CNN by phone from eastern India on Sunday that the family's home village, located in a backward region, still doesn't have a well-equipped health care center. ""It will be really good if our village gets a hospital in her name. That will keep her memory alive and serve a cause,"" said the 20-year-old, who asked not to be named. The young man referred to the victim as ""Didi"" -- Hindi for elder sister. ""Didi loved watching movies,"" he said. ""Talaash,"" meaning ""search"" in Hindi and Urdu, was the last Bollywood film they saw together, on a laptop in New Delhi. The rape victim was the eldest of three siblings, with two younger brothers. A physiotherapy student, she was expecting an internship at a hospital in the Indian capital in January. ""After her internship, she would have got a job. And that would have been a great help to our family,"" said the brother, himself a student. He described his sister as both soft and stern. ""Didi was cheerful. But she would also scold me if I didn't score well in exams. She would correct me if I made any mistakes in studies,"" the brother recounted. The family was still struggling with the traumatic loss, he said. ""My mother is trying to normalize. But my father often breaks down. Her memories haunt us. It's more difficult at night,"" he said. The family also regrets that help came too late when the victim was lying injured along a street after the vicious sexual assault on her on the night of December 16. ""That's the problem in our country. People don't come up quickly to help the injured people or accident victims. Mindsets have to change,"" said the victim's brother. Nonetheless, he felt the protests that the attack sparked were justified. ""You need these protests to bring about a change in laws. And laws should be made so tough that nobody should even think of committing such crimes. Rapists deserve death sentence,"" he said.","A new hospital would keep the victim's memory alive and serve a purpose, her brother says .

"(Financial Times) -- Bull markets in Japan tend not to last long. Over the past two decades, in an environment of low growth and persistent deflation, the best strategy for globally minded investors has been to get in early and then get out again, once the index has risen about 20 per cent. ""Normally we get our moment in the sun once every 18 months,"" chuckles Jesper Koll, head of equity research at JPMorgan, now in his 27th year of tracking the Tokyo market. Last year was a good one, with a rally in early spring and another still in progress, set off by expectations of more aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus under Shinzo Abe, the country's returning prime minister. From the time former premier Yoshihiko Noda called an election in mid-November, to the close of the Tokyo market for the new year holidays, the Nikkei 225 stock average rose by a fifth, outperforming 92 of 94 equity benchmarks around the world. Foreigners led, snapping up a net Y1.8tn ($21bn) of stocks in the six weeks before Christmas. But as the Japanese market reopens on Friday, investors should not necessarily be eyeing the exits, say strategists. While it is too early to judge whether Mr Abe's reflationary policies will be successful, they say, the stage he has set -- featuring a weaker yen and a looser central bank -- should support stocks for a while yet. ""Look around the world,"" says Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo, paraphrasing a recent comment from one of her clients. ""The US still has its fiscal cliff problem, Europe keeps muddling through and China's direction under its new leaders is uncertain."" In that context, ""Japan is the clearest macro game in town"". More inflows from abroad seem likely, say analysts. For one thing, valuations are inexpensive. Of the five cheapest holdings of Global Special Situations, an Investec Asset Management fund which seeks out companies with low enterprise values but strong cash flows, four are Japanese. ""We'd never say this is the start of a multiyear bull run but we do know the stocks we own here still look attractive,"" says Mark Wynne-Jones, the fund's co-manager. The yen is on track to record eight consecutive weeks of losses against the US dollar, which is something it has not achieved since 1989. A weaker currency should improve sales volumes and profit margins for exporters, which have become the primary engine of extremely cyclical growth in the world's third-largest economy. But perhaps the strongest reason for continuing to put on the so-called ""Abe trade"", say analysts, is the desire of the new prime minister to consolidate his hold on power. Last month's victory in the lower-house elections has given the Liberal Democrat party a two-thirds ""supermajority"", in tandem with its alliance partner. However, the coalition is short of a majority in parliament's upper house, where the Democratic Party of Japan still holds sway. If Mr Abe can steer his party to victory in July, when half the upper-house seats are up for grabs, he could, in theory, enjoy an election-free reign stretching out to 2016. For the next six months, Mr Abe's government will be ""using all its political power"" to push stocks up and the currency down, says Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst at SMBC in Singapore. After that, say analysts, gains may be harder to come by. In the absence of real structural reforms to increase Japan's potential growth rate, the market may not take off like it did between 2003 and 2005 under the administration of Junichiro Koizumi, says Ms Matsui of Goldman Sachs. In the past couple of months Japan has been ""a 'close-your-eyes-and-buy' market"", says Sean Darby, chief global strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong, noting that stocks that had been ""priced for technical insolvency"", such as Sharp, have rallied the hardest. But most feel that Mr Abe deserves a little faith. Dean Cashman, a Singapore-based director at Eastspring Investments, the Asian asset management arm of Prudential, has seen 14 prime ministers come and go since the early 1990s. He says he runs his $80m portfolio by focusing on what companies do ""in spite of politics -- not because of it"". But with Mr Abe, ""at least you have a party with an agenda and a fairly clear mandate. If nothing else, this opens the door to a better policy making process."" Jeff Atherton, senior portfolio manager at GLG Partners, which runs one of the biggest Japanese equity funds outside Japan, says it will take months, if not years, to judge the success of Mr Abe's ""great reflation experiment"". But for the time being ""it feels much too early to be too cynical,"" he says. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","The Nikkei 225 has outperformed 92 of 94 equity benchmarks around the world since November .

"(CNN) -- Two Mexican nationals were charged Monday in the death of a U.S. Coast Guardsman, whose succumbed to a traumatic head injury after his boat was rammed off the Southern California coast. The suspects -- Jose Meija-Leyva and Manuel Beltran-Higuera -- are charged with killing a U.S. government officer while that officer was on duty in the death of Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne III, the U.S. attorney's office for the central district of California said in a news release. Neither man was asked to enter a plea when they appeared Monday afternoon in federal court, where Magistrate Judge Victor Kenton ordered them held without bond, U.S. attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek said. A preliminary hearing is set for December 17, and their arraignment is set for December 21. Calls placed Monday evening to the separate attorneys representing the two suspects were not immediately returned. Early Sunday morning, the crew of a Coast Guard patrol aircraft spotted a panga boat near Santa Cruz Island, suspecting ""it was engaged in illegal activity,"" said Capt. James Jenkins. A panga is an engine-powered work boat often used off the coast of Mexico or Central America and is typically 25 feet to 45 feet long, Jenkins said. The aircraft's crew alerted the captain of the Cutter Halibut, an 87-foot patrol boat, which headed to the scene and noticed the panga ""operating with no lights."" A small boat was dispatched from the Halibut, and it headed closer to the suspect vessel. Then, the panga accelerated and slammed into the small boat, forcing Horne and another Coast Guard member overboard. Two Coast Guard colleagues on the same small boat recovered their shipmates, and all four boarded the Halibut as it headed to the nearest port. Having suffered a traumatic head injury, Horne was pronounced dead by emergency medical personnel upon his arrival on shore at Port Hueneme. The other Coast Guardsman tossed overboard was treated at a hospital for ""relatively minor injuries"" and released later Sunday morning, Jenkins said. The panga boat fled. Around 5 a.m. Sunday, about four hours after the initial crash, the panga was located about 20 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the criminal complaint. Coast Guard officers pulled up and ordered the boat's occupants, at gunpoint, to exit the boat. They refused to comply, and the panga raced away. It then stalled, refused further orders, and sped away again, the complaint said. In the third try, a Coast Guard officer pepper-sprayed both men on the panga. That boat's driver was detained after a struggle with Coast Guard officers, while his passenger was ""detained without incident,"" the criminal complaint said. The suspects had entered the United States ""illegally from Mexico,"" according to the document. Meija-Leyva told investigators ""he was taking gasoline to some lost friends north of Los Angeles,"" and Beltran-Higuera said he'd been offered $3,000 to transport gas to a waiting panga boat off the U.S. coast. As for what happened early Sunday, Beltran-Higuera said he heard people yelling ""Stop! Put your hands up!"" then ""a series of gunshots before the Coast Guard vessel collided with the panga,"" the criminal complaint stated.

"(CNN) -- As Hurricane Sandy pushes ashore with top wind speeds of 90 mph, the massive storm has already started walloping residents from Virginia to Massachusetts early Monday, hours before its center is expected to reach shore. The Category 1 hurricane's center is taking aim at southern New Jersey's shoreline and the Delmarva peninsula -- which gets its name from the three states that occupy parts of it: Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. Its center is expected to hit land as early as 8 p.m. ET Monday. Forecasters believe Sandy will collide with a cold front and spawn a ""superstorm"" that could generate flash floods, snowstorms and massive power outages along the Mid-Atlantic coastline, home to some 50 million people. Governors of the states affected are urging residents to take the threat seriously and make sure they are prepared for the worst. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . Here's what residents can expect over the next 24 to 48 hours: . Strong winds . Hurricane-force winds -- stronger than 74 mph -- will pummel the coasts of Delaware, New Jersey and New York state, while tropical-storm-force winds between 39 and 73 mph will stretch from North Carolina all the way to Maine. Likely immediate impact: downed power lines and extensive power outages. Storm surge . Forecasters are warning that an ""extremely dangerous storm surge"" could hit around the same time as high tide, with the highest storm surge along the coasts of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, especially where water funnels into New York Harbor and Long Island Sound. Immediate impact: coastal flooding and beach erosion. Flood-triggering rainfall . Heaviest rainfall of up to 8 to 12 inches will be likely on the Delmarva Peninsula and in New Jersey. Immediate impact: Cities such as Dover, Delaware; Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia could see significant flash flooding. State-by-state preparations . Snow . Extreme snowfalls totaling several feet will be likely in the Appalachian Mountains of West Virginia and to a lesser extent into portions of Pennsylvania and Virginia as well. Flight delays . With major airlines canceling many flights even ahead of the storm, air travel will be extremely difficult for all of the major Northeastern cities, from Washington through Boston both Monday and Tuesday. Impact: The ripple effect on air travel will be felt worldwide as flights arriving and departing will be canceled or severely delayed. Timing . Conditions will be deteriorating along the Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast through the day Monday. Landfall will occur Monday evening into overnight, and storm surge likely will peak around the evening high tide. (Remember Monday's tides are already the largest of the month due to the full moon.) On Tuesday, rain and snow will continue for much of the area, and surf will remain rough as the center of the system slowly drifts northward into Pennsylvania and New York. Delayed impact . Because of the size of this system, the effects will be felt far from the center. For example, large waves and surge will be felt in eastern Canada and along the shores of the eastern Great Lakes. Also, when Sandy transitions from hurricane or tropical storm to ""post-tropical storm,"" it does not mean it has weakened or the threat is any less. Latest updates on Hurricane Sandy . CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","Hurricane Sandy is a Category 1 storm with top winds at 90 mph .

"(CNN) -- A small plane crashed into a home in eastern Florida on Friday, killing all three people aboard, the Florida Highway Patrol said. It happened at 2:22 p.m., 12 minutes after the pilot declared an emergency, saying the plane was severely shaking, the highway patrol said. A middle-aged woman who lived alone in the house dived through a closed window to get out after the plane hit, neighbor Joe McBride, 71, told CNN. The highway patrol said she was taken to the hospital, but they did not have details on her injuries. ""She went right through the glass window,"" McBride said. ""She's banged up, but she's going to be all right."" He added, ""She's lucky to be alive because that house is a wreck."" The Beechcraft BE35 was en route to Knoxville Downtown Island Airport in Tennessee, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta. It wasn't immediately known from where the plane originated. The plane was diverting to Flagler County Airport, near the coast about 30 miles north of Daytona Beach, when it crashed a mile east of the airport, Bergen said. Video from CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 showed white smoke rising from a large, black hole in the one-story house, which is surrounded by trees. Parts of the roof were melted away. ""Because of the steepness of the trees in the area, the tall pine trees, it looks like it was a pretty steep descent and it went right into the roof,"" Lt. Justin Asbury of the highway patrol said. McBride said he was looking outside when the plane passed low overhead not more than 40 feet in the air, he estimated. ""I could look into it, almost,"" he said. The plane was making an odd sound as it passed overhead, as if it was stalling, he said. ""It sounded like the engine wasn't running right at all."" The plane took down all the utility wires on the street, which is in a rural residential area with many retirees. He said it appeared the plane was going in the general direction of the airport, but not directly toward it.

"(CNN) -- Opposition fighters are celebrating success in Syria's north but enduring squalor in and around Damascus, where government forces are cutting off food and medical supplies, a rebel leader said Saturday. Syrian rebels chipped away at President Bashar al-Assad's air power Saturday in Idlib province, where 800 fighters pummeled Taftanaz air base for the fourth day with anti-aircraft guns and tanks. Amid fighting, Al-Assad plans to deliver a speech Sunday on the latest developments in Syria and the region, state news said. Rebels have taken control of 70% of the Taftanaz heliport, rebel leader Capt. Islam Aloush said from Damascus. Militia members killed the head of the base, he said. ""There are still about 30 snipers and a few dozen regime forces, but the fight is closing in on them."" Al-Assad's forces use the base mainly to launch helicopter attacks on nearby towns. Syrian warplanes dropped cluster bombs on Taftanaz in a raid that led to the destruction of several buildings, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said Saturday. Since the rebel push on Taftanaz began, government forces have exacted retribution on the nearby city of Binnish, where amateur video posted on the Internet has shown dozens of smoke plumes marking where ordnance has struck. What's next for Syria in 2013? Aloush said his Liwaa Islam militia and other groups want to target the many military bases in Idlib ""to minimize the reach of the regime's warplanes."" Opposition and government sources report that the extremist al-Nusra Front, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, is taking part in the assault on Taftanaz. As al-Assad has lost some ground in the far north, he has tried to maintain the reach of his firepower by launching long-range Scud missiles at towns near Turkey's border. U.S. troops began arriving Friday to operate Patriot missile defense batteries, deployed to intercept any Scuds that might cross into Turkey from Syria. Farther south in the Damascus suburbs, government forces have been cutting off food and, in particular, medical supplies for weeks, Aloush said. ""They have sometimes resorted to field executions when they find people smuggling in syringes and other basic medical items,"" he said. Rebels depend on the medical supply lines because they have to treat the wounded in safe locations inside the country. It is too difficult to evacuate them from the country, he said. Government forces target bakeries, reducing food supplies, he said, and ammunition and money are dwindling. ""When we are not taking over regime military posts, we are not getting enough ammo to fight the security forces,"" he said. In Syria, school opens to displaced children . Other opposition groups have also reported the government ratcheting up the battle in the capital. In Daraya, south of Damascus, 1,000 of Aloush's men and other revolutionaries are holding out against a weeks-long offensive by the government, which wants to take the town back. ""Daraya is strategically located near very sensitive security buildings and military bases,"" Aloush said. Syria's opposition still feels deserted by the international community. In an open letter Friday, Ahmed Moaz al-Khatib, head of the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, implored the U.N. Security Council and world leaders to take action. ""Our people are subjected to genocide and our country is being destroyed as the international silence is only encouraging the regime to commit more crimes against humanity,"" he wrote. ""Halting massacres in Syria is an international obligation everyone should bear responsibility for."" The overall death toll in Syria has surpassed 60,000 people, the United Nations says. At least 79 people were killed in Syria on Saturday, the LCC said, including 35 in Damascus and its suburbs. Eighteen people were killed in Idlib on Saturday, the group said. CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition reports out of Syria, as the government has restricted access by journalists.","NEW: At least 79 people killed Saturday, opposition group says .

"Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Emergency services and Australian military personnel stepped up the search Friday for dozens of people still missing in Queensland as authorities and residents tried to assess the damage caused by the state's worst flooding in decades. One of the 15 bodies recovered was found 80 kilometers from where the person had been washed away, said Queensland Police Commissioner Bob Atkinson. Some bodies might never be recovered, he said. Floodwaters that carved a muddy trail of destruction through Brisbane, the state capital, have started to recede, but officials warn the cleanup will take months. More than 20,000 homes were inundated after the normally subdued Brisbane River turned into a raging torrent as weeks of rain pushed it to more than 4 meters at high tide early Thursday. Queensland Premier Anna Bligh fought back tears as she described the damage inflicted by the state's ""worst natural disaster in our history."" The search was concentrated to the west of Brisbane, near Toowoomba, which was all but submerged when a wall of water tore through the town on Monday. ""There has to be an expectation of further deaths and further bodies. ... We have to steel ourselves for that terrible outcome,"" said Australian Defence Minister Stephen Smith. Residents in Brisbane were being urged not to enter floodwater because of the risk of illness after sewage plants along the river were inundated. Sightseers were warned to stay clear of the Brisbane River or risk hampering emergency service operations. Some 200 people, including members of the Australian Defence Force, Special Emergency Services and police, searched vast tracts of land and swollen waters for 55 people still missing. Prime Minister Julia Gillard spoke to reporters at Amberley Air Force Base outside Brisbane, where she was preparing to board a plane to tour the area. She said the number of ADF personnel deployed for rescue and cleanup work was being boosted to 1,200. That represents the biggest deployment of ADF personnel for a natural disaster since Cyclone Tracy devastated the northern Australian city of Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974, killing 71 people. Aerial views of Brisbane showed islands of roofs and treetops jutting from a sea of muddy brown water -- or stranded high-rises jutting starkly from murky river overflow. The Brisbane River, which slices through the city, peaked Thursday at 4.6 meters (more than 15 feet), about a meter below predictions and below the level set by the last major flood in 1974. Officials had predicted a crest at 5.2 meters. Bligh said 11,900 homes in Brisbane were fully flooded and 14,700 were partially flooded. In addition, about 2,500 businesses were fully inundated and 2,500 more were partially inundated, she said. Many of them will never again be habitable, she said. ""There's a lot of heartache and grief as people start to see, for the first time, what has happened to their homes and their streets,"" Bligh told ABC News 24. ""In some cases, we have street after street where every home has been inundated to the roof level."" Queensland police have arrested 10 people on 18 charges of looting, Atkinson said. Nine of the incidents were in Brisbane and one in Ipswich. If convicted, offenders could face up to 10 years in prison. Some 600 members of the Australian Defence Force were helping and more were expected, said Bligh. She predicted that Brisbane's Central Business District was ""largely operational,"" and will likely be fully operational next week, when power is expected to be restored to 10 office buildings. The flooding in Brisbane follows flooding elsewhere in the state. Soon after Christmas, water from torrential rains swamped the northern city of Rockhampton, 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Brisbane, triggering a massive recovery operation to rebuild the town. Those floodwaters have been sweeping toward the coasts since then. So far, 70 towns and cities in Queensland have been affected by the flood, Bligh said. Homeowners who had evacuated their properties started returning Thursday to assess the damage. Some rowed out on inflatable boats, surfboards and whatever else they could find. One man was seen walking in the murky water up to his chin. Mark Grant reached his West End property, in central Brisbane, by kayak. ""I've got a couple of thousand dollars worth of surfboards under the house and we'd left the garage door open to avoid structural damage to the house and I wanted to get them before they floated out to sea,"" he said after paddling back to higher ground in his street, which was smeared with mud and littered with flood-damaged furniture. He, his wife and three children abandoned their home on Tuesday evening after the water rose 1 meter inside their garage. By late Thursday, the brown, murky water had risen more than half a meter above the second floor. The depth of the water surprised him. ""We'd been advised by the council that the building height we built at was a meter above the 1974 floods when in fact it's quite a bit below the 1974 floods,"" he said. ""It's only now that we've worked that out."" Farther down the street, Jody Jackson walked down her driveway, where sodden mattresses were piled on a muddy armchair and TV. She and her husband had been staying in the nearby hostel her husband manages, but abandoned it for the main flood evacuation center at the RNA Showgrounds. They were among more than 1,000 people who slept Wednesday night on inflatable mattresses at the center. Numbers are expected to fall in coming days as people find alternative accommodations. ""We've been coming back and forward just to check"" on the hostel, Jackson said. ""It's not as bad as we expected."" But many others weren't so lucky. Elsewhere in the city, floodwater rose to rooftops, submerging houses and creating a logistical and financial headache for homeowners waiting for the water to drop so they could check the damage.

"(CNN) -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic produced a memorable performance after his four-goal salvo helped Sweden defeat England in Stockholm. The 31-year-old, who has scored ten goals in as many games for club side Paris Saint-Germain, was on fire once again as Roy Hodgson's men were swept away. The Swedish skipper had given his side a 20th minute lead before goals from Manchester United's Danny Welbeck and Tottenham's Steven Caulker gave England a half-time. Ibrahimovic arrival marks watershed moment for Paris Saint-Germain . But it was Ibrahimovic who stole the show after the interval, with three strikes in the final 12 minutes. After netting a 78th minute equaliser, Ibrahimovic slammed home a rasping 30-yard free-kick before rounding off his night with a scarcely believable scissors kick. It ruined the night for England captain Steven Gerrard, who had hoped to celebrate his 100th cap with victory. Gerrard told ITV 1: ""I still stick by Zinedine Zidane, he is the best player in the world as the best player of his generation, but his (Ibrahimovic's) performance was world class and he just scored one of the best goals I seen live. ""It was his night. If someone scores four goals and the way he scored them....it's one of the best I've seen."" Hodgson added: ""The fourth goal was extraordinary, but it was the second and third goals which cost us. ""For 70 minutes we were playing very well and we deserved to be in the lead, but we made changes and they took the initiative."" Elsewhere, France recorded an impressive 2-1 victory over Italy after it came from behind in Parma. Milan star Stephan El Shaarway gave the hosts the lead only for France to hit back through Mathieu Valbuena and Bafetimbi Gomis.

Lionel Messi drew a rare blank after Argentina was held to a goalless draw by Saudi Arabia. Despite boasting the likes of Sergio Aguero and Angel Di Maria in their starting line-up, Argentina were unable to make the breakthrough against a stubborn Saudi defence. Mikkel Diskerud scored a late equalizer as the U.S. grabbed a 2-2 draw in Russia. Fyodor Smolov had given the hosts a ninth minute lead before Michael Bradley's fine effort brought the U.S. level. Roman Shirokov looked to have won the contest with an 84th minute penalty but Diskerud fired home late on to ensure the game finished level. Elsewhere, Portugal was held to a 2-2 draw in Gabon, Uruguay defeated Poland 3-1 and Greece claimed a 1-0 win over the Republic of Ireland.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored all four goals in Sweden's 4-2 win over England .

"Port Stanley, Falkland Islands (CNN) -- Britain on Wednesday dismissed a complaint from Argentina about the ""militarization of the South Atlantic"" as tensions rise regarding the Falkland Islands, over which the two countries fought a war 30 years ago. ""The people of the Falkland Islands are British out of choice,"" the British Foreign Office said in a statement. ""They are free to determine their own future, and there will be no negotiations with Argentina on sovereignty unless the Islanders wish it."" It was responding to a warning from Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner that her country would file a protest at the United Nations. ""I have instructed our chancellor to formally present before the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. General Assembly this militarization of the South Atlantic, which implies a great risk for international safety,"" she said during a speech in Buenos Aires. ""We're going to file a protest,"" Fernandez said. No protest had been filed as of Wednesday afternoon, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. Speculation in recent days had been that she would cut the Falklands air link to the South American mainland by banning the airline LAN Chile from using Argentinian airspace to fly to the islands from Chile. The Saturday flights are the only scheduled air service to the Falklands and carry fresh food as well as passengers. The president made no such announcement in her speech Tuesday. Why tensions are flaring over Falklands . Argentina already bans Falklands ships from its ports, an action joined by other South American and Caribbean nations. ""I guess we were all kind of relieved that there wasn't anything particularly concrete. It seems to be another burst of hot air really -- and to that degree -- we're relieved,"" said John Fowler, a journalist and Falkland Islands resident. Britain and Argentina fought a war over the Falkland Islands, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas, in 1982. Though Britain won the war, expelling an Argentinian military force, Argentina claims the territory, which has been under British rule since 1833, as its own. Britain maintains that the 2,500 residents of the Falklands have the right to determine their allegiance, and so far that has been staunchly British. ""The UK has no doubt about our sovereignty over the Falklands. The principle of self-determination, as set out in the U.N. Charter, underlies our position,"" the Foreign Office said. British Prime Minister David Cameron said residents have a right to decide. ""We support the Falklands' right to self-determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently I would argue is actually far more like colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else."" Addressing Cameron directly in her speech, Fernandez said: ""I simply want to ask the prime minister of England to give peace a chance."" Tensions between London and Buenos Aires were raised even higher this month when Britain sent Prince William to the Falklands as a military helicopter pilot. The prince's deployment comes as Britain is making other moves to support its 1,700 personnel at the Mount Pleasant military complex in the Falklands. ""We are having what in game theory is called tit-for-tat ... I don't see an end in sight right now, but I'm sure that war is not the end,"" Federico Merke, a professor of international relations at San Andres University, said after the president's speech. So why, besides supporting the Falklands' inhabitants, does Britain want to hang on to the islands? The answer may lie in the lucrative fishing grounds around the islands as well as a growing oil drilling industry. Argentina, of course, has economic interests as well, but analysts say the current standoff has much to do with internal politics. ""The government is being squeezed from lots of different areas, so one way to distract from the economic problems facing the country is to raise the Malvinas issue,"" said Mark Jones, an expert in Latin American politics at Rice University in Texas. ""It's one of the few issues outside football that you can get universal consensus on."" CNN's David Wilkinson, Dan Rivers, Brad Lendon and Richard Roth contributed to this report.","NEW: A spokesman says Argentina has not yet filed a protest with the United Nations .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- A convicted sex offender won a landmark legal ruling Friday that ordered Facebook to take down a page set up to monitor pedophiles in Northern Ireland. The case was brought in Belfast by a man who had been sentenced to six years in prison for a string of crimes against children more than two decades ago. He claimed he faced being attacked or burned out of his rented accommodation after his photograph and threatening comments were posted on the social networking site. A Belfast High Court judge Friday ruled that some of the contents on the Facebook page -- 'Keeping Our Kids Safe From Predators' -- amounted to harassment of the man and risked infringing on his human rights. The judge said the man -- who can't be identified -- had already been punished for his sex offenses ""in accordance with the rule of law."" The judge added: ""He has been punished by incarceration and he is subject to substantial daily restrictions on his lifestyle."" Facebook removed the man's photograph and corresponding comments, but lawyers for the company argued in court that it was neither necessary nor proportionate to remove a page used by 4,000 people. The sex offender continued to seek the closing of the page and the disclosure of the identity or identities of those who set up and ran it. Facebook was given 72 hours to remove the page, and it was taken down by Friday afternoon.

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- ""Your flight has been delayed due to a mechanical problem"" -- it is something a passenger never really wants to hear especially during Thanksgiving week. More than 24 million passengers are expected to fly in the U.S. during the Thanksgiving holiday which runs from November 16 through the 27. CNN went behind the scenes with maintenance crews at United Airlines at its base in Houston to find out how they work to keep planes flying safe and on time. More than 600 flights will go through Houston this Wednesday alone. Before any flight takes off, a mechanic examines the plane to make sure there is nothing wrong. ""We do just a walk around inspection, then we go upstairs and check the gauges and the log books and if there is anything broken we will fix it at that point,"" United Airlines technician Michael Baumgarten told CNN as he inspected a 737 just arrived from Guatemala. ""We look at all the critical things -- anything at all broken, leaking, worn out. Any problems at all."" 5 digital tips for saner holiday travel . He peers into the engine, sticks his head into the wheel wells and eyeballs the wings. ""After looking at a million of them you will pretty much recognize anything at all out of place,"" he said. When a problem is detected in the air, a pilot can enter details of the issue into the plane's in-flight computer so maintenance can be standing by when it lands to make a quick fix. Often this work can be as simple as a broken in-flight entertainment system or just a seat cushion wet from a spilled drink which can be quickly replaced without causing a delay. If repair work requires a long time, planes are moved to the hangar area. During CNN's visit, the airline's new 787 Dreamliner was there so teams could check out a couple of the systems on a layover. ""We are kind of getting to know it,"" maintenance supervisor Larry Thomson said standing outside the cockpit. ""It's very electronic, a lot more than any airplane we've ever had before. The systems are completely different than any airplane we ever had."" In the passenger compartment, a computer by the door can show technicians on board problems with a simple . ""We could run a test on all the monitors on the airplane and it would tell us if there is a problem,"" Darrell Miller said. He is the manager of United Airlines technical operations and has spent more than 25 years working his way up with Continental and United. ""It has changed a lot from pushing all of the light switches on every light to see if it works,"" he said. Inside the hangar sits a 737 in the midst of a brake job. The airline is installing new carbon fiber brakes which will lighten the load and save the airline money. Don't be a jerk en route to turkey dinner . In a neighboring building, a 757 is partially disassembled and surrounded by scaffolding for a major overhaul. ""They get deep into it,"" Miller pointed out. ""This is probably the highest level of maintenance you would do,"" he said. ""They will open the airplane up, inspect everything, replace a lot of components, lubricate everything and put it back together."" Planes go into the hangar for these massive month-long overhauls every four or five years. ""When these guys get it done, it will be in excellent shape,"" he said. Though much of United's maintenance is done in Houston and San Francisco, there are crews at 45 other airports around the world to work on the airline's planes. In some cases they even have contracts to do work on competitors' aircraft. There are about 8,000 United mechanics worldwide, as well as 2,000 other members of its Tech Ops division, including engineers, maintenance planners and inspectors. Their goal, they say, is to make sure their planes are safe and they get you there on time and this busy holiday season is no different . ""It's the same responsibility as it is every day,"" Baumgarten told CNN. ""Our job doesn't change if a plane is going to go one mile, empty, full -- our job is exactly the same.""

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A grenade explosion killed seven people and wounded another 24 on Sunday in a predominantly Somali neighborhood of Nairobi, a Kenya Red Cross official said. The grenade was tossed onto a minibus, known as a matatu, full of passengers riding through the Eastleigh section, according to local media reports. No group has claimed responsibility for this attack. Such attacks have escalated since Kenyan forces invaded neighboring Somalia last year to battle the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, blaming it for kidnappings of foreigners in the nation. A grenade thrown into a Kenyan church two weeks ago turned a prayer service into carnage, killing one worshipper and wounding 13 others. Witnesses said members of Al-Shabaab were involved, said Nelly Muluka, spokeswoman for the Kenya Red Cross. Seven weeks ago, one child died and several others were hurt in a grenade attack on a children's Sunday school class in Kenya, the Kenya Red Cross said. Kenyan forces are engaged in a fight in SomalIa to debilitate Al-Shabaab. The group once held large territories in Somalia, but has lost significant ground in the past year, including its southern base of Kismayo, which Kenyan forces took in late September.","A grenade was tossed into a crowded minibus, local media reports say .

"(CNN) -- SeaWorld defended itself Sunday from criticism from a family after a dolphin bit their 8-year-old daughter at the Orlando attraction. A video posted online shows the girl standing along the edge of a pool, one of several people feeding dolphins. After she picks up a paper plate that once held the marine mammal's food, a dolphin lunges at her and bites her hand. The dolphin let go after a few seconds, but not before leaving three puncture wounds on the girl's hand. In a statement, SeaWorld spokeswoman Becca Bides said on-site ""educators and animal care staff ... immediately connected with the family. In addition, a member of our health services team was in the area at Dolphin Cove and quickly responded and treated the young girl."" Yet in an interview with CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB, the family at the center of the November 21 incident faulted the central Florida attraction's staff for not warning them the dolphins might bite and for their response after the girl was injured. ""We felt powerless,"" the girl's father, Jamie Thomas, said in explaining their decision to post a video on YouTube. ""We thought, look, we've got this video, let's make it public, and let's try to put some pressure on SeaWorld to make some changes."" The 8-year-old, Jillian Thomas, said she ""accidentally held"" up the paper plate, after which the dolphin ""jumped up and ate the carton and bit my hand."" ""I was thinking it was going to haul me into the water,"" she said. ""And this is a little crazy, but I thought it was ... going to eat my hand off."" Jamie Thomas said those feeding the dolphins were told the paper plate should stay on the wall, ""but we really didn't know why."" No one signed a disclaimer, and there were no signs indicating any risk, the father said. The girl's mother, Amy Thomas, said she was upset about SeaWorld staffers' response. ""They did not tell us to look out for any signs of infection,"" the mother said. ""We had to ask for Band-Aids."" The Thomas family never contacted SeaWorld after leaving the park, Bides said.

"(CNN) -- Iraq took control Friday of billions of dollars in oil revenues set aside by the United Nations following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, money intended to be used build up the country's economy. The U.N. Security Council hand over of the Development Fund for Iraq is considered a milestone for Iraqi autonomy, which comes as the United States prepares to withdraw its roughly 47,000 troops from the country by the end of the year. ""The members of the Security Council welcomed the Government of Iraq's establishment of a successor arrangement for the transition of the Development Fund for Iraq,"" the United Nations said in a statement released Thursday. The fund will be turned over to an Iraqi committee of financial experts that will operate under terms approved by Iraq's Council of Ministers, it said. In the statement, the Security Council reiterated the commitment by Iraq to ""ensure that oil revenue is used in the interests of the Iraqi people, and to ensure that transition arrangements remain consistent with the constitution and with international best practices in respect of transparency, accountability and integrity."" A 2003 Security Council resolution that created the development fund requires 5% of Iraq's oil revenue be used to pay reparations, primarily Kuwaiti claims that arose from the 1991 Gulf War. In December, the Security Council lifted all but a few sanctions put in place prior to the invasion. Among the issues to still be resolved: war reparations to Kuwait, the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwait border and efforts to locate missing Kuwaitis and third-party nationals.","Iraq takes control of a fund established by the U.N. following the invasion .

"Washington (CNN) -- For National Rifle Association Vice President Wayne LaPierre and many other pro-gun Americans, the task is clear: The best way to protect children from becoming victims of a slaughter like the one seen last week in Newtown, Connecticut, is to make sure every school in America has ""qualified armed security."" For President Barack Obama, many Democratic leaders and a slight majority of the American public, the solution starts with tougher legislation on assault weapons, universal background checks and limits on high-capacity magazines, the first steps needed to begin to make it harder to get at the kinds of firearms that kill thousands of Americans each year. Both sides are so vested in intractable arguments that there is little room for political common ground. While both sides share a desire to keep children safe, it's like they are living in two different worlds. On one side, the gun rights advocates argue that a well-armed populace can best defend the innocent. They say that if the teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School were armed -- or if there were armed security at the front door -- fewer lives would have been lost. On the other side, the gun control advocates are fighting to protect lives by limiting access to guns. They say that if the weapons used in the Newtown massacre weren't so readily available -- there are at least 310 million non-military firearms in the U.S. today -- then the 27 people who were murdered might still be alive. ""It's hard for people to come to the table to at least talk about it,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. Why would someone own a military-style rifle? It took the NRA -- the nation's most politically powerful gun lobby that boasts 4.3 million members -- one week and a bizarre press conference-turned-one-way-announcement to do just that. Where some may have hoped for concessions on the NRA's staunch pro-gun, guns-don't-kill-people-people-kill-people stance, the NRA stayed the course, and even doubled down. They offered no willingness to consider any of the proposals offered this week to amend gun laws including limiting access to assault weapons, requiring universal background checks, limiting sales at gun shows and increasing the use of trigger locks. Instead, the group pointed to media sensationalism, violent video games, gun-free zones in schools, the failure to enforce gun laws already on the books, issues with the nation's mental health system and other societal problems as feeding the spate of gun violence. NRA clear on gun debate stance: arm schools . They then announced a new national program to train and arm thousands of armed security to be stationed at each of the nation's nearly 100,000 public and 33,000 private schools. They point to the fact that Sandy Hook Elementary School -- and most other schools in America -- are considered gun-free zones as a reason why it was easily attacked. Policies banning guns at schools create a place that ""insane killers"" consider ""the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,"" LaPierre, said Friday. LaPierre said U.S. society has left children ""utterly defenseless."" ""The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" he said. The organization also indicated that it would push back against a growing legislative movement to introduce or, in some cases, reintroduce gun control legislation. ""We can't lose precious time debating legislation that won't work,"" LaPierre said. The NRA's hard line came in stark contrast to President Obama's own plan after the Newtown shooting. The list: Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . Obama appealed to the pro-gun lobby who he said ""has members who are mothers and fathers"" likely impacted by the shooting. But then he also invited them to ""do some self-reflection."" Authorities must work to make ""access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,"" and the country needs to tackle a ""culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence,"" he said. Obama tapped Vice President Joe Biden to lead an administration effort to develop recommendations in January for preventing another tragedy like the Newtown school shooting. ""This is not some Washington commission. This is not something where folks are going to be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""This is a team that has a very specific task to pull together real reforms right now."" Across the rest of the nation, attitudes about guns appear to be changing. A CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday indicated that a slight majority now favor major restrictions on owning guns or an outright ban on gun ownership by ordinary citizens and more than 6 in 10 favor a ban on semi-automatic assault rifles. iReport: NRA member cuts up card in protest . Forty-three percent said the shootings in Connecticut make them more likely to support gun control laws, a 15-point increase from January 2011 following the Arizona gun rampage that wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Half of those questioned said the school shootings have not changed their opinions on gun control, down 19 points from January 2011. But there's an ocean of difference between the two sides, a gulf broadened by heated rhetoric and an almost singular focus on being ""right."" NRA comments draw swift opposition in reactions . While gun control advocate New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the NRA's stance ""a shameful evasion of the crisis facing our country,"" gun rights proponent and economist John Lott applauded the group for ""coming out strongly questioning these gun free zones."" Connecticut senator-elect Chris Murphy tweeted his disgust after seeing the NRA's statement: ""Walking out of another funeral and was handed the NRA transcript. The most revolting, tone deaf statement I've ever seen,"" he said on Twitter. Former Republican National Committee Chairman and NRA supporter Michael Steele called the NRA's remarks ""very haunting and very disturbing."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, considered by some as a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, also disagreed with the NRA's position. ""You don't want to make this an armed camp for kids,"" he said at an event in Newark Friday morning. ""I don't think that's a positive example for children. We should be able to figure out other ways to enhance safety."" The differences both in perspective and approach couldn't be more divergent, folks on both sides of the issue point out. ""I think that people are hard wired differently. If you look at the world as a beautiful place and I'm in the arts, I'm a composer, I write music, I write poetry, if you believe the world's a beautiful place, your viewpoint is different than if you feel 'I have to have my guns to protect myself,' "" said Hollis Thoms, 64, from Annapolis, Maryland, as he protested outside of the Willard InterContinental Hotel just after the NRA's press conference. That's exactly the type of rhetoric that baffles Paul Martin, who commented on CNN.com. ""I am a gun owner. I would be in favor of a ban on assault type weapons, and limiting magazines to a max of 10 rounds. It's the crazies that say 'ban all weapons' that make me nervous about giving any ground at all,"" Martin wrote. ""Approach it reasonably, with assurances that you won't go bonkers and demand a total ban, and you might make progress. Approach it just from anger and you will be fought all the way.""

CNN's Josh Levs, David Mattingly, Catherine Shoichet, Paul Steinhauser and Holly Yan contributed to this report .","The NRA wants to staff every school in America with ""qualified armed security""

"(CNN) -- Actor Robert Blake accused CNN's Piers Morgan of calling him a liar in a combative, profanity-laced interview that was more remarkable for its tone than revelations surrounding his acquittal in the 2001 murder of his wife. Blake, 78, said he agreed to appear on the show Wednesday to promote his self-published memoir ""Tales Of A Rascal,"" telling Morgan that the book was not about his late wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley, or their relationship. ""I made a deal to come here and talk about anybody from the book,"" Blake said after Morgan asked about his feelings about the case. ""I excused you from that deal because I thought you were going to be cool. Now you're trying to (bleep) into the ground."" Blake was acquitted in 2005 in connection with the murder of Bakley, though that same year he was found liable for her death in a wrongful death lawsuit and ordered to pay $30 million. Blake subsequently filed for bankruptcy. When Morgan asked about the case, including the civil suit, Blake demanded: ""Do you know why I was arrested?"" ""Tell me,"" Morgan said. ""Well, before you start asking questions, you should do some goddamn research,"" Blake said. The actor has long maintained his innocence, raising questions about Bakley's past and her relationships with other men as a possible motive. Bakley, who also had a well publicized relationship with Marlon Brando's son Christian, was found shot in the head in North Hollywood in 2001. The couple had married six months earlier after a paternity test revealed her child belonged to Blake not Brando. ""Bonnie had people that she burned. How bad I don't know. Did she steal everything from them? We'll leave that alone. But nobody really knew where Bonnie was. She had 15 ID cards. She had 15 credit cards. She had different places where she lived and nobody could ever find her if they were looking for her,"" Blake told Morgan. ""But one day somebody opened the paper and saw that Bonnie just married Robert Blake and where does Robert Blake live. And what a couple of weeks later she was dead. I want you to chew on that for a bit."" Blake's use of profanity is nothing new. Excerpts posted online from his self-published book are filled with it, especially as he describes the case that was built against him by Los Angeles authorities -- and his subsequent imprisonment while waiting to stand trial. Blake accused Morgan of insulting him by raising questions about the case. ""Nobody tells me I'm a liar,"" Blake said. At one point during one of Blake's tirades, Morgan asked: ""Are you sane?"" Later Blake said: ""My skin is a little bit thin. I've never allowed anybody to ask me the questions you're asking."" But during a 2011 interview with Tavis Smiley, the actor touched on similar subjects and gave similar answers, including accusing the talk show host of ""getting a little weird now"" when he asked questions about the case's aftermath, according to a transcript of the interview posted online. When Morgan raised questions about what he said he ""presumed to be a very important moment"" in Blake's life, the actor responded: ""I didn't write about that life and I didn't write a book about Bonnie."" At times, Blake appeared to be drawing on his acting experience, quoting lines from movies or interviews he gave years earlier. When Morgan asked where Blake was living, the actor appeared to draw on an answer he gave in 1993 to Entertainment Weekly: ""I live in an apartment. I told you, I'm broke. I couldn't buy spats for a hummingbird."" At other times, Blake took profanity-infused lines directly from his book, according to excerpts published online, delivering them almost verbatim, including an explanation of how he lost the civil suit brought by Bakley's family. ""They didn't win it, I lost it. I went up there, suicidal, to lose that,"" he told Morgan. He went on to call Morgan ""Charlie Potatoes"" or ""Charlie"" during the interview, taking a line from the 1958 movie ""The Defiant Ones"" that describes a man who is rich and popular. ""You're just like the cops. There's no place to get. Keep him in jail until he dies because everybody who's dead is guilty,"" he told Morgan, again using language from his book. Twitter -- the closest thing to an instant barometer of public opinion -- exploded with reaction. ""To my friend Charlie Potatoes: Great TV! Better you than me,"" former talk show host Arsenio Hall tweeted. Morgan, himself, tweeted: ""Incredible interview. I'd cast him in a movie with Charlie Sheen tomorrow."" Morgan also asked Blake about his wife's background. ""I think she was a con artist, yes,"" Blake said. ""I think she came to Hollywood to con her way into show business."" Blake also said he ""didn't know here well enough to know her."" ""I love her - well, I love you as a human being. You're my brother in arms,"" he told Morgan during the interview. ""We're all in this thing together. But we were not dramatically in love or things like that."" Blake is best known for his role as a tough-talking detective in the 1970s TV show ""Baretta"" and his Oscar-nominated performance as condemned killer in the 1967 movie ""In Cold Blood."" He began his career as a child actor, starring as a Mickey in the ""Our Gang"" movie shorts. Watch Piers Morgan Tonight weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"Paris (CNN) -- French voters are always good for a surprise, and the French presidential election will not be over before the run-off election on May 6. But the winner -- likely to be either Nicolas Sarkozy or Francois Hollande -- will need to immediately turn their attention to economic issues. The eurozone's problems will be top priority. The center of power in the eurozone has clearly moved to Germany, but France has always been the pivotal country in the European project, from the Treaty of Rome in 1957, to the Maastricht treaty in 1992, and the launch of the euro in 1998. So it may well be France, not Germany, which holds the key to the future of the euro. If France stays the course and commits to sufficient fiscal rigor and pro-competitive policies, then the euro has a good chance of survival, in whatever bruised form. Nonetheless, ""Europe"" has been conspicuously absent from the French election campaign. This paradox is best understood by considering that a majority of French voters are attached to the euro as well as to strict national sovereignty in fiscal matters. In the long run, they are unlikely to keep both. For the European sovereign debt crisis over the last 24 months has taught one stark lesson: The eurozone is not really viable without a fiscal union of some sort. But fiscal integration is not popular in Europe, and not in France. Not least because a fiscal union will only be feasible politically with a commitment to economic convergence. France faces other economic problems besides the euro wobbles: A loss of competitiveness, with unit labor costs that increased almost 20% relative to Germany since 2000, a rising current-account deficit of 2.1%, a public sector among the largest in the OECD as a share of GDP, a debt-to-GDP ratio of close to 90% and a public sector deficit projected at 4.8% this year that will be hard to bring down amid sluggish growth of 0.5% or less, and unemployment of 10% and rising. To outside observers, the election campaign may have looked surreal in its near-complete omission of the economic storm clouds. But French voters are not stupid; many anticipate a change of gear after the parliamentary election in June (even the surge of the hard left may well be attributed to such anticipation). Whatever the outcome of the election, much will depend on the financial markets in the coming year. Since neither of the two leading candidates has sought a mandate for structural economic or fiscal reform, the push for reform is likely to come from the outside, for example if sovereign bond markets become tumultuous again. ""Le spread"" as it is known in France, the difference between French and German government bond yields, has recently widened again. In France, serious reform is likely to get under way only when it looks inevitable, just as it did in Italy in the fall of 2011. Expect at some point a fight of high drama and brinkmanship between Paris and the European Central Bank, the arguably most powerful and independent central bank the world has ever known. No prize for predicting the winner: Reform may not be popular, but sovereign default is inconceivable in France, a country that did not have one in 200 years. Austerity will come at a high price in terms of economic growth for France and for Europe. But under current market conditions, conventional fiscal stimulus is not really feasible -- a euro exit would not change that. The only alternative would be a forced reduction in the debt of over-exposed sovereigns and/or banks (whose leverage risks are really intertwined), or an uptick in inflation. The two episodes of forced debt reduction in Europe since the start of the financial crisis, namely Icelandic banks and the Greek government, went actually rather well. As an economist, I advocate more of it. Ireland made a mistake by bailing out all its bank liabilities, and Spain for example should not repeat that error. Still, this road is unlikely to be tried unless decision makers feel they have no choice. If Hollande wins the election, financial markets may well express doubts over several of the Socialists' campaign proposals. Among them, the corporate tax with increases and the proposed total elimination of the deductibility of interest expenses, the income tax with its proposed 75% top marginal rate, and the undoing of parts of the pension reform. Eventually, economic pragmatism should prevail in French government policies. Hollande's campaigning as a man of reason should help. A strong reaction of financial markets in the months after the election could force his hand; he and his entourage may well have factored it in already, and might even secretly welcome it. After all, Hollande would be the first French president who holds a degree from a business school. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ulrich Hege.","The winner of France's election will have to quickly tend to economic issues .

"(CNN) -- One of the members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot serving a two-year prison sentence has asked to be transferred to solitary confinement because of ""strained relations"" with other inmates, state media reported Friday. Maria Alyokhina, 24, and fellow band member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, were sentenced in August for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in one of the Russian Orthodox Church's most important cathedrals in February. They are serving their sentences at a penal colony in Perm, about 1,000 kilometers (700 miles) east of Moscow. The state-run news agency Ria Novosti cited unidentified prison officials as saying that Alyokhina had made the transfer request. The agency noted that Alyokhina, a vegan, had previously complained about the meat-based diet at the prison colony. Yekaterina Samutsevich, a third member of the band who was sentenced with Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova, was freed from prison last month. Following her release on a suspended sentence, Samutsevich vowed to continue the kind of political protest act that led to their imprisonment. Footage of the brief but provocative protest action attracted worldwide attention after it was posted online. It showed the band members, their faces shrouded by balaclavas, screaming ""Mother Mary, please drive Putin away"" inside Christ Savior Cathedral in Moscow, outraging many of the Russia church's faithful . The three women, who were arrested shortly after the protest act, were convicted of hooliganism. Two other members of the all-female group have fled Russia. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina are expected to try to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.","Maria Alyokhina and another punk band member were sentenced in August .

"(CNN) -- Remember Wikipedia's black banner ads that asked for money to keep the lights on at the not-for-profit online encyclopedia? Expect more of those. ""We think it's really important to maintain the independence of Wikipedia. We like to keep it ad free,"" said co-founder Jimmy Wales to CNN's Richard Quest. Loyal users of the crowd-sourced information portal have answered the call for coin in the past. In 2010, the last time Wikipedia asked for donations, the website pulled in the requested $16 million dollars in 50 days from 500,000 people, according to the Wikimedia Foundation. While critics might compare the black banner blitz to begging, Wales implies he does not want conflicts of interest to arise.

"Wellington, New Zealand (CNN) -- Perhaps the most nervous people ahead of Wednesday night's world premiere of Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" in Wellington will be the weather forecasters. As the wind whipped through New Zealand's capital city with customary spring ferocity, they would have been praying for more lenient treatment than the average Italian seismologist if their forecast for fine weather on the big day turns out to be wrong. Wellington is stunning on a beautiful day, but only the brave plan outdoor events, and the red carpet parade of Hobbit stars and crew through the city before the premiere is both a genuine moment of national celebration and a chance to impress the visitors. International media are here in droves, almost never seen in this far-flung place which, while sometimes dubbed Middle Earth, is really at the end of the Earth. Arriving by air, they will already have seen the rather amusing Air New Zealand safety briefing video in which Orcs turn off bony iPads, and Hobbits push luggage under the seat with their furry feet. They may have even flown in on the Boeing-777 decked out in Hobbit livery. At Wellington airport, they'll have seen the staff wearing jokey ""Elfin Safety"" vests, and a giant Gollum poised disconcertingly over the snack bars. What they won't have seen as they landed at the hair-raising local aerodrome, set close among suburban houses, is a sign saying ""Wellywood."" Watch: Sneak preview of The Hobbit . Too many locals thought that idea was just a bit too craven, notwithstanding the fact that Jackson's stunning success has pumped millions of dollars and a great lump of creative industries into an otherwise remote, government town. A string of productions including the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""King Kong,"" ""TinTin,"" ""Avatar,"" and ""The Lovely Bones"" have built a globally credible film facility in what used to be a quiet corner of town best known for its garden center and some second-hand shops. People down here are a bit like J.R.R. Tolkien's dwarves, you see; fine when you get to know them, but with noses easily put out of joint. When ""Avatar"" director James Cameron bought a spread over the hill from Wellington, as many complained about farmland sales to foreigners as thought it might be good for the place. Jackson himself is known to entertain occasional despair at the small-mindedness of his countryfolk. He remains loyal to the industry he's built here but he's also had to be ruthless about it. A campaign orchestrated by Hollywood trade unions saw Warner Brothers threaten to take the project to Scotland rather than agree to bind New Zealand actors and crew into the kinds of contracts they're fleeing the United States to avoid. Stars, fans turn out for 'Hobbit' premiere . In the process, the New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, earned a reputation as a huge suck-up to Warners, and political opponents wondered just how much principle was for sale to get a movie made here. Echoes of that bitter campaign have re-emerged to spoil the film's global publicity. There have been late-surfacing claims, hotly denied, of animal cruelty on set and ham-fisted handling by local media seeking to tell more than the fairy story. The Hobbit has also been used as a political weapon in local political sparring over the country's economic direction. If it's really so pure, the critics fairly ask, how come New Zealand's environmental halo has slipped so badly of late? Local media breathlessly pick apart reports on the issue from the New York Times with all the parochial angst you'd expect from a place unused to attracting attention and desperate to be well-regarded. Still, no one ever said a Tolkien plot was subtle. Meanwhile, in a country where manufacturers and farmers have expected neither tax breaks nor protective tariffs for a generation, New Zealanders seem as placid as Hobbiton burghers about nearly half a billion Kiwi dollars in tax breaks that have secured every production since the Lord of the Rings. Perhaps with his next trilogy in mind, Jackson was this week warning there would need to be more where that came from if New Zealand is to compete with the many other countries that know blockbuster movies do more for national self-belief than a million widgets ever will. Still, the gods appear to be smiling on the enterprise. How else to explain the eruption on cue of the volcano that plays Mount Doom -- a central landscape for Hobbit shenanigans -- mere days before the premiere? Given the Hobbit-mania gripping the country, it's just a wonder that when authorities closed the area to tourists, they didn't put signs saying: ""You Shall Not Pass.""","New Zealand's capital to host the premiere of Peter Jackson's adaptation of ""The Hobbit""

For over two decades, the A Very Special Christmas compilations have brought together some of rock and pop's biggest names to pay tribute to the season and raise money for the Special Olympics. For the group's 25th anniversary, they pulled together some classics, including a silky smooth Michael BublÃ© take on ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" and a live recording of Dave Matthews Band's alarmingly sweet original ""Christmas Song."" Lady Antebellum, On This Winter's Night . The sonic version of an eternally burning yule log. Though you've heard these songs before, the band uses their three-part harmonies to melt the deepest snow and the iciest Scrooge heart. (Or more likely, just make your mom really happy.) Holidays Rule . Like the indie version of Now That's What I Call Christmas, Holidays Rule brings together Paul McCartney, Civil Wars, the Shins, and a bevy of other on-the-fringes acts doing Yuletide favorites. Nobody has more fun than, uh, fun., who blow through ""Sleigh Ride"" with the same kind of joyful abandon they bring to their own hits. Blake Shelton, Cheers, It's Christmas . With this album and his recent one-hour primetime special, is Blake Shelton taking Santa's place as the new mascot of Christmas? It's possible. Shelton's standards are to be expected, but his original composition ""Santa's Got a Choo Choo Train"" has charisma to spare. Scotty McCreary, Christmas With Scott McCreary . Scotty's album made a huge jump up the Billboard chart this week, which means that his core demographicâ€”country fans who find Blake Shelton too edgyâ€”have made their way to their local record emporium. Listen to his ""First Noel"" only if you don't like booze in your eggnog. Christina Perri, a very merry perri christmas . Because even Goth kids need a little Christmas cheer, Perri lends her icy alto to a handful of standards plus an original called ""Something About December"" that provides some fantastically melodic holiday haunting.

"(CNN) -- Let's be clear: Israel's latest operation in Gaza is not about security. Cease-fires between Hamas-ruled Gaza and Israel have brought security for months on end and there is ample evidence to show that Israel is largely responsible for truce breakdowns. Israel decided to escalate the conflict last Wednesday with its assassination of Hamas leader Ahmed al-Ja'abari despite a truce that had been observed by all Palestinian factions during the previous two days. Read more on CNNArabic . And even though they knew that al-Ja'abari had just received a proposal for a permanent truce agreement with Israel, as revealed in Haaretz. Some analysts have tied Israel's latest operation to the forthcoming elections, a way of cementing victory for Benjamin Netanyahu. Previous prime ministers have tried it, and failed. Netanyahu had previously avoided such operations but he seems to have succumbed, although events can spiral out of his control, as Hamas hits near Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have shown. But at the end of the day, the loss of Palestinian lives will far exceed that of Israelis. During Israel's last major operation against Gaza, the devastating three-week assault it launched on December 27, 2008 despite a cease-fire that had held for months, nearly 1,400 Palestinians were killed and thousands injured, compared to 13 Israelis (four from friendly fire.) In the present attacks, more than 100 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed so far. CNN Poll: 57% of Americans say Israeli attacks in Gaza are justified . The loss of life in armed conflict is always tragic, and much more so when those lives could have been spared by a cease-fire. What is particularly heartbreaking about the population in Gaza, against the backdrop of broader Palestinian dispossession, is that they have nowhere to run. CNN iReport: Share your images but stay safe. Israel's blockade is now into its seventh year, while the new Egyptian government has not yet significantly opened Gaza's only non-Israeli border crossing at Rafah. There are arguably two other factors behind Israel's new operation. One is deterrence, as Gabi Siboni, an Israeli colonel emphasized in The New York Times: ""Deterrence has to be maintained. It was only a question of time until this moment arrived."" Put differently, Israel will ignore any cease-fire at will. Blogger Jerry Haber recalls his conversation with an Israeli military expert shortly after Operation Cast Lead who said that Israel deliberately provoked Hamas rocket fire so it could do a little ""spring cleaning"" and deplete Hamas's weapons. He said this happened every few years. And here we are, four years on. The second reason for the attacks on Gaza is that Israel may be testing the boundaries of the changes brought about by the Arab uprisings to see just how far it can push the U.S., Egypt, and the Palestinian leadership. Read related: How Middle East has changed since last Gaza conflict . There is clearly no change from the U.S., whose spokespersons unquestioningly supported Israel's right to ""self-defense."" By contrast, Egypt's Mohammed Morsi unreservedly condemned the attack, sending his prime minister and other officials to Gaza to effectively serve as human shields: An Israeli attack on the officials would have meant a real rupture with Egypt. The signals from the Palestinian Authority (PA) have been mixed. PA security forces have brutally cracked down on some of the demonstrations protesting Israel's assault on Gaza as part of their security coordination with Israel. At the same time, PA head Mahmoud Abbas has been urging Arab and international action to bring about an end to the fighting and speaking of reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas. With the impending bid to upgrade the status of the Palestinian territories at the United Nations to that of non-member observer state, the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) cannot abandon Gaza to its fate. This is a sharp reversal of PLO behavior during Operation Cast Lead in 2009, when it resisted attempts to bring about an immediate cease-fire so as to please the U.S. -- so much so that the then-president of the U.N. General Assembly, the Nicaraguan priest Father Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, effectively accused them of complicity though without naming names. Read latest: Reports from CNN on the ground in the Gaza-Israel conflict . Four years on, the PLO/PA has little faith in the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution and none in Israel's. In any case, the PLO/PA cannot afford to be seen to be less pro-Palestinian than Egypt. Even the U.S. may not be able to completely ignore Arab sentiments in an era of disappearing dictatorships. What is needed now is an immediate cease-fire, pushed by Palestinian and Arab leaders and supported by the international community, whether Israel wants it or not. It is imperative to end the bloodshed now, and then work for a just peace that will end it for all time.","Palestinian political analyst: ""Israel largely responsible for truce breakdowns [with Gaza]""

"(CNN) -- Singer Fiona Apple's recent decision to cancel a tour to care for her dying dog, Janet, brought an outpouring of support from dog owners who could relate all too well to the need to honor their beloved companions until the very end. As CNN's Kat Kinsman recently wrote in a tribute to her late Irish Wolfhound, Mordred: ""Dogs express their love and trust in many ways -- some lap at your face, knock you down with kisses as you come home, leave a half-dead animal on your pillow, or sit on your lap and sigh with contentment. The large and stoic ones tend to lean. It's a hug. It's the best feeling in the universe."" We saw a well of sympathy in response to Kinsman's story, like from the commenter who said, ""My doggies never hold grudges, shun me, argue with me, they give love, laughter, constancy and protection. How can one not love and honor such behavior? That means returning the favor no matter what that takes."" After reading the comments on Kinsman's essay, CNN iReport decided to invite dog owners to share their stories about the animals they loved and lost. The assignment turned into a wake of sorts for owners -- many for whom the loss was still fresh -- to share their best times with their furry pals and their last moments together. ""The love of an animal is something you can't define or even describe.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to winning, Coach Beverly Kearney, University of Texas head women's track and field coach, knows how to get the job done. With a coaching career spanning nearly three decades, she has won seven NCAA championships and coached 12 Olympians. In 2007, she was inducted into the USTFCCCA Coaches Hall of Fame. Needless to say, Kearney's athletes are known to get results. ""They would say that I'm tough. That I believe in being the best you can be at all times,"" she says. ""I am going to demand their best, and I am relentless at it."" But for Kearney, success means more than coming in first place. Her goal is to make others successful beyond the finish line, so she founded the Pursuit of Dreams Foundation. Designed around Kearney's coaching philosophy, the nonprofit strives to connect young men and women with needed resources to realize their fullest potential. ""If I could utilize the techniques that I used to produce results in sports, why can't I utilize those techniques to produce results in life,"" Kearney says. ""Pursuit of Dreams is about connecting people with the inner magic that lies within them...that let's them know, yes you can. No, better yet, yes we can."" The organization hosts many programs including a minority mentorship symposium, which introduces students of color to the back stories of notable leaders as a way to motivate and empower. ""If I can expose you to the best...it has a great chance of inspiring you to be the best,"" Kearney explains. Another one of the nonprofit's programs is Pursuit of Excellence. Under this program, Kearney works with children and teens in foster care. Kearney and her team provide these children with new wardrobes, designed and custom tailored by a celebrity stylist. ""It's that hands-on loving touch that makes them feel special,"" Kearney says. ""Why not use your resources to inspire them to be better citizens, to pursue their dreams? We are letting them know we care."" Kearney credits her life experiences as preparation for not only her nonprofit but her successful coaching career. While winning may seem to come easy for her, she is honest that her journey toward success was not without sacrifice and faith. During her senior year of high school, Kearney was homeless after her mother, a single parent, unexpectedly passed away. After short periods of staying with friends and family, Kearney graduated high school and went to college on a scholarship where she excelled in both academics and track and field. ""More than any other time I realized I was on my own, and that moment drove me to being successful,"" she says. After college she received a graduate assistantship where she turned her love of track and field into a successful coaching career. She is the first African-American to win an NCAA national team championship in Division I track and field, and she is the first African-American to serve as a head coach at the University of Texas. ""I just knew I couldn't fail,"" Kearney says. ""If I failed I would be a shining example of why you don't hire African-Americans and why you don't hire women."" Kearney says what separates her from her competition is her empowering style that motivates her athletes to succeed. ""I won't give up on you,"" she says. ""I don't care how bad you do, I am not letting go. I will believe in you no matter what. As long as you keep trying...I got your back."" Kearney's determination was tested again when over a decade ago while on her way to Disney World she was involved in a tragic car accident that claimed the lives of two of her friends. Thrown over 50 feet from the car, she suffered extensive spinal injuries that left her partially paralyzed. Kearney says she never doubted her ability to walk again and continued to lead her team from her hospital bed. ""When they told me I was paralyzed, it went in one ear and out the next...because I had to get up and coach,"" she says. Track practices were recorded and then played for Kearney on a VCR in her hospital room. ""Because I was an intuitive coach...whatever it is you need to do I can describe it in a way that you internalize it and you feel it without me having to demonstrate it."" Guided by her personal motto -- Believe it. Speak it, Do it -- Kearney continued to beat the odds and eventually learned to walk again. ""All that I have been through in my life has been the foundation that has created an unshakeable, unwavering faith that all things are possible,"" Kearney says.","Beverly Kearney is the founder of the Pursuit of Dreams Foundation .

"(CNN) -- Luxembourg's Andy Schleck has been forced to pull out of this year's Tour de France due to injuries he suffered in a warm-up race, he confirmed Wednesday. It is a bitter blow for the 27-year-old, who was recently crowned the 2010 champion of cycling's most famous race following the disqualification of Alberto Contador of Spain for doping offenses. RadioShack's Schleck was among the favorites for the 98th edition, which will start from Liege in Belgium on June 30, but a fractured pelvis has put paid to his hopes. He sustained the injury when he crashed during the 53km time trial stage of the Criterium du Dauphine last Thursday, caught by a ferocious gust of wind. ""It is the biggest disappointment of my career. I would rather have finished last on the Tour than not be able to participate at all,"" Schleck told a press conference in Luxembourg. ""I will need to be back to 100 percent before I can start riding again. I hope to be at the Olympics,"" he added. It completes a miserable 2012 for Schleck, who has been forced to abandon preparatory stage races such as Paris-Nice, the Tour of Catalunya and the Dauphine through a mixture of injury and illness. But he had hoped to attend a final training camp in the Pyrenees mountains until hospital scans revealed the full extent of his injuries. His brother Franck, who finished third in last year's Tour de France, will now spearhead the RadioShack effort at this year's race. Team Sky's Bradley Wiggins, who has won the Paris Nice and Criterium du Dauphine this season, will start the three-week race as favorite. He will be bidding to become the first British rider to win the Tour while Australia's Cadel Evans will be defending his title. Contador, given a retrospective two-year ban which ends after this year's Tour de France, is set to make his return at the Tour of Spain where Andy Schleck hopes to compete. In other cycling news Wednesday, David Millar has been named in the Great Britain squad for the road race at the London Olympics. Millar served a two-year ban from 2004-2006 for a doping offense and under a then British Olympic Association bye-law was banned for life from Olympic competition. But the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned that ruling in April, allowing Millar to be selected. Millar has been named in a long-list of eight riders which will be whittled down to five before the Games.","Andy Schleck pulls out of this year's Tour de France through injuruy .

"(CNN) -- There's no sign hanging on the front door of the University of Iowa law school that reads ""Republicans Need Not Apply."" But Teresa Wagner got the message. Wagner, an Iowa law school alum who had worked for the Family Research Council and the National Right to Life Committee, worked part-time at the law school's writing center. Twice, she applied for full-time positions. Twice, despite positive reviews and being the most qualified applicant, she was rejected. So she sued. In a federal case heard this week, Wagner claimed that the state school violated her First Amendment rights by rejecting her because she's a Republican. Her claim reads: ""The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees individuals the right to associate and express themselves on matters of public concern without fear of reprisal from their government. ""This guarantee prohibits the government, when acting as employer, from firing, refusing to promote and/or refusing to hire citizens because of their political views or affiliations."" The prospect of ideological discrimination in higher education shouldn't come as a surprise. A 2005 study showed that 72% of college professors identified as liberals. Only 15% described themselves as conservative. Former Harvard President Larry Summers, who served as director of President Obama's National Economic Council, has compared the paucity of conservative professors to the early days of racial integration in baseball. Sure, there are conservative professors, just like there were black baseball players in the 1950s. ""But it appeared (then) that there were not any African-American .250 hitters,"" Summers has said. ""The only (black) players who played were stars."" There is a similar lack of conservative professors who aren't ""stars."" This distortion has left Summers wondering whether there is a bias against conservatives in higher education. Certainly, some of the stats are due to self-selection, with more liberals choosing to go into academia. But that wasn't the case with Wagner. And if she was rejected because of her political views, taxpayers in America are funding not only an ideological lemming herd but a mob that casts out anyone who questions the groupthink. Still, is it unconstitutional? The Supreme Court has stated clearly that the First Amendment prohibits a state from basing hiring decisions on political beliefs or associations. This rule, though, is not absolute. Imagine if Obama were to be prohibited from rejecting Grover Norquist for a post in his administration for ideological reasons. So the court has recognized limited exceptions for political appointees. However, the court has not extended a discrimination exception to academia. In fact, the court has said that academic freedom is of special concern to the First Amendment. And the test set by numerous appellate courts for ferreting out political discrimination is whether someone's political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the adverse employment action. How would someone like Wagner meet that test and prove that she was discriminated against because of her ideas on abortion or gay marriage? The university claims that she lost the jobs because she performed poorly in her interview. Wagner's evidence includes e-mails from the law school's associate dean, warning her to hide a job offer from Ave Maria School of Law, which is perceived to be conservative. During the faculty meeting to vote on whether Wagner should be hired, it was mentioned that she holds conservative beliefs. And after her rejection, the same associate dean sent an e-mail to the dean, asking whether Wagner's political beliefs had been considered in the vote. Wagner points out that of 50 faculty members at Iowa School of Law, only one is a registered Republican, and 46 are Democrats. One of those faculty members, Mark Osiel, testified this week that he had worked with Wagner, that she was a ""superlative writer"" and that the university's liberal leaning ""corrupts everything it touches."" Meanwhile, the two people hired at the school's writing center instead of Wagner were less qualified and less experienced and had received lower student evaluation scores. Osiel said the school's policies are ""unconstitutional and morally indefensible."" It's no pretty solution to have courts interfering in the hiring decisions of universities. And as Summers has said, it would be ""a real horror"" if, to avoid discrimination claims, Harvard's astronomy department were forced to hire an astrologer. But that example, like the need for agreement among policymakers, speaks to the merits of the candidate. What do Wagner's views on abortion have to do with her ability to teach legal writing? For that matter, does liberalism have exclusive claim to righteousness so that competing views can be discriminated against and discarded as unmeritorious? If Wagner was discriminated against because of her political views, the law school's rejection of her was most likely unconstitutional. More important, though, it was ignorant. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Will Cain.","Court heard case of woman who says she was rejected for job for being conservative .

"(CNN) -- A last-minute and unexpected change in government rules over a key environmental dispute prompted uncertainty and consternation at the Supreme Court on Monday, with justices chastising the Obama administration over its policy tactics. Final rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency on Friday exempted logging road runoff from storm water permit requirements, saying timber firms may continue to use ""best management practices"" that suit local conditions. The change came just ahead of Monday's oral arguments on one of two cases this week dealing with the financial and health effects of storm water drainage. ""Maybe in the future you could let us know when something as definite as that comes"" at the last minute, Chief Justice John Roberts told the Justice Department's lawyer. Roberts suggested that arguments could have been delayed so that the court and both sides of the case could prepare. Photos: 15 Supreme Court cases that changed America . At issue was whether logging road operators must obtain federal Clean Water Act discharge permits for ditches, drains, and culverts channeling rain runoff from those roads-- treating it the same as industrial storm water. Scientists have said such sediment from muddy water-- created in part by large logging trucks-- can prove deadly to fish, plants and other wildlife, often many miles downstream from the initial source. A small environmental group from Oregon first sued over dirt roads in the Tillamook State Forest, near streams where threatened salmon migrate. That includes the Trask River and Sam Downs Roads. The Portland-based Northwest Environmental Defense Center last year won an important victory in a federal appeals court. But state officials and timber companies then asked the high court to intervene, saying changes in long-established federal rules would be overly burdensome and cost jobs in the already financially stressed timber market in the Pacific northwest. The Clean Water Act generally prohibits any pollutants being discharged by companies or individuals into American waters, unless a government permit has been issued. Such ""pollutants"" can include rock, sand, and contaminated soil. Small-scale family farm runoff traditionally receives less scrutiny than an industrial factory or mine. The question before the court is where forestry activities should fall on regulatory scale when it comes to the permitting process. The Obama administration is backing Oregon and the timber industry, but also told the court in recent weeks that Congress and the EPA were working to minimize any further environmental damage, without an additional regulatory scheme. Roberts noted it would be an ""unusual situation"" for the court to now try and rule following the regulatory bombshell -- when the key point of contention has now apparently become moot. But Timothy Bishop, the attorney for Oregon, urged the justices to continue deciding the matter despite the EPA action. ""Are you sure you want what you're asking for,"" said Roberts. ""What if we go ahead and decide this case and rule against you?"" Photos: Justice Roberts on the high court . Some justices seemed prepared to do so after Bishop insisted ""timber harvesting is not industrial activity"" that would likely trigger permits. The lawyer for the environmentalists said in light of all the recent rule changes, the easiest thing would be for the high court to dismiss the industry appeal-- which would mean a victory for the environmental coalition. Some on the bench were skeptical that was a practical alternative. The justices Tuesday will tackle another ongoing dispute over whether water on a navigable river that flows through a concrete channel-- or an ""engineered improvement""-- can be considered ""discharge"" subject to greater Clean Water Act regulation. That appeals concerns responsibility over billions of gallons of polluted storm water flowing into the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers. Monday's consolidated cases are Decker v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center (11-338) and Georgia-Pacific West, Inc. v. Northwest Environmental Defense Center (11-347).","EPA rule finalized just before Supreme Court arguments in logging case .

"(CNN) -- This season has been very good to NBC. ABC, CBS and Fox — not so much. This year's television season is only a few weeks old, but there are already signs about how it's shaping up in the ratings. The news is not good. For the first three weeks of the 2012-2013 season, according to Ad Age, ABC, CBS and Fox are all down by double-digits in the key 18-49 demo, which helps sell advertising . Only NBC is up. (Fortunes for The CW, the netlet co-owned by Warner Bros. and CBS, are still unclear.) Is network TV dying? According to Robert Thompson, director of The Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, it's not that simple. ""Network TV is certainly not where it was back in the years of the 'Milton Berle Show,'"" he said. But he added that the major networks still have the most money, and can grab the most eyeballs, even if viewers have scrambled their viewing habits. It's not that no one is watching TV — it's just that they're watching it across many different platforms, like laptops and tablets or through streaming services like Hulu. In this ""multichannel universe, narrow-casting is the order of the day,"" Thompson said. With so many options, people tend to seek out what's tailored to their tastes, which helps explain the explosion of cable channels since the 1980s. In 2009, they accounted for more than 40 percent of household viewing, according to Nielsen, while networks made up 25 percent. ""The Walking Dead"" is one of TV's biggest shows, dominating its time slot and the cultural conversation — and it's on AMC. By comparison, Thompson said, part of the networks' problem has been a lack of ""big new things:"" the shows that can pull people back to their couches. In 2011, it was ""The Voice"" on NBC; in 2009, it was ABC's ""Modern Family."" ""It's not that this year they said no to the next 'Modern Family' and chose the wrong thing,"" Thompson said. ""It may be that the next 'Modern Family' didn't present itself."" Of the 20 new shows launched by the five major networks this year, only one of them — ""Revolution"" on NBC — has been an overachiever, by debuting big and staying that way. Season-to-date, its 18-49 rating is almost twice NBC's average, according to TVByTheNumbers.com. It may be no coincidence that this year's success stories are genre shows, like the post-apocalyptic ""Revolution"" and the post-apocalyptic ""Walking Dead,"" or even The CW's ""Arrow,"" about a brooding, hooded superhero. The success of ""The Voice,"" meanwhile, means viewers remain open to big, splashy reality and competition shows, Thompson said, even if NBC risks overexposing the show. The networks still have the benefit of a lot of marketing and production muscle: their shows can be bigger and their ads can be louder. Some of the buzziest programming however, including ABC's nuclear sub thriller ""Last Resort"" and its country music soap ""Nashville,"" is also some of the lowest-rated. Thompson suggested that prestige programming is now better left to cable and the smaller, more passionate audiences who flock there. Sitcoms are still bustling, even if several high-profile fall launches (Fox's freshman ""The Mindy Project,"" ABC's pairing of returning comedies ""Happy Endings"" and ""Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23"") haven't broken through. It doesn't matter, Thompson said: comedy properties are full of potential — not just in primetime, but in syndication, where they can be replayed at hefty prices for years. Ad Age's annual survey of TV commercial prices, released at the end of October and based on pre-season estimates, backs up Thompson's claim: seven of the 10 costliest shows are comedies, including ""Modern Family,"" Fox's ""New Girl"" and CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory."" ""The first three things on my Top 10 list of things to do would be develop half-hour comedies, develop half-hour comedies, develop half-hour comedies,"" Thompson said. Meanwhile, the networks are in a ""holding pattern,"" waiting for the next big thing to stop the slide, he said. The trick is finding them. ""The content is everything,"" Thompson said. ""In the end whether people are going to watch hits on their laptops or five days later on their DVRs or watch it the old way, if you get a big hit like a 'Survivor' or a 'CSI' when it was at its peak, then you're going to be fine.""","This year's fall TV season has been good to NBC .

Part of the problem is a lack of ""big new things""

"(CNN) -- A little more than two months ago, I stood on a California beach, tears streaming down my cheeks as I watched members of the 2012 CNN Fit Nation team cross the finish line of the Nautica Malibu Triathlon. A year before they had never worn a pair of running shoes, let alone a triathlon suit. For many of them completing a triathlon was utterly inconceivable, akin to asking them to walk on the moon. But what a difference a year made. At the Nautica Malibu Triathlon, I saw the Lucky Seven athletes conquer their fears and achieve more than they could have ever imagined. Their courage, strength, happiness, elation and pride were a beacon that shone for all to see, and that light continues to inspire everyone who shared in their amazing journey. It was an absolute privilege to join Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Coach April as a guest coach for the 2012 CNN Fit Nation team. The finish line was not the end for the Lucky Seven; it was just the beginning. Their journey did not simply bring newfound physical fitness and vigor. The experience gave the team members altered perspective, a sense of purpose, healthy eating habits, a wealth of new skills, mental fortitude and a string of wonderful memories. It gave them a new life as triathletes, filled with belief in themselves and lifelong friendships. Of course, challenges are never easy. It takes a huge amount of courage to try a new sport and set a new goal. The Lucky Seven all had personal barriers. They were all nervous about testing themselves, taking risks and biting off more than they could chew. They all worried about the what ifs. What if I can't do the training? What if I can't learn to swim? What if I crash on the bike? What if I can't finish? What if I let myself down? While watching them conquer their fears, I realized once again that the only limits are those that exist in the mind. The key is to overcome and move beyond them -- to a space where our real power dwells. Ironman champ: Train your brain, then your body . Four years ago I was asked whether I would ever do an Ironman. My response? ""No way, you must be completely mad to do something like that!"" But once I had done the shorter distance races, I realized that maybe the Ironman mountain wasn't so big after all. I gained confidence in myself, and with the support of my coach and training partners, I seized this new, exciting challenge with both hands. Imagine if I had never gone back on my word, if I hadn't changed ""I can't"" to ""I can."" Imagine if I hadn't dared to push myself harder, and most importantly, if I hadn't had people to support, encourage, mentor and make me believe in me? I would never be sitting here as four-time Ironman World champion. Getting to the starting line of your first triathlon . The same goes for the 2012 CNN Fit Nation Team. If the team members hadn't had the courage to overcome their fears and doubts, they may never have been able to call themselves triathletes. And they, and their families and loved ones, may not be looking to the future filled with optimism, positivity and unbridled confidence. I await the news of the selection of the 2013 CNN Fit Nation team, knowing it marks the start of a journey that will change lives, empowering a new group to defy what they may have deemed impossible and inspire everyone else out there to do the same. This is the start of a new beginning, for them and for you. To apply to be a 2013 CNN Fit Nation team member, go to iReport.com and share your story. If you are selected, you'll receive a bike, uniform, wet suit, personal training and nutrition coaching, two all-expenses-paid training trips and a chance to train and compete alongside Gupta at the 2013 Nautica Malibu Triathlon.","Apply to join the 2013 CNN Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge on iReport.com .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama received the backing of a nation when he was elected for a second term as U.S. president last month, and now his favorite English soccer club has also won a significant ballot. English Premier League side West Ham United -- the team of choice of the 44th president of the United States -- has been selected as the preferred occupant for London's Olympic Stadium, the venue which hosted the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) announced on Wednesday that the east London club -- whose stadium is located near to the former Olympic Park site in Stratford -- had beaten off competition from neighboring third-tier team Leyton Orient, a proposed sports university project and a consortium looking to bring Formula One to the British capital. ""The LLDC's board unanimously agreed that West Ham United's bid for a concession to play at the Olympic Stadium should be ranked highest of the bids received, and that negotiations should be held with the club on final commercial terms for them to move to the stadium,"" read a statement on the organization's website. West Ham had initially tried to buy the stadium and was named the preferred bidder in February 2011, but that deal collapsed in October of that year after threats of court action from rival candidates and an independent review of the process. The stadium was then offered to potential tenants, and from an initial 16 interested parties the list was cut to four bidders in March 2012. Despite backing West Ham's bid for the 80,000-seater arena, the LLDC insisted any future tenant would have to accommodate the 2017 World Athletics Championships. If West Ham cannot cater for track and field, the club would be unable to complete its proposed move to the site. ""If a football use can be agreed the stadium would be reconfigured to provide a retractable/moveable seating solution so there could be a quick change over between athletics and football use,"" the LLDC said. ""The legacy corporation recognizes that West Ham and other parties may not be able to meet the necessary conditions, so is progressing a detailed design for a non-football option. This would allow the stadium to be brought back into use as soon as possible."" West Ham's joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold hailed Wednesday's announcement as the latest step in realizing the vision they had for the club when they purchased a 50% shareholding for $85 million in 2010. ""We are ambitious for our great club and aim to set the benchmark for visiting away and neutral football supporters from across the globe to come and enjoy the iconic Stadium and be part of our Premier League club experience,"" they said in a statement. Reconstruction work on the stadium, including extending the roof and adding retractable seating, will reportedly cost between $210-240 million and will be funded by a mix of public money and a $64 million loan from the local Newham Council. West Ham is expected to contribute $24 million to the restructuring of the public-funded stadium, which cost $690 million to build. The club returned to the English top flight in August following relegation in 2011, and has made an encouraging start to the season under the guidance of manager Sam Allardyce, sitting eighth in the table with 22 points from 15 matches. Obama has reportedly been a fan of ""the Hammers"" since a trip to England several years before his election to office in 2008. The club's supporters have even sung songs in his honor during matches, according to the Goal.com website.","Soccer club West Ham selected as preferred bidder for London's Olympic Stadium .

"(CNN) -- Catania manager Rolando Maran was not even alive the last time his club claimed a home win over AC Milan in the top-flight. Maran was born on July 14, 1963, just two months after Catania had pulled off victory against a Milan team which would go on to win the European Cup three days later. Led by the prolific Jose Altafini, Milan went on to defeat a Benfica side which had won the trophy in each of the previous two years and claim the title as the first Italian team to have won the competition. What a contrast to that of a few days earlier when Catania pulled off a famous victory, courtesy of a goal from Bruno Petroni -- a player on loan from AC's famous rivals, Internazionale. Back to the future . Fast forward to the present day and Maran was hoping his side could reverse their awful record against the Rossoneri. It began in perfect fashion when Nicola Legrottaglie headed home Francesco Lodi's corner with just 11 minutes on the clock. Milan stuns leaders Juventus . Milan, looking for back-to-back wins in Serie A for the first time this season following its victory against Juventus last week, looked lethargic in the opening exchanges. Sergio Almiron should have doubled Catania's advantage but sent his free header wide of the goal from just six-yards. It was not until the second period that Milan really began to exert its dominance and even then it took the sending off of Pablo Barrientos to inspire them. Red card . Barrientos, already on a booking, only had himself to blame after taking a pointless swipe at Antonio Nocerino which earned him a second yellow card. That gave Milan the boost it was looking for and El Shaarway fired home a 53rd minute equalizer. Milan forged into the lead three minutes later as Boateng beat Lodi, before unleashing a rasping effort into the top corner. Milan continued to dominate with El Shaarawy and Robinho both missing glorious opportunities to seal the points, while Urby Emanuelson hit a post. Milan were reduced to 10-men in the final minute when Boateng was dismissed for a rash challenge. But El Shaarway sealed the win, bending home his second of the night and 12th of the season to fire Milan up to seventh place and leave Maran dreaming of that famous victory.","Milan comes from behind to defeat Catania 3-1 .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- The clothing factory fire that killed more than 100 workers in Bangladesh over the weekend was no accident, the country's prime minister said. The fire Saturday at the factory near Dhaka, and a second fire at another factory Monday were ""planned arson,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Monday. Two people were arrested Monday trying to set fire to an apparel factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, but local police said they had not yet found any links between the arrests and the other factory fires. Hasina's remarks came the night before Tuesday's day of mourning for those killed at the factory and for the victims from a recent overpass collapse in southeastern Bangladesh. All apparel factories were to be closed Tuesday, and special prayers will be offered at mosques, churches and temples, the government said. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. put some distance between it and the clothing factory, saying the factory was no longer authorized to produce merchandise for the company. ""A supplier subcontracted work to this factory without authorization and in direct violation of our policies. Today, we have terminated the relationship with that supplier,"" Wal-Mart said Monday. The clothing factory, housed in a multistory building near the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, caught fire Saturday night. More than 100 people were killed and at least 200 were injured as they rushed to escape the factory in Ashulia, police said. ""How the factory caught fire, I don't know. But when we heard 'fire,' we all rushed out and we were trying to get out of the factory,"" said Parul Begum, a survivor. ""One factory worker broke a window and one of the workers pulled me through. After the fire, we tried to run out the door, but it was locked. When the floor (became) dark with smoke, the boys came to rescue me,"" she said. Fire rips through clothing factory near Dhaka . Thousands of workers from dozens of clothing factories in Ashulia took to the streets Monday to protest the deaths of their colleagues. The protesters blocked traffic and demonstrated for several hours, demanding compensation and a full investigation into what happened. The Bangladeshi government has ordered such an investigation, asking two committees to file reports within a week. On Tuesday, Hasina urged factory owners to be more careful about the safety of their workers, but also to remain vigilant to the possibility of suspicious activities in their mills. Overpass collapse kills 11 in Bangladesh . Police and witnesses said the latest fire, at a 10-story clothing factory in the suburb of Uttara, began Monday morning, and it took firefighters about four hours to bring it under control. ""Firefighters have brought the flames under control, and no one died in the incident,"" Brigadier Gen. Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, director general of Bangladesh Fire Service and Civil Defense, told reporters. Local police said at least 10 people were injured in Uttara as they jumped from windows to escape. They said the fire began on the second floor, where a large quantity of fabric and yarn were stored, and it spread immediately to the fourth floor. Bangladesh's ready-made garments make up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports. The country has about 4,500 garment factories that make clothes for stores including Tesco, Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney, H&M, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour. The sector earned $19 billion this year as of June. The state-run news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), recently reported that some 6,000 people die every year in fires in the country.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo's late header sealed a deserved win for Portugal in the Euro 2012 quarterfinal clash against Czech Republic. The Real Madrid forward, who found form so emphatically with two goals in the previous match against Holland, proved the difference once again as he powered home a Joao Moutinho cross with 11 minutes remaining. It was no less than Portugal's display merited after they dominated the second half against an unfancied Czech side that started the match brightly but faded drastically. Portugal's win set up a semifinal meeting next Wednesday against either France or Spain. ""We played very well, created a lot of chances and I hit the post twice,"" Ronaldo told TV reporters after the victory. Soccer Live: CNN's blog from Thursday's opening quarterfinal . ""We know it'll be difficult in the next game, but we're very a mature team and we're ready for the fight."" This match was a repeat of the Euro '96 quarterfinal in England, where Karel Poborsky scored a famous scooped lob to give the Czech underdogs a 1-0 win. It was that losing Portugal side, elegantly marshaled by the likes of Rui Costa and Luis Figo, which prompted Ruud Gullit to coin the phrase ""sexy football."" And there was plenty to seduce viewers in Portugal's second-half display in Warsaw, as the Czechs were blown away by their opponents' pace and guile going forward. Not that Paulo Bento side's superiority was evident in a cagey first half where the Portuguese were labored and sloppy, in contrast to the lively, well-drilled Czechs. Still, it was Ronaldo who almost broke the deadlock with a moment of brilliance seconds before halftime. The winger deftly chested down a Raul Meireles pass inside the Czech box, spun cleverly away from Michael Kadlec and unleashed a low shot that bounced back off the post. The Portugal captain looked to the heavens in exasperation, but it was a warning sign the Czechs would have heeded. Yet Michal Bilek's side were powerless to stem the tide of Portuguese attacks that followed after the break. Minutes after the restart, Ronaldo hit the post again -- this time with a fearsome 35-yard free-kick. It set the tone for the remainder of the game as Portugal relentlessly pinned the Czechs back, with chances coming thick and fast. Hugo Almeida sent a free header tamely over the bar, before Petr Cech parried Nani's venomous hit and tipped over a fizzing effort from Moutinho. Meireles and Nani then fired chances over the bar with the goal begging. Ronaldo, inevitably, had a few attempts of his own too. He fired a shot over and had several efforts blocked, the spasms of anguish that greeted each miss becoming increasingly animated. But that frustration was released with the clock ticking towards extra time, as Ronaldo's aerial prowess came to the fore. Moutinho delivered a right-wing cross and Ronaldo hurled himself at the ball to send a powerful header into the ground and bouncing over the outstretched fingers of Cech to spark wild Portuguese celebrations. Portugal are unlikely to be the favorites in the semifinals, whichever team they face, but with Europe's best player looking at the peak of his powers, who would bet against them?","Cristiano Ronaldo scores winner as Portugal knock Czech Republic out of Euro 2012 .

"(CNN) -- A fire, a fuel leak, mechanical issues. For a passenger about to board Boeing's next-generation 787 Dreamliner aircraft, reports of parts of the plane not working properly don't inspire confidence. After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 debuted in 2011. Yet a string of maintenance issues have put the much-anticipated plane into a less rosy light. On Tuesday, a Japan Airlines flight aborted takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport for Tokyo after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel. On Monday, a maintenance worker discovered an electrical fire aboard an empty Japan Airlines 787 slated for departure from Logan. In December, a United Airlines 787 traveling from Houston to Newark was diverted to New Orleans after experiencing mechanical problems. Despite the flurry of reports, aviation experts say most new commercial airplanes do encounter problems after their launch. Read more: 7 reasons the 787 Dreamliner is special . Every new airplane is going to have these kinds of ""teething problems,"" said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and former airline mechanic. The manufacturers usually ""get a handle on it quickly and fix it."" That's Boeing's plan. ""There are issues we have seen that we will need to work through and just like any new airplane program we work through those issues and we move on,"" said Mike Sinnett, Boeing vice president and chief project engineer for the 787, during a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. In the 15 months the aircraft has been flying passengers, Sinnett says its on-time departure rating has been ""in the high 90 percents."" That measure is about the same as Boeing's last major new commercial airplane, the 777, which was launched in 1995. ""These are best-in-class airplanes and their performance has been best in class,"" he said. ""But we are not happy until we are perfect."" Newer airplanes are safer than ever, Goglia said. ""We are flying more airplanes that have been engineered to be safer,"" he said. ""We almost (never) have material failures in airplanes anymore."" Part of the Dreamliner's appeal to airlines is its increased fuel efficiency due to its construction of lightweight composite materials instead of metal. The interior features larger windows and overhead bins and better ventilation. Problems on other new aircraft . The Airbus A380 also had problems when it started flying in 2007, but aviation expert Janet Bednarek loves to fly it. ""It had cracks in the wing, which would be much more concerning to me"" than the 787 reports, said Bednarek, a University of Dayton aviation history professor. ""They figured it out. Pilots want to get to their destination alive as much as anybody so they don't mess around."" Like the 787, the Boeing 747 was also a ""game changer"" and had a lot of issues when it started flying in 1970, according to aviation consultant Michael Boyd. ""The engines on the first ones were a leap at the time and had big problems but they got through it,"" said Boyd. ""I think the potential and perceived operational advantages of the aircraft are such that airline orders will stick with the 787 through this situation."" The size of the key players in the commercial aircraft game -- Boeing and Airbus -- lend a lot of weight to maintenance issues, said Bednarek, who said she looks forward to flying the 787. ""What makes this a bigger story is that essentially we have two companies only that make these really big airplanes. ""They dominate the world market so their company is on the line when this happens. They are both 900-pound gorillas. Misfortune for one company might benefit the other."" Situation Room: Go inside Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner . Computers fly the plane . As computers do more of the work that pilots used to do, any kind of electrical failure does concern aviation historian David T. Courtwright, author of ""Sky as Frontier: Adventure, Aviation, and Empire."" ""More of the human function of piloting has been transferred to equipment itself. In general, that's been a great thing for passenger safety,"" said Courtwright. ""That's why any kind of electrical failure in a new piece of equipment is alarming, because there is so much electrically driven."" Courtwright doesn't think the 787's problems will slow down the computerization of flight that's been going on for more than 30 years. ""Whatever the particular flaws of this aircraft, it's a setback for Boeing and this design, but it no way indicates a trend away from these kinds of advanced, electronically sophisticated aircraft that essentially fly themselves."" For his part, Boeing engineer Sinnett is concerned, but is ""100 percent convinced"" the 787 is safe to fly. ""I'm concerned about the things that everybody else is concerned about, but there is not a single one of them that stands out as a particular concern from a safety or economic perspective."" CNN's Jim Barnett and Todd Sperry contributed to this report.","It's normal for new aircraft to have problems in their first year of flight, experts say .
Both the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747 went through growing pains when they were introduced .
The trend of electronically sophisticated aircraft that essentially fly themselves is likely to continue ."
"New York (CNN) -- New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating whether New York utilities Long Island Power Authority and Consolidated Edison adequately prepared for and responded to Superstorm Sandy, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. On Wednesday, the attorney general's office subpoenaed LIPA and ConEd requesting information about what they did to brace their systems ahead of the storm and their management in its wake, the source said. The investigation, which began November 5, is examining whether ConEd, as a publicly traded investor-owned utility company, breached the Public Service Law, which requires gas and electric companies to ""supply safe and adequate service.""

Schneiderman's office is questioning whether LIPA, which was created under the Public Authorities law, violated its legal obligations to ensure a safe and dependable flow of electricity.

"(CNN) -- The federal lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett on behalf of the state against the NCAA is politically smart. It is never a bad thing for a state lawmaker to stand behind the flagship university, especially when the lawmaker himself is under investigation for his alleged complicity in protracting the official inquiry of Jerry Sandusky. But legally, the lawsuit makes no sense. Recall the events: Penn State University, in the midst of the national scandal stemming from the crimes of Sandusky, agreed to settle any claims that the NCAA might have against it for failure to supervise its football program. The settlement was undeniably harsh, including a fine of $60 million, loss of scholarships and bowl eligibility for four years, and the easing of rules to allow student-athletes to transfer out of Penn State's football program. (Meanwhile, outside of the settlement, the criminal trials of key university administrators for perjury and failure to report abuse are proceeding.) Like most plea bargains, the perpetrator got something from the deal, too. By settling early, the university avoided the prolonged NCAA infractions process. Proceeding by the infractions process would have kept Penn State's name, Sandusky's crimes and Joe Paterno's dubious legacy in the news longer than usual. More alarmingly, the infractions committee could have imposed the dreaded ""death penalty"" -- a complete termination of the football program for years, the cost of which would have undoubtedly dwarfed the measures imposed. Notably, Penn State agreed in accepting the deal that it would not challenge the NCAA's authority in court. Corbett described the sanctions as ""overreaching and unlawful"" while other lawmakers object to the fines being used to fund programs in other states. Since the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was not limited by the Penn State-NCAA agreement, it can sue to overturn it. Yet it is that very fact -- that Pennsylvania is a stranger to the agreement -- that dooms its litigation. The lawsuit asks the court to grant an injunction so that NCAA can be refrained from imposing the sanctions. Injunctions look to the future and are designed to prevent damages. Typically, an injunction plaintiff claims that something bad is about to happen and asks the court to stop it. What bad thing will happen to Pennsylvania? It partially funds Penn State. Therefore, according to the complaint, future NCAA sanctions that come out of the Penn State treasury will, by derivation, also be taken from Pennsylvania's treasury, or at least the part of it that the state chooses to share with the university. In other words, Pennsylvania is claiming that it will be injured by its decision to contribute money to the university. If it is so keen to prevent itself from being harmed, why doesn't the state simply refuse to give money to the school until the sanctions period has expired? Pennsylvania will not be injured by the NCAA's sanctions; it will be injured by its own decision to fund the university. No federal judge is going to find otherwise. I strongly suspect Pennsylvania's lawyers are well aware of the fundamental absurdity of their lawsuit. That is why the complaint repeatedly alludes to the losses that other people and parties will suffer from the NCAA sanctions; those others include local businesses, other students and sports teams at the university, season-ticket holders and the numerous merchandise vendors who profit from the financial success of this greatest-of-all revenue sports. Yet none of those other people would likely have standing to sue, so their inclusion only underscores the state's untenable litigation position. At times, the complaint filed by the state reads less like a legal document and more like a press release, extolling the fine virtues of a Penn State education amidst the hard-working townsfolk of central Pennsylvania. The complaint also strangely paints the NCAA in starkly negative hues, as if associating the organization with greed and its leadership with conspiracy will somehow make a difference. It goes so far as to smear the NCAA president for his handsome salary, noting that it constitutes a substantial raise over that of his predecessor. This lawsuit will probably not get past the motion to dismiss. The high point of the suit in Pennsylvania's eyes is now; get your shots in while you can. But imagine that Pennsylvania actually litigates to a successful conclusion and has the consent decree between Penn State and the NCAA overturned. What then? The NCAA can simply reopen the case and refer the matter to the infractions process, with the penalty of death the likely outcome for Penn State's Nittany Lions. If Joe were still here, he would tell you: Sometimes it's smarter to punt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Standen.","Gov.

"London (CNN) -- Before he died last year, Jimmy Savile was viewed as a kind of UK equivalent to American TV icon Dick Clark, gaining fame by bringing music to generations of teens. Savile was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He now stands accused as a predatory sex offender. The shocking allegations have Britain reeling. Countless viewers who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and his children's program ""Jim'll Fix It"" are now questioning their trust in a social institution: the British Broadcasting Corporation. It's the worst crisis at the BBC in 50 years, says a top correspondent, and the scandal has prompted a wider examination into an alleged culture of sexism stretching back decades within Britain's widely respected public broadcaster. The scandal has also gripped the British media, with many questioning who knew what and when about the alleged abuse of mostly teenage girls and whether there was any attempt at a coverup. Police say they have identified more than 200 potential victims, with accusations spanning several decades, and are investigating other suspects in connection with alleged abuse. Savile died in October 2011 at age 84, soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia. Related: Ex-Scout describes abuse by Savile . Savile's favored target was apparently girls in their mid-teens in what one officer, Cmdr. Peter Spindler, said was ""alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale."" The BBC, on whose premises some of the sexual assaults occurred, has found itself in the dock of public opinion seeking to explain how his behavior went undetected for decades. The national public broadcaster has set up two independent inquiries, and Director General George Entwistle was called before a panel of lawmakers Tuesday to defend its handling of the scandal -- including why the broadcaster decided to drop an investigation into the star last year. ""There is no question that what Jimmy Savile did and the way the BBC behaved in the years -- the culture and practices of the BBC seems to allow Jimmy Savile to do what he did -- will raise questions of trust for us and reputation for us,"" Entwistle said. ""This is a gravely serious matter, and one cannot look back at it with anything other than horror, frankly, that his activities went on as long as they did undetected."" Entwistle pointed out that the BBC was not alone in failing to uncover Savile's behavior, with no newspaper exposÃ© published in his lifetime. And he drew a parallel with a furor that has recently gripped the United States, where retired Penn State University football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted of molesting numerous children. ""Mr. Savile has prosecuted his activities, his disgusting activities, in a matter that was very successfully and skilfully concealed, and experts in pedophile behavior have pointed out that's often the case,"" Entwistle said. ""In the case of the United States, of Jerry Sandusky ... these people build very long-range plans to put them in contact with their targets. These things are institutionally, it seems, very difficult to deal with."" Related: National treasure in life, reviled 'sex abuser' in death . Savile had access to psychiatric hospital . The National Health Service also faces difficult questions over the access Savile was allowed to a number of hospitals. Among them was Broadmoor, a high-security psychiatric hospital where Savile worked as a volunteer and had keys to the wards. In 1988, he was appointed to a senior role there, a move now being investigated by the NHS. The police may also be asked to explain why past abuse claims against Savile never led to investigations resulting in a prosecution in his lifetime. How celebrity scandal has rocked the BBC . Reasons behind the national outrage over the scandal include Savile's privileged position as a broadcaster. At a time when viewers had only a handful of channels to choose from, Savile was a BBC mainstay. Savile's program aimed at children, ""Jim'll Fix It,"" ran for almost 20 years, airing in the prime Saturday teatime slot. Children wrote in with dreams they wanted the star to make come true -- and at the height of its popularity, the BBC said it was receiving 20,000 requests a week. The show's theme surrounded famous ""fixes"" that included an encounter between boxing legend Muhammad Ali and a group of Boy Scouts who also wanted to eat their packed lunches on a roller coaster, resulting in a predictable mess. Stories of abuse . Victims, male and female, have come forward with harrowing tales of sexual abuse. They also explain how the star's power and fame made it hard for them to speak out. Kevin Cook, who appeared on ""Jim'll Fix It"" as a Boy Scout at the age of 9, told of how he was invited into Savile's BBC dressing room after the show. Savile proceeded to undo his shorts and touch him inappropriately -- only stopping when someone else suddenly entered the room and, as abruptly, left. ""He said to me, 'don't you dare tell anyone about this because no one will believe it, because I'm King Jimmy,' "" Cook said. The boy could hardly bear to watch the show when it aired a few months later, to the great excitement of his family. ""I just hated the man,"" Cook said. ""I blamed myself for 37 years. That's the worst thing: You do blame yourself."" Harriet Harman, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, sympathized with the plight of the victims. ""Everyone has been sickened by the vile abuse perpetrated by Jimmy Savile, and it is impossible to overstate the suffering caused to those he abused,"" she said last week. Scandal rocks the BBC . Veteran BBC world affairs correspondent John Simpson gave an idea of the sense of disarray within the company during an interview broadcast Monday. ""This is the worst crisis that I can remember in my nearly 50 years at the BBC. ... I don't think the BBC has handled it terribly well. All we have as an organization is the trust of people, the people that watch us and listen to us. ... If we start to lose that, that's very dangerous for the BBC."" The BBC, which has repeatedly expressed its horror over the abuse, is now embroiled in painful internal turmoil, with the two independent inquiries raking over e-mails and conversations for evidence of who knew what when. One is focused on the culture and practices of the BBC, as well as the safeguards in place for members of the public and staff now and in the past, while the other is scrutinizing why its flagship current affairs program ""Newsnight"" dropped its investigation into Savile late last year. On Monday, the BBC said the program's editor, Peter Rippon, was ""stepping aside"" amid the furor. It labeled an October 2 blog post by Rippon explaining his decision to drop the investigation ""inaccurate or incomplete in some respects."" Hours later, another BBC program, ""Panorama,"" broadcast its own probe into the ""Newsnight"" decision, suggesting that serious allegations had been made to ""Newsnight"" reporters before the investigation was shelved. On Tuesday, Entwistle told lawmakers that having watched the program, he was ""surprised that nothing further happened"" in light of the material dug up by ""Newsnight."" Meanwhile, the scandal continues to dominate conversation in homes, workplaces and pubs across the country as people seek to understand how a man widely seen as an eccentric hero could have duped the nation and done so much harm. The debate is all the more uncomfortable as Savile appears to have used his access to children, through his charity and TV work, as a means to prey on vulnerable young people for decades -- and has gone to his grave unpunished.

"(CNN) -- The photographer who took the picture of a man about to be fatally struck by a New York subway car said Thursday that he did so in a desperate attempt to alert the driver of the train to stop. ""From where I was, I could have screamed my lungs out; probably nobody would have heard it,"" R. Umar Abbasi told CNN's Anderson Cooper about the incident Monday in which 58-year-old Ki-Suck Han had been shoved onto the tracks in a Times Square station as a train approached. ""The only way, I thought at that moment, was to start clicking away, releasing the shutter that will fire the flash, and make him aware that this is an unusual occurrence -- why is there a burst of light hitting him -- and catch Mr. Han on the track."" Abbasi, who asked that CNN note that he was not paid for the interview (CNN does not pay for any interviews), estimated that he had been 400 feet from Han when he saw in his peripheral vision a body being flung onto the tracks. ""There was a collective gasp that went into the air that really got my attention,"" he said. ""People started waving their hands and screaming because, a few moments earlier, they had made an announcement that the train will be approaching the station and I could see the distant lights of the approaching train."" Abbasi said he started running toward Han but stood aside and braced himself against the wall when he realized that the suspect was approaching him. ""He seemed agitated, and as he was approaching, he was cursing and using profanities."" Abbasi said the only thing he might have done differently would have been to urge Han to try to outrun the train. ""I would have said, 'Mr. Han, run the other direction,'"" he said. ""There were only about three cars in the station and all he had to do was outrun three cars and he would have lived."" Abbasi said he would have saved Han had he been able to do so. ""It wasn't important to get the photograph; the photograph came out as a result of my effort -- or what I could think at that moment to do."" Though he said he heard others urging Han to get up, ""I don't know why anyone did not reach out."" Abbasi said Han's end came quickly. ""I could hear the sounds,"" he said. ""I do not want to be too graphic about it for respect for the family, but I could hear all the sounds. Mr. Han did not scream or anything, this is how fast it transpired."" The whole experience, he said, has been traumatic for him. ""If I have to narrate the whole thing, it's like reliving it. I did not sleep for close to 36, 40 hours."" Even three days later, he said, the photograph is chilling to him. ""It's like I am looking at his end. And the oncoming train -- the metaphor for it -- death staring him down."" Abbasi dismissed those who say he should have helped as ""armchair critics."" Naeem Davis, 30, a homeless man, was arraigned late Wednesday in Han's death and charged with second-degree murder. His next scheduled court appearance is Tuesday. Opinion: Why the outrage over photo in subway death . Abbasi said he didn't look at the pictures before returning to the office and turning his camera's memory card over to police. The Post published them the next day. ""Doomed"" the headline screamed. ""Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die."" Readers and media critics quickly jumped on the newspaper's decision to use the image. On Twitter, users posted that it was cruel and ""snuff porn."" Lauren Ashburn, a media critic and editor in chief of the website Daily Download, called it ""profit-motive journalism at its worst."" ""It's insensitive, it's inappropriate, it's sickening rubbernecking,"" she said Wednesday. But Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" and the Washington bureau chief for The Daily Beast and Newsweek, said he sees an argument for publishing the image. ""Because this is every New Yorker's nightmare,"" he said. ""I do still wonder why the photographer's first instinct was to take pictures,"" he said. ""I do wonder that."" Jeff Sonderman, a fellow at the journalism think tank Poynter Institute, wrote on the organization's website that it appeared journalists were largely critical of the decision. ""Even if you accept that that photographer and other bystanders did everything they could to try to save the man, it's a separate question of what the Post should have done with that photo,"" he wrote. ""All journalists we've seen talking about it online concluded the Post was wrong to use the photo, especially on its front page."" Kenny Irby, a senior faculty member for visual journalism and diversity programs at Poynter, said Tuesday that what the paper did wasn't necessarily wrong. ""It was not illegal or unethical given that ethical guidelines and recommendations are not absolute,"" he said in an e-mail. But he also said the Post should have used another image. ""This moment was such for me -- it was too private in my view,"" he wrote. ""I am all for maximizing truth telling, while minimizing harm, which can be done by fully vetting the alternatives available and publishing with a sense of compassion and respect."" The Post is no stranger to walking up to the lines of journalistic ethics -- and sometimes crossing them -- with its pithy, often lurid, coverage of crime and other news in the Big Apple. ""HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR,"" the newspaper once famously shouted from its cover. Nor is the Post shot the first news photo to generate ethics concerns. An Agence France-Presse photo that won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize generated controversy for its depiction of a girl in Afghanistan crying amid a number of bloody bodies. Also this year, the New York Times published a graphic image showing blood streaming from the body of a victim after a fatal August shooting at the Empire State Building. At the time, Poynter quoted a Times spokeswoman as saying the image was ""a newsworthy photograph that shows the result and impact of a public act of violence."" CNN's Marina Carver, Pauline Kim, Yon Pomrenze and Mary Snow contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I would have said, 'Mr. Han, run the other direction,'"" photographer says .

"(CNN) -- An intense typhoon has carved across the southern Philippines, destroying buildings, setting off floods and landslides and killing at least 95 people, authorities said Wednesday. Typhoon Bopha struck the large southern island of Mindanao, which is rarely in the direct path of tropical cyclones, fueling fears that it could be as devastating as a storm that killed more than 1,200 people there almost a year ago. Bopha, the most powerful typhoon to hit Mindanao in decades, had top winds of 175 kph (110 mph) as it came ashore over the city of Baganga early Tuesday. Millions of people, many of whom live in remote and unprepared communities, were in the storm's path, Philippine authorities and aid groups said. Watch: iReporter captures Typhoon aftermath in southern Philippines . ""It really is getting to be a very, very big typhoon and it's just starting,"" Richard Gordon, the head of the Philippine Red Cross, said Tuesday. Trees have been uprooted and fragile houses blown away on Mindanao, Gordon said, adding that the corrugated iron roofs of some buildings were being carried through the air by the wind like ""flying machetes."" At least 95 people have been killed so far as a result of the storm, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said Wednesday. The typhoon has affected more than 213,000 people, demolished houses and stranded people in two Mindanao regions and parts of the Visayas region, according to the disaster agency. More than 179,000 people are in evacuation centers, it said. A landslide in eastern Mindanao blocked a national highway, the news agency reported, leavening hundreds of people in buses, vans and cars stuck on the road. iReport: Plight of typhoon evacuees . Maintenance workers were using heavy equipment to clear the mud and rocks, said Dennis Flores, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Works and Highways cited by the news agency. The tightly packed but fierce typhoon churned west northwest across the island, weakening slightly as it went, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said. By Wednesday morning, the center of the storm was approaching the outlying western island of Palawan. But it continued to soak a wide area with heavy rain, raising the risk of mudslides and flash floods elsewhere. The storm, dubbed ""Pablo"" in the Philippines, had blown up into a super typhoon at one point Monday as it moved over the ocean, with sustained winds greater than 240 kph -- the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported. That wind speed is two and a half times the top winds of Severe Tropical Storm Washi, known in the Philippines as Sendong, whose heavy rains swept away entire villages in the same region in December 2011. ""Many emotional people in (Mindanao) trying to prepare for Pablo with Sendong fresh in their minds,"" Carin van der Hor, the Philippines director for the children's charity Plan International, wrote Monday on Twitter. But local authorities have done a good job of relocating people out of vulnerable areas and preparing evacuation centers, said Gordon of the Red Cross. Washi, on the other hand, caught many residents off guard. It was a weaker storm, but its torrential rain triggered landslides and flash floods in the middle of the night, when many people were sleeping. More than 1,200 people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless, prompting a humanitarian crisis. Ahead of Bopha's arrival on Tuesday, government agencies relocated more than 50,000 people to evacuation centers. They also moved millions of dollars worth of relief supplies into position for quick delivery to storm-hit regions and put emergency crews, the military and hospitals on standby. School classes were suspended in many cities, and dozens of flights were canceled, according to the national disaster agency. Nearly 5,000 travelers were left stranded at ports across the country as of Wednesday because of disruption to ferry services. Palau, a tiny island nation roughly 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) east of Mindanao, had a close shave with Bopha earlier in the week as the typhoon churned past, catching some outlying parts of the archipelago. ""It was headed right toward Palau,"" said Derek Williams, a meteorologist for the U.S. National Weather Service in Guam. But at the last minute, ""it just turned to the west and fortunately went south of them,"" he said. ""I really think they escaped the brunt of the storm,"" Williams said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, noting that Palau doesn't usually get hit by strong typhoons. Bopha nonetheless brought down a lot of trees and caused widespread power outages in Palau, according to Williams. ""The fast movement of the system really prevented a lot of flooding,"" he said. ""I think probably only a few inches of rain fell, so that's certainly good news, because Palau itself is susceptible to mudslides.""

"(CNN) -- Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old Georgia woman who has waged a two-month battle against flesh-eating bacteria, was released from a hospital Monday. Copeland will enter a rehab facility for an undetermined amount of time before returning home after surgeons amputated most of her hands, one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the infection. She has also had multiple skin grafts after tissue was removed from her abdomen. ""Aimee is very excited, like a kid going off to college,"" her father, Andy, said Monday, ""but she also realizes that rehab will be arduous. But she says she will handle it."" Copeland was discharged Monday morning from Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, hospital spokesman Barclay Bishop said. Previously on CNN.com: Georgia woman with flesh-eating infection dramatically improves . Andy Copeland told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" last week his daughter is ready for new surroundings: ""She's been seeing those four walls inside that hospital for a long time."" He said, ""This next step is her opportunity to go (to) the next phase and learn something, be able to rehabilitate and basically relearn her life skills. She needs to be able to develop the autonomy to be able to transfer from her bed to a wheelchair to the shower to the bathroom or anywhere else in the house. And she can do it."" Aimee Copeland had gone outside the hospital in a wheelchair at least once, June 24, as her condition improved, her father said in his blog. Copeland's ordeal began May 1 when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and received a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Since then, her father has blogged about her situation regularly. A Facebook page devoted to her fight has more than 78,000 ""likes."" A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis. When the bacteria get into the bloodstream, such as through a cut, doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. Advocate: Story of rare bacterial infection raising awareness . The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Copeland has remained positive throughout the ordeal that brought her to the brink of death, her sister told ""OutFront."" ""She's just amazing because she just knows that she's blessed and she is just so happy to be alive,"" Paige Copeland said. ""Aimee, she cherishes life. She relishes life.

"Ambergris Caye, Belize (CNN) -- To look for John McAfee, you must be willing to travel a narrow, rutted and muddy road. And the more I bumped and backfired along it in my temperamental, rented, gas golf cart ... the deeper down the rabbit hole I fell. This is one weird story. Some say it began a week ago Friday when the man who practically invented Internet security, John McAfee, shot his dogs. McAfee 'frightened for his life' Others say it goes back to April when police raided his compound on the mainland looking for drugs and guns. They found both but the guns had permits and the drugs were legal. Some say police never got over their disappointment. The Austrian woman I had picked up with my golf cart told me McAfee was trying to make a female version of Viagra. I'm not in the habit of picking up hitchhikers but it's customary here to give a lift to locals. As they say, ""You never know when YOU might need a ride."" Judging by the sound of my golf cart, that time wasn't far off. McAfee lives in the remote northern part of Ambergris Caye, an island 36 miles from the Belize mainland. I hopped a 15-minute prop-powered shuttle only to find his home was an additional six miles from the town of San Pedro. You might wonder why someone with so much money would live so far from town down such a difficult road. Rounding a sandy curve it quickly became obvious: the staggering beauty of the Belize Barrier Reef coast. Residents say the farther north on the island you go the higher the price of real estate. McAfee's view is worth a fortune. An endless stretch of blue sky overhangs an ocean of pastel greens and blues framed by coconut palms. Next to a long wooden dock with chairs at its end sits a fast-looking boat with twin outboards. I take a seat in McAfee's front yard. Under Belize law I'm not trespassing since the beach is public property. Behind me the wood-sided, thatch-roofed home painted purple and yellow sits eerily empty with one porch light on. A rusted telescope on a balcony stares off to the horizon. The only sound is the wind. The day before, I met ""Tiffany"" here. She claimed to be one of McAfee's girlfriends, one of seven. They all live together, sharing McAfee's houses and fantasies. He's 67. Tiffany says she's 23 and they have been lovers for three years. The girl beside her gives no name and only says she's 19. Tiffany says she's not seen or heard from McAfee in nearly a week -- not since the neighbor, Greg Faull, was discovered dead and McAfee went into hiding. Three arrested in killing in Belize . Now a day later the 23-year-old had vanished too. Half a dozen dogs lie sorry-looking or listless in the yard -- thin, hungry and thirsty. They're lucky to be alive. Dogs just might be the key to this mystery. Officials say their barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a 52-year-old contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door. On November 9, McAfee told police someone poisoned four of his dogs. Tiffany said to put them out of their misery he shot each one in the head and buried them. Then two days later someone shot Faull in the head in his own living room. A 9mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor, and Faull was found dead on the second floor. And McAfee had vanished. Police say they only want to talk to the famous internet security guru. Instead, McAfee talks only to reporters. Over a phone, he gives out all sorts of colorful quotes and tantalizing hints of his whereabouts, each contradicting the previous. He talks about moving every four hours and sleeping on a lice-infested bed, of watching ""Rawhide"" on an old tube TV, then claiming to be in a house not far from his compound, then no, actually he's been in his compound the whole time, saying he doesn't like the look of the traffic on the highway. This island has no highway. This almost daily ""catch me if you can"" game is wearing thin on investigators. The longer it all goes on, the more suspicious police become. Police want to question McAfee . So five days ago they dug up his dogs. I found the partially exposed graves next to a trash pit in the back behind his priceless ocean view. The flies led me there. I asked a caretaker if he was here when the police came for them. ""Yes"" he said, then added another tick up the strange-o-meter by revealing, ""They cut off their heads."" Since only the heads had bullets, the investigators put the rest of the remains back in the holes, then hurriedly and poorly recovered them. A source close to the investigation said authorities probably want to see if the slugs in the dogs match the one in Faull. I stepped on the gas and my golf cart sputtered to life. Like me, it seemed to dread the bone-jarring return to town. My phone beeped; a local friend texted me to say McAfee had just proclaimed a $25,000-dollar (just over 12,000 U.S. dollars) reward for information leading to the arrest of Faull's killer. A murdered neighbor, headless dogs and a millionaire on the run granting interviews and now offering a lottery-like reward. Maybe someone could make up a more intriguing story ... but it wouldn't be easy.","Internet security pioneer is in hiding after neighbor's killing .

"(CNN) -- Police have abandoned a ground search for a man who went missing five days ago over the Cascade Mountains in Washington. Kurt Ruppert of Lake City, Florida, disappeared Thursday after he jumped from out of a helicopter at 6,500 feet while wearing a special jumpsuit known as a ""wingsuit,"" which allows a person to soar and glide before deploying a parachute. ""The only areas left to search are areas (authorities are) not able to search on the ground. They're steep cliffs and ravines, and when the weather clears, we'll hopefully get our helicopter back up there to look,"" Sgt. Cindy West, a spokeswoman for the King County Sheriff's Office, said Monday. It is unlikely Ruppert is still alive given the low temperatures on Mount Si where rescuers have focused their search, authorities said. ""Initially we thought he was probably flying 50 to 60 miles per hour,"" West said, ""but after talking to his jump friends, we found more likely he was traveling 80 to 100 miles per hour, which ... in just a matter of a few seconds he's going to be over a large area. And then the other issue is we don't know exactly what direction he went."" In a written statement issued Sunday, West said: ""There are cliff areas that could not be searched due to the extreme risk to searchers. The Sheriff's Office said they will search those areas by helicopter when weather permits."" CNN affiliate KOMO reported there was too much fog on Monday for air crews.

"New York (CNN) -- The Manhattan district attorney announced Thursday new indictments against Rodney Alcala, the so-called ""Dating Game Killer,"" in connection with the deaths of two women in New York during the 1970s. Alcala, 67, is currently on death row in California for killing four women and a 12-year-old girl there. He was convicted of those crimes in February 2010 and sentenced the following month. The California murders took place between November 1977 and June 1979 and covered a wide swath of suburban Los Angeles, from Burbank to El Segundo. ""Cold cases are not forgotten cases -- our prosecutors, investigators, and partners in the NYPD do not give up,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. ""These cases were built one brick at a time, as each new lead brought us closer to where we are today."" Alcala is charged with murder in the deaths of Cornelia Crilley and Ellen Hover in New York. ""Ms. Crilley, a 23-year-old TWA flight attendant, was found raped and strangled inside her Upper East Side apartment in June of 1971,"" Vance said in a news release. ""Ms. Hover, who was also 23 and living in Manhattan, was found murdered in Westchester County in 1977. In 1978, Alcala was a winning bachelor on the television show ""The Dating Game."" At the time, he had been convicted in the 1968 rape of an 8-year-old girl, authorities said. He served a 34-month sentence. Police investigating Alcala found dozens of photographs of women and children in a storage locker he kept in Seattle. The locker also contained earrings belonging to Robin Samsoe, his 12-year-old victim, according to the Orange County, California, district attorney's office. Authorities asked for the public's help in determining whether any of the people in the photographs were victims of Alcala. A year before his appearance on ""The Dating Game,"" according to prosecutors, Alcala raped, sodomized and killed 18-year-old Jill Barcomb and 27-year-old nurse Georgia Wixted in California. He used a large rock to smash Barcomb's face in, prosecutors said, and strangled her to death by tying a belt and pants leg around her neck. Her body was discovered in a mountainous area in the foothills near Hollywood. Wixted was beaten with the claw end of a hammer, authorities said, and strangled to death with a nylon stocking. Her body was left in her Malibu apartment. On ""The Dating Game,"" Alcala was introduced as a ""successful photographer"" who might also be found sky diving or motorcycling. In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. And the same month, he raped and murdered Jill Parenteau, 21, strangling her with a cord or a stocking in her Burbank apartment. Alcala's blood was collected from the scene after he cut himself crawling out a window. ""Based on a semi-rare blood match, Alcala was linked to the murder,"" the district attorney said. He was charged with murdering Parenteau, but the case was dismissed after he was convicted of killing Samsoe in 1979. Alcala approached her at the beach in Huntington Beach and asked her to pose for pictures, authorities said. She did, they said, and Alcala then kidnapped and murdered her, dumping her body in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. Alcala was convicted of Samsoe's death in 1980 and sentenced to die, but the California Supreme Court overturned his conviction. A second trial in 1986 also resulted in a conviction and death sentence, but it was overturned by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

"Berlin (CNN) -- The opening of Berlin's new international airport has been postponed again, officials said, in the latest of a series of setbacks that have led some in Germany to slam the project as a national embarrassment. Willy Brandt International Airport, south of the German capital, was originally due to go into service in June 2012 but has been plagued with problems. Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit stood down as head of the supervisory board overseeing the project on Monday, as he acknowledged the airport would still not be ready for its latest scheduled opening on October 27. Wowereit declined to name a date for the beginning of flight operations. BER, the company managing the construction, said in a statement: ""Reasons for the renewed delays are problems with the fire extinguishing system, especially with regards to the fresh air vents in case of fire, but also the complexity of the entire construction situation."" The airport's original opening in June 2012 was canceled only days beforehand, when problems with the sprinkler systems came to light. Speaking at a news conference in Berlin Monday, Wowereit said he would hand over his duties as head of the project's supervisory board to Matthias Platzeck, the governor of the state of Brandenburg. The mayor has been heavily criticized for the delays, which various politicians and media outlets have called a ""national disgrace."" The city of Berlin and the state of Brandenburg are the main parties involved in the construction of the airport, with the German federal government also footing part of the bill. Regina Pop, head of the opposition Green Party in Berlin's City Parliament, said: ""So far the mayor has only admitted things that became public anyway. That is not what transparency and crisis management need to look like. ""It remains unclear how the construction and restoration of the airport can be finished in a solid way."" Germany's largest daily newspaper, BILD, has called the situation surrounding Berlin's new signature airport a ""disgrace for Germany,"" and quoted several international reports on the problems with the construction process. Citing internal sources, the newspaper reports that the airport will not commence operations before 2014. Officials have declined to confirm whether that is the case.","The opening of Willy Brandt International Airport in Berlin is delayed again .

"Washington (CNN) -- The bar has never been lower for the nearly 100 freshmen of the 113th Congress who were sworn-in on Thursday. After all, it won't take much to exceed the abysmal approval rating of the previous Congress. Despite the usual burst optimism of a freshman class on Capitol Hill and the sentiment to reach across the aisle and dissolve partisan gridlock, recent history shows those pledges are destined to falter like so many New Year's resolutions. ""On the day people are sworn in they are entitled to dream,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""The idea that they are going to bridge the unbridgeable gap between the two parties is indeed a dream."" Obama signs fiscal cliff bill into law . The new Congress faces many of the same stubborn issues that make bipartisanship in a politically divided country difficult to achieve. Although Washington averted the worst aspects of the fiscal cliff earlier this week, the automatic spending cuts, or sequester, that were a centerpiece of that debate for months but cut out of the final deal at the last minute are coming around again in February. At about the same time, lawmakers will have to consider raising the nation's debt ceiling, or the ability of the Treasury to borrow money to pay the nation's bills. Both sides are already digging in on spending and debt. Are days of Congress 'going big' over? A fresh controversy involves assistance to victims of Superstorm Sandy. An aid bill approved by the Senate was shelved on Tuesday night by House Speaker John Boehner over concerns that voting on a big spending package immediately after approving a fiscal cliff deal that excluded deficit reduction would send a bad political signal. New York and New Jersey politicians were incensed at Boehner's inaction, prompting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to growl: that this is ""why the American people hate Congress."" A scaled-back version of $9 billion for immediate aid for flood insurance will be considered by both houses on Friday. Lawmakers will weigh the balance of the $60 billion plan later this month. Furor over dropped vote for Sandy aid defused . Further out on the horizon is an expected fight over gun control, a high priority for the White House in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre that will face push-back from congressional members with high ratings and big-dollar donations from gun rights advocates. Immigration reform, another White House priority, will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress. All in all, the sharp divisions on Capitol Hill are still evident and expectations for meaningful progress on substantive issues are not high. ""My sense is that things are not going to be that different because the fundamental divisions that existed in the previous Congress are still there,"" said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. New faces on Capitol Hill . ""We still have a Democratic Senate and Republican House. We still have a divided Congress. The ideological divisions between the parties are as great as they were in the last Congress,"" he said. The divide is widened by a continued attrition of moderates, who lost or retired from seats on both sides of the aisle in both chambers. But on the other side of the question there have been subtle shifts in numbers and other changes that could make a difference in how votes on some issues play out, political experts say. Republicans retained control of the House in November but Democrats gained seats there and expanded their control of the Senate. Republicans now fill 234 seats in the new House, down from 242. There are 201 House Democrats, up from 193. In the Senate, voters handed two former GOP seats to Democrats for a new balance of 55-45. The 55 Democratic seats include two independents who caucus with the party. Kirk makes emotional return after stroke . For the first time, the House Democratic caucus is dominated by women and racial minorities, while the Republican caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men. Over in the Senate, 20 women â€” the largest number in history â€” will be sworn in. The increased diversity ""means that we reflect America more,"" said newly elected Illinois Democrat Rep. Tammy Duckworth. ""You know the district where I come from is a very diverse district, and it is good to see Congress starting to look more like the rest of America. And you see the demographic shifts that are happening across the country."" Partisanship remains strong, however, political experts say. ""Those things are interesting and it's a good thing to have that diversity ... but just that party attached to the person's name explains the roll call. It doesn't matter the race or the gender. It's the party affiliation,"" Sabato said. Boehner, whose relationship with President Barack Obama frayed further during the fiscal cliff negotiations, received the gavel again on Thursday when he was re-elected to lead the chamber. While 220 of the 234 House Republicans voted for the Ohio lawmaker, a few members didn't answer, simply voted ""present,"" or cast ballots for other candidates. Following the fiscal cliff fight, Boehner is telling colleagues no more negotiating deals and that ""regular order works best"" from now on. Boehner also signaled the upcoming debt showdown in remarks following his re-election, saying that taming debt was the most important thing for restoring long-term U.S. economic health. ""At $16 trillion and rising, our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state. The American Dream is in peril so long as its namesake is weighed down by this anchor of debt. Break its hold, and we begin to set our economy free,"" he said. Boehner, under fire from some conservatives, re-elected speaker . Obama had stern words for the 113th Congress, warning lawmakers that he will not tolerate the kind of prolonged brinksmanship that defined the fiscal cliff saga. ""While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they've passed,"" he said shortly after the House passed the fiscal cliff bill. Obama calls for less 'drama,' 'brinkmanship' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell responded sharply in an opinion piece for Yahoo News, insisting that spending would be part of the debate over the debt ceiling. The incoming freshman class took notes on failures of the previous Congress in hopes of avoiding a repeat performance. Incoming freshmen ""learned a lot from what happened over the last few weeks with the fiscal cliff debacle,"" freshman Texas Democrat Rep. Joaquin Castro said on CNN, adding that the takeaway for a lot of his class is to strengthen bipartisan ties. ""A lot of us come in with that mind frame,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has the weight of a nation on his shoulders at Euro 2012, but the world's most expensive footballer is struggling to make an impact for Portugal. Mocked by opposing fans after uncharacteristic misses against Denmark, the man who seemingly scores at will for Real Madrid is under extreme pressure ahead of Sunday's final Group B clash with the Netherlands. The Dutch need to win by two goals to have any chance of reaching the quarterfinals, while 2004 runners-up Portugal could go through with a draw if Denmark cannot beat leaders Germany. Ronaldo scored 46 goals in 38 league games as Real wrested the Spanish title off Barcelona last season, but Denmark fans chanted the name of Lionel Messi -- his rival for the title of world's best player -- in Portugal's last-gasp 3-2 victory on Wednesday. However, former Portugal goalkeeper Vitor Baia told CNN that Ronaldo does not deserve the criticism he has received for his performances so far. ""Cristiano is a fantastic player and is our captain and is doing very well,"" said Baia, who won 80 international caps and played at two European Championships and the 2002 World Cup. ""He's working, he's helping the team. Okay we are always expecting Ronaldo can win the game alone, but sometimes it is not possible. ""Now he's playing for the team, that is very important. When he cannot make the difference, he helps the team. That's what a captain has to do in this situation."" Portugal's defensive approach under coach Paulo Bento has mystified football pundits and fans alike, especially given the glimpses of the team's undoubted attacking skills in the final 20 minutes of the 1-0 defeat by Germany. Baia expects similar tactics in the match in Kharkiv. ""We will play on the counterattack because it's the way we played in the other two matches. It will be the same because Holland has to win this game,"" he said. ""We did not start so well against Germany with a defensive strategy -- we have so much quality in our players to play in that way. But in the second game, we played better -- not the way we like it. ""We played better until 2-2 and then we suffered a little bit, but at the end we scored a third goal and now we are in a fantastic position to go to the next round because this is a very tough group, it's the most difficult group in this European Cup."" It has been called the ""Group of Death"" -- and the Netherlands are fighting for their lives after two successive defeats. The 2010 World Cup finalists suffered a shock 1-0 loss to Denmark, and then were dominated in the first half by Germany before losing 2-1 as star names such as Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wes Sneijder failed to combine their undoubted talents. Former international Boudewijn Zenden remains hopeful that the 1988 champions can continue their record of reaching the last eight in their last six appearances at the tournament. ""Two-nil to Holland -- I'm still confident! It's going to be really, really tough. Portugal needs to win, Holland needs to win ... Denmark needs to win -- it's still a group where anything can happen,"" he said. Zenden, who helped the ""Oranje"" reach the semifinals of Euro 2000 and 2004, said coach Bert van Marwijk might make changes against Portugal. ""The manager hasn't changed much over the last years, he always tries to play with two central holding midfielders and let the other four play in front of them and go forward,"" the 35-year-old said. ""There's been a lot of talk in the press that maybe he should play just one holding midfielder and put maybe Rafael van der Vaart back in the team to get some more drive forward. ""The big shout is for Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who is the top goalscorer in the Bundesliga, for him to play up front and maybe find a different position for Van Persie, so maybe that's what will happen. ""He made a big point by substituting (captain and the coach's son-in-law) Mark van Bommel the other day at halftime. Ibrahim Afellay got dragged off, it's all signals that there has to be a change when playing against Portugal."" Van Marwijk has been in charge since 2008, and last year extended his contract until Euro 2016, but Zenden suggested that the 60-year-old might not last that long if the Dutch crash out early. ""The Dutch FA came out and said even if they don't qualify he'll keep his job. We know that Van Marwijk signed a new deal with a clause in there (saying) when he finds a top team in Europe he can leave,"" Zenden said. ""Well maybe he put that in for himself. Maybe if it doesn't work out at the Euros, with mutual consent you can say, 'Well, if you find a nice club you can do it this way,' and he might say goodbye.""","Final games in Euro 2012's ""Group of Death"" to be played in Ukraine on Sunday .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- All indications are that sanctions against Iran are really starting to bite and this time it is coming from the oil ministry in Tehran, which for months has denied that oil production was suffering due to international pressure. In an interview with the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA), Gholam Reza Kateb a member of the national planning and budget committee in Parliament referenced a report from Iran's oil minister Rostam Qasemi. In that report, the minister suggested that oil revenues in the country plummeted 40 percent, while gas and gas products' export revenues fell by 45% compared to the same period last year. Read more: Official: Iran, nuclear watchdog group deal close . This is a hot button issue in Iran, where the currency due to sanctions has dropped 80 percent from its peak in 2011. The Iranian people are faced with spiralling inflation and job layoffs within the state sector. I spoke with a source in Iran's representative office to OPEC who declined to comment and referred all matters to the Oil Ministry. A spokesman at the state oil company Iran Petroleum would only say ""in this political climate it is difficult to confirm these statements."" Read more: Iran steps up uranium enrichment, U.N. report says . Hours later, a spokesman from the Ministry told another Iranian news agency, Mehr, that the numbers quoted about revenue and production drops are not true, although he offered no specific numbers. Until this report to the Iranian Parliament, Minister Qasemi has maintained that Iran's production was hovering around four million barrels a day, where it was two years ago. Read more: Opinion: Time to defuse Iranian nuclear issue . Back at the OPEC Seminar in June 2012, the minister told me that sanctions would not have any influence on plans to expand production and investment, shrugging off questions that suggested otherwise. This despite analysis to the contrary from the Paris based International Energy Agency and Vienna based OPEC of which Iran is a member. The IEA back in July suggested that Iraq surpassed Iran in production for the first time in over two decades and production in Iran dipped to 2.9 million barrels a day. OPEC in its October 2012 survey said it slipped to 2.72 million at the time Minister Qasemi said output remained at 4 million barrels. Minister Qasemi was recently quoted at a conference in Tehran that Iran needs to invest $400 billion over the next five years to maintain production targets and to play catch up after years of under investment. Iran is a land full of potential. According to the annual BP Statistical Review, Iran sits on nearly 10 percent of the world's proven reserves at 137 billion barrels. The South Pars field which it shares with Qatar is one of the largest natural gas fields in the world -- but Iran, due to sanctions, cannot expand development. This is a highly charged period. With elections in mid-June, it remains unclear how energy policy will evolve after the era of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad passes. It has been eight years of his tough line against Washington, Brussels and other governments that put forth sanctions against Iran. It is not clear if a new President will usher in a new nuclear development policy to ease the pressure on Iran's energy sector and the country's people.","The IEA has suggested Iraq surpassed Iran in output for the first time in over 20 years .

"(CNN) -- Rafael Benitez was given a red-hot reception at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea fans vented their fury at its team's new manager. The Spaniard, who coached his side to a goalless draw with Manchester City, was subjected to chants and taunts throughout the game by home supporters. The former Liverpool manager replaced Roberto Di Matteo after the Italian was sacked by owner Roman Abramovich last week. Benitez takes over Chelsea hot seat . But many of the club's supporters are unhappy with the decision given last season's FA Cup and Champions League triumphs. In the 16th minute, fans began to sing and applaud Di Matteo, who wore the number 16 shirt during his time as a player at the west London club. But Benitez, whose side sit fourth and five points off leaders Manchester United, insists the hostile welcome did not bother him. ""I am focused on the game, I don't listen to the crowd,"" he told reporters. ""The main thing was the team on the pitch. I was not listening, I was just concentrating on the game. ""It was a tough game against a good team, no clear chances for them or us. ""It's not the ideal (result) but to have a clean sheet and to see the spirit and mentality and work rate was quite positive. ""You could see they were trying really hard with and without the ball and against a great team they had some chances."" City, who exited the Champions League during the week, are second in the league, a point behind neighbours United. Di Matteo sacked by Chelsea . But manager Roberto Mancini felt his side should have done better, especially after Sergio Aguero missed a glorious opportunity early on. ""We were so poor in the last 20 metres,"" Mancini said.

"(CNN) -- Eight weeks after the terrorist attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, it is encouraging that Congress is finally serious about examining the events surrounding that day. As the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Rogers, said on ""Meet the Press"" recently, this was not an intelligence failure. But failures clearly happened elsewhere, particularly in the State Department. State Department documents revealed that slain Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and others had warned several times of ""growing problems with security"" and violence in eastern Libya, where Benghazi is located, after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi and after the Transitional National Council moved its governing headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli in September 2011. Stevens' predecessor Ambassador Gene Cretz had also sent cables to the State Department warning of the deepening security crisis in Libya. Well before the Benghazi attack, our intelligence agencies, Department of Defense and State Department cables from the U.S. Embassy in Libya all warned of a growing security crisis. They said terrorists from across the region, including al Qaeda elements believed to be associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, were able to travel freely into the country to recruit, organize, plan attacks and procure weapons. This is not to suggest these attacks were planned months in advance. We don't know, but we do know that they were premeditated. We also know that the CIA believed the Benghazi tragedy on September 11 was the work of terrorists within hours of the attacks. Conducting diplomacy on behalf of the United States is not without risks. U.S. foreign service officers and members of the diplomatic corps understand this. I think it is important that the U.S. continue to show the flag in far-flung corners of the world, some of which may often be dangerous. Peter Bergen: Republican obsession with Benghazi makes no sense . Diplomats like Stevens thrive on engaging with the local population. That important work must continue in Libya, Pakistan, Egypt and other countries that pose difficulties. However, the U.S. government has a responsibility to ensure that our posts overseas are properly fortified and defended, based on the security situation on the ground. We know that the security at the U.S. mission in Benghazi and the CIA annex was woefully inadequate. It should have been fortified, and more reliable security forces were clearly needed to defend those facilities. Immediate access to heavier weapons may have saved lives. It is important to decide which elements of the U.S. national security structure should be available to support the defense and extraction of U.S. diplomats and personnel if they come under fire. The State Department needs a clear procedure, understood by all, to communicate with the Department of Defense or the CIA in emergencies. We need to resolve why the nearest defense rescue team was six hours away and why teams weren't deployed that might have been able to save the lives of the two Americans at the CIA annex who died in the early hours of September 12. Although there are no obvious targets for fighter jets, the mere presence of an American or allied F-15 nearby could strongly deter attackers. Because the uppermost purpose of any inquiry is to prevent such a tragedy from happening again, we need to know what measures Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has taken to ensure that decisions about security and requirements of U.S. diplomatic missions are given the highest priority. We understand from congressional testimony that the deputy assistant secretary for international programs in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has broad authority over the allocation of security resources, with life and death consequences for our diplomats. Given the vulnerability of nontraditional posts like Benghazi, we should determine whether higher-level officials should oversee security issues. If not, we must be sure that anyone assuming such a position is adequately qualified in overseas security operations and threat analysis. We must also ensure that clear mechanisms are in place to enable a seamless emergency response among the different agencies that share responsibility. On all these counts, we have more questions right now than answers. It is very important to establish how far the U.S. commitment to Libya extends. While the U.S. played a role in helping the Libyans overthrow Gadhafi, we need to assess how this attack affects our plan for a post-Gadhafi Libya. I believe the U.S. has a responsibility to help the Libyans develop their defense services through the expansion of the Defense Department's Section 1206 training and equipment programs. The U.S. must also support the Libyans in forging a new constitution that respects the rights of all and begins to restore governance to their country. Americans have watched recent developments in Libya with great sadness and concern. We have a strong interest in helping a secular, pro-American government that rejects Islamic extremism take root. Unfortunately, this attack and the confusion stemming from the administration's response have led some to conclude that Libya is more trouble than it's worth. But our interests in Libya are worth pursuing, and getting answers and developing solutions to prevent future tragedies are critical to our national interest. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Marco Rubio.","Marco Rubio: Answers from Congress' Benghazi inquiry will help prevent another tragedy .

"(MNN.com) -- While every dog is different, most canines enter their geriatric phase at seven to eight years of age. As with humans, advanced age can lead to arthritis, decreased mobility and decreased organ functions. An expert from my pooch's veterinary clinic offers the following tips to help embrace your dog's inner puppy as the years go by: . Keep up the exercise . Don't discount those daily walks. Even if the pace is a little slower these days, it's a way to bond with your dog and burn calories together. Just be sure to monitor your pet during and after the walk. Dogs don't sweat the way humans do, so be mindful of excessive panting or signs of exhaustion. If your dog is like my sister's 10-year-old dog, Daisy, it will simply stop when enough is enough. If you have a couch potato, introduce exercise on a gradual basis. A few minutes of fetch each day can keep dogs active and mentally stimulated. MNN.com: Why are compostable dog bags are so hard to find? Watch the weight . On a small frame, an extra three to five pounds can strain hips and joints. Since older animals are less active, they also require fewer calories so resist the urge to over love them with food. In a 2009 study, the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention noted that 45 percent of U.S. dogs are overweight or obese and the numbers have been increasing steadily. As with human companions, pooches also face weigh-related health hazards such as diabetes, heart and joint issues. Talk to your veterinarian about reducing portions or switching to a senior formula, which has fewer calories and often includes joint-friendly supplements such as glucosamine and chondroitin. A smaller-size kibble or softer food also may be necessary to aid in digestion. I've added a bit of warm water or veggie broth to help soften Daisy's food during her visits. Schedule regular checkups: An annual veterinary exam is recommended for all dogs. Older dogs also should undergo blood work so vets can catch any internal issues such as kidney or liver damage. In some breeds, biannual blood work is recommended. Talk to your vet about blood tests during the next visit. It's a great way to monitor breed-related health issues before they become serious. MNN.com: Disabilities no longer a death sentence for pets . Keep it simple . A dog's vision and sense of smell can diminish with age. Be sure to keep things simple by removing obstacles from around the house. It also helps to establish a routine for older dogs and avoid sudden schedule changes. Pet steps or doggie ramps also provide easy access to your dog's favorite spots without risk of injury. Make sure that pet bedding is soft to cushion old joints or an elevated bed, which you'll often see in animal shelters because they offer easy access while keeping dogs off the floor. Take note of toys . Try toys that are gentler on your dog's teeth and jaws. Contrasting colors make balls and plush pull toys easier for older eyes to track down. Eco-friendly pet company PlanetDog.com has a line of toys for ""old souls"" that feature ""slobber-wick"" technology, super loud squeaks and softer material for older jaws. Also, make sure playtime is still fun by adding new activities. You really can teach an old dog new tricks. MNN.com: An introduction to pet nutrition . Protect those chompers . Teeth become more brittle with age. Make sure to check your dog's teeth regularly and watch for signs of tartar or gum disease. Check out tips from an earlier column on keeping those teeth pearly white and avoiding ""dog breath."" Socialize, socialize, socialize . Older dogs need love, too. They make the best cuddle bugs, especially for elderly relatives. Interacting with younger dogs also may help your pooch stay young at heart. Try one-on-one play dates with other dogs. Also, consider fostering a dog from a local rescue group. It's a short-term commitment that allows your pet to help another dog learn the ropes and -- hopefully -- land a forever home. © Copyright 2011 Mother Nature Network .","For the best quality of life, your older dog requires special care .

"(CNN) -- Those who possess illegally downloaded of music or films in Japan can face prison term of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen (U.S. $25,679), according to a new law which takes effect Monday. The move is aimed to stop falling music sales in the world's second largest music market, where industry officials estimate only one in 10 downloads are legally purchased. The new law is a victory for the recording industry's global fight against online piracy, which has seen setbacks in the U.S. and European Union where the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), respectively, has run afoul of the public, which fears it will curb online freedom and privacy. The Recording Industry Association of Japan says the download music market shrank 16% in 2011, the second consecutive year of decline. The slide comes despite global sales of digital music increasing 8% last year to $5.2 billion, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Globally, one in four internet users ""regularly access unlicensed services,"" according to an IFPI/Nielsen survey. The Japanese music industry is hoping to replicate the success of South Korea, which has seen its global market ranking jump to 11th in the world from 23rd after the country cracked down on download piracy beginning in 2007, according the IFIP's 2012 ""Digital Music Report."" South Korean laws require Internet providers to send notices to users who illegally download music, with 70% of infringers stopping after first notification, IFPI says.

"(CNN) -- Here are the latest key developments in the violence between Gaza and Israel, and the diplomatic efforts to bring peace, including a cease-fire announced earlier Wednesday. Read CNN's full story on the attacks and the talks here . (4:30 p.m. ET, 11:30 p.m. local) Israel makes arrest in Tel Aviv bus bombing . Israel has made an arrest in Wednesday's bus bombing in Tel Aviv that wounded 24 people, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces said Thursday. ... (4:40 a.m. ET, 11:40 a.m. local) IDF says fewer rockets from Gaza; death toll rises . An Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman says three rockets have flown out of Gaza toward Israel since the cease-fire began. Earlier figures of five to 12 rockets mentioned by officials are incorrect. Two of the rockets hit open areas, and one was intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system, she said. The death toll in Gaza rose to 163 and 1,225 others wounded as residents and rescuers pulled more people from piles of rubble. ... (9 p.m. ET, 4 a.m. local) The cease-fire is holding . ""We assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold,"" Israel's ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, told CNN after initial reports of rockets still being launched from Gaza into Israel. ""I understand now that it has taken hold. There hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire."" ... (8:30 p.m. ET, 3:30 a.m. local) The agreement . The agreement calls for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to Egypt's state news agency EGYNews. It was the November 14 assassination by Israeli forces of Ahmed al-Jaabari, the head of Hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting. It also calls for the Palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from Gaza against Israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. Border crossings were to be opened Thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said. ... (6:15 p.m. ET, 1:15 a.m. local) People in Gaza celebrate cease-fire . Gazans have been taking to the streets, firing their guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over Israel's military. ""Their attempts backfired against them,"" Khaled Meshaal, a Hamas political leader, said of Israel at a news conference Wednesday night. ""They wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of Hamas. They claim they have done so, and they have not. They are bankrupt."" He cited Israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. ""This is their accomplishment,"" he said. ""They have nothing else to show. And our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute."" Besides a cease-fire, the agreement calls for the discussion of a number of issues, including freedom of movement in and out of Gaza and a commitment by Israel not to target Palestinian militants within Gaza. ... (2:19 p.m. ET, 9:19 p.m. local) Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev on cease-fire agreement . Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said the agreement calls for ""complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the Gaza Strip."" ""For us, that's victory. That's what we wanted,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Israel will hold Hamas responsible for any attacks from Gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, Regev said. He said the agreement reflects that understanding. Regev also said the deal calls for immediate talks on economic restrictions on Gaza. ""If the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming,"" he said. ""The arrangements agreed with the Egyptians say we'll start talking from tomorrow about a process to work on those issues."" ... (12:49 p.m. ET, 7:49 p.m. local) U.S. President Barack Obama on cease-fire announcement .

(12:15 p.m. ET, 7:15 p.m. local) Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal on the Tel Aviv bus attack . CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour, in an interview in Cairo, asked Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal whether Hamas was responsible for Wednesday's bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv, Israel. ""Not Hamas, not others, not other people from, not Hamas. No one can announce except those who committed (it), not me,"" Meshaal said. ""The lesson is what matters. What led to this? Who created the circumstances that led to this (operation)? It is (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu with his crimes, in killing the kids of Gaza, and the continuity of aggression. He (creates) such ramifications everywhere. This could lead to any kind of reaction as retaliation for what happened in Gaza."" ... (9:25 a.m. ET, 4:25 p.m. local) Israeli President Shimon Peres on chances for a cease-fire . CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Peres if there would be a cease-fire. ""I hope so,"" Peres replied. ""It is not yet done. There are difficulties, in any negotiation there are difficulties, but this time their expectations are over the horizon. But we are waiting and trying. The situation is very strange; both sides won't like a ground operation, neither us or them. A cease-fire is preferred by both sides, but the conditions they start to put (out) are little bit exaggerated."" When asked what Hamas wanted of Israel, he added: ""They want Israel to do nothing. We shall not fly over, we shall not guard the border. Many others. The conditions of Israel (are) basically security conditions. Their conditions are political ones, and this is a contradiction."" ... (8:43 a.m. ET, 3:43 p.m. local) State Department on Hillary Clinton talks with Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank .

"(CNN) -- Sunday's showpiece European Championship final in the Ukrainian capital Kiev pits Spain against Italy, between them the winners of the last two World Cups. Spain is on the brink of creating soccer history; never before has a country won three major international football tournaments in a row. And Spain, which won Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, now has the chance to earn a place in the record books. Before the Euros, former Barcelona and England striker Gary Lineker said ""La Furia Roja,"" or the Red Fury as the Spanish national team is called, was just one trophy away from greatness. ""If they won three tournaments in a row, something no other team has done, you would have to put them up there among the all-time greatest teams,"" said Lineker, who helped England reach the World Cup semifinals in 1990. Spain reach Euro 2012 final after shootout victory . Vicente del Bosque's side enjoyed huge good fortune in Wednesday's semifinal against Iberian neighbors Portugal, winning 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 draw. Cesc Fabregas scuffed the decisive spot-kick as it hit the inside the post and rolled along the goal line before creeping into Rui Patricio's net. Fabregas' penalty can perhaps be seen as a symbol of Spain's unconvincing performances at Euro 2012 so far, which have left a large proportion of the watching public unsatisfied as the team struggled to break down packed opposition defenses. The end of a love affair? For all their possession (Spain have enjoyed around 67% of the ball in their five matches), there has been frustration that the team has neither moved the ball around quickly enough nor created enough goalscoring chances. Instead, it has worn down the other team by making their players chase shadows before waiting for a mistake. Whisper it quietly, but some have even labeled Spain's previously much-feted tiki-taka style of play ""boring"" and claimed it is currently a more defensive tactic than offensive. That argument is perhaps backed up by the fact that Spain has now not conceded a knockout-stage goal in any tournament since the 2006 World Cup, a run of nine matches and a remarkable 900 minutes of action. Against Italy in the group stage and France in the last eight, Del Bosque even picked a starting 11 without a single striker -- a tactic designed to help Spain keep the ball better and lure the opposing defense out so they could get in behind. It hasn't worked flawlessly, but the team has churned out results regardless. Beautiful football might be what people demand, but results are what Del Bosque deals in first. Since taking over from previous coach Luis Aragones following Euro 2008, the 61-year-old has led the national team to an incredible 50 wins from 59 matches. Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who scored the winner in the 2010 World Cup final, says Spain isn't bothered by the ""boring"" tag. The 27-year-old instead focuses on the positives of the team's possession-based game. ""When a team wants to attack and comes up against an opponent that sits back and tries to close the space and not try to create its own chances, that's not always the football you want to watch,"" said Iniesta. ""It's easy to forget that only a few years ago this style is what changed the story of Spain."" A change in mentality . It is a story that began at Euro 2008 -- and really, truly began with Spain's quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over Italy in Vienna, a match that defender Gerard Pique looks back on as the turning point. ""I think it changed the mentality of the national team,"" said the Barcelona star. ""Before, Spain played to avoid losing -- but afterwards they played to win."" Italy was the World Cup champion at the time and the favorite to go through. The team, however, was missing the suspended Andrea Pirlo, who has been in such glorious form at this tournament. Pirlo was also injured at the 2010 World Cup and played only 34 minutes in the team's final group game as Italy crashed out at the first hurdle following draws with Paraguay and New Zealand and a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Slovakia. But the 33-year-old midfielder is enjoying a stunning renaissance in his career. A year ago, he was discarded by AC Milan after 10 years of service. He signed for Juventus and led ""The Old Lady"" to the Italian league title before showcasing the full range of his majestic talents for the world to see in Poland and Ukraine. With hardly a hair out of place and rarely breaking into a sweat, the masterful Pirlo has dictated the knockout matches against England and Germany with breathtaking class, providing an exhibition in how to create space and pass the ball. The master and the maverick . When looking long, Pirlo has often sought out Mario Balotelli, the maverick Manchester City striker who is as well known for his controversial lifestyle as his performances on the pitch -- something which may change after his monumental two-goal showing against the much-fancied Germans in the semifinal. Balotelli double sends Italy through to Euro 2012 final . Balotelli went into Euro 2012 considered a talented liability, as capable of moments of madness as those of brilliance. But he powered home a header to give Italy the lead and then crashed a stunning second into the top corner from 18 yards. Even German keeper Manuel Neuer had to applaud the 21-year-old's chutzpah. ""Tonight was the most beautiful of my life -- but I hope that this Sunday is even better,"" said Balotelli after the game. ""Along with Spain, we are the two best teams in the tournament. We are the only side to have scored against Spain so far. We proved that we are equal to them, if not more, and we want to win."" Whoever wins on Sunday, it will provide a fairytale finish to a competition that has surpassed all expectations. Scare stories . The buildup to the first major football tournament behind the old Iron Curtain in eastern Europe was dominated by scare stories: the transportation infrastructure wasn't ready; there weren't enough affordable hotels for supporters to stay in; racism was a widespread problem in both host countries; foreign fans would not be welcomed in many of the host cities, and so on. Yet most of the fears have been unfounded. Yes, there have been issues with supporters that European football's governing body UEFA has had to deal with, and member associations have been fined for specific incidents of failing to keep their fans under control. Some of the magnificent stadia have not been full for every game, but that is probably due to the fact that Europe is going through difficult economic times right now and Poland and Ukraine are further away than most host nations have been -- resulting in increased traveling costs. But by and large, Euro 2012 has been an unqualified success. The group stage matches were full of attacking intent and fine goals. And the knockout stages have produced two penalty shootouts of unbearable tension, not to mention Italy's awesome destruction of Germany. Referees have let games flow and kept the card count down, and players have responded by concentrating more on their football and less on feigning injury and trying to artificially gain their team an advantage. Everywhere you looked, there was a story: Andriy Shevchenko gave Ukraine a memory it will never forget with two goals to see off Sweden; Greece put the country's vast financial problems aside to qualify from Group A; the much-fancied Netherlands went back home with its tail between its legs; and Spain and Italy quietly worked their way through the tournament. Sensational scoring . With 30 of the 31 matches played, we have seen only three red cards -- two of which came in the opening game as Poland drew with Greece. And there have been 21 goals scored from headers, which at 29% of the total 72, stands higher than at any previous Euros. Wonderful goals have crashed in with regularity, from the acrobatics of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Balotelli to the gorgeous flick of Danny Welbeck, the emphatic volleys of Sami Khedira and Marco Reus, to the unstoppable rocket shots of Jakub Blaszczykowski and, again, Balotelli. And then there was Pirlo's ""Panenka."" With England leading Italy 2-1 after the first two penalties in Sunday's quarterfinal shootout, Pirlo produced a moment of genius to change the momentum entirely in Italy's favor. He watched the England keeper buzz around on the line trying to put him off, before coolly chipping the ball -- a la Antonin Panenka in the 1976 European Championship final shootout -- delicately into the net after Joe Hart had dived early and erroneously to his right. England missed its next two penalties and Italy triumphed. ""Hart seemed to be very confident in himself. I needed to do something to beat him and it seemed to be a psychological blow,"" said the unflappable Pirlo. England boss Roy Hodgson added: ""The cool, calculated way Pirlo chipped it, that is something you either have or you don't have as a player."" The football world swooned, and Pirlo produced his second successive man-of-the-match display to help Italy slay Germany in the semis and continue the Azzurri's amazing record of never having lost a competitive game to ""Die Mannschaft."" On Sunday, Cesare Prandelli's team can keep another record intact: that of a country never winning three major international tournaments in a row. Spain are potentially 90 minutes away from sporting immortality. A captivating conclusion to Euro 2012 lies in wait.","Euro 2012 final takes place in Ukrainian capital of Kiev .

"(CNN) -- Sherlock Holmes is back, and it's more than elementary my dear Watson. Eighty-one years after the death of his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and more than 100 years since the last original story, the world's greatest detective returns in a new novel, ""The House of Silk."" The novel may be the peak of what's been recent Holmes renaissance, including ""Sherlock,"" a successful, modern adaptation for the BBC. There's also a Hollywood film starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law which re-imagines Holmes and Watson as steampunk action heroes, it was a hit with movie-goers, even spawning a sequel this holiday. Bookstore shelves are loaded with tributes, pastiches, spinoffs and repackaged versions of the ""sacred 60,"" Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 56 original short stories and 4 novels, but ""The House of Silk"" stands apart. It's the first new Holmes novel authorized and written with the endorsement of the Conan Doyle estate. Picking up the Meerschaum pipe is Anthony Horowitz, a bestselling novelist and television producer from Britain. Horowitz penned the extremely popular, Alex Rider series, about a teenage super-spy. He's also written and produced several popular television dramas, including ""Foyle's War,"" and ""Midsomer Murders"" both seen on PBS. Horowitz says he didn't tinker much with Conan Doyle's creation, hoping to preserve the flavor and tone of the original stories while giving the new novel a modern sensibility and pace. ""The House of Silk"" is set in 1890, a London shrouded in fog and shadow, where Hansom cabs still roam the streets. Watson now lives in a retirement home, Holmes is dead a year. Watson recounts one of their earlier cases, so shocking; the pages of its telling have stayed in his solicitor's safe for 100 years. Now, the usual cast of characters is reunited; Mrs. Hudson, Inspector Lestrade, the Baker Street Irregulars, Holmes' brother Mycroft, even the evil Professor Moriarty. There's a train robbery, a prison break, a carnival freak show, a high-speed chase by horse drawn carriage and a criminal gang that leaves a strip of white silk as their calling card. Once again, the game is afoot. CNN recently spoke with Horowitz about continuing the Sherlock Holmes canon; the following is an edited transcript. CNN: How long have you been a fan of Sherlock Holmes? Do you remember reading your first Holmes story? Horowitz: I was given a complete collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories and the four novels when I was 16. I remember reading ""The Sign of Four"" first and loving it. The book has a wonderful story with the tentacles of imperial India spreading all the way to suburban London. It has great characters, a macabre murder and a terrific chase down the River Thames. From that moment, I was hooked. CNN: This is the first time the Conan Doyle estate has authorized a new Holmes novel, how did you get involved? Horowitz: An agent approached me, but in the end I had very little to do with the estate. It was important to me that I should be allowed to work on my own so nobody gave me notes, I didn't have to show my manuscript to the estate, I wasn't told what I could or couldn't do. To be fair to the estate, they put their complete trust in me and I hope I've repaid it. CNN: With so many fans worldwide, how daunting a challenge was this? Horowitz: To be honest, I wouldn't have accepted the assignment if I didn't think I could do it and in the end I found the process, if not exactly easy, then remarkably stress-free. In fact, I loved every minute of the writing. It was a huge privilege to inhabit 221b Baker Street for four months in the company of two great literary figures. CNN: Much about ""The House of Silk"" has been kept top secret until now. What can you tell us about the book? Horowitz: It's set in the winter of 1890, in London and begins with an art dealer who believes he is being followed. He has come into contact with a vicious American gang and it seems that one of their number is out for revenge. But very soon the story spirals out of control and Holmes finds himself drawn into a much wider and deadlier conspiracy that could destroy the entire fabric of British society. CNN: Do you have a favorite Holmes story? Horowitz: ""The Dying Detective"" is my favorite story. It has no murder and very few characters but it's wonderfully ingenious and shows Holmes at his best. ""The House of Silk"" starts three days after ""The Dying Detective"" ends. CNN: Why do you think Holmes has remained arguably the world's most popular detective for more than 100 years? Horowitz: Well, he was the first, the father of all modern detectives. But I think what makes him so unforgettable is his relationship with Watson. He is austere, irritating, aloof. Watson is warm, loyal, affable. Together, they have the greatest friendship in literature. CNN: You have a hugely successful career in books, film & TV, how big an impact did the Holmes stories have on you as a writer? Horowitz: It's probably true to say that they helped to steer me towards murder mystery. I always had a love of puzzles, illusions, magic. Holmes pressed all the right buttons.

"(CNN) -- The apparent suicide of Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who inadvertently put through a prank call to the hospital ward where the Duchess of Cambridge was staying, has provoked outrage, sadness and demands for retribution in all corners of the media. The tragedy has revived memories of previous practical jokes that have gone horribly wrong, but also stirred an already febrile debate on ethical boundaries, whether in the mainstream or social media, and what, if any, legal recourse should be available to people humiliated or taunted in public. Saldanha, a 46-year-old mother of two, was found dead Friday -- three days after Australian DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian of 2DayFM placed a call to the King Edward VII hospital in the UK, where the duchess was being treated for morning sickness. They pretended to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. A statement on the radio station's website said: ""The hosts have decided that they will not return to their radio show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy."" Rhys Holleran, CEO of the company that owns the radio station, said Saturday the DJs were ""deeply shattered"" by what occurred. ""This is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen and we are deeply saddened by it,"" he said of Saldanha's death. Many media organizations played the audio tape of the prank call in part or its entirety. CNN broadcast part of it -- but not the segment where a nurse in the ward briefly discussed details of the duchess's condition. Of the three major broadcasters in the United Kingdom, neither Sky News nor the BBC played the call. ITN played a clip that included the voice of Saldanha (but did not identify her) on several newscasts. It didn't really matter whether the major broadcasters aired the tape; the whole conversation was widely available online via YouTube. Nurse found dead after taking prank call . Before Saldanha's apparent suicide, the chief executive of the hospital, John Lofthouse, had already condemned the prank, saying, ""I think this whole thing is pretty deplorable, our nurses are caring, professional people trained to look after patients, not to cope with journalistic trickery of this sort."" And trickery seems to go the heart of the issue. 2DayFM has a history of public humiliation. In 2009, a 14-year-old girl was tricked into acknowledging that she had been raped at the age of 12 -- only to be asked by a DJ: ""Is that the only experience you've had?"" That led the Australian Communications and Media Authority to censure the station -- saying the broadcast did not meet standards of decency. The station said it had provided the teenager with counseling and vowed ""to prevent anything similar from happening again."" But 2DayFM has been the subject of several inquiries since; and this year was told it ""must not broadcast material that demeans or is likely to demean women or girls"" as a condition of keeping its license. That followed a broadcast in which a female journalist was called a derogatory term and told ""to watch your mouth or I'll hunt you down"" by DJ Kyle Sandilands. The incident provoked a campaign to persuade advertisers to boycott the show, but 2DayFM was not fined and Sandilands kept his job. He even interviewed Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard in July. Social media entwined in radio prank . After its latest prank, 2DayFM's website boasted about the ""Biggest Royal Prank Ever,"" but in the UK, Daily Telegraph columnist Bryony Gordon said it was ""not so funny to hear two grown adults call up a hospital ward full of sick people to try to scam information about one of them."" ""What Christian and Greig did was borderline illegal,"" she added. On social media, the tragedy made an impact in a way that many stories don't. ""Desensitisation created by 24/7 news means few news items actually cause shock; the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha is one such item,"" tweeted Ricky Seal. It also prompted visceral hostility toward the radio presenters. 'I hope they're proud of themselves'.... ""Do the moronic callers still find themselves humorous?"".... ""Humanity, we have reached another low"" were among the thousands of furious tweets. Both DJs have deleted their Twitter accounts. As the UK tabloid the Daily Mirror put it on its front-page Saturday, 'Pranksters Face World Fury.' Around the world, reaction in the op-ed columns echoed the fury. In Canada, Christina Blizzard wrote: ""So a young woman who cared enough to go into nursing, was courteous enough to pick up a phone because a receptionist wasn't at her desk, was trusting enough to be helpful -- is dead. Two children don't have a mother. ""But at least a radio station kept their audience entertained."" However, some -- a minority to be sure -- said it was too easy to mobilize the virtual lynch mob. One Canadian tweeted: ""The two deejays are not responsible for the actions of an unbalanced woman."" Prank phone calls and other practical jokes have long been a form of entertainment on radio and television. Most of the time they are harmless enough: both sides get the joke. The TV series ""Candid Camera"" ran for years because the great majority of the people tricked by the show were prepared to sign away their dignity for a few minutes. But pranks can go wrong. Back in 2008, the BBC apologized to actor Andrew Sachs after two radio presenters -- Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross -- left a series of messages on his phone while on-air, including offensive references to his granddaughter. The second message apologized for the first -- but also suggested Sachs might kill himself because of the content of the previous message. The two presenters were later suspended by the BBC, and a senior executive resigned. The corporation was also fined some $225,000 by the UK media regulator and its governing trust described the episode as a ""deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification."" Brand moved on -- to a career in Hollywood. Veteran publicist Max Clifford told the Daily Telegraph soon after the incident that Brand's career would not be hurt. ""He's known to be controversial and, if anything, it will make him more popular amongst his fans, who will have thought this was hilarious,"" Clifford told the newspaper. As Oscar Wilde once said, ""The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about."" Sachs was at least familiar with the public spotlight as a well-known actor and narrator. Jacintha Saldanha was not. Nor was Gretchen Molannen. On November 30, the Tampa Bay Times published a story about Gretchen Molannen, a 39-year old woman who had a rare sexual disorder known as 'persistent genital arousal.' The Times worked with Molannen and read her the entire story before it was published. She'd written to the newspaper thanking it for showing an interest, adding: ""I just hope this will educate people that this is serious and really exists, and that other women who are suffering in silence will now have the courage to talk to a doctor about it."" The day after the story was published, Molannen killed herself. Even sympathetic coverage and subsequent offers of help could not save her. It's unclear whether the publicity about her condition was too much to bear; she had previously attempted to take her own life. ""It's important to understand that suicide is complex,"" says Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Samaritans, a UK group that counsels people thinking of suicide. ""Although a catalyst may appear to be obvious, suicide is never the result of a single factor or event and is likely to have several interrelated causes,"" Johnstone said on the group's website soon after news emerged of Saldanha's death. If adults are vulnerable to what they perceive as public humiliation, teenagers are doubly so. Tyler Clementi was an 18-year old student at Rutgers University who in 2010 was secretly filmed by his roommate having a sexual encounter with another man. A short while later he jumped to his death from a New York bridge. Clementi was not only humiliated but his humiliation was amplified by the fact that his roommate, Dharun Ravi, shared the footage with others and tweeted about it. He was later convicted of bias intimidation and invasion of privacy and sentenced to 30 days in jail. The case seemed to bring together many of the factors that put the vulnerable even more at risk: technology that can record and distribute private acts in a matter of minutes; the failure -- especially among many younger users of social media -- to understand the potential consequences of their postings; and the uncertain state of the law in many places. It also highlighted an epidemic of teenage suicides in the United States -- one that has coincided with the immersion of that age group in social media and texting for hours at a stretch. Schoolyard bullying ends when recess does; cyber-bullying is 24/7 and reaches into the bedroom, the mall and the classroom. When 15-year old Phoebe Prince killed herself in Massachusetts two years ago, another student at her school told the media: ""Someone told her to go hang herself, and I don't really know who that was, but she was getting bullied by some people, because there were people talking about her and I guess she didn't like being hated."" At first glance, many of these cases bear little resemblance to that of Jacintha Saldanha. But there are common threads. In the 21st century, personal humiliation can quickly go viral thanks to the reach and appetite of both social and mainstream media. Within hours, the minor transgressions and innocent mistakes, the private behavior and anxieties of ordinary people can reach, or seem to reach, the ends of the earth. For a few, that exposure is quickly overwhelming.","NEW: Radio company CEO talks of ""tragic event""

"London (CNN) -- Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousufzai stood with the aid of nurses Friday for the first time since her shooting and is ""communicating very freely,"" according to the director of the UK hospital where she is undergoing treatment. Malala can't talk because she has a tracheotomy tube inserted to protect her airway, which was swollen after her gunshot injury, but she is writing coherent sentences, said Dave Rosser, director of University Hospitals Birmingham. ""We have no reason to believe she won't be able to talk when the tube is out, which may be in the next few days,"" he said. She ""is not out of the woods yet"" but is doing very well, he added. Taliban stifle media over Malala attack . The latest progress report -- more detailed than previous updates -- suggests that the girl shot after she defied the Taliban by insisting on the right of girls to go to school could make a good recovery. There ""is certainly physical damage to the brain"" from the bullet that entered Malala's head, Rosser said, but she appears to be functioning well intellectually and has the motor control to stand, with help from nurses. Malala: A global symbol but still just a kid . ""Whether there's any subtle intellectual or memory deficits down the line, it's too early to say,"" he said. Queen Elizabeth Hospital released the first photographs of Malala since she was admitted on Sunday after being flown from Pakistan. She looks bruised and wan but clearly conscious. Rosser said Malala, who is aware of her surroundings and appears to have some memory of what happened, had agreed that the hospital could tell the public more about her medical condition. ""She is keen that people share the details. She is also keen that I thank people for their support and their interest, because she's obviously aware of the amount of interest this is generating around the world,"" he said. One of the first things she asked nurses Tuesday afternoon, as she gradually regained consciousness, was what country she was in, he said. Social media: Messages for Malala . ""There is every sign that she understands why she's here,"" he said. ""It's a very difficult position for her, because she's gone from being on her school bus, and the next thing she will be consciously aware of is being in a strange hospital in a different country. So she seems to have understood why she is no longer in Pakistan and what is happening to her."" Malala has spoken to hospital staff in Urdu and seems to understand English, he said. Many well-wishers have sent messages of support for the teen, and the hospital has set up a bank account for donations. In terms of Malala's care, the key concern for doctors at present is to treat signs of infection probably related to the path the bullet took through her body, Rosser said. The bullet entered above the back of her left eye, traveled down through her jaw and into her left shoulder, lodging in the tissue above her shoulder blade, he said. Her skull and jaw were damaged by its passage. MRI scans also show that the bullet grazed the side of her brain, he said, although in such cases, most of the damage tends to be caused by shock waves from the shot. Girl shot alongside Malala haunted by attack . The hospital is trying to arrange for the 15-year-old to listen to her father on the phone, although she cannot speak because of the tracheotomy tube, he added. Malala is likely to spend another couple of weeks recovering before the team of specialists considers reconstructive surgery on her skull, using either a piece of bone that was initially removed or a titanium plate, Rosser said. She may also need surgery on her jaw joint. Malala inspires others to fight for education . ""It certainly would be over-optimistic to say there won't be any further problems, but it is possible she will make a smooth recovery,"" he said, adding that she probably faces weeks in the hospital even if all goes well. Doctors and nurses are trying very hard to limit communication to her medical needs rather than risk setting back her recovery by discussing the trauma of the attack, he said. The shooting in the northwestern district of Swat last week, which left Malala battling to recover from her injuries, generated a wave of shock and anger in Pakistan and around the world. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the act, but they didn't appear to have anticipated the level of revulsion and condemnation that it would provoke. Thousands of people joined in rallies across Pakistan in support of the wounded teen, and calls have grown for a strong response from the government. Authorities are investigating the attack and say they have made a number of arrests.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Loyalist paramilitaries are behind some of the violence seen in the past day in Northern Ireland, police said Saturday, as authorities appealed for calm ahead of more protests planned in Belfast. Twelve people -- including a 13-year-old boy -- were arrested during disorder in the Belfast area overnight Friday into Saturday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said. Eight police officers were injured in the unrest, which followed days of violent outbreaks prompted by a decision Monday by Belfast city councilors to stop flying the Union flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days. ""Police can now confirm loyalist paramilitaries are orchestrating some of the violence we have seen in the past 24 hours,"" Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said in a statement. He appealed to anyone planning to protest in the city center Saturday to stay away and let people do their holiday shopping in peace. ""Violence has serious and unwanted consequences for us all, and we will robustly investigate all incidents,"" he said. ""Today I am urging everyone to be calm, take a step back and think about how this violence is affecting not just their own communities but the whole of Northern Ireland."" Alliance party councillor Linda Cleland was among those those affected by the violence, when the windows of her car were smashed and several of the windows on her house broken. ""This violence must stop,"" she said. ""There is no justification for the attack on my home or the homes and offices of my colleagues."" About 1,000 pro-British loyalists joined a peaceful protest outside the city hall Saturday afternoon. The latest disorder came hours after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Belfast as she wrapped up a European tour. Condemning the violence, she urged a continued commitment to peace during meetings with First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in Belfast on Friday. ""There can be no place in Northern Ireland for any violence; the remnants of the past must be quickly condemned,"" she said. Clinton described the violence as ""a sad reminder, unfortunately, that -- despite how hardy the peace has been -- there are still those who not only would test it, but try to destroy it."" Both Robinson and McGuinness condemned the violence and appealed for calm. Four men were arrested Thursday after police investigating ""ongoing dissident Republican activity"" found what they described as a homemade rocket when they stopped a car in the area of Londonderry. An unexploded letter bomb was also found in a mail box, police said. Buildings linked to the cross-community Alliance Party, which backed the Union flag's removal, have also been targeted. The party said Friday that its sole lawmaker in the UK parliament at Westminster, Naomi Long, had received a death threat. The vote on the Union flag followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers injured. Just more than a month ago, a prison officer was killed in a suspected dissident IRA attack, the first such attack in years. In recent days, a number of suspected dissident IRA members have been arrested. The recent disorder follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Journalist Peter Taggart reported from Belfast, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London.","NEW: Alliance party councillor Linda Cleland was among those those affected by the violence .

"(CNN) -- Forty days alone in the wilderness was enough for Jesus, but Lance Armstrong is facing an altogether longer period of solitude. The disgraced former cycling icon was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles 44 days ago, on October 22, and has spent most of the intervening period in his hometown of Austin, Texas. While he contemplates his next move, there have been beneficiaries of his newfound infamy, notably Mellow Johnny's bike store. Call it the power of celebrity or call it voyeurism, but thanks to Armstrong's notoriety, the Austin store co-owned by the disgraced cyclist, with its name inspired by the Texan's nickname on the Tour -- Mellow Johnny's, an Americanized version of the French for the leader's yellow jersey, maillot jaune -- is doing just fine. Giant photographs of Armstrong crossing the line, arms aloft, loom over racks of bikes; a set of framed, signed yellow jerseys fills another wall; Armstrong merchandise is on offer at every turn, from cycling spandex to lemon-flavored waffles. ""It would be Lance's decision,"" general manager Will Black explained when asked why the memorabilia remains on display, given Armstrong's spectacular fall from grace. ""If he decides he wants us to take them down, we would, but until that happens, they will stay up."" How an all-American hero fell to earth . And by the look of the shop's bustle on a Monday morning, Mellow Johnny's will survive the scandal that has enveloped Armstrong. ""We haven't seen it in terms of the number of customers coming in,"" Black said. ""It really hasn't had an effect in a negative way."" It is not just cycling enthusiasts that are flocking to the shop; the stars of Formula One also stopped off during the sport's first visit to Austin last month. Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso took a look inside Mellow Johnny's while seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher and Mark Webber of Red Bull both purchased bikes. Lance Armstrong's epic downfall . Written out of history . Since the release of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's report that stated there was ""overwhelming"" evidence Armstrong was involved in ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program"" ever seen in professional cycling, the American's reputation has unraveled like a onion being peeled away one layer at a time. Armstrong steadfastly maintains his innocence. But a few blocks east of Mellow Johnny's is the yellow-hued headquarters of the Livestrong Foundation -- the charity Armstrong set up after overcoming testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs, abdomen and brain -- which has taken down his Tour race-winner's yellow jerseys. But if the American has been written out of cycling history -- ""Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling,"" said the International Cycling Union's president, Pat McQuaid, recently -- the cyclist's legacy at home in Austin remains deep-rooted and complex. It was thanks to Armstrong that this laid-back city became synonymous with cycling. Its biking culture has been strengthened by the presence of close to 50,000 University of Texas students using bikes to commute around town, the city's provision of cycling infrastructure and the popular biking trails that circle the shoreline of Town Lake on the fringes of downtown. Few in the city disagree that Armstrong put Austin on the cycling map -- and vice versa. ""The Lance Armstrong effect is part of what gave cycling such a big boost here,"" said Gilbert Martinez, president of the Austin Cycling Association Gilbert Martinez. ""When he started winning the Tour, there was lots of buzz. People gathered to watch it; there were parties all round town, not just at bike shops but at bars and grills. It was a tremendous boost."" The city paid tribute to Armstrong's contribution to cycling with the creation of the Lance Armstrong Bikeway, running east to west across downtown. There have been calls for the bikeway to be renamed, but Austin's Mayor Lee Leffingwell says he has no plans to amend this homage to Armstrong. So as they whizz past Armstrong's name emblazoned on square, green and white signs, Austin's cyclists have a permanent reminder of his deeds -- good and bad. ""Lance is a very divisive topic,"" Martinez explained. ""There are people who really believe he was persecuted and it's not fair what's happening to him. Armstrong quits Livestrong entirely . ""Then there are others who feel he is getting exactly what he deserves. There's a reputation of Lance as a bit of a jerk and (the doping) was part of his win-at-all-costs personality. ""There is a sizeable part of the community who really don't care one way or another. ""We as people want to believe he overcame cancer and he won the most grueling bicycle race in the world, and he did it seven times in a row. ""But cycling was here before Lance got here, and it'll still be here long after we've forgotten him."" Back at the 15-year-old Livestrong Foundation charity, which has raised more than $500 million to support cancer patients, donations have increased since the allegations linking Armstrong with serial doping. ""It might be that people are learning about the work of the foundation as a result of the controversy from the cycling world,"" mused Livestrong spokeswoman Katherine McLane. ""In which case, that is a positive effect."" Armstrong stepped down as chairman of the Livestrong Foundation in October, the same month the organization also legally changed its name from the Lance Armstrong Foundation. McLane says it's his work with the foundation that should remain as Armstrong's lasting legacy, not the implosion of his cycling career. ""I would say that Lance's greatest legacy is creating an organization that has helped 2.5 million people when they are facing cancer,"" she added. ""He's still the foundation's biggest donor. He's donated $7 million."" Amid all the opinion and rhetoric bubbling around Armstrong in Austin, there was no sign of the man himself. His only public appearance since the scandal enveloped him was at a Livestrong gala on October 20, and when Formula One made its debut in the city, Armstrong flew to Hawaii to avoid the hubbub. Suzanne Halliburton, who has followed Armstrong's rise and fall for the Austin American-Statesman newspaper since 1996, is one of the few still in regular contact with Armstrong. ""The last time I talked to him, he seemed to be doing reasonably well,"" she said. ""He has access to a private plane where he can zip off and go hang out in Hawaii at his house there."" Armstrong, who also has a Spanish-style villa close to downtown Austin, has no reason to keep out of the public gaze in his hometown, according to Halliburton. ""When he rides, he goes out to the Hill Country, but his house is in central Austin,"" she explained. ""He's got five kids, two of whom live with him. He's very active, going to see all their sporting events, sometimes coaching their soccer teams. He sits in line to pick up the kids. ""He lives pretty normal. He goes out to eat. I don't see him keeping a low profile here. ""He's not beloved anymore, but he's not hated."" Away from Austin, the wheels of justice are cranking into gear. Sponsor sad at loss of Armstrong's 'great story' An International Cycling Union commission has been assembled to investigate the USADA's damning report into the allegations that Armstrong systematically used performance-enhancing drugs. He could also face lawsuits from groups such as British newspaper The Sunday Times, which lost legal disputes with Armstrong surrounding doping allegations and, as a result, paid out huge sums, as well as Texan insurance firm SCA Promotions, which insured performance bonuses paid to the American after he claimed his fourth, fifth and sixth Tour de France wins. Back in Texas, there is a little expectation of Armstrong undergoing a Damascene conversion. ""He'd already fallen off the pedestal,"" Martinez argued. ""All that is left is for a mea culpa -- but I don't think that is ever going to come."" Halliburton is less sure. ""Whether you think Lance did drugs or not -- and it looks like he did something -- he still worked his ass off,"" she opined. ""I've had people come up to me and say 'I've been an athlete. and I know that performance enhancers are not going to help somebody who's not also working hard.' so he's real driven. He's a perfectionist, and he doesn't suffer fools gladly. ""The last time I talked to him, he said he's going to get the last word. ""But first and foremost, he is going to think about his family. You can't just go throwing yourself on the mercy of the public and want them to love you again. ""He's in a tough spot right now.""","Mellow Johnny's is a cycling store co-owned by disgraced former cyclist Lance Armstrong .

"(CNN) -- ""Beware the fury of the patient man."" -- John Dryden . In January, 1956, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser was pledging to take over Palestine. In the United States, a ""sensational new RCA Victor Star,"" just days away from cracking the music charts with his first hit, ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" was touring with Hank Snow and the stars of Grand Old Opry. Norma Jeane Mortenson was preparing to change her name. Also that month, a fresh-faced U.S. senator gave Richard Nixon an autographed copy of his second book, ""Profiles in Courage"". In that best-seller, John F. Kennedy applauded leaders with the courage to represent ""the actual sentiments of the silent majority of their constituents in opposition to the screams of a vocal minority."" That ""silent majority"" was a constituency neither Nixon nor the country would forget: Fifty-six years later, Mitt Romney is counting on it to win the presidency. Nixon could have thanked Kennedy's hardcover for one of his many resurrections. His appeal to the ""silent majority"" turned around his political fortunes, driving his approval ratings from the mid-50s to more than 80%. Opinion: Both parties have a huge race problem . His pivotal speech contrasted a ""vocal minority"" of idealistic but impractical, young, anti-Vietnam protestors, cultural elites and intellectuals with their stodgy parents, older, blue-collar, working-class Americans. Until Nixon drew the silent majority from the shadows, their simmering outrage at the left's lack of respect for time-tested American values was undetected. Political historian Teddy White characterized the split between ""what the silent people think"" and what the country's ""more important thinkers think."" He wrote, ""Never have America's leading cultural media, its university thinkers, its influence makers been more intrigued by experiment and change; but in no election have the mute masses more completely separated themselves from such leadership and thinking."" At least, until today. By some measures, little has changed since the seminal year of 1969. Marilyn Monroe remains a powerful symbol of fragile, sexual romanticism. The Arab world still lusts for the Palestinian territory. Elvis is making more money than ever. And we are still fighting the Vietnam War. The division between Nixon's silent majority, on one hand, and, on the other, Democrat-leaning young voters, Hollywood stars, academia, the music industry, fashionistas, and news media elites has never repaired itself. In the ""The Conquest of Cool,"" Thomas Frank chronicled how the social ferment of the 60's not only failed to overthrow establishment culture, but was absorbed by it. The counter-culture of the 60s revolution turned into the ""Me Generation"" of the 80s. They settled into entitled consumerism, grew fat and became today's establishment. Now the counterculture defines itself by the brands it wears, not the institutions it protests. Being different today requires the latest IPhone and a vanilla, extra-shot latte. The counter culture wears a Nike swoosh, not a tie-died shirt. The Axis of Cool, born in protest against the war that has defined all future wars, has become a culture of locust-like consumption. It devours public and private resources. It remains allied against the previous generation's antiquated ethos of self-discipline, personal responsibility and moderation. Over five decades, the counterculture became our culture. It expanded its home within the Democratic Party, finding its identity challenging the quaint social norms of tragically uncool Republicans. We are an easy cultural target. We are suspicious of all cutting-edge music, abstract art, avant-garde style and trendy thought. We advocate unimaginative self-restraint and standards we often fail to meet -- and we get no credit for trying. Our imperfections are labeled hypocritical, not human. Hip America is more fun. And in 2008, it found its leader, the coolest president ever. President Obama hangs out with movie stars, makes no decisions without consulting the academic elite and sings like Al Green. Obama is the president of cool America. To oppose him, where did Republicans turn? We chose the strait-laced personification of everything Obama is not. We made ourselves even more dated. Mitt Romney is the chaperone to be eluded at every prom. He's common-sense parental advice, not counter-intuitive academic insight. He has stepped down, fresh and perfect, from a Norman Rockwell painting. As Ashley Parker notes in the New York Times, an emotional outburst from the proper Romney is limited to saying ""the heck with it."" Even my own daughter writes that Romney's ""tendency to say 'shoot' and 'darn it' tells us he's from another generation."" Being terminally uncool, however, may be the secret of Romney's success. Nixon's majority was silent a long time, until aroused by Obama, whose self-admitted superiority led him to denigrate their bitter attachment to their values. They slept, this quiet group of Americans who worked hard, paid their taxes and played by the rules, until awakened by a president who violated their core ethic of responsibility, telling them the cure for too much debt is even more debt. They are mature. They are responsible. And now they are frightened. They worry that everything they've worked for is being consumed, leaving only a bare orchard of fruitless trees and leafless branches. They have heard an alarm. And now they stand to defend what is plain and boring and true. They rise to tell us their values, like the lines on the side of the road, are there for a purpose. They are there to keep us straight. Now it is the silent majority who takes to the streets in protest of their government's fiscal fantasies. They are adults, rising to say that their country's time-honored values are not luxuries we can discard, but obligations that must be met. Their children, who think themselves the first generation with the mental capacity to understand the world's problems, stare at them. They confuse their parent's civility with softness. They are baffled to hear that success requires self-discipline -- not just self-indulgence, good intentions and intellect. Polls say this race is tied. The president of cool is suddenly in a tight race against America's most uncool parent. Are the ""mute masses"" Nixon aroused still a majority? Early turnout and absentee voting data from the Republican National Committee indicates that GOP vote totals are up over 2% from 2008 while Democrat totals are down 6%. GOP pollsters report Republicans are heading into 2012 with a significant advantage in voter interest and intensity. No-drama Obama has got the cool. All Romney has is the fury of the patient man. If he wins, Romney could make being uncool, cool again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Castellanos.","Alex Castellanos says election may echo old split between cultural elite, silent majority .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- Two suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan's volatile tribal region left 15 people dead --- including a Taliban commander -- on Thursday, Pakistani intelligence officials said. Among the 11 killed in one strike in the province of South Waziristan was a Taliban commander named Mullah Nazir, also known as Maulvi Nazir Wazir, the officials said. The drone fired two missiles in the Sarkanda area of Birmil, killing Nazir, the officials said. Read more: Not just for military use, drones turn civilian .

"(CNN) -- Economic sanctions have effects, says an expert at Johns Hopkins University, but not all may be intended. ""Sanctions historically are quite counterproductive in the sense that if you impose sanctions on your enemy, it tends to strengthen your enemy,"" Steve Hanke told CNN's John Defterios. In Iran -- where oil exports provide about 70% of government revenues according to the Congressional Research Service -- ongoing sanctions that bar the export of oil are hurting its economy. In the past year, Iranian crude sales have dropped 60% while the value of the rial has fallen to near-historic lows. Since 2010, the currency has dropped nearly 24% against the U.S. dollar. At the same time, food prices for everything from meat for kebabs to yogurt have surged. The international community hopes the sanctions will pressure Iran to stop its alleged development of nuclear weapons. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes yet only last month the International Atomic Energy Agency released a report saying Iran can now readily convert its uranium stockpiles to a weapons-grade level. Hanke, an economics professor and expert on sanctions, says the economic restrictions on Iran could be dangerous for the global oil trade and threatens safe passage through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow shipping lane in the Persian Gulf. ""If you squeeze and squeeze and you don't allow the Iranians to sell any oil, then what do they have to lose by shutting the Strait of Hormuz down? And if they do that, that's 35% of all the world's oil that comes through the strait and 20% of the liquefied natural gas in the world,"" Hanke says. Hanke adds if the Strait of Hormuz is shut down for even a week, the economic impact would be ""bigger than any bomb we could conceive of."" Looking elsewhere in the world, Hanke points to relations between the United States and Cuba as another example of sanctions not succeeding. ""That's why we've seen Castro and the Communists hanging around for so long in Cuba."" Washington first imposed an embargo on Cuban goods in 1960 to pressure the Communist government under Fidel Castro into collapse. But Cuba is still ruled by a Castro -- Fidel's brother, Raul -- and is still Communist. While there has been a thawing of bilateral relations with the U.S. in recent years, restrictions remain. On Tuesday, the United Nations General Assembly passed a symbolic condemnation of Washington's embargo of Cuban goods, 188-3. This vote has occurred for the past 21 years in a row. This past September, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Israel should lift its blockade of Gaza to ease the plight of civilians, saying that the policy would backfire. ""Keeping a large and dense population in unremitting poverty is in nobody's interest except that of the most extreme radicals in the region,"" he declared. Hanke says those on the receiving end of sanctions, ""will point their finger at those who are imposing the sanctions, they'll say they're the enemy, they're the bad guys.""","Sanctions on oil exports from Iran are hurting the nation's economy .

"(CNN) -- With a crushing right hand, Juan Manuel Marquez knocked out Manny Pacquiao in the sixth round of a non-title bout in Las Vegas late Saturday, scoring a definitive victory after three previous bouts that ended in close judgments. The fight came to an end 2:59 into the sixth round, after Juan Manuel Marquez landed a right hand to Manny Pacquiao's face, knocking him cold late Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Pacquiao went down face-first and lay motionless for a while, possibly unconscious, before eventually sitting up. It was called a technical knockout and Marquez declared the winner. Pacquiao shook Marquez' hand after getting back on his feet. The loss to his arch rival comes as a second severe blow to Pacquiao's career this year. He lost his title to American Timothy Bradley in June. Saturday's fight was originally scheduled for 12 rounds. Both fighters scored a knock-down earlier in the fight with Marquez sending Pacquiao flying onto his back and Pacquiao tipping Marquez enough off of his feet to cause one of his gloves to touch the mat. Former presidential hopeful Mitt Romney was at ringside with his wife Ann and shook Pacquiao's hand before the match to wish him success. Pacquiao is an elected congressman in his native Philippines. Actor Steven Seagal and Basketball legend Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson could be seen at the match, and former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson tweeted that he was also in attendance. It's a rare case when it takes a fourth fight to satisfy the fighters, the fans and the press. Boxers often have other rivals to battle, and younger fighters come along deserving their shots. But for Pacquiao (now 54-5-2, 38 KOs) and Marquez (now 55-6-1, 40 KOs), their legacies required at least one more battle in the ring. Pacquiao has, in the eyes of the judges, won two of the previous matches. The first was ruled a tie. He believes he won all three. Marquez fervently believes he won all three. At a press conference announcing the fight, Pacquiao used his thumb to scratch into the tablecloth, ""We need to win by knockout"" for his trainer Freddie Roach to see. ""I said, 'Yes, we do,'"" Roach said. He didn't think it likely that judges would hand a third decision victory to his fighter. Marquez has also said that he believed he needed to score a knockout to put all doubts to rest. Pacquiao's prior opponent gave him a taste of what Marquez has felt during the reading of the scorecards for their battles. It appeared Pacquiao dominated Bradley in a 12-round welterweight title fight in June, but he lost the decision on two of the three judges' scorecards. Bradley walked off with the WBO belt. Public sentiment and the opinion of sports media on Marquez' and Pacquiao's previous bouts have fallen mostly in the middle. What everyone agrees on is that the fights have been great. Pacquiao has come hard after Marquez, who has counter-punched superbly. Pacquiao has knocked Marquez down four times, three of which came in the first round of the first fight. Had the referee stopped the fight, as they often do after a boxer falls three times, the trilogy would have been a quick one-night stand, or one-night fall, as it were. Now the two fighters are forever linked, and there is a clear victor. CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.","It is the first time either fighter knocked out the other .

"London (CNN) -- When I was driving through Poland last year, all the talk was about a Chinese company's failure to complete a major motorway project. The contract was wrestled away from the Chinese and the Poles finished it themselves. The details, denials and counter-claims aren't important for this article; far more interesting is the impact of any China-led project in Europe. Any news on such projects -- good or bad -- makes headlines. But the splash is bigger when such projects fail or when people starting mumbling about Chinese influence. What China does in Europe matters greatly, though rarely do I hear or read a positive story about China's influence. When a Chinese company bought Volvo, it was the transfer of technology that made the headlines, along with the end of the era for a venerable European brand. When an Indian company bought Land Rover and Jaguar, Tata was hailed as the savior of two venerable European brands. Why is that? The answer appears clear. We are equally fascinated and frightened by the rise of China's economic and military prowess. The Chinese government's recent trip to central Europe revealed that the hiccup in Poland has not slowed China's plan to invest heavily in the former communist states. A $10 billion credit line will be used for infrastructure projects in Poland, Hungary and other countries. It was reported that the leaders of 16 central European countries met with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao while in Poland. China's tech giant Huawei is a growing power in the telecoms world. But any attempt it makes to expand in Europe, United States or Africa is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the Chinese military through its founder. Rightly so, governments fret over a ""foreign"" firm controlling the hardware that is the backbone of modern society. In Huawei's case, as the Economist recently pointed out in a front cover story, the fear is China illegally tapping into western communications, both government and private. Of course Huawei will say it's a private company with no state control and simply wants to compete on a level playing field with the likes of Nokia-Siemens, Cisco and Ericsson. A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe. There is no reason to believe big changes will come from the top. Instead, change appears to be coming from the bottom. Rising wages and increased worker benefits might raise the prices of goods exported to Europe. It also helps to expand China's middle class which appears to love European and American products. I recall growing up in America with worries about the rising power of Japan. All the products we desired were designed there or manufactured there, from video games players to VCRs and automobiles to the Walkman. With the wealth created, the Japanese were buying up property in California and buildings in New York. It was feared the rise of Japan's economic prowess would never abate. But it did. Europe can't assume the same will happen with China. But the economies now are so interlinked that stingy European consumers quickly translates into weaker manufacturing output in China. That slowdown is dissected by European economists and, on any given day, it can cause stocks to fall, leading to the similar stock tumbles a few hours later on Wall Street. Recently Burberry noted a slowdown in sales in Asia, particularly in China -- its shares promptly fell 20%. Perhaps it was an overreaction, but it shows investors are quite happy to plow money into companies with ""an Asian strategy"" and then ignore it -- until there is a profit warning blamed on that same market. That goes to show Europe has to get comfortable with the growing influence of China on its shores. It cannot expect its companies to grow in the Chinese market, then be surprised when enriched Chinese companies come shopping for European companies to buy. China needs to understand that it will take time for Europe to get comfortable with China's investments. China has to make sure its investments and intentions are transparent. Oh, then there is that small matter of reciprocity.","CNN's Jim Boulden writes he hardly hears positive stories about China's influence in Europe .

"(CNN) -- The last time Maria Sharapova beat Serena Williams, the Russian was just 17. It was the final of the 2004 WTA Championships, and the victory capped her breakthrough year after an attention-grabbing first grand slam title at Wimbledon. Fast forward eight years, and history is repeating as the two biggest names in women's tennis meet again in Sunday's climax to the season-ending championships in Turkey. Neither ended 2004 ranked as No. 1, and the same will be the case this time. Sharapova overpowered Victoria Azarenka 6-4 6-2 in the second of Saturday's semifinals, but the Belorussian had already guaranteed the year-end top spot by winning two of her group games. However, it was a measure of revenge for the second-ranked Russian, who lost to Azarenka in January's Australian Open final, the U.S. Open semifinals and in two other tournament title matches -- the most recent in Beijing earlier this month. ""When you find yourself in a losing position a few times during the year, you want to try to figure out how to change those things around,"" Sharapova said. ""I certainly didn't make as many mistakes today as I did in our previous matches this year. ""I'd lost to Victoria the last few times, so I'm really happy I put myself in the semifinals to play against her and try to improve that -- I was hoping to have a better result, and I'm happy I did today."" While she ended her losing run against Azarenka, Sharapova must now break a streak of eight successive defeats against Williams -- who thrashed her in August's Olympic final. The American, who won the WTA event in 2001 and 2009, reached the final for the fifth time with a 6-2 6-1 demolition of fourth-ranked Agnieszka Radwanska in a rematch of July's Wimbledon final. The Pole had been on court for three and a half hours in winning her final group match on Friday, and it showed as U.S. Open champion Williams -- who had a rest day -- needed just 61 minutes to complete victory. ""Those last two matches really killed me,"" Radwanska said. ""Especially that I didn't have the day off, and especially that surface -- it's very sticky, so three and a half hours is a lot. ""I really tried today and I really wanted to run, but my legs just didn't. This is the kind of tournament where you have to be fit every match to win. ""I was trying, but Serena played too fast. I couldn't do anything."" Williams, playing her first tournament since claiming her 15th grand slam title in New York, has now won 17 matches in a row against top-five players and has lost just twice in her last 49 matches. ""I probably had an idea she was tired,"" the 31-year-old. ""I just told her that it was awesome she played so well and played through another match, after playing a good eight hours. It was really inspiring for me."" Azarenka was last year's runner-up but her hopes of reaching another final were seemingly hampered by an injury that left her in tears at times during the second set. She is 62-0 this year in matches where she has won the first set, but Sharapova improved her record in such circumstances to 51-1. ""I'm not going to say I was the freshest today, but I also don't want to make any excuses,"" Azarenka said. ""I think Agnieszka felt much worse than me today. I saw her before the match and we looked at each other and we laughed really hard. That says it all."" While Azarenka has just one grand slam to her name, she won five other tournaments this year, reached three more finals, claimed bronze at London 2012 and was ranked No. 1 for all but four weeks. ""I'm really proud of what I've done the whole year,"" the 23-year-old said. ""I started the year with No.3 and I finished with No.1, which in numbers doesn't seem like a huge jump, but we all know in reality it's a pretty big difference. ""I finished the year a much more mature person. I'm very proud of that too. The whole year was a lot of learning experience, trying new things and taking the whole journey with the good and a few bads -- I didn't have many. I cannot complain about this year."" Meanwhile, Roger Federer reached the final of his home Swiss Indoors event for the ninth time with a 7-5 6-4 win over France's Paul-Henri Mathieu on Saturday. The world No. 1 is now level with John McEnroe on 875 career wins, leaving them equal fourth. If he beats his 2009 U.S. Open final conqueror Juan Martin del Potro on Sunday to win the Basel hard-court tournament for the sixth time, the 31-year-old will match American McEnroe on 77 top-level titles.","Maria Sharapova sets up final clash with Serena Williams at WTA Championships .

"(CNN) -- A railroad swing bridge in New Jersey that collapsed near the Delaware River was inspected in November, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday. Several cars on a train that was passing over the bridge derailed Friday morning. Some fell into the water below and one car hit another, tearing it open and releasing a vapor cloud from hazardous materials, Debbie Hersman told reporters at a new conference. Investigators are just beginning to piece together information from the accident and whether the bridge collapse or the train derailment occurred first. The bridge is subject to several different types of inspections, a biannual structure assessment that occurred in May and November, and a quarterly mechanical examination. Inspectors also look at the parts of the bridge underwater once every five years. The next such inspection was scheduled for September 2014. Hersman said the track is inspected often, most recently on November 20. NTSB investigators have interviewed train crews that recently used the bridge and some of them said there have been signal issues with the bridge, which swings across the river when trains need to cross the waterway. Herman said a team from Conrail, which owns and operates the track and the bridge, was at the structure on Thursday. On Friday, the train engineer tried several times to get the bridge signal to turn to green using a keypad, but it stayed red. After about six minutes, the train crew spoke with the dispatcher who monitors the bridge and was given the OK to cross. The front of the train reached the other side of the bridge when the crew said they saw the bridge collapse. Emergency brakes activated, but by that time seven of the cars had derailed, four of which fell in the water. One of the cars in the water was carrying ethanol. The three others were carrying vinyl chloride, and the crash tore open a 1-by-3-foot hole in one of them. The bridge near Paulsboro collapsed in 2009 and was rebuilt, Hersman said. Saturday morning, crews found slightly elevated levels of fumes in the immediate area, but still well below acceptable thresholds, Coast Guard Capt. Cathy Moore said. Twelve square blocks near the scene -- approximately 48 households -- were evacuated Friday. The residents have been told to stay away for three days, Moore said. CNN affiliate WPVI reported that 70 people went to emergency rooms, but no one was injured. Hersman said NTSB investigators are waiting to be told it's safe to conduct on-site information gathering. Her teams will pay close attention to the locking mechanisms on the bridge, she said Sunday. The NTSB has examined most of the cars didn't derail and found no problems with them, Hersman said. Investigators will also be looking at the possibility that elevated levels of water created by Hurricane Sandy affected the bridge. The structure crosses a creek that flows into the Delaware River. Water levels in the creek also rise and fall with the tides.","NTSB chairwoman said bridge is inspected for structural problems twice a year .

"(CNN) -- It's happened again. Another actress apparently forgot she wasn't wearing any underwear when exiting her limo in front of throngs of paparazzi. The result: ""wardrobe malfunction."" Followed, of course, by a ton of free publicity for the actress and her new film. We're talking about Anne Hathaway. At Monday night's New York premiere of ""Les Misérables,"" the 30-year-old star got out of her vehicle in a way that flashed to the paparazzi ""the Full Hathaway."" And next thing you know, she's making the headlines. C'mon, let's be honest: Are these ""malfunctions"" really accidents or just calculated ploys by celebrities to garner attention? Are we being played for idiots, or do celebrities suddenly fall out of their clothes more often than the rest of us? In the case of Hathaway, it seems that the incident was probably a mistake. She told the press that she was ""devastated"" by the mishap. Certainly, she has no history of these types of antics. And she is well-respected in Hollywood. In fact, on Thursday, she received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in ""Les Misérables."" Although you would think that since Hathaway was exiting her car sans underwear, she would do so more carefully than a cowboy climbing off a horse. Especially since she was being dropped off on the red carpet where the paparazzi were lined up like piranhas awaiting a piece of meat. They live for stuff like this. There's no doubt that being a celebrity is challenging. Celebrities have to constantly stay in the limelight. If they're out of sight, they're out of work. This is true for even those who have been very successful. Just this week, Jessica Biel -- a popular actress who recently married Justin Timberlake -- complained about losing out on several movie roles she desperately wanted, including the part in ""Les Misérables"" that went to Hathaway. The answer for some celebs is simple: Do whatever it takes to stay in the public eye. ""Any press is good press"" is the adage they live by. You don't have to look far for examples of this philosophy. Lindsay Lohan, Kim Kardashian, Charlie Sheen, Snooki, Paris Hilton, along with their wardrobe malfunctions, drunken tirades, ""accidentally"" leaked sex tapes, etc. Then there are celebs like Lady Gaga and Rihanna who wear outfits that appear to be intentionally designed wardrobe malfunctions, from see-through blouses to bathing suit tops slightly bigger than a 50-cent piece. They do this all in front of paparazzi all too happy to accommodate their desire for attention. The queen of manipulating the press is Madonna. There are no ""malfunctions"" with Madonna; it's all by design. This summer, during her concert in Istanbul, she flashed the audience her right breast. A month later during her Paris show, she flashed the audience her left breast. Madonna's strategy is truly impressive: Her breasts yielded two different stories, one for each breast. Believe it not, there are celebrities that have not resorted to these tricks to stay relevant. They are able to remain famous and work continually without such extracurricular activities. We have yet to hear about Meryl Streep flashing her breasts on the Letterman show. Or George Clooney inadvertently having a part of his anatomy fall out of his pants. We haven't even seen pictures of people like Ben Affleck or Matt Damon with their zippers accidentally undone. As long as celebrities feel the pressure to remain famous, there will be wardrobe ""malfunctions."" But calling them accidents in many cases is just laughable. They are simply more creative press releases. It could always be worse. One day you could pick up the newspaper and discover Donald Trump has had a wardrobe malfunction revealing to us all: ""The Full Donald."" The thought of that makes me appreciate Madonna's breasts -- both her left and her right one -- that much more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Anne Hathaway had a ""wardrobe malfunction"" at a premiere of ""Les Misérables""

"Washington (CNN) -- Anthony Koller's squad was ambushed in Iraq. He saw his friend die. He spent 14 months at war and returned home with a diagnosis that has become all too common for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans: post-traumatic stress disorder. The Army discharged him but he did not receive medical benefits to which he said he was entitled. There were times when the family, with three small children, did not have any health care coverage at all. But relief is on its way for Koller and more than 1,000 other Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who suffer from PTSD. Under the terms of a class-action lawsuit settlement announced Friday by a veterans advocacy group, those veterans will now receive lifetime disability benefits. The National Veterans Legal Services Program said the U.S. military violated the law by failing  to assign the veterans a 50% or higher disability rating that is needed to qualify for benefits. ""These veterans served our country in time of war, but have waited three to eight years to receive the disability benefits which they've earned for their service,"" said Bart Stichman, co-executive director of the veterans advocacy group. ""Today, a terrible wrong to our nation's war veterans is being righted,"" he said. The case affects as many as 4,000 veterans who were medically discharged because of the disorder between 2003 and 2008. Some were receiving benefits but will now receive higher compensation. ""This is a happy ending to a sad chapter of military mistreatment of those who served our country in time of war,"" Stichman said. Lawyers for the veterans group, the Justice Department and the armed services urged a speedy court approval for the tenative settlement to avoid further delays. Expediting the settlement will help soldiers like Timothy Martin, a Bradley gunner in Iraq who lived through several firefights and bombings. Martin, a single father, was told he could no longer serve in the military due to his PTSD, but ""was separated from the military without retirement benefits and a low disability rating, well below what the law stipulated,"" the veterans group said. Martin said in a court statement that his family was struggling to make ends meet. Now he will finally be able to get help from the military. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder filed a class-action lawsuit .

"(CNN) -- Are we there yet? If you're Voyager 1 and you're looking for a spot beyond the end of our solar system, the answer is no. NASA officials have been saying for months that Voyager 1 is almost there when it comes to interstellar space as it continues the longest road trip in the history of mankind. Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 took off 16 days apart in 1977, and Voyager 1 is now about 11 billion miles (18 billion kilometers) from the sun. On Monday, project officials said new information sent back from the ship yielded a surprising result. ""If we would have only looked at particle data alone, we would have said we're out of the solar system,"" said Tom Krimigis, a scientist from Johns Hopkins University who examines data on low-energy charged particles. ""But nature is very imaginative, and Lucy pulled up the football again."" The Voyager team believes this region is where lines of magnetic particles from the solar system are meeting particles from interstellar space. Because the direction of the magnetic lines is unchanged, the project members count this as part of the solar system. When the direction changes, Voyager 1 will finally be in interstellar space. ""We believe this is the last leg of our journey to interstellar space,"" said project member Edward Stone of the California Institute of Technology. ""Our best guess is it's likely just a few months to a couple years away. The new region isn't what we expected, but we've come to expect the unexpected from Voyager."" The spacecraft entered the new region in July, fueling predictions it was getting close to the edge of the solar system. Voyager 2, which is on a different flight path, is a few billion miles closer to the sun.

"(CNN) -- Katt Williams announced the end of his stand-up comedy career Monday, a day after a bizarre incident in Seattle that landed him in jail. ""I'm just going to go ahead and announce my retirement from stand-up,"" he told a photographer for Seattle TV station KOMO Monday night. ""I'm kinda done."" Williams was in Seattle to perform over the weekend, but his allegedly aggressive behavior at a Seattle bar and an odd exchange with police ended with him in the King County, Washington, jail Sunday on charges of assault, harassment and obstruction. He was released on bond Monday morning, a jail official said. He was also involved in incidents in Sacramento and Oakland during comedy tour stops in California in the past month. KOMO aired an interview with Williams that is said was recorded on a street after he was ejected from a south Lake Union hotel Monday evening. Police detail Katt Williams' bizarre behavior . ""I've already discussed it with my kids,"" Williams said. ""I wasn't really going to do it on a Seattle street. I was going to Los Angeles and do it in the offices of ICM or LiveNation."" ICM is a talent agency, and LiveNation is a concert promotion company. Williams told the station he would remain in Seattle until a Thursday court date on the criminal charges and while he files a lawsuit against the city ""for this $50 million that I want for crippling my reputation as a father and a black man and as a taxpaying citizen and as a person who is not a convicted felon."" Williams ""exchanged words with patrons in the bar, brandished a pool cue at a bar manager and refused to leave the business,"" and later refused to show identification to a police officer who had been called to the scene, a Seattle police news release said. Officer Michael Virgilio wrote in the arrest report that the World Sports Bar manager told him Williams had returned to the bar Sunday after being involved in a dispute with a customer the night before. ""I suppose you're going to ask me to take my hands out of my pockets, huh?"" Williams said to Virgilio, according to the report. Williams refused to give his name or show an ID, but ""yelled out a (California) driver's license number,"" the officer wrote. When Virgilio warned he would arrest him for obstruction unless he produced an ID, Williams said ""no."" The comedian then turned around and placed his hands behind his back ""on his own accord,"" the arrest report said. ""Two of Williams' associates were standing nearby and were pleading for Williams to calm down,"" the officer wrote. While being handcuffed and searched, Williams ""made several comments about how he was going to sue the department,"" the report said. ""He stated he had been arrested over 30 times in the last few months and every time he was released prior to being booked into jail,"" Virgilio wrote. ""He made comments regarding my employment with the city of Seattle and how it would end as a result of his arrest. Williams stated he had millions of dollars, and this arrest would not affect him."" After the search turned up Williams' passport in his pocket, the officer asked why he hadn't just handed it over. ""You asked for my driver's license,"" he quoted Williams saying. ""I didn't have it!"" Then, it got worse, the arrest report said. ""Williams became aggressive and resistant and his actions forced me to take him to the ground for a short period of time. He was subsequently placed in the back of my patrol car."" Williams was playing pool in the bar when Sunday's trouble started, the report said. ""An argument began and quickly escalated."" When the manager tried to separate Williams from the couple with whom he was arguing, Williams yelled at him for ""protecting the customers from the famous guy,"" Virgilio wrote. ""Williams picked up a pool stick, raised it up and pointed it at (the manager's) face,"" the report said. ""(The manager) continued to state if he hadn't stepped back the stick would have hit in the the face."" When the manager asked him to put the stick down, Williams said ""What if I don't?"" and jabbed the stick toward him again, the report said. ""At one point during the altercation, Williams followed a family outside of the bar where, as the family got into their car, Williams flicked a cigarette through a car window at a woman, striking her just below her eye,"" the police news release said. ""Williams also threw a rock at the family's car."" Virgilio said he would request additional charges against Williams, including reckless endangerment, because the rock hit a window in the family's car, ""directly next to an 8-year-old girl."" ""Had the glass shattered or the rock had penetrated the window, it could have struck and harmed the 8-year-old victim,"" he said. Williams began his career as a stand-up comic, gaining attention in 1999 for comedy club appearances. Television appearances on the BET network led to more success. His 2006 HBO special ""Katt Williams: Pimp Chronicles Pt.1"" raised his profile even higher. He has acted in several movies, including Eddie Murphy's ""Norbit,"" and his voice is featured in several popular cartoons, including ""The Boondocks."" His often raunchy style has drawn comparisons to comedy legend Richard Pryor.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- So often it starts with just a provocative word, and in my case it was three ... ""Black and Blue"". A phrase more commonly used to describe bruising and pain had been used as the title of an autobiography by Chelsea's first black footballer, Paul Canoville. Paul Canoville endured horrendous abuse in the 1980s as Chelsea's first black footballer. I was sold on it even before I'd opened the front cover, the book's description hinted at an incredible story of a young footballer who had managed to fulfil his dreams, against all the odds. But Canoville's dream was often a nightmare, he suffered horrendous abuse from both his own team's supporters, as well as opposition fans, and it took him years to finally become accepted by ""his own."" This was back in 1982 -- and his experience wasn't entirely unique. The few players who ""looked different"" in the 1970s and 80s were regularly subjected to vile abuse from the stands, monkey chanting and the humiliation of being targeted by supporters throwing bananas and other pieces of fruit. I'm fortunately too young to remember seeing any of this stuff at football grounds. By the time I started going regularly to games in London in the late 80s much of this had died down and now it's very, very rare in the UK. Campaign groups like ""Kick It Out"" have helped eradicate much of it at sporting arenas, where at the very least it is deemed socially unacceptable. But Canoville's story was an eye-opening, jaw-dropping window into the past and I was keen to meet him. To sit with Paul in the seats at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground and re-live his torment was a sobering assignment, but I was impressed with his strength and philosophy. He's taken some hard knocks in his life, drug addiction and cancer to name but two, but he never let the bigots cool his passion for the game. Tragically, it was a serious knee injury that forced him out of football in 1987. The fact that Paul is still an active campaigner against racism tells you something though -- there's still work to be done. But whatever problems linger in the UK -- it's nothing compared to continental Europe and beyond. Using Canoville as the cornerstone for our investigation, we looked at Spain and Italy; two high-profile footballing nations, where it's said that attempts to tackle racism are 30 years behind the UK. Why is that? And has there been any serious attempts to deal with it? Is enough being done to tackle racism in sport? Have your say . We talked to some of the biggest names in the European game Samuel Eto'o, Zinedine Zidane and the UEFA President Michel Platini to get their thoughts. Of course it's not just football that suffers, earlier this year Formula One's first black racing driver Lewis Hamilton was on the receiving end of racist abuse while testing in Spain. There was uproar in the British media, but for some reason the Spanish press seemed less excited. In some top-level, win-at-all-costs professional sports, it seems as though racism has almost become an acceptable barb with which to jibe your opponent. Increasingly, there are examples of racism within international cricket; India and Australia have been the latest to clash. Sledging has always been cutting and personal, but it seems in some cases that a mark is being overstepped. Or is it all just a big misunderstanding? We sent a reporter to the heartland of the game, India, to see if racism really is a problem and if so, to find out what is being done. How are children being raised in the game, and are insults -- of whatever nature -- considered acceptable to those who will one day represent their country on the international stage? We have also looked at the situation in South Africa - a nation which has for so long struggled with racial tension -- to see whether steps to integrate blacks into historically white teams are working. Can quota systems ever work? Or are they counter-productive, leaving everyone with a bad taste in the mouth? Perhaps the rainbow nation can look towards the U.S. for inspiration? For some, ""Negro"" sporting leagues are still in living memory, but a glance at the NBA for example would suggest that integration has been successfully achieved. The dark past is never far away though -- only this year a golf commentator caused a furore by suggestion that Tiger Woods rivals should ""lynch him in a back alley."" Our investigation therefore covers four continents and many different sports, hearing from those that have suffered racism and those who have helped to tackle it. Can it ever be beaten, or merely suppressed? Is sport a barometer of social attitudes or a platform to initiate wider change? Are racist abusers in sport genuinely prejudiced or merely looking for an edge? These are hard very questions to answer, but we hope to at least shed some light on the matter and get a debate going in our series, both on-air and online. I hope you find it is as stimulating to ponder as it was for us to produce.","CNN considers issues of racism in sport in a one-week special .

"(CNN) -- In 2009, we wrote a book, ""40 More Years: How Democrats Will Rule the Next Generation."" Building on Ruy Teixeira and John Judis' 2002 tour de force ""The Emerging Democratic Majority"" predicting the 2008 election, we argued that America's diversifying and increasingly liberal youth voters would secure a lasting Democratic majority. Our collaboration seemed appropriate then and is only more so now. On one half of the byline, you have James Carville, 68-year-old white man from Louisiana and professor at Tulane University. On the other side, you've got a 26-year-old second-generation Latina with a fiancée. Voters who look like James are on their way out; voters like Rebecca are our future. A few reviewers missed the point of our focus on demographics. Others, primarily young, entitled, progressive men, critiqued us for not recommending that Democrats focus on appealing to young, entitled, progressive men. To this, we plead guilty. Our book was about demographic diversity and the future of the Democratic Party. Politics: What the election teaches us about ourselves . After the midterm elections in 2010, we were mocked viciously. Our thesis was laughable, Republicans hooted, ignoring the book's careful caveat that midterm election turnout differs substantially from that of presidential elections. We would like to direct these critics to the Epistle of Jude, 1:10: ""Yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand; and what things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals—these are the very things that destroy them."" Tuesday night proved our 2009 selves could not have been more right. ""Mid-20th century, white men made up half of the electorate,"" we wrote in 2009. ""In 2008, white men made up only 36% of the electorate ... and their vote share is dropping by a percentage point a year."" Our only error was in slightly underestimating the rate at which white men's vote share is shrinking. White voters were 74% of voters in 2008; they were 72% this year. White men comprised just 34% of the electorate on Tuesday. Politics: The new American electorate has arrived . In 2009, we also commented on the Republicans' reliance on the far right and evangelical voters: ""The shrinking Christian right leaves a void in the Republicans' collection of base groups—and they can't look to any growing groups to replace those votes."" Mitt Romney outperformed Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential candidate, by 5 points with both white voters overall (59%) and white men (62%). He also bested McCain's margin among Republicans, winning 93% of self-identified Republicans as compared to McCain's 90%, and white evangelical voters, 79% compared with McCain's 73%. Romney lost by relying on a tapped-out, ever-shrinking group of voters. By way of contrast, Latinos now make up a greater share of the electorate than they did four years ago: 10% of all voters. Obama won 71% of Latinos, reflecting an increase in support of 4%. Similarly, the proportion of the electorate identifying as Asian increased from 2% to 3%, and Obama's support among Asian voters rose 11 points, from 62% to 73%. There's an entire chapter in ""40 More Years"" on the importance of youth voters. Four years ago, 18% of the electorate was between 18 and 29. Now, youth are 19% of voters. We highlighted a critical trend within the youth vote: ""Back in 1972, almost nine in 10 youth voters (87%) were white. By 2004, only 62% of youth said they were white."" This year, about 58% of voters 18-29 identified as white; 42.1% of youth self-reported as African-American, Latino, or otherwise nonwhite. Opinion: How GOP can attract Latino voters . We also predicted the implosion of Republicans' culture war strategy. Our conclusion was that ""[w]hat Bush started in 2000 was a two-election trick that had met its natural and timely death by 2008."" Our critics tried to answer our claim by citing the success of culture-war tactics in 2004 and their state-level effects in 2008. We ignored them. As we said, ""The consequence of Republicans' lingering preoccupation with the culture war is that it has led them to become a party of ridiculous positions."" Republicans would ""have to be certifiable,"" our sage selves circa 2009 warned, to ever try a culture war strategy again. We could not be more delighted that Maine, Maryland and Washington became the first states in the country to pass same-sex marriage by popular vote on Tuesday. What we're downright thrilled about, however, is the fact that Mitt Romney got fewer votes than ""traditional"" marriage in every one of those states. The Republicans did their damnedest to use the specter of homosexual marital bliss to incite their base voters to vote for Mitt Romney. In the past, that has worked. This time, the best they could do with millions of dollars and overt hate mongering—their favorite weapons—was mobilize a conservative minority that voted for ""traditional marriage"" but rejected Romney. Some analyses have tried to make 2012 about single women or educated white women or some other narrow slice of the electorate. They're thinking small. The big picture is this: Democrats are continuing to win big with the demographic groups that are growing; Republicans are still struggling to increase support with shrinking base voter groups. Republicans made critical, unforced errors in 2008 and 2012. Our present hope is that Republicans continue to mock rather than read ""40 More Years,"" and that Democrats take heed. It's not that we like saying we told you so. It's just that we wrote an entire book telling you so. Opinion: GOP voter suppression fueled black turnout .

"(CNN) -- In the 1950s, I was almost gang-molested by a group of male fellow high school students. The incident took place one afternoon in the basement basketball court of the nearby Catholic church, of which I was a member. I had recently invited one member of the group to what I thought was an innocent get-together at a local square dance. I supposed later that they thought ""I wanted it."" As I remember the incident, after some friendly play in the gym, the guys (four of them) turned on me, holding the ball as if I were the basket. The look on their faces terrified me. I ducked under their outstretched arms and ran, all the way home without looking back. I never mentioned the incident until 1983, when I spoke at a rally supporting a student of mine who was gang-raped at a fraternity party. The rape case unraveling in Steubenville, Ohio, brought back memories of my own frightening experience. I didn't know what was happening that day when the four young men began looking at me differently. I only knew that I had to get away as soon as possible. In the Steubenville case, a girl purportedly passed out and was allegedly sexually assaulted by two young men on the high school football team while others watched. What strikes me about the incident is that it demonstrates a split in the boy rape-prone sexual culture. Some young men continue to believe that when a girl gets drunk, staging a sexual spectacle for their mates is part of a night's fun. They don't think of it as rape. Some of their buddies, however, disagree. In their transition to manhood, they are able to name rape when they see it. This split opinion is illustrated in the video posted a few days ago by Anonymous showing a young man -- presumably an eyewitness -- egged on by others, telling his version of what happened. The video footage is disturbing, to say the least. He repeats in a litany format that the girl is dead. However, he doesn't mean lifeless, except in the sense that she isn't moving. ""How do you feel on a dead girl?"" he asks someone in the room. He describes her as ""deader than a doornail."" When asked ""How do you know she's dead?"" he answers that she is dead because she isn't moving. He then goes on to describe how dead: ""Deader than Andy Reid's son ... deader than Chris Henry ... deader than OJ's wife ... deader than f***ing JFK ... deader than Trayvon Martin."" In other words, made only for use by men. In the cacophony of voices spurring him on, one hears the word ""rape"" from one or two other voices. One says, ""This is not funny,"" only to be drowned out by the laughter of the main speaker and those supporting him. When asked ""What if that was your daughter?"" he answers, ""If that was my daughter, I wouldn't care. I'd just let her be dead."" Besides, he says, ""Is it really rape because you don't know if she wanted to or not,"" the teenager says on the video. ""She might have wanted to."" In response, the onlooker says, ""You are sick."" What happened in Steubenville that night in August seems to suggest that some sort of sexual assault took place, at least from this eyewitness account if the video is verified to be authentic. Most rape laws in the U.S. state that sexual activity on a person who is incapacitated or unable to consent constitutes rape. One of the clauses of the Ohio law states that sexual activity is not permissible when ""the other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age."" The girl's incapacity comes not just from the multiple mentions of her being dead in the video. There is also possibly a photo of her being dragged along held by her wrists and ankles by two boys. In the United States, surveys administered from the early 1980s to the present indicate that 20% to 25% of female students say they have experienced nonconsensual sex by the age of 21. Every year, a high-profile case of gang rape appears in the news. With each new report, many Americans react with shock. Confronted with such cases, many explain it away, thinking or actually saying ""she wanted it."" Why do we think this way? Doing so is behind the strange idea of ""legitimate rape."" When will our sexual culture change so that an inebriated girl (or boy) is protected rather than abused? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy R. Sanday.","A video shows boys talking about the alleged rape in Steubenville, Ohio .

"(CNN) -- It was a horrifying front-page photo in every sense of the word. It felt cheap, degrading and exploitative in a way that words could never match. The photo captures a Queens man, Ki-Suck Han, after he had been pushed onto the subway tracks Monday as an oncoming train roared toward him. The screaming headline says it all: ""DOOMED."" But the New York Post had every right to run the picture. This is what tabloids do -- milk tragedy for every ounce of emotional impact. No New York straphanger should have been surprised to see the photo. Perspective: 'Outraged' at NY subway death photo . A typical reaction: ""Sickening rubber-necking front page from the New York Post. Imagine how this man's family feels,"" tweeted an editor at The Guardian. That, of course, is the normal human response. It also explains why Rupert Murdoch's paper did it, knowing that everyone in New York would be gripped by the image. Watch: Is the New York Post harassing Alec Baldwin in alleged stalker case? No one would dispute that the story is newsworthy. It is, in fact, every New Yorker's nightmare. Perhaps you have to have spent much of your life crowding onto narrow platforms with total strangers and trying to squeeze onto overcrowded subway cars, to understand the every-day fear that you could be groped, mugged or pushed into danger. Watch: Fox's Roger Ailes courted David Petraeus for possible presidential run . Why, then, the visceral sense of revulsion? It's fine to look down your nose at the New York Post for showing such a horrific picture, to say it was grossly unethical. But what about all the media outlets that show equally horrific pictures from war zones? We've seen bloodied children in Gaza, Pakistani police machine-gunned by the Taliban, bodies being thrown off roofs in Syria. And we're horrified by a picture of a man who is about to die in New York? What's the difference? Is it any worse because it happens in the United States? The truth is that this picture seems more monstrously unfair because we can easily imagine being in the victim's place. We may complain about it, but if it's so clearly out of bounds, why have so many websites and television networks now run it? For the Post to run it was unfair to Han's family, but the media don't usually worry about such things. It was accurate and captured an important story. Watch: Are TV newsbabes dressing sexy for ratings? It was insensitive -- hard to imagine the photo running in The New York Times -- but people buy the Post for punch-in-the-gut tales, for the ""headless body in topless bar,"" not for astute foreign policy analysis. The story is so sickening that we want to turn away but can't. The picture makes us so uncomfortable that we're mad at the Post for inflicting it on us. There are pictures of murder victims in the paper every day, part of the sad toll of urban life. But the difference is that we're not watching them being shot or stabbed. Watch: Media embrace cop who bought boots for homeless man . One aspect of this tale that makes my blood boil is the role of the freelance photographer, R. Umar Abbasi. Instead of snapping two pictures of a man about to die, why didn't he try to pull him to safety? Abbasi claims he hoped the flash would warn the subway driver. I'm not buying it. His first instinct was to record death, not prevent it. Every editor has to strike a balance between depicting ugly reality and the sensibilities of readers and viewers. There are those who believe that the American media should run more pictures of dead or wounded soldiers, that we -- especially in television news -- sanitize war by shying away from showing its victims. Would I have run the front-page photo of Han? No way. But the New York Post has a different mission, to shock and sensationalize, especially when it comes to crime. On that point, the tabloid succeeded, which is why so many people are angry -- and everyone is buzzing about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: New York Post ran degrading, exploitative pic of man about to be hit by subway .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Ann Nixon Cooper craned her neck and leaned her head forward. On the television set across the room, Barack Obama moved forward and put his hand on the Bible. Ann Nixon Cooper, 107, watched the inauguration from her Atlanta home: ""I'm most excited."" At 107 years old, Cooper said she always believed she might live to see a black man sworn in as president of the United States. ""I had that in mind all the time -- all the time -- hoping for a great change that would happen in my day,"" she said, a charm necklace with a gold ""107"" around her neck. ""I was hoping that it would happen in my time."" This moment in history, she said, marks one of the greatest days of her event-filled life. ""I'm most excited about it ... just nothing but the greatest,"" she said, a wide smile spread across her face. ""Our new president means nothing but more freedom as a human being. That's all. That's all it could mean to us. You feel more like a real person.""  Watch Cooper's reaction » . She knew the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he was just a boy in Atlanta. Today, she said, ""he would be most happy."" She added, ""That's all I looked forward to: better days, because we've never known any better days. But now, you see, we can live like real people."" The African-American centenarian, three grandsons and her caretaker gathered in her quiet Atlanta home to watch the inauguration of the nation's first African-American president. When Obama began heading toward the ceremony, she asked not to be bothered. ""I've got to be concentrating,"" she said with a smile.  Watch ""Hope over fear"" » . The grandsons clapped their hands when Obama was announced to the sea of people who had gathered on the National Mall. ""Look at that crowd,"" said Jeff Cooper, one of her grandsons. Cooper sat quietly, taking it all in, her legs wrapped in a fuzzy red blanket. She laughed and smiled moments after Obama was officially sworn in. Obama began his speech with the words, ""My fellow citizens."" ""All right, listen,"" Cooper said, leaning her head forward again, her eyebrows raised in the hushed room. At the end of the speech, Jeff Cooper hugged her and kissed her cheek. ""Grandma, how does it feel to have a black president?"" ""I'm so happy,"" she said. She said she remembers the days when she couldn't vote and was subjected to racial slurs and injustices. ""There was a time when they thought they could just kick us around,"" she said. ""Now, it has changed."" She said she could've been at the inauguration Tuesday, but she wasn't up to it because of her age. ""I didn't need to be there. They know my thoughts,"" she said. Eric Mannings, a 54-year-old grandson, said simply, ""This is history. Let me start by saying, 'God is good.' "" ""My understanding of the struggle comes through my parents and grandparents,"" he said. ""The difficulties involved in just being black in America have been so overwhelming."" He said he was proud to share this moment with his grandmother. ""She's gone from oil lamps ... to cell phones, from horse and buggies to spaceships. She's seen it all."" ""She has seen black people liberated.""  Watch the struggles of a slave's grandson » . Of Obama, Mannings added, ""This isn't the end. ... He's the American president, not just the black president."" Ann Nixon Cooper celebrated her 107th birthday last week. The ""107"" charm necklace she had on for this day was given to her by Andrew Young, the former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and former Atlanta mayor. He's given her a new charm every year since she turned 99. Cooper and her late husband, prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper, raised four children in their Atlanta house. The home was a center of Atlanta's black society and the scene of many parties. In Obama's victory speech in November, he praised Cooper's fight. ""She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin."" Cooper has called Atlanta home since the 1920s. She co-founded a Girls Club for African-American youth and taught community residents to read in a tutoring program at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, often dropped in to visit. ""It's been a house with a heap of living going on in it,"" Cooper said. Born in 1902 in Shelbyville, Tennessee, Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103. She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip. Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter is 83. She has 14 grandchildren living and many great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. On a typical day, Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood-paneled sitting room. Her favorite shows are ""The Price is Right,"" ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" and ""Dancing with the Stars."" But on this day, the set was tuned to CNN and the swearing-in of the nation's 44th president. All Americans, she said, need to ""work with him."" ""All of us work together, and it will all turn out all right. That's the way I feel about it.""

"New York (CNN) -- Every parent's worst nightmare became reality for a New York City couple when their 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son were stabbed to death, allegedly at the hands of their nanny. Two months after that October tragedy, Marina and Kevin Krim have embarked on a cross-country trip, adding a literal dimension to their road to recovery by sharing images and insights gleaned from their journey on Facebook. With the new year, the couple and their 4-year-old daughter, Nessie, set out from Los Angeles ""hopeful that 2013 will be a year of healing, growth and peace."" ""She saves us every day,"" Kevin Krim wrote on Facebook, referring to his surviving daughter. The pair have created the Lulu & Leo Fund in their slain children's names to carry on their ""love of arts and sciences education."" It's not clear how much money the couple has raised, but its purpose is to support ""art and science education for young children in schools, museums, and other community institutions,"" according to a statement. As the couple head east aboard a recreational vehicle, the Krims said they hope ""to experience some inspiring moments that will help us with our healing and rebuilding when we get back to NYC."" Included in that post was a ""gorgeous sunset at the beach that Lulu and Leo painted for us."" They said they also drew comfort from inspirational images as they reached Sante Fe, New Mexico, on Saturday. A mother's greatest fear . ""We strolled through a few art galleries today and found some pieces at the Canyon Road Contemporary Art Gallery that we are sure Lulu and Leo would have loved,"" the couple wrote. In November, a New York grand jury indicted Yoselyn Ortega on first- and second-degree murder charges in the deaths of Lucia and Leo Krim. Their mother returned home to her Upper West Side apartment, police said, and found her children in the bathroom. She also saw the nanny stab herself with a kitchen knife, authorities said. Ortega is currently being held at the Elmhurst Hospital Prison Ward, according to the New York City Department of Correction. Since their children's death, the couple have sought to use art from their trip in the healing process, posting the images online. ""We created the Lulu & Leo Fund to help more children benefit from these education experiences in art and science,"" the couple say in the fund's mission statement, describing how much Lulu cherished her ""beloved 'Art Afternoons' class at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."" The page has since accumulated more than 14,000 ""likes"" on Facebook. Before the deaths, Marina Krim maintained a blog called ""Life with the Little Krim Kids,"" offering her view of family life, which had included Ortega.","Parents of children stabbed to death in October start arts and science fund .

"(CNN) -- If you don't have the time, inclination and, more importantly, the money to go to university in Manila, you can still get a degree. It will cost you between $US10 and $US60, it will take about two hours to complete and it will be fake. Welcome to ""Recto University,"" the name Manila mockingly gives to the strip of document counterfeiters that openly ply their trade between Claro M. Recto and Rizal Avenues in the Philippines capital. Located a stone's throw from Manila's university district and, somewhat ironically, Manila City Jail, the counterfeiters of Recto can run off a university testamur, any type of diploma, a job reference and, more worryingly, a pilot's license and a seaman's certificate in a matter of hours. ""Today business is not so good,"" says a hawker sitting beside a makeshift sign displaying fake diplomas, driver's licenses and job references that can be bought for as little as 500 pesos (US$11.50). ""If we do five documents a day, we're doing well,"" he says smiling broadly. ""Sunday is our best day, because people start class or work the next day. Term time at the universities is much better for us than the semester break. ""Our business is tied to the academic year,"" he says. While degrees, licenses and identification from the Philippines are the counterfeiters' strong suit -- and locals say they can even source testamur paper from the year you graduated for added authenticity -- they will attempt any type of foreign document. Could they do a Green Card, for example, or anything with a hologram? The man turns to a fellow hawker next to his sign and, after a brief exchange in Tagalog, both nod emphatically. ""We can do anything if we've got the original,"" he says. ""It depends how much you're willing to pay."" For students in Manila, the strip on Recto is a one-stop shop for term papers and end-of-year assignments. ""I once went to Recto with five other classmates and we paid to get term papers,"" said Cecilia Rohas, a former student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines. ""I needed 30 pages, double spaced, on the Philippines revolutionary movement under the Spanish and, sure enough, I got 30 pages, double-spaced, all with a bibliography at the back. ""I was too busy studying for the end-of-year exams to do the term paper. Everybody does it,"" says Ms Rohas. These days, she says, the operators on Recto have globalised operations, providing academic texts to order online. ""It's becoming a good line for people in Manila that want to make a living by writing,"" she adds. ""I guess because of the high level of English in the Philippines it's a good fit."" While other 'diploma mill' operators on the Recto strip operate openly and in full view of the law, the stallholder stands nervously to attention when two police saunter past his sandwich board. Crackdowns have become more frequent since Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, nicknamed ""Dirty Harry"" for his tough stance with the national police, ordered a clean up of the ID mills several years ago. The stallholders on Recto rarely do the forgeries themselves, acting simply as runners to forgers who do the counterfeiting behind closed doors. In October, police raided one of the country's most audacious scams; an entire bogus government department that was collecting ""taxes"" using forged documents and IDs. While police suspect the fake presidential agency may have had their own, more sophisticated, in-house forgers who used the latest technology to produce their paperwork and identity cards, the standard of street counterfeits is getting better. The National Bureau of Investigation's Questioned Documents Division is tight-lipped about the level of sophistication of the forgeries, but admits it's a tough game keeping ahead of the counterfeiters. ""Are the counterfeiters improving? Yes they are,"" says Carolyn Moldez-Pitoy, supervising document examiner with the National Bureau of Investigation. ""The good part is that we are also getting better at detecting them and that dissuades the forgers.""","Manila's fake degree mill does a thriving business on Claro M. Recto Avenue .

"(CNN) -- Regional leaders meeting in Uganda on Saturday called on a rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to withdraw from a city seized by its fighters this week and to ""stop all war activities."" The M23 group must also ""stop talk of overthrowing an elected government,"" said a statement issued by the regional leaders at the end of the Great Lakes region summit in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. It states the rebels should withdraw at least 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Goma and that the U.N. mission for DR Congo, MONUSCO, should monitor the buffer zone. The statement also calls on the Congolese government to listen to and resolve the grievances of the rebels, who took control of the city of Goma on Tuesday after days of fighting with government forces. Rebel leader in Uganda for Congo crisis talks . The M23 group was named for a peace deal reached on March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. Congolese President Joseph Kabila was among the leaders who attended the conference Saturday aimed at ending the crisis. Rwandan President Paul Kagame was scheduled to attend, but sent his foreign minister instead, Ugandan officials said. Kagame attended monthly community meetings Saturday where residents plant trees, according to his website. The Rwandan president met his Congolese counterpart Tuesday in Uganda. After the meeting, the leaders issued a statement calling on the rebels to pull out of Goma. Rene Abandi, a spokesman for the M23 group, told reporters on the sidelines of the conference Saturday that the rebels' main aim was to force the Congolese president to agree to talks. ""We want talks over human rights and insecurity (involving) issues contained in the 2009 truce, which he, Kabila, has refused to implement,"" Abandi said. The outstanding issues include the sharing out of positions in the national army, an equitable distribution of resources and infrastructure development in eastern DR Congo, Abandi said. ""If he (Kabila) does not agree talks now on how we get to implement the 2009 truce, then he will take full responsibility of what will happen later."" On Wednesday, another M23 spokesman told crowds at Goma's stadium that his group would fight on. ""President Kabila brought war planes and big guns, but he was unable to defeat us. That is a clear sign that we are part of God's plan, we were sent by God and this will not end here,"" Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said. ""We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government."" Rebel march continues in Eastern Congo . The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 by providing it with arms, support and soldiers. Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation. As the latest conflict flares, aid groups are warning of escalating risks of diseases and abductions facing victims fleeing the violence and uncertainty. International organizations, including Oxfam, World Vision and the United Nations, have been forced to abandon operations in eastern DR Congo. Their exit leaves the area susceptible to a humanitarian crisis, including spreading attacks and children at risk of kidnappings by groups such as the Lord's Resistance Army. ""UNHCR is extremely concerned about the situation of displaced people in Democratic Republic of the Congo's North Kivu province, especially children and other vulnerable groups,"" said Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the world body's refugee agency. Edwards said his agency works in 31 displaced camps that host about 108,000 people in North Kivu. ""The fighting has meant that we and our partners have not been able to access most of these areas,"" he said. ""Only Mugunga III just outside Goma can be currently visited."" Rebels threaten wider Congo conflict . North and South Kivu face the greatest risk. The Kivus are considered mineral-rich in a country known for its vast reserves of diamonds, gold and copper. The area's potential for wealth has been plundered by greedy warlords. Civil wars -- most recently in the 1990s through 2003 -- have left millions dead and displaced entire generations. On Tuesday, the United Nations moved all but a core team to Rwanda to avoid casualties and urged armed parties to ensure civilians' safety. ""In Goma, there have been reports of 60 assaults on civilians to our partners,"" Edwards said Friday. ""Our partners are telling us eight people have been killed, and houses and shops have been looted."" Killings included six women, including one who was pregnant and an additional infant, according to Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. The fighting between M23 and the Congolese army has left the Kivus vulnerable to other armed groups, raising the possibility of the Lord's Resistance Army abducting children, said Marixie Mercado, a spokeswoman for the U.N. children's agency. ""There are other groups operating in the area, which raises the likelihood of recruitment of children,"" she said. And the risks are not limited to violence. ""Before the crisis started, there were already 27,000 cases of cholera reported in the country,"" she said. "" Running water in Goma has just been restored. It had been shut off for over a week and there are huge numbers of children collecting water from Lake Kivu which obviously raises the risk of disease spreading."" The U.N.'s refugee agency estimates that more than 589,000 people have been displaced in North and South Kivu since the beginning of the year. Oxfam estimates that 230,000 are affected by this crisis alone. Rebels seize control of Goma amid clashes .

"University Avenue, Yangon (CNN) -- I am surfing the Internet from Aung San Suu Kyi's garden. That sentence implies several minor miracles. The fact that I am in the country at all is surprising. I was deported for my reporting on the repression here... twice. Now I have been invited back with the White House press pack, my past ""sins"" apparently forgotten. To be here at this most famous house is strangely moving. I'd driven past it on numerous occasions when Daw Suu was under house arrest -- the secret police watching the entrance, whispering into their radios, as they saw a car full of Westerners approaching. You couldn't even stop on this part of University Avenue in those days, let alone wander around the manicured garden of ""the Lady."" Now I am waiting for her most famous visitor yet -- U.S. President Barack Obama will be stopping here for a chat. Read more: Obama to urge Myanmar not to extinguish 'flickers of progress' It is the historic culmination of three years of hard diplomacy. The U.S. policy of sanctions was clearly failing: punishing the people and leaving the elite free to plunder the rich resources of this benighted country. In 2009, the White House initiated a review of policy towards the country it still stubbornly calls Burma. It resulted in a significant shift toward Myanmar. Engagement was the watchword. But few dared to predict how quickly events would move. Officials here are frank about their astonishment. Don't forget it was only just over two years ago that Suu Kyi was still under house arrest and the whole road map to democracy seemed a sham.

"(CNN) -- The driver of a large motor coach that crashed in Oregon late last month, killing nine and injuring 39, had worked 92 hours in the seven days leading up to the crash, far exceeding the 70 hours allowed, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, which Tuesday ordered the Canadian bus company to cease operations in the United States. The transportation department said the Vancouver-based company, Mi Joo Tour & Travel Ltd., poses an ""imminent hazard to public safety"" because of its failure to take basic measures to ensure that its drivers are properly rested. In a 10-page order, the department outlines a list of accusations against Mi Joo Tour & Travel involving its conduct before and after the crash. The DOT said the company failed to test the driver for drugs and alcohol after the December 30 crash. It also accused the company of continuing to operate in early 2012, when it ordered the company to discontinue operations because of its failure to pay fines. Those fines also involved the company's failure to conduct drug and alcohol tests. Bus company in crash had history of DOT violations . The deadly accident happened as one of Mi Joo's small fleet of buses was returning to Vancouver, British Columbia, from Las Vegas, police said. The bus skidded on ice on Interstate 84 near Pendleton, Oregon, crashed through a guardrail and tumbled down a steep embankment. A CNN check of a DOT website, billed as a convenient way for passengers to check on bus company safety records, did not yield any information on the company's history of violations. But in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from CNN, the DOT turned over inspection reports showing the company had been cited for 11 violations in 2010 and eight violations in 2011. The 2010 violations included one ""Acute"" violation, which led the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency within the DOT, to place the company on ""conditional"" status. After a 2011 inspection, the motor carrier administration gave Mi Joo a ""satisfactory"" rating. During both reviews, the company was ordered to comply with all rules. Other records also show Mi Joo's operating authority was revoked in 2008 after the motor carrier agency informed the company that it did not have proof of insurance on file. The license was reinstated after two weeks when the company provided proof that it had the required insurance. In its order this week, the administration says it has discovered a ""deterioration in your safety management controls and widespread safety violations that demonstrate a continuing and flagrant general disregard"" of the rules. ""Mi Joo does not monitor its drivers' hours of service to ensure that its drivers do not violate"" work-hour restrictions,"" the order says. DOT investigators said Mi Joo does not require its drivers to maintain driver logs and supporting documentation. Transportation department officials this week defended its inspections of Mi Joo, saying the FMCSA has a ""robust compliance program,"" conducting almost 1,900 compliance reviews in 2012 and more than 100,000 roadside inspections. It said its consumer website contains the most recent compliance reviews and that rules for what is included on the site are vetted during a public review process. ""Don't risk your life ... by making an uninformed decision,"" the department says in one promotion for the site. In news releases and other material, the SAFER website -- for Safety and Fitness Electronic Records -- is promoted as a way for travelers to determine whether bus companies are safe.","U.S. Department of Transportation bans Canadian bus company in fatal crash .

"(EW.com) -- It's the comeback that ""General Hospital"" fans have been waiting for: the Emmy-winning Genie Francis, who spent a little over a year on ""The Young and the Restless,"" will return to the ABC soap that made her a household name, EW has learned exclusively. Francis just closed a deal to reprise her role as Laura Spencer for the drama's 50th anniversary this year. She'll report to the sudser's Los Angeles, California, set sometime later this month for a February 11 debut, which is actually 50 days before the series' April 1 anniversary. It's unclear how long Francis, a.k.a. Laura, will stick around Port Charles this time. Lance Armstrong agrees to Oprah Q&A . Speculation about Francis returning to GH fired up as soon as she left Y&R in November, where she played Genevieve Atkinson since May of 2011. ""Everywhere I was being asked!"" Francis tells EW. Turns out executive producer Frank Valentini was definitely interested in staging a comeback for Francis, who worked on ""GH"" from 1976 to 2008, but they made the decision to wait for the right time. ""I don't know what the story is,"" she says. ""I have no idea, but Frank is very persuasive, energetic, infectious and has a sense of fun, a positive-ness that makes you want to work for the guy.

"(CNN) -- When you get bored, your eyes wander. So when a blossoming blowout between the University of Alabama and some other team in Monday night's college football championship floated into yawnfest territory, the electronic eyes of ESPN naturally went wandering -- settling on a brunette bombshell who just happens to be the girlfriend of Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron. ""Now when you are a quarterback at Alabama, you see that lovely lady there, she does go to Auburn, I want to admit that, but she's also Miss Alabama and that's AJ McCarron's girlfriend, OK,"" ESPN broadcaster Brent Musburger said Monday night as the camera focused on Katherine Webb in the stands. ""Wow, I'm telling you, quarterbacks -- you get all the good-looking women. What a beautiful woman,"" he gushed. ""Wow!"" ESPN: Brent went too far . As the chasm grew between Alabama and the other team -- the name will surely come back to us soon -- ESPN kept going back to the well, repeatedly showing Webb cheering in the crowd, wearing her boyfriend's No. 10 jersey. Finally, Yahoo! Sports columnist Jess Passan jokingly tweeted, ""Sources: A.J. McCarron's girlfriend to seek restraining order from Brent Musburger at halftime."" Is Alabama college football's new dynasty? The attention prompted thousands of football fans to check out of the game and check up on McCarron's flame, turning ""Katherine Webb"" into Google's second-hottest search -- behind only McCarron himself. All the attention made her a hotter property on Twitter, as well. She went from a scant 526 followers December 26 to more than 148,000 Tuesday, according to the stats site TwitterCounter.com, outscoring her gridiron boyfriend's 91,000 fans on the social networking service. In her first Tweet after the game, Webb didn't mention what had happened. ""So extremely blessed... @10AJMcCarron. Congrats to Alabama and making history! #BCSChamps"" is all she said in that message, posted at 11:07 p.m. Musburger's fawning attention prompted a spate of criticism of the 73-year-old broadcaster, with some posters to Twitter calling his comments ""creepy."" The episode even spawned the creation of a parody Twitter account, ""Horny Musburger."" CNN was not able to reach Musburger for comment through ESPN, but the network responded, saying: ""We always try to capture interesting storylines and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss Alabama and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test. However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far and Brent understands that."" Far from being creeped out, Webb said Tuesday that she was ""flattered"" by the broadcaster's comments, entertainment website TMZ reported. ""I've been reading on Twitter that Musburger had backlash that he's 'creepy',"" TMZ quoted Webb as saying. ""If I were to see him I would say, 'I don't think you're creepy at all!' "" One of McCarron's teammates, center Barrett Jones, joked Tuesday in an appearance on CNN's ""Starting Point"" that he was jealous of Webb's sudden fame. ""Where's the love for the actual players?"" he joked. ""She is certainly very pretty. But I just think Brent needs to share the love a little bit, that's all I'm saying."" Webb is the second rather attractive member of a football audience that Musburger and network cameras have helped push into the limelight. Back in 2005, when ABC cameras panned across a trio of scantily clad football fans during a Florida State football game, Musburger opined that ""1,500 red-blooded Americans just decided to apply"" to the school. One of those fans, Jenn Sterger, went on to a 15-minutes-of-fame career with appearances in Maxim and Playboy and a job as the stadium host for New York Jets football games. Later, quarterback Brett Favre got in trouble for sending her lurid messages while he was a player on the Jets. For the record, Webb was Miss Alabama USA 2012 and is a 2011 graduate of Auburn University with a degree in business management and administration, according to her Miss Universe biography. Oh, by the way, almost forgot ... it was Notre Dame on the business end of that 42-14 drubbing Alabama put on.","NEW: Network says the announcer went ""too far"" in his comments .

"Berlin (CNN) -- A string of arson attacks has hit the German capital, with vandals burning dozens of cars this week, including an additional 11 overnight, authorities said Friday. At least 50 cars have been torched since Monday, authorities said. Authorities described 30 crimes are ""politically motivated,"" with police spokesman Guido Busch saying Friday that the motive has changed during the week. ""While the first attacks were concentrated on the district of Charlottenburg, more and more copycats are now trying to imitate the arson attacks in various other parts of the city,"" Busch said. The vandalism has heightened fears in normally quiet, gentrified districts of Berlin. ""In my opinion, it is vandalism, and we must hope that the offenders don't cross the line to terrorism,"" Dieter Wiefelsputz, a home affairs expert for the German Social Democratic Party, said Thursday. German police say they still have no clear idea who the perpetrators are. They are offering a 5,000-euro reward, just over $7,000, for any leads that might result in arrests. A government official said the attacks are unprecedented. ""Right now, we have reached a new peak of arson attacks in Berlin,"" said Ehrhart Koerting, the senator for domestic affairs who's responsible for Berlin's police force. 'I don't know what's going through the heads of the people doing this,"" he said. The founder of a website called ""burning cars in Berlin"" believes that class envy is the reason for the attacks. The website, which is run by the CEO of a travel company, documents incidents across the city. ""The burning mostly occurs in districts like Kreuzberg, Berlin Mitte or Friedrichshain. Its inhabitants don't like their rich neighbors, so they set their cars on fire,"" said Uwe Frers, who runs the website. Berlin neighborhoods have been transformed in recent years as wealthy people move into areas that used to have high unemployment, and low housing and living costs. But German sociologist Klaus Hurrelmann says the motivation for the attacks has changed over time. The attacks now are dominated by ""youngsters who are searching for the London kick,"" he said. ""Setting cars on fire is cheap and easy,"" said Hurrelmann, a professor at the University of Bielefeld. The vandalism has found its way into modern culture. In his song ""Cars are burning,"" Frankfurt-based rapper Real Jay asks: ""What are you going to do, when the cars are set on fire?"" At least 135 cars have been torched this year, compared with 54 in 2010, authorities said. ""Right now there are about 100 extra police officers out on the streets of Berlin each night to arrest the attacker or attackers,"" police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said. Despite the large police presence, Busch said it will be hard to contain the crimes. ""Even if we would have 1,000 extra police staff out on the streets, we couldn't stop the offenders from burning cars. Berlin is just too large,"" Busch said.","NEW: At least 50 cars have been torched since Monday, police say .

"(CNN) -- A former Massachusetts state chemist accused of misconduct in thousands of criminal cases was arraigned in two different courts Wednesday on additional charges relating to her alleged false claims about holding a master's degree in chemistry. In the morning, Annie Dookhan, 34, of Franklin, Massachusetts, pleaded not guilty to three counts of obstruction of justice in Middlesex Superior Court in Woburn, Massachusetts. Her next court date there is February 8 for a pre-trial conference. In the afternoon, she again pleaded not guilty to two counts of obstruction of justice in Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham, Massachusetts. She was released on her personal recognizance and is scheduled for another pre-trial conference there in February. Read more: Chemist in Massachusetts drug sample case lied about degree . In December, Dookhan was indicted in Suffolk County in Boston on charges relating to alleged mishandling of evidence and obstruction. Massachusetts authorities are reviewing the sentences of 1,140 people who are in prison after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan. She is facing charges in several counties in Massachusetts because she had previously testified in various trials in her former official capacity as a chemist. In October, police arrested the former chemist on accusations that she had lied about drug evidence she handled while working at a state police lab and pretended to hold a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. She allegedly ""lied about the integrity of drug evidence that she analyzed,"" the attorney general said in a statement last year. The former chemist has admitted to wrongdoing during her nine-year employment with the Department of Public Health. Read more: Chemist pleads not guilty to lying about evidence as review of cases goes on . A preliminary investigation looked into every case Dookhan may have touched from 2003 until she left last March, and it is possible she touched 60,000 samples that were involved in 34,000 drug cases. ""There will be designated court sessions in each county to hear the cases,"" Chief Justice Robert Mulligan said last October in a statement. ""The Trial Court is fully cooperating with the prosecutors and defense counsel who are responding to these issues."" State police were tipped off last July by Dookhan's co-workers at the William A. Hinton State Laboratory in Jamaica Plain who alleged her work might be unreliable. At the time, state police were taking over what had previously been a Department of Public Health drug laboratory, which certified random drug tests for the police departments in Norfolk, Suffolk, Middlesex and Bristol Counties, as well as for Cape Cod and the nearby islands. During the takeover, authorities learned from employees how they were afraid to verify the work of Dookhan, said a spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security. Dookhan worked as a chemist in the Hinton State Lab's drug analysis unit -- which tested drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies across the state -- from 2003 until last March, when she resigned, according to a statement last month by Massachusetts attorney general's office. She was promoted from chemist I to chemist II in 2005. Her work was ""consistently the highest in the lab among her co-workers"" until June 2011, when an evidence officer discovered that 90 samples of drugs had been improperly ""scanned out of the drug safe"" and that Dookhan's name appeared on the control card as the primary chemist, the attorney general's office said. ""The next day, when Dookhan was confronted with the log book, the initials of Gloria Philips had suddenly appeared in the book,"" the attorney general's statement said. Phillips was an evidence officer, according to the statement. Dookhan denied writing the initials at first, but she ""later confessed to investigators"" that she forged them ""to cover up her misconduct,"" the statement said. Last July, Massachusetts State Police investigators interviewed lab employees. On August 28, Dookhan ""admitted to 'dry labbing' some of the samples,"" the statement said. ""Dry labbing"" is the practice of merely visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test, the attorney general said. ""It was discovered that Dookhan would assemble multiple drug samples from different cases that appeared to be the same substance. She would then perform the chemical tests on a few of the samples to verify that the samples were in fact the drug she believed they were, and if those were positive, would assume all the samples were positive without performing the necessary chemical tests,"" the attorney general said. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick ordered the lab to be shut down on August 30.","Former chemist, 34, faces new charges about alleged lying about master's degree .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday is the 100th anniversary of Richard Nixon's birth. He remains a controversial figure, and not just on the political left. Last year, I was covering the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when I came across a stall selling old political pins. Unable to resist, I bought one with a picture of Tricky Dick giving his best crocodile smile beneath the classic slogan ""Nixon's The One!"" I slipped it on at a party later that evening and was surprised by the results. None of the young conservative activists had a nice word to say about Nixon and many were quite hostile. To them, he was the archetypal Republican in Name Only -- a liberal in conservative clothing. While most Americans probably remember him only for Watergate or Vietnam -- and many liberals still revile him as a war-bating, divisive anti-communist -- from a conservative perspective his politics were disappointingly moderate. He's a reminder of an older, more centrist kind of Republican, the kind you don't see very much these days. It feels today like the Republican Party is fighting a series of rear guard actions -- on the fiscal cliff, on guns and on Obama's nominations. That's partly a reflection of political reality; they lost the presidential election and only control the House. But a common theme running through each of these battles is ""inflexibility."" They seem unwilling to yield either to President Obama's post-election authority or to the popular mood. Of course, principle is an admirable quality. But it won't necessarily win the White House in 2016. A lesson in the benefits of adapting to circumstances might be taken from the life of Richard Nixon. In domestic policy, Nixon bowed to the liberal consensus of his era. He supported the Equal Rights Amendment, founded the Environmental Protection Agency and was a proponent of the poverty-fighting measure of guaranteed income. He also established the first federal affirmative action program - the Philadelphia Plan, which required government contractors in Philadelphia to hire minority construction workers. As was so often the case with Nixon's public compassion, this served a private purpose of outflanking his opponents. His environmentalism was designed to deny the issue to liberals; his support of affirmative action divided them. The Philadelphia Plan was opposed by many Democrats, not just by Southern conservatives but also by labor leaders who saw it as a challenge to seniority programs. It set unions and civil rights activists against each other, while the president grabbed a little credit for being progressive. Even on foreign policy, the record is a complex mix of hawk and dove. Nixon said he wanted ""peace with honor"" in Vietnam, which meant concluding the conflict in such a way that didn't undermine American military or political credibility. This translated into a perverse policy of extending the war to end it -- bombing Cambodia to a point of social anarchy that would lead, inexorably, to the genocide of the Khmer Rouge. Opinion: GOP's obstructionism is suicide strategy . But Nixon won re-election in 1972 partly on a reputation as a peacemaker with whom the Democrats could not compete. His visit to China began the slow process of integrating the Forbidden Kingdom into the rest of the world, and it put pressure on the Soviets to go further on detente. In 1973, the administration helped Israel resist an Arab invasion by (belatedly) supplying arms. When that war was concluded, Nixon was widely regarded as having saved the world from a superpower confrontation in the Middle East and he was greeted by enthusiastic crowds in Egypt. But, by that point, his reputation at home had been so scarred by his involvement in the Watergate break-in that he couldn't capitalize on his image as a global problem solver. Nixon was his own worst enemy. Beyond his foxing of opponents, Nixon was not without a personal manifesto. He was saving his more conservative policies for after his re-election. Had Watergate not reduced his political capital so early in 1973, there's a chance Nixon would have pushed ahead with his agenda of a New Federalism and undone much of the liberalism of his first term. The New Federalism was similar to what would later become Reaganism: tax cuts, more power to the states, welfare reform. Nixon, then, was a mix of ideals and prejudices, but all tempered by a respect for the possibilities and limitations of power. Aside from Watergate, that's why he's so unpopular with the contemporary conservative movement. While it's true that the Republican Party continues to nominate moderates (from George H.W. Bush to Mitt Romney), in recent decades they've been expected to pass a test of ideological purity put to them by a restive base that invariably shifts the candidates' platform to the right. Nixon also did his best to court conservatives, but his instinct was always to anchor himself in the rhetorical center. As president, his ambition to build a permanent New Majority depended upon walking a line between the radicalism of the left and the racialism of the far right. His strategy wasn't built entirely upon pursuing Southern racists, as many liberal critics have suggested. Had it been so, he wouldn't have been re-elected in 1972 by winning every single state but Massachusetts. The fact is that Nixon was often very popular with a lot of regular Americans. In 1968, he even took 36% of the black vote, a much stronger performance than Mitt Romney's paltry 6%. Today, it's difficult to talk about Nixon as a model for contemporary Republicans because his political reputation is so tarnished. But he does offer an interesting alternative electoral strategy to that pursued by the contemporary right and embodied by the mythically consistent Ronald Reagan (the Gipper was more moderate than his fans admit). And the test of how well Nixon's pragmatism worked is measured in his electoral victories. Despite his two memorable defeats in 1960 and 1962 (""You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore""), he won election as a House representative, a senator, a vice president and a president. Considering that record, moderate Republicans in pursuit of the White House have every cause to get misty-eyed when they hear the name Richard Nixon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: Wednesday is 100th anniversary of Richard Nixon's birth .

"Washington (CNN) -- Black ice -- road ice virtually invisible to drivers -- played a ""significant role"" in last month's fatal bus crash in Oregon, an attorney for the bus company said Wednesday night. Attorney Mark Scheer also said bus driver Haeng Kyu Hwang had had 7 Â½ hours of sleep the night before the crash, suggesting that fatigue was not a factor, and said there is ""no indication"" that drugs and alcohol were involved. On Tuesday, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration barred Mi Joo Tour & Travel Ltd., a Canadian company, from operating in the United States, saying in an order that Hwang had worked 92 hours in the seven days leading up to the crash, far exceeding the 70 hours allowed. It also said that the bus company had not conducted required post-accident alcohol and drug tests on the driver. An agency spokesman Wednesday night declined to comment on the black ice claim or on the driver's sleep history, citing the ongoing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. The deadly accident occurred December 30 as the large motor coach was returning to Vancouver, British Columbia, from Las Vegas. The bus skidded on Interstate 84 near Pendleton, Oregon, crashed through a guardrail and tumbled down a steep embankment. Nine passengers were killed and 39 people were injured, including the driver. ""I can say conclusively that black ice was involved from all reports we have of the accident,"" Scheer told reporters. There were other accidents involving black ice near the crash site, he said. Scheer said Hwang was properly licensed, had previously worked as a school bus and truck driver and had extensive experience driving in the West. Hwang had slept 7 1/2 hours the night before the crash and had been on the road only 2 1/2 hours that day, including a rest stop, he said. He declined to comment on the claim that Hwang had violated work hour rules that week, saying he was not familiar with the driver's itinerary. In its 10-page order Tuesday, the motor carrier administration said Mi Joo Tour & Travel poses an ""imminent hazard to public safety"" because of its failure to ensure that its drivers are properly rested. ""Mi Joo does not monitor its drivers' hours of service to ensure that its drivers do not violate"" work-hour restrictions, it said. Further, Mi Joo does not require its drivers to maintain driver logs, as required by law, it said. The NTSB and the Oregon State Police are investigating the accident. FMCSA also is conducting a compliance review of the company, which caters to Korean tourists. In 2010, the FMCSA cited Mi Joo for 11 violations and gave the company a ""conditional"" rating, meaning it was in jeopardy of losing its ability to operate in the United States. In 2011, the agency cited Mi Joo for eight violations and gave it a ""satisfactory"" rating.","""Black ice was involved"" in Oregon crash that killed 9, hurt 39, attorney says .

"(CNN) -- Despite periodic violence and continued unresolved issues, Sudan's president on Sunday authorized the reopening of all border crossings with South Sudan, state news reported. President Omar al-Bashir ordered the reopening of all passages -- by land, water and air -- between his African nation and its newly independent neighbor South Sudan, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported. The president met Sunday with Foreign Minister Ali Ahmad Karti and Mutrif Sadiq, Sudan's recently appointed ambassador to South Sudan, to ask his help in carrying out the directives and make normalizing relations between the two countries a priority. Sadiq said after the meeting that he had been instructed by the president ""to work together with the concerned authorities"" to reopen the borders, SUNA reported. Sudan was embroiled in a bloody two-decade civil war that ended with a peace agreement in 2005. A referendum six years later led to South Sudan's secession, which became official in July 2011. The two nations, however, have remained at odds since then on a number of hot-button issues. Their leaders have faced international pressure, from the likes of the United Nations and the African Union, to resolve their disputes and come to a lasting agreement. They made some headway toward that end late last month -- though the deal they reached failed to address a number of disputes. Sudan, South Sudan reach partial agreement . During talks in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, al-Bashir and South Sudan's President Salva Kiir agreed to resume oil exports and set up a demilitarized zone, as well as principles related to border demarcation. Yet they could not reach a deal on the status of Abyei, a disputed region claimed by both countries, which has been a contentious issue since the South declared independence on July 9 of last year. The partial agreement was applauded by, among others, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. President Barack Obama. Photos: South Sudan's gun culture . Sudan and South Sudan have been under increasing pressure from the African Union and Security Council to resolve the matter peacefully. In April, Sudan and South Sudan slipped close to all-out war with a series of tit-for-tat air raids and ground attacks that prompted the African Union and Security Council to push the two sides to act. Still, the recent political progress has not stopped violence in the region. Peacekeepers die in Darfur attack . Last week, four peacekeepers with the African Union-United Nations Mission in Sudan's Darfur region were killed and eight injured in an ambush by unidentified attackers. UNAMID Force Commander and officer-in-charge Lt. Gen. Patrick Nyamvumba condemned what he called a ""criminal attack,"" demanding Sudan's government ""bring the perpetrators to justice.""
