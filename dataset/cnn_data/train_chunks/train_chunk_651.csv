An Indiana college freshman has died at a booze-fueled house party after she tumbled down a flight of stairs and suffered a severe head injury - and her friends didn't call an ambulance for seven hours because they thought she was sleeping. Police at Indiana University in Bloomington say that Rachael Fiege, 19, fell down the basement stairs at an off-campus house and passed out sometime between 1 and 2am on Friday. Her fellow students helped her up, but did not call an ambulance until nearly 8am - seven hours later, because they didn't realize she was badly injured and thought she had just passed out, police say. Miss Fiege's tragic death came just two days after she arrived at Indiana University and before she had a chance to even attend her first class. Tragic: Rachael Fiege, 19, likely moved to campus on Wednesday and was set to start class today. She was taken off life support Friday afternoon after sustaining a head injury early that morning . Off-campus: This is the house, just a block from the edge of the Indiana University campus, where Miss Fiege fell down a flight of basement stairs and died . The campus newspaper, the Indiana Daily Student, reports that her parents took her off life support Friday afternoon after doctors advised them that she was brain dead. She would have started classes today. Miss Fiege, who hoped to be a nurse, likely moved on campus on Wednesday - the day that the dormitories opened to new students. Thursday night, she attended a boozy party at a house just one block from the edge of campus. Police say they have not confirmed whether Miss Fiege was drinking at that party. The coroner's office is awaiting toxicology reports to determine whether she had alcohol in her system. After she tumbled down the stairs in the basement of the home, students helped her up and had her lay down in a different part of the house about 2am. Terrible choice: Miss Fiege was taken off life support by her parents, pictured, after a doctor told them that she was brain dead and would not recover from her injuries . Close friends: Miss Fiege's high school soccer teammates traveled to Bloomington for a chance to say goodbye to their friend before she was removed from life support . 'The thought initially was probably that the injury was not as serious as it was,' IU Police Chief Laury Flint told the Daily Student. It was not until 7.45am that Miss Fiege's fellow students realized she would not wake up and called authorities. No one has been charged in connection with the young student's death. Miss Fiege was a high school soccer star in her hometown of Zionsville, Indiana, about an hour and a half north of Bloomington. Her high school teammates traveled from Zionsville and their own colleges across the country on Friday to spend the final few moments with Miss Fiege before doctors removed her from life support. Her mother Angi Fiege, who is a nurse, learned of her daughter's injury just as she was getting off work at a hospital in Indianapolis. 'It was a nightmare to live on the other side of that. You can never feel the pain of being the parent of a child dying,' she told the Daily Student.","Rachael Fiege was due to start class at Indiana University today; she moved to campus on Wednesday .

As speculation over his alleged drug abuse continues to intensify, it has been reported that Khloe Kardashian has 'separated' from husband Lamar Odom. US website TMZ has claimed that the couple are living apart and have effectively 'split' after the reality star threw her husband out of the house. In the wake of the reports, Khloe has vented on Twitter, saying: 'Really hard to sit here and listen to . people talk s*** about my family! F*** you and shame on you! I'm too . protective for this s***!' Separated? Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom have reportedly 'split' after she allegedly threw him out of the house last Wednesday . At her breaking point: Khloe finally tweeted her frustration with people talking 's**t' about her current marital situation . While it's believed that neither of them have actually contacted a divorce lawyer, they are now allegedly 'separated', according to the website. TMZ claims that people close to the NBA star have been unable to find or contact him for the last 72 hours, although a representative for the star has denied this. The couple have been subject to persistent rumours that their marriage is in trouble after Lamar, 33, allegedly cheated on Khloe, 29, with two different women. But several sources have told TMZ the real reason behind their marriage crisis is that Khloe reportedly believes that her husband has a drug problem. 'Missing': People close to Lamar Odom have allegedly been unable to find or contact him for the last 72 hours . Representatives for Lamar did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment. Earlier this week the Kardashian family allegedly staged an intervention to convince Lamar to return to rehab, but he refused, reports the gossip website. Khloe urged Lamar in August 2012 to go to rehab and after he entered a San Diego facility she hired private investigators to make sure he didn't leave. Lamar reportedly constantly threatened to leave the rehab clinic and Khloe visited several times to convince him to stay, but he left after three weeks, sources said.

A spokesperson for the basketball star told TMZ on Sunday afternoon that he was fine but would not reveal his whereabouts. Lamar, who won two championships with the Los Angeles Lakers, stayed clean and played well last season for the Los Angeles Clippers, but sources said he resumed using drugs after the season. Khloe was convinced of recent reports of Lamar's infidelity, but feels his drug abuse has been the main problem, the website reported. Neither Khloe nor Lamar has contacted a divorce lawyer. Heartfelt: Lamar posted a tweet last month supporting Khloe as claims of his infidelity surfaced . 'Khloe is more concerned about saving Lamar than ending her marriage,' a source told TMZ. Khloe allegedly tossed Lamar out of the house after the failed intervention, and he was pictured Wednesday as an associated loaded a number of large suitcases into his car in Calabasas, California. Khloe and Lamar got married in 2009 about a month after meeting each other. Khloe has recently endured reports that Lamar had an affair with Jennifer Richardson for a year until March 2013 and a six-week fling with lawyer Polina Polonsky at the start of the summer.

Palestinian negotiators called off a planned round of peace talks today after Israeli soldiers killed three protesters during clashes following an arrest raid in the West Bank, officials said. The violence, the deadliest incident in the area in years, dealt a new blow to U.S-led peace efforts, which resumed late last month after a nearly five-year break. Palestinian officials have accused the Israelis of stonewalling and using the process as a cover to build new Jewish settlements. Scroll down for video . Palestinians carry the body of Jihad Aslan during his funeral at Qalandiya Refugee Camp near the West Bank city of Ramallah. His death, and that of two others, has derailed peace talks . It was not known when talks will resume, but Palestinian officials said that they could begin again as early as Tuesday. They spoke anonymously as they were not authorised to talk to media. Monday's clashes broke out when Israeli forces entered the Qalandia refugee camp, just outside of Jerusalem, on an overnight arrest raid. Shai Hakimi, a spokesman for the paramilitary border police, said hundreds of Palestinians poured into the streets and hurled firebombs, concrete blocks and rocks at officers. The Israeli military said soldiers rushed to the scene to provide backup and opened fire after they felt their lives were in 'imminent danger'. Flare up: A Palestinian protester gets ready to throw a Molotov cocktail during small clashes with Israeli forces following the funerals of Robin Zayed, Younis Jahjouh and Jihad Aslan today . An official at a Ramallah hospital confirmed three deaths and more than a dozen wounded. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Hatim Khatib, whose brother Youssef was arrested in the raid, told The Associated Press that undercover troops dressed in civilian clothes arrived at their home at 4:30 a.m. looking for the brother. 'After half an hour we started hearing shooting from the soldiers inside our house, and then people started throwing stones at them,' he said. Youssef was arrested after he returned from morning prayers at 7am, he said. Israeli soldiers fire tear gas towards Palestinian demonstrators during clashes last week . He said he didn't know why his brother was the only one arrested but said Youssef had spent time in Israeli jail for throwing rocks and was released three years ago. The Israeli military would not say why he was wanted. The violence drew fierce Palestinian condemnations. 'Such a crime proves the need for an urgent and effective international protection for our people,' Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah said in a statement. Shortly afterward, Palestinian officials said that a planned round of peace talks had been called off. They said the Palestinians were protesting the day's violence, and were also upset by an Israeli announcement Sunday that it was pushing forward with new settlement construction in east Jerusalem. The Palestinians object to construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, the lands they claim along with the Gaza Strip for their future state. Israel captured all three territories in 1967. It was not immediately known when talks would resume. A Palestinian official said the talks have gotten off to a rocky start, with the sides still arguing over the agenda. The Palestinians want discussions to focus on security issues and the border between Israel and a future state of Palestine. The official said the Israelis have insisted on limiting talks only to security matters. He spoke on condition of anonymity because both sides have promised U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to keep the details of the negotiations secret. Israeli officials declined to comment. Kerry is expected to meet Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Rome on September 8 to help push negotiations forward, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials.","U.S-led peace talks falter after the deaths of three men in Israeli raid .

Bullied every day: The family of Joel Morales, 12, who hanged himself after years of abuse from classmates, are suing the four bullies . The devastated family of a boy who hanged himself are suing the schoolboys that allegedly bullied him. Joel Morales, 12, committed suicide after a two-year barrage of bullying because of his small stature, according to his family. Now the boy’s family from East Harlem, New York have filed a law suit against the city, the Board of Education and four youths. His mother, Lisbeth Babilonia, said the bullies hassled Joel every day, throwing pencils and taunting him. In the suit, Joel was described as ‘a small-framed, fragile boy who sometimes stuttered and had problems with fine motor skills. He was extremely short and underweight for his age’. He also suffered from unspecified anxiety disorders according to the Daily News. The allegedly bullies were named as Kenneth, Stephen, Omar and Elijah ‘Doe’ and their parents were named as defendants. The schoolboy was ‘the target of ongoing severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment’ by his peers at Public School 102 in East Harlem, according to the suit. Ms Babilonia complained to the Board of Education several times and eventually the school set up a meeting with the perpetrators’ parents. After the meeting, the boys allegedly went to the apartment block where Joel lived and threw pipes and sticks at him. Ms Babilonia’s lawyer Tedd Kessler said of the meeting: ‘It didn’t alleviate the situation at all.’ Joel was transferred to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school. The boy was found dead in his family’s apartment on May 31 last year. Ms Babilonia was left bewildered by his . actions. She said: ‘Every morning he always said “I love you mum. Give . me a hug and a kiss.”’ At the time of Joel’s death, it was . revealed that his father had committed suicide some 13 years ago when he . jumped off a rooftop in New York's Bronx borough. A 'beautiful boy': Joel suffered physical and emotional abuse, and while his mother complained to the Board of Education it did little to alleviate the situation . Neighbours told how Ms Babilonia let out a 'blood-curdling scream' as she cut down her son's body with a knife before plunging the blade into herself. Neighbour Inez Rodriguez, 41, said that he knocked the knife out of Ms Babilonia’s hand as she tried to harm herself. He also tried to give Joel CPR. Relatives said the boy was teased for being short and brainy but the final tipping point were taunts about his dead father. Joel was 4-months-old when his father died. Richard Salazar, 25, Babilonia's other son said to the New York Post last year: 'She’s going through the same thing she went through then.' The boy's aunt Angelica Babilonia, 23, said he told a friend just hours before taking his life: 'I’m tired of all this bullying.' In .

Tempers flared after a controversial pit stop helped Will Power win an IndyCar race Sunday over Scott Dixon. With Dixon and Power running a close race, both men hit pit row for a final stop before a sprint to the finish at Sonoma Raceway in California. Dixon was ahead in the race, but directly behind Power in the pits. Pulling out, Dixon’s car clipped one of Power’s pit crew, causing him to incur a penalty and lose the race. Dixon was irate after the race, saying that Power’s crew got in the way on purpose – and he may have a point. Fuming: Scott Dixon's car [9] hit a member of Will Power's crew while leaving a pit stop . Footage of the pit stop shows a member of Power’s crew slowly walking towards Dixon’s car while holding a tire at his side. As Dixon begins pulling away, the crew member doesn’t even lift his head. Dixon’s car strikes the tire, sending it one way and the crew member another, causing him to be penalized and setting Power up for the win. A second Power crew member also hit the ground during the incident. The analysts covering the race for NBC Sports Network could be heard questioning the crew member’s actions shortly after the incident. ‘It’s tough to put that on Scott [Dixon], you would expect the crew member to do everything he can to get out of the way,’ said one analyst, adding ‘look at him walk there with the tire in his hand.’ Without a care in the world: The crew member appears to not even be looking for Scott Dixon's car as he walks back through pit row, perhaps even holding the tire out so Dixon might hit it as he leaves . Moment of impact: The tire first buckled in before going airborne after being hit by Dixon's car . ‘It didn’t even look like he was looking,’ said a second announcer, adding that the guy was likely thinking that he would make Dixon go around him. ‘I would certainly not place any blame on Scott Dixon for that,’ another analyst concurred.After the race, Dixon was livid. ‘That's probably the most blatant thing I've seen in a long time,’ Dixon said. ‘You watch most pit guys, they try to get out of the way of other people, so that was a bit of a (classless) move, to be honest. … If that's the way they want to try and win, that's pretty bad.’ The analysts covering the race for NBC Sports Network could also be heard questioning the crew member’s actions shortly after the incident. ‘It’s tough to put that on Scott . [Dixon], you would expect the crew member to do everything he can to get . out of the way,’ said one analyst, adding ‘look at him walk there with . the tire in his hand.’ Hit the deck: Two crew members were sent into the pavement after Dixon's car struck the tire . Out of sight, out of mind: Dixon pulled away thinking he had the race won . ‘It’s tough to put that on Scott [Dixon], you would expect the crew member to do everything he can to get out of the way,’ said one analyst, adding ‘look at him walk there with the tire in his hand.’ ‘It didn’t even look like he was looking,’ said a second announcer, adding that the guy was likely thinking that he would make Dixon go around him. ‘I would certainly not place any blame on Scott Dixon for that,’ another analyst concurred.Power defended his pit crew after the race. ‘I would be very surprised (if it was intentional). I haven't seen it. It's not even worth commenting on,’ said Dixon. A race official explained his decision, saying it was clearly Dixon’s fault. ‘With the No. 9 car [Dixon] leaving the pit lane, he clearly crosses right into the pit box into the No. 12 car [Power] space, and that's where the violation occurred,’ race director Beaux Barfield said. The penalty caused Dixon, who was in the lead, to be dropped 19 seconds behind Power – into 21st place – paving the way for Power’s victory. All crew members involved were able to finish the race.","Scott Dixon's car struck a member of Will Power's pit crew while pulling out of pit row .

A friend of the woman's family told the Irish Times: 'She doesn't want to make a big deal about it and I don't know if it's because she's embarrassed or just isn't bothered by it but I know she was very frightened by the whole thing.

'I can't even imagine what would have happened if the bus had gone the Corkscrew Hill route to Doolin. 'She would have been thrown all over the place and would definitely have been hurt.' The bus company, which runs services across the country, said that it is investigating how the woman came to be trapped. It is unable to confirm any other details until the probe is complete.","The middle-aged woman had travelled to Ballyvaughan from Galway .

An Arizona teenager whose body was found near to his abandoned SUV on a heavily-wooded hill in southern Oregon was 'a young man who had a broken heart', his devastated father has said. The body of Johnathan Croom, 18, was discovered on Monday evening about 1,000 feet from where his vehicle was found abandoned last week, Douglas County sheriff's spokesman Dwes Hutson said. It had been believed that Croom, from Apache Junction, had run away after telling friends he was interested in taking an 'Into the Wild' type of adventure. The sheriff's spokesman said that crews had searched the area for several days - calling his name and making noise - but had been looking for a live person. But when they discovered text messages indicating Croom planned to kill himself, they brought in cadaver dogs and the boy's body was found within hours. Loss: Jonathan Croom's body was found days after he vanished as he drove from Washington state to Arizona. His father has revealed the teenager was struggling with a break up . The discovery of the texts had changed the nature of the search, Hutson said. 'That . led us to believe that he was probably going to do this,' he said. 'In . these kind of cases, sometimes people leave very detailed notes and . instructions. Sometimes, you don't.' In . a telephone interview from Oregon, where the abandoned SUV was found, . David Croom said his son was grieving the end of a recent relationship . with 'someone back in Phoenix'. 'He was a young man who had a broken heart and headed out to try to find himself,' the elder Croom said. 'We're looking forward to finding out exactly what happened.' He said he had no specifics on a cause of death but he thanked everyone who helped search for his son, adding: 'Please pray for our family.' The teenager, who was due to start classes in Mesa, Arizona on August 17, had talked with his parents about the book 'Into the Wild' and told a friend he wanted to run away. Tragic: The 18-year-old was due to begin college classes in Mesa more than a week ago but failed to turn up . Missed: Johnathan (second left) with his father David (second right), who said the teenager had a broken heart when he went missing. They are also pictured with Jonathan's mother, Monica, right . Croom . left a friend's home in Seattle on August 16 and was driving home to . Arizona, but he failed to turn up to his first classes at Mesa Community . College. On Wednesday, his SUV was found in Riddle, just off Interstate 5. Inside the SUV were Jonathan's wallet, $200 in cash and a . book on outdoor survival tactics. Hutson said Croom had talked to his parents about Christopher McCandless, whose journey to Alaska was documented in the book 'Into the Wild'. McCandless . headed to the Alaskan wilderness with few provisions in a bid to live . simply and appreciate nature. He was found dead in August 1992, when he . was just 24. 'This was a kid who was obsessed with the . movie,' David Croom told KVAL.com before his son's body was discovered. 'My concern is he is up there with very limited resources, and no . experience. Copycat? Family had previously said Croom was obsessed with Into the Wild, a 2007 film starring Emile Hirsh, based on the true story of a graduate who travels across the U.S. with few provisions .

She added that his SUV didn't . break down, wasn't out of gas and was unlocked with money inside. Officers added that the vehicle had not been broken into. Search teams scoured the area for clues to his whereabouts but it wasn't until Monday that they came across the body. 'I think we have kind of a combination . there,' Hutson said. 'He talked with his parents about Into the Wild, . and in text messages we've looked at, he does specifically talk about . running away, kind of just running away from his life.' On his blog earlier this year, Croom described himself as someone looking for adventure. Sad: On his blog, Croom said he wanted to live an exciting life so he could teach others how to do so . 'I am definitely searching for my purpose in the world and writing about Life,' he wrote. 'I want to teach people to live . extraordinarily unusual, fun, exhilarating lives. In order to do so, I . need to be living the excitement myself.' But he added in a post written in May: 'I do recognize that I make very bad decisions, quite often. 'These . decisions lead to a lot of remorse and unhappiness. I know I should . just let these things go and push forward, as I'd recommend to anybody, . but it's hard. 'I am trying though.

Despite fending off bombs and bullets in the harsh environment of a Middle Eastern war zone, soldiers are complaining about one simple thing – sore feet. The US army are working to reinvent the humble army boot after soldiers complained about their footwear in a survey on conditions during operations. Engineers are now in the final stages of a two-year project to develop boots so troops can comfortably negotiate arid terrains such as in Afghanistan. Problems with boots, problems with everything: Soldiers have complained about sore feet caused by their boots during deployment in harsh environments such as Afghanistan and so the US army is working to develop a new, more comfortable boot . The US army must now choose between three American agencies which have come up with different versions of the improved military footwear after calling for submissions back in 2011. Bob Hall, a footwear project engineer . at the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center in . Massachusetts, said troops live and sleep in their boots. According to The Boston Globe he said: ‘If he’s having problems with his boots, he’s having problems with everything.’ Extreme conditions: Ben Cooper (left) and Bob Hall (right) have been working on developing boots with more ankle stability, traction and durability . Ben Cooper, also from the research centre, said: ‘Due to Afghanistan's unique climate and environment, they [troops] needed a boot that not only would provide them ankle stability and traction and durability, but they also needed greater breathability. ‘It's a balancing act. We were . constantly walking that fine line. I think that we have worked with . industry tirelessly on trying to make sure that we accomplish exactly . what the warfighter wants and needs.’ Hold up in harsh conditions: The standard army combat boots don't work as well in mountainous terrain, engineer Bob Hall said . The . new boots are set to be about 0.5lbs lighter than boots currently worn . by troops in Afghanistan and will be able to withstand hot summer . temperatures upward of 37 degrees Celsius. The three designs use different materials including leather, canvas, nylon and rubber to provide grip, protection and ventilation. Mr Hall said: ‘Because of the mountainous terrain, the standard combat boots don’t hold up as well.’ The different boots have been tested twice with over 200 soldiers donning the experimental footwear at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California under conditions similar to Afghanistan. Researchers will either pick one of the designs or choose specific characteristics from each boot to create a new and improved version. Each designer is using the same sole made by American shoe company Vibram USA. The unique sole has multidirectional lugs or spikes to give the shoes more grip while dislodging mud and debris as the soldier flexes the foot. One specialist design agency, Danner in Portland, Oregon, used nylon, canvas and leather in its design, while the other two, Bates Footwear of Rockford, Michigan, and Belleville Boot Co in Belleville Boots, Illinois, used more nylon for support. The Belleville design uses leather and high-density nylon which has better ventilation than leather as well as being more light weight and thinner, allowing for flexibility. In the Bates Footwear design, holes were added for more ventilation while the Danner boot covers ventilation holes with mesh to stop dirt getting into the boot. Bates Footwear said its shoe contracts with the US army were worth £9.67 million in 2012. Boots sell retail for £96 to £174.","The US Army surveyed soldiers about conditions during operations .

The Massachusetts teen whose rapist now wants custody of their child is now swinging back at both him and the state of Massachusetts, which she says has allowed him to continue to victimize her using the court system. The unnamed victim, 19, was 14-years-old at the time of the rape and says she is still trying to get away from him because a Bay State judge turned the case over to family court, allowing rapist Jamie Melendez, 24, to petition for visitation and other rights. 'That's what makes this case so barbaric,' said the victim's attorney Wendy Murphy. 'That's what makes this case so barbaric': The unnamed victim appeared in disguise alongside her attorney Wendy Murphy in a television interview in which she says she still being victimized by her rapist . Fatherly? An undated photo shows Jamie Melendez, who pleaded guilty to th 2009 statutory rape. He decided to sue for visitation rights only after he was ordered to pay child support . 'This case was ordered to be transferred to family court,' she told CNN, 'by a judge who found a man guilty of rape.' Melendez, then 20, pleaded guilty to a statutory rape that took place in the victim's own home in 2009 and led to her pregnancy. He was sentenced to 16 years probation. Melendez was later ordered to pay $110 a week in child support to her by the family court. But last year Melendez filed a petition in a family court to argue that he should have visitation rights if he is forced to pay child support to the girl. She is expected to now have to fight this in family court. 'He gets to then literally use the family court system to control his rape victim's life,' said Murphy. He offered to no longer request these rights if the child maintenance order was made void. His victim was a middle school student at the time of the attack but recently graduated from high school. Murphy criticised the original decision to force Melendez to pay child support as ‘outrageous’ and said it framed his behaviour as something ‘other than a serious crime’. She told ABC: ‘My client is very worried she'll have to send her daughter off to this man she doesn't know, and tell her she'll be going off on visits with the man who raped her mother and created her. ‘She wants nothing to do with this guy. She doesn't want a 16-year relationship with him.’ 'He gets to then literally use the family court system to control his rape victim's life,' said Murphy .

Jamie Melendez pleaded guilty to statutory rape and was sentenced to 16 years probation. After a judge turned the case over to family court, he became able to petition for visitation and other rights . The attorney added that the girl is concerned about . risking losing the custody of her child if she does not participate in . the family court proceedings. Melendez - who had known his victim for . three years before the attack - had gone to the girl’s house when he . knew her mother would not be home, and pressured her into having sex . with him. She had asked a state criminal court judge to order Melendez to pay criminal restitution instead of child support - and free her from any legal relationship or proceedings with him. But this was refused - and an application for review to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court also failed, as well as a further appeal. She is now suing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in Federal Court and wants an annulment of the court order, reported Courthouse News. Unrest: The victim is pictured her with her child.

But Nigella Lawson would appear to have turned a corner after filing for divorce from millionaire art dealer Charles Saatchi, 70, last month. With her head held high and the trace of a smile on her lips, the television cook, 53, looked happy and confident as she left a central London hairdresser’s on Saturday. Even the rain, which caused her to put her newly-done hair up in a chignon, couldn’t change her mood.

The same cannot be said of Mr Saatchi, who looked dishevelled after dining at Scott’s in Mayfair on Friday – the very restaurant where the ‘throttling’ scene took place only weeks before. He appeared exhausted as he sucked on a cigarette in the street, and later as he sat in the back of a taxi his head was bowed. In June Miss Lawson left the marital home following the very public assault, for which Mr Saatchi has accepted a police caution, and they have barely spoken to one another since. The couple were granted a decree nisi last month. Earlier this week Nigella finally broken her silence two months after the distressing pictures emerged. On Tuesday night, she returned to Twitter for the first time to share a photograph of a cake she'd made to mark the return of The Great British Bake Off.

Ms Lawson returned to her micro-blogging account yesterday, writing: 'Yum: settling down to The Great British Bake Off with a slice of this blackcurrant Victoria sponge #GBBO'. When one of her 430,000 followers asked whether she had baked the cake herself or bought it in a shop, she replied: 'I MADE IT - though it wouldn't get me far in the #GBBO!' Since the pictures of Mr Saatchi with his hand on Ms Lawson's neck were published by a Sunday newspaper in June this year, the chef has made no public comment. By contrast, the advertising mogul has repeatedly spoken out over the controversy - including an announcement that he was divorcing his wife of 10 years.","Nigella emerged with a smile from central London hairdressers .

Enjoyed by millions of consumers worldwide every day, many of our favourite food and drinks claim to be steeped in a tradition that saw generations before us savoring the same unmistakable tastes. Coca Cola claims to use the same secret recipe as it did when the fizzy drink was first created some 127 years ago and fast food chain KFC says it sticks to Colonel Harland Sanders' original 1940 method for frying chicken. But are the most famous brands in our cupboards really true to their roots? The Real Thing? Coca-Cola's 127-year-old recipe, which manufacturers claim is still used today, sits in this overstated secure vault at the World of Coca-Cola museum, in Atlanta . Secret: A security guard stands outside the Coke vault - a popular tourist attraction . Photo opportunity: The vault is bathed in swathes of colourful lasers as tourists flock to have their picture taken outside it . Arguably the most famous soft drinks brand in the world, Coca Cola says that its flagship drink uses the same secret formula as creator Dr John S Pemberton in 1886. It even goes as far as keeping the original formula in a high security vault at its Atlanta World of Coca-Cola museum - perhaps a sales gimmick argue some. But a 1994 book called Secret Formula claimed that there have been a variety of changes to the Coke recipe over the generations and even claimed that it once contained cocaine in trace amounts, derived in the coca plants used to make the product - a claim that Coca-Cola has since dismissed as untrue. Similarly, PepsiCo also celebrates the roots of its flagship drink Pepsi-Cola invented by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad's drink in 1893. But the drink was made sweeter in the 1930s when a new owner bought the firm and didn't like the taste and both Coca-Cola and Pepsi switched from sugar to high-fructose corn syrup in the 1980s. It was widely reported last year that both firms changed their U.S recipes to avoid having to put a cancer warning on the label. Steeped in tradition: Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi herald their long history . History: Pepsi's first home office and bottling plant is shown in this 1906 file photo in New Bern, North Carolina . But a Coca-Cola spokesman told MailOnline at the time that rather than altering the recipe, the firm was merely changing the way it makes one of its ingredients to reduce the amount of 4-MEI in the caramel. In fact when Coca-Cola tried to make the drink slightly sweeter in 1985 and relaunched it as 'New Coke' in the US there was a public outcry. Less than three months later the company announced it was reverting back to the original recipe. Its origins are also a big part of the way fast food chain KFC markets its fried chicken with inventor Colonel Sanders still featuring in cartoon form on the brand's signs. According to Yahoo News, the Colonel even dyed his beard white to achieve a more grandfatherly look in the early days. Origins: KFC still uses a picture of Colonel Sanders on its logo . Same taste: Even products which have been added to the KFC menu use the same seasoning recipe says the company . In a similar move to Coca-Cola, KFC also gave security surrounding the original formula an upgrade by installing a 770-pond safe to guard it. Although the recipe might still be the same as Colonel Sanders', the production method is said to have changed. The founder is said to have been unhappy with the way chicken was handled after new owners bought him out in 1964. His friend Dave Thomas, founder of the Wendy's chain, said that he was angry that the new owners drained grease off chicken by putting it on wire racks rather than spooning it off by hand. Old favourite: Twinkies has relaunched with a seemingly new recipe . But KFC say that the integral parts of the recipe - using fresh on the bone chicken, hand breading, frying under pressure and the recipe for the seasoning itself - remain exactly the same. Even new introductions to the chain's popular menu which include filleted chicken use the same seasoning, say the chain. When popular U.S snack Twinkies parent company ran into financial trouble in recent years the product was removed from the shelves. But the snack is back - albeit with a different recipe to that which millions of Americans enjoyed since its 1930 launch. Hostess, which makes the product, said that the primary three ingredients remain the same, but the product has a noticeably longer shelf life and more ingredients listed on the packaging. It remains to be seen whether sticking to the original recipe really is a winning formula or whether a change will do Twinkies good. Classic: Coca-Cola . The exact recipe of Coca-Cola has always been a mystery and today's official recipe is guarded 24-hours a day in a vault in Atlanta. The list of ingredients below are meant to be those used by pharmacist John Pemberton, who created the drink in 1886.","Coca-Cola claims to use the same 127-year-old recipe in its current drink .

One family, however, appears to have gone with a current affairs theme - dressing up their children as accused drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly. Dressed in the same outfits, their hair in the same styles, stood with suitcases and holding a sign that says: 'The Peru 2. Drugs is for mugs...' the two young girls look like miniature versions of the girls who await their trial in Peru. Caused a stir: The photo of two young children dressed as the accused drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly has gone viral online . The picture, which has been posted online, was taken at the weekend on the village green in Strangford, Co Down, Northern Ireland, about 20 miles south east of Belfast, reportedly during the village summer festival. In the background parents and children surround a bouncy castle and other games. According to a local resident, there is a fancy dress competition every year at the fete; it is not known if the children won or not, but there's no doubting the resemblance they have to Melissa Reid, from Lenzie near Glasgow, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, from Dungannon in Northern Ireland, who claim they were kidnapped and forced to unknowingly smuggle drugs from Peru to Spain. The resident, who preferred not to be named, said he was 'appalled' at seeing the picture of the two girls. He said: 'I'm absolutely appalled. I'm a parent and I have absolutely no idea whether the the drug mules in Peru are guilty or innocent. So to ride on the back of their notoriety like this is really sad.' The photo has received a flurry of comments on Twitter, with reactions ranging from incredulous to comical and also support for raising awareness of the accused girls' plight. Many find the stunt funny, posting messages including: 'OMG DYING LAUGHING...' 'Hilarious,' 'Hahahaha,' 'Made my day,' and 'Can't help but find this hilarious.' Another says: 'Bit of a change from the normal fete costume. But shows solidarity for Peru drug girls.' Others feel torn by the gesture; one person says: 'This isn't appropriate, but rather funny.' Another says: 'Can't decide if this is funny, or wrong... or both' While some take offense to the political stand. 'Unbelievable,' one Twitter user writes, 'Now I'll be making my kids do funny stuff in the future but this is insane and very very wrong,' says another. 'Why would you do that?!?' someone questions. Irish Michaella McCollum Connolly (L) and British Melissa Reid (R) were detained allegedly with 11 kilograms of cocaine on their way to Madrid, Spain, at the international airport Jorge Chavez in Callao, near Lima, Peru . Up until now Reid, from Glasgow, and . McCollum Connolly, from Northern Ireland - but not close to the village . fete - have insisted they are innocent. If found guilty, they could be . sentenced to 15 years in prison. However, if they plead guilty, they may get off with only six years and eight months. On Thursday the girls were moved to the Virgen de Fatima jail, which is surrounded by shanty towns just south of Lima. The only Western inmates, they will endure a military-style regime alongside 1,000 other female prisoners, including murderers and terrorists. Reid's father William Reid told the media last week he wants his daughter to plead guilty, work with authorities and tell them everything she knows. 'They were found to have drugs on them. They collected packages which transpired to be drugs. They are going to be guilty of that. 'If that’s the Peruvian law, regardless of the mitigating circumstances, then you are as well pleading guilty rather than defending that to the nth degree and be sitting there with 15 years that you’re trying to appeal and reduce. Cuffed: The pair could spend up to three years in jail in Peru as they await their trial . The father of Melissa Reid, right, has urged her to plead guilty to avoid up to 15 years in prison if found guilty in a trial. McCollum Connolly, left, and Reid claim they were abducted by gun-toting Colombian gangsters in Ibiza who threatened them and their families if they did not do as they were told . ‘These girls are young. They may be living in cloud cuckoo land and thinking that magically next week they’re going to go free. If you’re adamant that you’re innocent, you don’t believe that you’re even going to be given a sentence,' he said. The pair could spend up to three years in jail awaiting trial.

Burger King to offer French Fry Burger for just $1 to compete with McDonald's Dollar Menu . Burger King is focusing more on cheaper items after McDonald's aggressive push for its Dollar Menu, which brings in the most cash of all its offerings. The . burger, which clocks in at 360 calories and 19 grams of fat, is a . relatively novel offering, but doesn't require any extra investment from . Burger King; it's basically a standard beef patty topped with four of . the chain's french fries. The offering comes as fast-food chains jump through hoops to get customers through their doors, in large part by heavily promoting their cheapest eats. McDonald's has stepped up advertising for its Dollar Menu, which now features its Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger and a more substantial McDouble, which has two patties and a slice of cheese. That forced Burger King and Wendy's to adjust their tactics earlier this year to stress value more clearly as well. Burger King, for example, has offered any two sandwiches for $5 and a Junior Whopper for $1.29. Mighty Wings: McDonald's 'Might Wings,' pictured, will be added to the chain's chicken menu immediately . It's not clear whether the strategy will . pay off for the chains, or what impact it could have on wearing away at . profit margins over the long term. But in the latest quarter, Burger King said its sales at North American restaurants open at least a year slipped 0.5 per cent. Wendy's reported an anemic 0.4 per cent rise, while McDonald's reported a 1 per cent increase for U.S. restaurants. The metric is an important indicator of health because it strips out the impact of newly opened and closed locations. Other chains, by contrast, are faring better. Chipotle reported a 3.4 per cent increase and Starbucks said the figure rose 9 per cent.","The French Fry Burger clocks 360 calories and 19 grams of fat .

The Arlington, Virgina parking garage where 'Deep Throat' famously leaked information, which blew open the Watergate scandal to Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward is about to be demolished. Property group Monday Properties plans to tear down the two aging office buildings, at 1401 Wilson Blvd and 1400 Key Blvd in the Rosslyn neighborhood, that sit above the garage that played a pivotal role in ending Richard Nixon's presidency in 1974. The demolition will make way for a new mixed use development, with a 32-story apartment or condo building and a 29-story office building. Demolition: The Watergate 600, at the Watergate Complex, is set to be demolished to make way for a new development . Historic: A historical note marks parking spot D32 in a parking garage in the Rosslyn neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, where Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward met in secret with his source 'Deep Throat' But before any construction can take place the proposed redevelopment will go through Arlington's site plan process, which generally takes 1-4 years. Forty years ago, Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward met a source, dubbed by the newspaper's managing editor as 'Deep Throat' and later revealed to be FBI official Mark Felt, in the humble garage. The underground parking lot was chosen because Felt, who was nicknamed because he was on 'deep background,' considered it an 'anonymous secure location.' They met there six times between October 1972 and November 1973. The information Felt passed on to Woodward helped expose the Watergate scandal, which ultimately saw President Nixon become the first ever United States president to resign.

Out: President Nixon, pictured here after his resignation in 1974, was forced to step down after the Watergate scandal was revealed . Woodward and his colleague Carl . Bernstein wrote a book about the scandal two years later called All The . President's Men, which was later turned into a film starring Robert . Redford and Dustin Hoffman. A . permanent historical marker was erected outside the garage by Arlington . County to mark the location and the marker is expected to stay after . the garage is gone. 'We . obviously view the whole Watergate situation as a significant event in . the history of our country,' the company's chief development officer, . Tim Helmig, told Arlnow.com. 'It would be our hope that we preserve that plaque and incorporate it in our redevelopment.' He . added that the garage, which was built in the early 1960s, was nearing . the end of its useful life and said his company was open to ideas about . how to preserve some part of the garage's history. Secret location: A still from the 1976 film All the President's Men shows Robert Redford, laying Bob Woodward, meeting with his source in the garage . Watergate: Robert Redford, right, and Dustin Hoffman, left, played the two Washington Post reporters who blew open the Watergate scandal . 'That will likely come into the discussion as part of the (site plan) process,' he said. 'That's exactly what the process is designed for.' The marker will likely be removed and stored during the redevelopment. Some were upset that the historical place will be torn down. The garage is somewhat of a mecca for many working journalists, who believe it is the physical embodiment of how important investigative reporting can be. Local, Michelle Bloom, wrote on Twitter: 'We're always tearing down historic places... This is why we're not Europe.'

The Duchess of Cambridge is to undertake her first official public engagement since the birth of her baby on September 12, palace sources have confirmed. Kate, and her husband, Prince William, will be guests of honour at the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards, Mail Online can reveal. It will be the Duchess’s first royal job since Prince George was born on July 22, although she is still formally on maternity leave. Duty calls: Kate, pictured outside the Lindo Wing the day after she gave birth to Prince George on 22 July, will attend the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards on September 12 . Fashion watchers will no doubt be keeping a keen eye on Kate’s first post-baby outfit given her immensely stylish maternity wardrobe. She also earned worldwide plaudits for her appearance on the steps of the Lindo Wing the day after giving birth wearing a chic baby blue polka-dot dress by British designer Jenny Packham, showing off her still prominent baby bump. The event next month has been organised by Tusk Trust, a UK charity that funds African conservation projects of which William is patron. He is a passionate supporter of their work and has visited many of the charity’s projects in Africa – which accounts for the Duchess’s decision to leave baby George at home and join him.It is not clear yet who will be baby-sitting the new third in line to the throne, but it is most likely to fall to her mother, Carole Middleton. Hard at it: Prince William yesterday carried out his first solo public engagement since becoming a father when he handled a Harris Hawk, during a falconry display at the Anglesey Show, in Anglesey, North Wales . Kate went to live with her parents at their home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, for almost a month after George was born and friends say Carole has taken to being a grandmother for the first time with gusto. The Tusk Conservation Awards will honour the unsung heroes of wildlife conservation. The Duke and Duchess will meet the nominees at a private reception beforehand. A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed today that the Duchess would be attending. ‘It is a long standing engagements,’ they told MailOnline. William has also given his first interview since the birth of Prince George to CNN’s Royal Correspondent Max Foster, it was also confirmed today. In a documentary entitled Prince William’s Passion: New Father, New Hope the prince talks passionately about his conservation work and new baby George - particularly his hope that his son will continue that work. William is a patron of Tusk Trust and has long been involved in raising awareness surrounding issues of conservation. Here he feeds a 5-year-old black rhino called Zawadi as he visits Port Lympne Wild Animal Park . Some of Tusk Trust's work involves protecting rhinos which are killed, usually shot, by poachers who can sell their horns for the equivalent of several months' salary . The interview will be broadcast on CNN internationally and also on ITV in the UK on 15 September at 10pm, although excerpts will be released next week. The interview with the prince will be part of a one-hour special, chronicling the Prince’s passion for Africa and his dream to save the world’s most endangered species. As a new father, the Prince discusses his hope that one day his son can experience the same Africa that he and Prince Harry did as young boys. The brothers were visitors to Africa with their parents and continue to visit the continent regularly – indeed William proposed to his wife in Kenya, while Prince Harry has just concluded a working trip to Angola. William also reflects on becoming a new parent and how it has forever changed him. The Royal Family has worked on conservation in Africa for generations.  In Prince William’s Passion:  New Father, New Hope, William  discusses how he is continuing the tradition. His love of Africa and its endangered species were instilled in him by his father Prince Charles, and late mother Princess Diana. The Duke of Cambridge also highlights some of the incredible work done by individuals in the area of conservation, including Tusk.","Kate will be guest of honour at Tusk Conservation Awards on 12 September .

'Lee Daniels' The Butler' served up a second helping at the box office, topping the weekend with $17 million according to studio estimates Sunday. That was enough to lead all films on a late August weekend known as a dumping ground for studios following their summer blockbusters and before the start of the fall movie-going season. Daniels' historical drama about a long-serving White House butler, starring Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey, last weekend opened with $24.6million for the Weinstein Co. Three new releases failed to catch on. The teen fantasy 'Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,' adapted from the popular young adult book series, opened tepidly in third with $9.3million on the weekend and $14million since opening Wednesday. With franchise hopes, Sony Screen Gems has already started production on a sequel, again starring Lily Collins as a New York teenager who discovers she has mystical powers. Tops again!: Oprah Winfrey, left, and Forest Whitaker in a scene from 'Lee Daniels' The Butler. Edgar Wright's pub-crawl-gone-wrong comedy 'The World's End' opened with $8.9million for Focus Features. That was a better start for 'The World's End,' which stars Simon Pegg, than Wright's last film with the actor: 2007's 'Hot Fuzz.' It opened with $5.8million. Playing in 1,549 theaters, 'The World's End' did its business in less than half the theaters of 'The Butler' or 'Mortal Instruments.' Despite good reviews, Lionsgate's home-invasion horror flick 'You're Next' opened weakly with $7.1 million. With a cumulative total of $52.3million, 'The Butler' is headed for a domestic haul of $100million. It has followed the release pattern of another movie about race and domestic service: the 2011 drama 'The Help,' also released in August. The Weinstein Co. hopes that 'The Butler' will similarly lead to Oscar nominations. Paul Dergarabedian, analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com, attributed the success of 'The Butler' particularly to the marketing power of Winfrey and a savvy choice of a release date with little competition. King of the hill: The Butler has spent the past two weeks atop the box office . 'This is a film that you wouldn't want to open in June or July,' said Dergarabedian. 'The release date that the Weinstein Co. picked absolutely paid off for them.' In its third week of release, Warner Bros.' R-rated road trip comedy 'We're the Millers,' starring Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Aniston, continued to thrive. It took in $13.5million over the weekend, bringing its overall total to $91.7million. Woody Allen's 'Blue Jasmine' became his widest release ever. Sony Pictures Classics expanded Allen's drama of a ruined socialite starring Cate Blanchett to 1,283 theaters. It made $4.3million over the weekend after earning more than $10million in four weeks of limited release. The 3-D release of Universal's 'Jurassic Park,' which opened in North America in April, led the overseas market with $30million over the weekend, most of that from its opening in China. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where available, latest international numbers are also included.

Decision time: David Cameron arrives at Number 10 yesterday, where he made his case for Britain to join in an attack on Syria . Britain cannot ‘stand idly by’ as the Syrian regime uses chemical weapons to attack innocent children, David Cameron said last night. Making his first public case for Britain joining a retaliatory attack on the regime of tyrant Bashar al-Assad, the Prime Minister said the use of chemical weapons was ‘morally indefensible’. Mr Cameron, who announced MPs would be recalled tomorrow to debate military action, said: ‘What we have seen in Syria are appalling scenes of death and suffering because of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. 'I don’t believe we can let that stand.’ Nick Clegg also appeared to back military action, saying: ‘The murder of innocent men, women and children through the use of chemical weapons is a repugnant crime ... if we stand idly by we set a very dangerous precedent indeed.’ But former Army chief Lord Dannatt warned against an attack, saying it could make the conflict in Syria even worse. Ed Miliband, who was briefed in Downing Street yesterday, struck a more cautious note, saying Labour would ‘consider’ backing the action provided it was legal and limited. Many Tory MPs are also sceptical about any intervention in Syria’s bloody civil war, and Mr Cameron faces a tense Commons vote tomorrow night. On another day of dramatic developments: . Mr Cameron, who will chair a meeting of the National Security Council today, said a military response to last week’s atrocity in Damascus was ‘not about getting involved in a Middle Eastern war or changing our stance in Syria, or going further into that conflict’. ‘It’s about chemical weapons,’ he insisted. ‘Their use is wrong and the world should not stand idly by.’ He said all the evidence suggested Assad was responsible for last week’s atrocity in a Damascus suburb, which killed hundreds and injured thousands. But, conscious of the mistakes of the Iraq war, he acknowledged there was ‘never 100 per cent certainty’. Grim toll: A picture shows the aftermath of the chemical weapons attack in Damascus last week . Mr Cameron, who said there was evidence Assad had used chemical weapons at least ten times, said any attack would have to be ‘proportionate, have to be legal, (and) would have to specifically be about deterring the use of chemical weapons’. The G20 summit of world leaders in Russia next Thursday is likely to be dominated by the Syrian crisis. David Cameron and Barack Obama will be in St Petersburg as guests of Vladimir Putin, who has issued a strong condemnation of any military action by the West. Russia, which along with China is a staunch supporter of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, has sold him a stockpile of weapons reported to include helicopter gunships. In a difficult phone call on Monday night, Mr Putin told Mr Cameron there was no evidence of a chemical weapons attack. But the Prime Minister told the Russian president there was ‘little doubt’ one had been carried out by the regime’s forces. Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov accused the West of having ‘engineered a media campaign to facilitate a military incursion’. Relations between Moscow and the US are at a low ebb, especially since CIA whistleblower Ed Snowden was granted temporary asylum in Russia. He said that a final decision on military action had not been taken. But his words left little doubt that he is ready to order a British submarine in the region to fire cruise missiles at targets in Syria as part of an allied attack. Attorney general Dominic Grieve has been asked to draw up a detailed legal opinion underpinning the case for military action without a United Nations mandate. The Cabinet will meet tomorrow to approve the plans before the Prime Minister heads to the Commons to try to persuade MPs to back the high-risk intervention. Lord Dannatt was the latest high-profile figure to question the legality and purpose of the proposed military strike. Describing the plans as inappropriate, he said Assad’s probable use of chemical weapons, however wrong, did ‘not constitute an open invitation for the international community to impose themselves on the internal affairs of another country’. Lord Dannatt, who headed the British intervention in Kosovo, said it was unclear what the military objective of the plan was, adding: ‘We run a risk of fuelling the conflict and making it worse’. Conservative Richard Ottaway, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said it was doubtful whether the West could legally intervene on humanitarian grounds. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem denied the regime had used chemical weapons and challenged Washington to present proof backing up its accusations. He said missile strikes would play into the hands of Al Qaeda sympathisers fighting with the Syrian rebels. He added: ‘If we face aggression, we will defend ourselves. We will not hesitate to use any means available.’ The Arab League said the Syrian regime was ‘fully responsible for the ugly crime’. Military might: A picture released by the US Navy shows the . guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, left, and the aircraft carrier USS . Harry S. Truman sailing through the Strait of Gibraltar earlier this . month . The might of the US Navy was seen heading towards the Syrian coast in a photograph released yesterday. Aircraft Carrier USS Harry S Truman supported by guided missile carrier USS Gettysburg, moved into position ready to fire missiles into the heart of Damascus. US defence secretary Chuck Hagel said yesterday the military was ‘ready to go’ immediately with ‘all options’ against the Syrian regime. ‘We have moved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take,’ he declared. ‘We are prepared ... we are ready to go.’ The Harry S Truman has a crew of almost 6,000 and carries at least 90 Tomahawk missiles and the Gettysburg carries a mixture of 122 long and short-range missiles. The release of the picture, taken earlier this month by the US Navy, came as Britain put a squadron of Typhoon aircraft – in the Middle East on exercise – on standby to support any Coalition strike. Security at British bases in Cyprus has also been increased in case of reprisal attacks. More than 650 Royal Marines, who are due to arrive in Jordan late next week for an exercise with US forces, are set to be issued with chemical warfare suits and respirators as a precaution. A British nuclear submarine is understood to be in the eastern Mediterranean and is fully loaded with Tomahawk missiles ready to strike key targets if the command comes.","Cameron makes first public case for military attack on Syrian regime .

A photographer has captured candid and incredibly moving photographs of teenage triplets, all of whom suffer from autism. Over the course of two years, José Antonio de Lamadrid, 50, from Seville, has followed three 18-year-old brothers who were all born with the same complex neurological disorder. Mr Lamadrid wanted to follow Alejandro, Álvaro and Jaime Morillo  Aguilar because he was fascinated and touched by their interaction. Mr Lamadrid also has personal experience of the condition as his nephew is autistic. Here Jaime, Alejandro and Álvaro (left to right) are on their way to school in their parent's car. It took three years for them to be diagnosed with the complex neurological disorder . The condition is characterised by a . difficulty to communicate and socialise yet the three men have a visibly . strong brotherly bond. The men's parents, Noelia and Jaime, said that it was shortly after their sons turned one that they started to notice differences between them and children of the same age. They said that the boys did not respond to their calls and seemed disinterested by things that should have fascinated the them - planes in the sky, barking dogs and offerings of sweets all went unnoticed. Here the triplets' clothing is laid on the bed they sleep in during summer. They like to wear the same clothes as each other . Isolated: Alejandro is pictured in the school playground. The image captures how difficult it can be for autistic people to interact with their peers and the wider world . Every day, Jaime and Alejandro write their diary, documenting exactly what they have done, including minute details such as playing on their Nintendo console. Those with autism tend to be obsessive about their routine . This photograph captures the touching moment that father Jaime washes and shaves his son, Alejandro. Despite their age, the triplets will remain childlike and vulnerable for the rest of their life . It took three years and a raft of tests for them to be diagnosed. They were not deaf, there were not obvious genetic ot neurological problems. 'When you do not have any of these symptoms, you have autism,' Noelia said. Álvaro suffers with the most severe learning difficulties out of the three because he suffered a brain injury in childhood. As a result he attends a specialised autism centre. Alejandro and Álvaro may be 18-years-old but their condition makes them remarkably childlike. Here they are photographed playing cowboys at home . Alejandro is fixated by an image of himself in a mirror of a supermarket. Autism removes a person's understanding of what is acceptable in social situations . His brothers Alejandro and Jaime however attend the local high school that offers special classes to help them integrate with those unaffected by the condition. As with many people suffering autism, the men are very keen to stick to a routine. They . tirelessly document their days - even recording the minutiae of atching . TV, washing the dishes and, as one diary entry says, 'eating a coconut . yoghurt and playing Nintendo'. Every . Friday the men go to the town library to rent out movies. They also . visit their local leisure centre to socialise with other children who . have autism. Here Jaime enjoys being pampered by his mother and aunt in preparation for a costume party. The photographer's images give a rare insight into the complex world of men living with a condition that remains relatively misunderstood . Álvaro always carries small objects in his hands - everyday items that he calls 'inventions'. Autism is often characterised by obsessive tendencies, such as becoming fixated by seemingly unimportant objects . Here the brothers play, supervised by a social worker, while they wait to be picked up by their parents from their weekly club. Every Friday they play games and meet other people with autism at a local recreation centre . Alejandro . is an accomplished artist and enjoys playing puzzles. Since the age of six . he has been able to complete 1000-piece jigsaws in a matter of hours. Álvaro, . always carries what he refers to as 'inventions'. Objects include clay . figures and everyday household objects such as combs, pegs, . scissors and pencils. Jaime has a incredible memory - for example, if he is given a date he is able to tell you what day of the week it was, even if it was many years ago. Álvaro does not like noise and here he covers his ears in the recreation centre he attends each Friday. There he interacts - by bowling, for example - with other autistic people . Alejandro is pictured completing a puzzle. Since the age of six he has been able to complete 1000-piece jigsaws within a matter of hours . Jaime is the most competent at interacting and speaking with other people and is the natural spokesperson of the three. Despite their age, the men will always be childlike - both in terms of their interests and their understanding of the world around them. Mother . Noelia said: 'I look forward to the age that they can realise their . dreams. Maybe they can go to the Caribbean, or work in a  factory in . their Murcia with their cousin, Laura.' 'Many autistic people have communication and language problems and they do not understand lies, sarcasm. 'We are not only a form family. We are a team.'

A set of twins who were born three months early and were not expected to survive are to start school this term. Fraser and Ewan White suffered breathing problems, bleeding in the brain, heart defects and hernias and doctors said it was a miracle that they survived. Now almost six years later, the boys are a picture of health and ready to start their first day of school - a date that their mother, Julie, 36, feared she would never see. Fraser and Ewan White, now six, were born three months prematurely and it was feared that they would not survive. They both suffered breathing difficulties, bleeds on the brain and hernias . Stirling couple Julie, and Graham, 45, were over the moon when they were told they would be having twins. But the babies developed twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome - a disease of the placenta that affects identical twin pregnancies - and the couple feared they would lose them. Things went from bad to worse when one their babies developed the life-threatening condition absent end diastolic flow (AEDF), which stops the blood flowing through the umbilical cord properly. Mrs White said: ‘Being told on the day of my 12 week scan that I was having twins was an incredible experience. ‘But from then on everything was just horrendous. ‘We had several TTTS scares, then at 25 weeks I was told that Ewan had AEDF and there was a chance he wouldn't survive because he couldn't breathe.’ In the womb Ewan and Fraser (pictured with their mother, Julie) developed twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome - a disease of the placenta that can affect identical twins . Ewan had to be delivered as quickly as possible, but if he arrived too early, he would be too weak to survive. ‘It was awful, just awful’, Mrs White said. ‘Four weeks of just watching every second on the clock tick by. ‘It was the worst time of my life.’ The boys were eventually delivered at 29 weeks by an emergency Caesarean-section, and rushed off to intensive care where doctors fought to save them. Fraser (pictured when he was seven-hours-old) was born with a hole in his heart and it was feared that he would have to have surgery to repair it. However, fortunately the hole repaired itself . Ewan (pictured when he was seven-hours-old) and Fraser were rushed straight from the operating theatre to intensive care and it was six hours before their mother knew if they had survived . Mrs White said: ‘I didn't even get to see them. ‘There was a team of about 17 people, and my babies were just rushed away. ‘I was left for about six hours before anyone could even tell me if they were alive or not.’ They had survived, but within days Mr and Mrs White were told they had suffered bleeding in their brains - a common complication of prematurity which can cause cerebral palsy - and that Fraser might require an operation to repair a hole in his heart. In the womb, Ewan also developed the life-threatening condition absent end diastolic flow (AEDF), which stops the blood flowing through the umbilical cord properly . Thankfully the hole healed itself, but weighing just two and a half pounds, the boys had to be watched closely by doctors and nurses at the hospital for almost two months before doctors started to think about discharging them. Then, just as Mr and Mrs White thought they would get to take their babies home, Fraser developed a hernia and was rushed to Yorkhill Children's Hospital, in Glasgow, to be operated on. Because he was so small and fragile, doctors were worried he would not survive. Mrs White said: ‘It was really hard that day because they discharged Ewan, and Fraser was taken away in an ambulance on his own to go for surgery. The boys are now both healthy and are starting school. Their mother, Julie, says that she always told herself that they would be fine if they could reach their first day of school without any long term health problems . ‘I was left with just one baby, and Graham was back at work by then. ‘It was really hard. I'd waited so long to take them home, but ended up taking one baby home for my sister to look after before driving to Yorkhill to be with the other one.’ But the problems did not stop there, and just 24 hours after Fraser was operated on, Ewan too developed hernia. Mrs White said: ‘They were each in Yorkhill for two days and three nights. ‘They try under all circumstances to avoid giving general anaesthetic to babies under 4lbs because it's so risky.’ Mrs White said: 'Being told on the day of my 12 week scan that I was having twins was an incredible experience. But from then on everything was just horrendous with the pregnancy' When Mrs White eventually got to take the twins home she was worried they would have lasting health problems. She always told herself if they could reach primary school without any problems then they'd be in the clear. Fraser and Ewan are starting school in the same class at St Ninians Primary School, Stirling, this term.

Mrs White said: ‘Having them home eventually was wonderful, but it took a very long time before I could relax. ‘They were just under 4lbs - and it was still before their due date. ‘I tried not to think about all that had happened, it was too distressing. ‘When you read about all the complications of premature births, you're preparing yourself for children with cerebral palsy or learning difficulties. Mrs White says that she will be extremely proud when she sees the boys walk through the school gates for the first time. She says that they are now 'healthy, robust' children . ‘To come through the TTTS, then the AEDF and the premature delivery and then the various complications, is a miracle. ‘It almost defied all medical explanation. ‘I always said if they could make it to primary one that would be them in the all-clear. ‘Now they're really healthy, robust kids. ‘When they walk through the school gates I'll be bursting with pride. ‘There will be a whole mix of emotions, it'll be really overwhelming, but it'll be wonderful.’","Fraser and Ewan White were delivered by emergency C-section at 29 weeks .

Comedian Freddie Starr has been re-bailed until October by police investigating alleged 'historic' sexual offences . Comedian Freddie Starr faced new agony yesterday after he was re-bailed until October by police investigating alleged ‘historic’ sexual offences. The 70-year-old was first arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree - the Scotland Yard inquiry set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal - in November of last year. He was re-arrested in April when further allegations against him emerged. He was due to answer police bail this week, but has instead been re-bailed until October. The entertainer, who lives in Warwickshire, has consistently denied any wrongdoing and had hoped he would be cleared this week. A number of well-placed sources believe the claim against him is flimsy and ultimately he will face no further action. Operation Yewtree is being run in three strands - one involving claims against Savile, one against Savile and others, and the third allegations involving others. Starr’s arrest in November concerned allegations involving Savile and others, while the April re-arrest was over claims with no link to the late, shamed television presenter. Last week Jim Davidson was told he would face no further action seven months after he was arrested over allegations he sexually assaulted ten women. The 59-year-old comedian was arrested in January and again in March as part of Operation Yewtree. But the Crown Prosecution Service said the women’s allegations were not strong enough for there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction. Three people have so far been charged under Operation Yewtree. Earlier this month ex Radio One DJ Dave Lee Travis was charged with 12 sexual offences, some dating back to the 1970s.

Standing in line for a chance to see her within minutes of the zoo opening yesterday, the visitors’ mood was pregnant with excitement. That much, at least, can be said with certainty, despite it still being unconfirmed if Tian Tian, the furry focus of thousands’ fascination every day, is expecting a cub. But such is the air of expectancy over the mere possibility, that pre-booked viewing slots to see her and her male partner Yang Guang are now sold out for days in advance. Pre-booked viewing slots to see Tian Tian and her male partner Yang Guang are now sold out for days in advance since the news that she may be pregnant . The 10 year-old panda could give birth at any point over the next two weeks . The female giant panda rests at Edinburgh zoo today in preparation for what could be the first birth of a giant panda in the UK . Only a limited number of tickets are being released each morning on a first come, first served basis as fans flock to Edinburgh Zoo for a peek before the UK’s only female giant panda pops (if, indeed, she ever does). From toddlers in pushchairs to octogenarians with walking sticks, those lucky enough to have places on yesterday’s coveted viewing slots patiently waited to enter the panda enclosure in groups of 50 at a time. A notice board outside warned ‘all panda viewing time slots are fully booked’, but, after paying the zoo’s £16 entrance fee, I was lucky enough to nab one of the last places, which cost nothing extra, on the 9.30am visit. First you are led into a viewing area where you can see into the ten-year-old(ok) pandas’ indoor enclosure through floor-to-ceiling windows. The blinds were down on Tian Tian’s, part of the process hopeful keepers are using to help mimic the atmosphere of a den that she would seek in the wild to have a cub in. Yang Guang briefly stuck his head round the entrance to his, but that was all we saw of him. No pacing up and down like an expectant father - but then, panda dads do leave raising the kids to mum. In the outdoor viewing area, we were graced with Tian Tian’s presence. She bounded up her climbing frame and lay down on top of it for a few minutes. A chorus of ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ greeted her arrival as cameras clicked away. Exiting via the zoo shop, you are surrounded by ‘panda-phernalia’ of every sort: t-shirts, tea towels, pens, fridge magnets, masks - you name it, they’ve got it and it’s all emblazoned with a panda. Cuddly pands toys alone are selling at a rate of 5,000 a week. Yesterday children were going homes with armfuls of the stuff. There is a chance Tian Tian, seen roaming her Edinburgh Zoo enclosure today, could reject the foetuses or that her body could reabsorb them . Yang Guang enjoys his free time at Edinburgh Zoo while Tian Tian, who is possible pregnant, rests in her 'off show area' After Yang Guang and Tian Tian failed to mate naturally, experts artificially inseminated the female giant panda with Yang Guang's semen so the cub or cubs will still be his . Craig Sommerville, 33, a customer relations manager for an energy firm, visiting with his niece Sophia, two, from Glasgow, said: ‘It’s not Edinburgh Zoo - it’s panda zoo. It’s all about the panda here - everything is panda, panda, panda.’ Stephen Haarer, 48, a business analyst from Staines, London, who was visiting with his wife Judith, 47, and daughters Natalie, 15 and 13-year-old Samantha, booked their panda slot in advance via the zoo’s website to avoid disappointment. ‘We saw Tian Tian, I was quite surprised as I thought she’d be sleeping,’ he said. ‘A cub would be brilliant, it’d generate even more interest in conservation.’ Audrey Collins, 80, of Edinburgh, who has been visiting for 50 years, said: ‘It’ll be very interesting if they have a cub - and good for Edinburgh and good for the zoo.’ The zoo revealed on Monday that hormone tests suggest Tian Tian is expecting and could give birth to what would be the first panda cub to be born in the UK any day now. But such are the peculiarities of panda biology, no one can be 100 per cent sure until she actually goes into labour. It wouldn’t be her first cub. She had twins in 2009 at the zoo in China which loaned her and Yang Gunag (he was not the father on that occasion, but this time he may turn out to be) to Britain. Unlike humans, pandas are as likely to have twins as they a single cub, but as they are only able to rear one cub at a time, when born in captivity the second cub is cared for by keepers. By all accounts, she was a good mum too, picking up her newborns, cradling them in her arms and affectionately licking them. Will such heart-warming scenes be witnessed in Edinburgh? Keepers say she could give birth at any time in the next two weeks. In the meantime, all any of us can do is grin and, er, bear it as we await the hoped-for happy day.","Crowds queue to see Tian Tian within minutes of zoo opening .

An artist is dedicating his life’s work to painting a portrait of every person living in his home city - all 1,800 of them. Grahame Hurd-Wood, 55, has already spent 14 years producing pictures of people in St Davids in Wales - which is Britain's smallest city. He has painted oil portraits of everyone from its councillors and bishops to children, housewives and students. Talented: Grahame Hurd-Wood has already spent 14 years producing paintings of people in St Davids . Mr Hurd-Wood has finished 112 paintings but believes he can complete the remaining 1,688 in a decade if he paints them at a rate of one every two days. He has spent the past 30 years living in the Pembrokeshire city - Britain’s smallest in both size and population and reputably the second smallest in the world. His labour of love began as a hobby but after painting dozens of friends and family he decided to keep going until he has captured every last resident. Eventually Mr Hurd-Wood plans to merge them all together as one giant panorama capturing all walks of life. Grahame Hurd-Wood has painted oil portraits of people in St Davids from its councillors and bishops to children, housewives and students . He said: 'I began painting residents in St Davids around 14 years ago. The original concept was to paint a few people and then put the portraits together as one large image. 'But after I painted just over 100 portraits I thought if I concentrate more it would be possible to paint the whole city. 'St Davids is a very special place and a unique city. People from all walks of life integrate and live alongside one another. 'I have been accepted into the community and I love it here - this is my way of paying tribute to the place I call home.' Mr Hurd-Wood says each small portrait can take between 45 minutes and four hours but so far every single resident he’s asked has been happy to sit for him. Dorrien Davis, the Canon of St David's Cathedral, holds his portrait created by artist Grahame Hurd-Wood . His youngest subject to date was four-year-old Erin Dauncey, while the oldest was 85-year-old Klaus Trier. Mr Hurd-Wood, who trained at Camberwell College of Arts and the Royal Academy of Arts, is traditionally a landscape artist who works predominantly in oils. He’s calling his mammoth project 'City of Portraits'. Mr Hurd-Wood said: 'Once I’ve completed the whole collection I’ll have an exhibition in St Davids where everyone who I have painted can come and see the paintings as one collection. Pleased with the results: Resident David Lloyd (left) and student Angharad Lewis, 24, hold their portraits . 'I tend to approach people to see if they would be happy to sit, but occasionally someone will ask for me to do a portrait of them. 'Most people are intrigued and really positive about it. I do every portrait from a sitting so each one is personalised. It’s nice to have the time to get to know that individual a little better. 'When it’s finished it will look from a distance like one giant piece of work. But when you look closer you will be able to see each individual’s portrait and identity. Artist Grahame Hurd-Wood works on a portrait in his home town of St Davids in Wales . Mr Hurd-Wood says each small portrait can take between 45 minutes and four hours . 'The collection is an eclectic viewpoint which reflects the diversity of the whole city from all walks of life.' St Davids was given city status in the 16th century due to the presence of St David’s Cathedral but lost it in 1888, only to see it restored in 1994 at the request of Queen Elizabeth II. David Lloyd, 68, a barrister who has lived there all his life, said: 'Grahame’s amazing collection is a striking snapshot of the community that I belong to and where I have been all my life.'","Grahame Hurd-Wood has spent 14 years producing portraits of people in St David's in Wales - Britain's smallest city .

Business leaders have delivered a body blow to the HS2 rail line by branding it a ‘grand folly’ which should be scrapped. A poll of company directors found 70 per cent believe the 225mph trains between London and Birmingham – and a later extension to Leeds and Manchester – will have no impact on the productivity of their firms. Public backing for the £50billion project has been plummeting in recent weeks amid claims the budget could balloon to £73billion and senior political figures questioning the economic case for it. Body blow: A poll of business leaders found that 70% thought that the proposed HS2 rail line would have no impact on their firm's productivity . A key plank of the argument for the north-south high-speed rail link is that it will boost companies’ productivity as staff will spend less time travelling, however the latest poll from the Institute of Directors undermines this argument as 94 per cent of its members said they work while on a train. But the most damning conclusions of the survey of more than 1,300 directors was the  little enthusiasm shown for HS2 in the regions where the benefits are supposed to be strongest. Just 29 per cent of those in the North West and only 20 per cent in the North East thought the rail link would be good value for money, while 63 per cent thought the budget would be better spent on other rail and road schemes. 'Grand folly': Simon Walker said the Government should focus on 1,000 smaller projects after the Institute of Directors' research found businesses do not see value for money in HS2 . Simon Walker, IoD director general, said: ‘Businesses know value for money when they see it, and our research shows that they don’t see it in the Government’s case for HS2. ‘We agree with the need for key infrastructure spending, but the business case for HS2 simply is not there. ‘The money would be far better spent elsewhere and in a way that will benefit much more of the country. Station upgrades, inter-city improvements, tunnels, electrification and capacity improvements should all be considered alternatives. ‘It is time for the Government to look at a thousand smaller projects instead of falling for one grand folly.’ The rail line, set to be constructed from 2017, would run from London to Birmingham by 2026 and on to Manchester and Leeds by 2032-3, significantly cutting down current journey times. When given the go-ahead by the Coalition three years ago its budget was £30billion, but it has now been increased to £42.6billion, plus £7.5billion for rolling stock. Despite the insistence from ministers that the line will boost economic growth in northern England, the majority of directors in almost every region felt London would be the major beneficiary from it. Labour Party grandees have broken ranks in recent weeks by saying the money would be better spent on a range of rail upgrades, such as the East Coast mainline and commuter trains in the South West. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has made it clear there will be ‘no blank cheque’ for the project, while the party’s transport spokesman, Maria Eagle, proposed a cap of £50billion. Attacks: Former Chancellor Alistair Darling, left, has called the proposed HS2 scheme 'foolish', while current Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls has said there will be 'no blank cheque' for the plans . Former Chancellor Alistair Darling also attacked HS2 as ‘foolish’, saying investing such a vast sum on one rail line will starve resources from the rest of the network and leave it ‘falling apart’. Some MPs and think tanks already believe HS2 could eventually cost up to £80billion. But Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin insisted last week there is still cross-party support for HS2 and stood by the £42.6billion budget.

The country's 10 most lucrative speed cameras have been revealed - and between them, they have made £12million for the state over three years. One camera, situated on the M60 in Greater Manchester, caught more than 32,000 speeding drivers - meaning it took in around £2million in revenue. Campaigners have accused transport bosses of using speed cameras to raise money from motorists, rather than improving road safety. Hotspots: This map shows the most lucrative speed cameras in England and Wales over the past three years . The top 10 permanent speed cameras in England and Wales were revealed by a Freedom of Information request published in The Sun. Each of the cameras - which include motorways, city centre roads and more rural routes - caught more than 10,000 people breaking the speed limit over the past three years. The most lucrative of all was on the M60 near Stockport, where 32,205 motorists were caught speeding - meaning that with the minimum fine set at £60, it will have raised at least £1,932,300. Next came a stretch of the A4042 near Newport in South Wales, which took in more than £1.4million. Not all the cameras on the list were located on inter-city roads - major urban thoroughfares such as the Limehouse Link tunnel in East London and Scotland Road in Liverpool also raised over £1million. Number one: A camera on the M60 near Stockport in Greater Manchester raised nearly £2million in three years . Urban: The Limehouse Link tunnel in East London is another speed camera hotspot, according to figures . It is not only permanent cameras which proved lucrative money-spinners - a temporary camera at the junction of the M1 and M6 in Warwickshire made £1million in 18 months. The Taxpayers' Alliance criticised the findings, saying they suggested that cameras were being used to raise money rather than reduce speeds. 'It's incredible that just a tiny number of cameras are raking in so much cash at motorists' expense,' said chief executive Matthew Sinclair. 'Driver have long suspected that speed cameras are more about raising money than keeping roads safe. 'The authorities should focus on measure that improve the safety of the roads, not simply look to maximise the amount brought in from fines.' Controversy: Campaigners have accused road bosses of using speed cameras to make money . A spokesman for the AA said that the vast amounts of money being raised by certain cameras could mean they were not doing their job of preventing against excessive speeds. 'There needs to be a degree of investigation about why so many drivers are breaking the speed limit,' he said. 'Are they understanding the signage? Are the cameras conspicuous, as they are meant to be? 'Cameras that just click away aren't necessarily improving road safety.' However, he added that more than two thirds of drivers accept the role that speed cameras play in improving safety, according to polls. Road safety charity Brake defended the importance of cracking down on speeding in accident blackspots. 'Rigorous academic studies have shown fixed speed cameras are exceptionally effective in reducing speeds, crashes and casualties, preventing families going through the unnecessary trauma and pain of a road death or injury,' said campaigns officer Ellen Booth. 'These studies have also demonstrated that speed cameras pay for themselves several times over by preventing costly casualties. 'It's important to remember that cameras only catch drivers who are breaking speed limits, and these drivers are putting others at risk by speeding.'","Camera on the M60 near Stockport is UK's most lucrative capturing 32,000 .

A paedophile who escaped jail after his 13-year-old victim was called 'predatory' in court will have his sentenced reviewed by the Court of Appeal. Neil Wilson sparked outrage when he was handed a suspended sentence despite pleading guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child, making indecent images of a child and possession of an extreme pornographic image. Now the Attorney General has opted to refer the case to appeal judges who will decide whether the original sentence was unduly lenient. Review: A paedophile who escaped prison will have his sentence re-examined at the Court of Appeal . Wilson, 41, was given a 12-month suspended sentence after prosecuting barrister Robert Colover labelled his victims 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced'. Judge Nigel Peters QC also said he had accounted for the fact that the girl looked older than 13 when he sentenced Wilson. 'Having carefully reviewed this case, the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC MP, has decided to refer the sentence of Neil Wilson to the Court of Appeal for review,' the Attorney General's Office said in a statement. 'The case will in due course be heard by three Court of Appeal judges who will decide whether or not the sentence is unduly lenient and whether they should increase it.' Controversy: Attorney General Dominic Grieve, left, made the decision after barrister Robert Colover, right, sparked an outcry by describing the man's victim as 'predatory' Mr Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sexual offence cases pending a review by the Crown Prosecution Service, while Mr Peters' comments are to be investigated by the Office for Judicial Complaints. Following the outcry over Mr Colover's comments, 50,000 people signed a petition demanding that the Director of Public Prosecutions investigate the lawyer's language. Uproar: Judge Nigel Peters imposed a more lenient sentence because the 13-year-old girl looked older . Even David Cameron got involved in . the controversy, saying: 'We need a criminal justice system that stands . up properly for victims. The victims of crime should always be at the . centre of our thinking.' Wilson admitted to picking up the girl in the street in Romford, Essex while she was playing truant from school. He took her back to his flat and started a two-week 'fling' with her, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard, culminating in a sexual encounter apparently initiated by the girl. When officers went to Wilson's home after the girl told a friend about the incident, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer. During sentencing, Mr Colover said: 'The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced. 'She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15 year old despite being younger than that. 'There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson's doing, you might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her.' The judge apparently agreed, telling Wilson: 'I have taken in to account that even though the girl was 13, the prosecution say she looked and behaved a little bit older. 'You knew she was not nearly 16 as she said and your plea of guilty recognises that you knew. 'Allowing her to visit your home is something we have to clamp down on and in normal circumstances that would mean a significant term in prison. 'On these facts, the girl was predatory and was egging you on. That is no defence when dealing with children but I am prepared to impose a suspension.'","Neil Wilson received 12-month suspended sentence after preying on girl .

Labour plans for a ‘tourist tax’ would mean millions of families could no longer afford to take ‘staycations’ in the UK, ministers warned last night. Culture Secretary Maria Miller and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said a ‘levy on overnight accommodation’ would hit thousands of businesses in the tourist sector. The proposal, put forward by Ed Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet ally Sadiq Khan and backed by some Labour councils, would potentially see a tax placed on all hotel, bed and breakfast and self-catering accommodation. Sadiq Khan's suggestion of a 'levy on overnight accommodation' would leave families unable to afford 'staycations' in the UK, the Conservatives have warned (pictured B&Bs in Blackpool) Similar taxes in the United States are typically levied at 10 per cent of the price of a room. If Labour adopted a similar rate it would add £10 to the cost of a £100 hotel room. A family staying in a £90-a-night room would pay an extra £126 in tax for a two-week holiday. Mrs Miller said: ‘Labour’s plans will make having a holiday here far more expensive, which will drive people elsewhere and do terrible damage to this country’s tourism industry.’ Mr Pickles also rejected the idea. ‘This will destroy jobs in coastal towns and popular tourist destinations across the country,’ he said. Labour considered the idea of a tourist tax while in government but dropped the idea after criticism from the tourism industry. But Mr Khan revived the idea in a newspaper article. He suggested it could be piloted in London. Culture Secretary Maria Miller (left) said Sadiq Khan's (right) suggestions for a tourist tax 'will drive people elsewhere and do terrible damage to this country's tourism industry' ‘We could tailor a tourism contribution that works for the tourism industry, doesn’t penalise local people and has the sole purpose of improving and promoting the city,’ he said. A number of Labour councils are also still pushing the idea. Theo Blackwell of Camden Council said even a modest £1-a-night charge would raise £4million a year in the borough. But Martin Couchman, of the British Hospitality Association, said any new tax would damage an industry already suffering one of the highest VAT rates in Europe. He said a modest tax would barely be worth collecting while a larger tax would deter tourists. A Labour source last night insisted the party was not formally backing a tourist tax. The source said: ‘Sadiq Khan was highlighting the need for London to have greater control of its finances. A tourist contribution is not Labour Party policy.’","Tories said levy will do 'terrible damage to country's tourism industry'

Ed Miliband’s failure to take on Labour’s union paymasters has left him looking ‘weaker than Neil Kinnock’, Michael Gove will warn today. In an attack on the Labour leader’s record, the Education Secretary will accuse him of letting powerful union barons drag the party back to the 1970s. Mr Gove – who has repeatedly clashed with teaching unions over radical school reforms – warns that the issue facing Mr Miliband is similar to that faced by Lord Kinnock in the 1980s when the hard-left Militant group was trying to take over the Labour Party. Toxic issue: Labour leader Ed Miliband is compromised by his union backers . In a speech at Conservative Party HQ he will say the unions have become ‘a toxic issue’ for Mr Miliband and because of ‘his failure to appreciate that with him in place radical left-wing union leaders now believe the Labour Party can be theirs again: and they are taking it back, seat by seat, policy by policy, before his impotent gaze’. Lord Kinnock led Labour to defeats against Margaret Thatcher and John Major. Attack: Michael Gove has accused Miliband of letting union barons take over the Labour party . But Mr Gove will say that, unlike Mr Miliband, he stood up for Labour when the party came under threat from the hard left. ‘The contrast with Neil Kinnock... is striking and not at all flattering to Ed Miliband.’ And he believes that while Lord Kinnock acted ‘bravely and remorselessly’ to eradicate Militant’s influence, ‘Miliband has done nothing to stop the takeover of his own party’. Mr Miliband has been rocked by . allegations that the Unite union  attempted to take over the Labour . Party by trying to fix parliamentary selection meetings for its . candidate in Falkirk. Mr . Gove will warn that Mr Miliband is too in hock to the unions in general, . and Unite in particular, ever to be able to tackle them effectively. The . unions have provided 85 per cent of Labour’s donations since Mr . Miliband became leader – a far higher proportion than under Tony Blair . or Gordon Brown – with Unite Labour’s biggest single donor, handing over . £8.4million since 2010. Mr Gove points out that Mr Miliband owes his position to the unions, with MPs and party members voting for his brother David. ‘That . is key to his weakness,’ Mr Gove will say. ‘He was put in place by . organisations with an agenda because they believed he would be the most . pliant personality available.’ He will also hit out at Labour’s call for a £5,000 cap on political donations. Behind the scenes: Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union Unite, which is Labour's single biggest donor . MP Jonathan Ashworth, of Labour’s National Executive Committee, accused Mr Gove of  ‘throwing around cheap smears’. Party funding was ‘crying out for serious reform’, he said. ‘Anyone would have thought Mr Gove would welcome such an opportunity to clean up Tory party finances.’","Michael Gove has accused Miliband of letting the unions dictate to Labour .

The family of a dying grandmother have told how they smuggled ice lollies in to hospital after nurses left her so thirsty her lips cracked and bled. Sandra Aston, 79, was ‘treated like an animal’ by nurses, who claimed they could not help when her family begged them to act as she became increasingly dehydrated. While Mrs Aston was too weak to drink from a cup, her thirst could have been quenched with oral sponges. But staff did not provide these, leaving her family to feed her ice lollies they bought outside. Tracey Holmes, 51, says that her mother, Sandra Aston, 79, was left in squalor and 'treated like an animal' in the week before she died at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, in April last year . Mrs Aston (pictured with her daughter, Tracey Holmes) was initially misdiagnosed with pneumonia when she was admitted to Redditch Alexandra Hospital before X-rays revealed she had inoperable lung cancer . As they finally received a formal apology from the hospital, Mrs Aston’s family yesterday spoke of their ongoing distress about the way she was left to die with so little dignity. Her daughter Tracy Holmes, 51, who lived close to her mother and father Robert, 80, in Evesham, Worcestershire, said medical staff deprived her dying mother of ‘basic human dignity’ in her final days. ‘My mother was left dehydrated, with no monitoring of her fluid or food intake,’ she added. ‘We constantly found her freezing cold, with cracked bleeding lips and in considerable distress due to her discomfort and desperate thirst. We even took to bringing her ice lollies because the hospital was unable to provide oral sponges. We fear that if we had not been there then Mum would have received nothing at all.’ She said the care received by her mother was ‘appalling’ and ‘no better than that given to a helpless animal’. ‘If Mum was to die then she deserved . to do so peacefully and with dignity. She could have had a peaceful . release, she could have said goodbye to her grandchildren.’ Mrs . Aston, a retired office manager, was admitted to Redditch Alexandra . Hospital on April 19 last year. She was suffering with inoperable lung . cancer and secondary liver cancer but was initially misdiagnosed as . having pneumonia, despite the cancer showing up on X-rays. Mrs Aston (pictured with her husband, Robert, in 1983) was left freezing cold, dehydrated and in great discomfort by staff at the hospital. Her family say that her lips cracked because they were so dry . The family were told that she was  dying of cancer only when she had days to live after a physiotherapist realised her health was rapidly deteriorating and further tests were run. The grandmother-of-two died in appalling conditions less than a week after she was diagnosed with cancer. As her condition deteriorated, leaving her unable to drink properly, she became painfully dehydrated. Mrs Holmes said agency nurses did not fill up her water supply by her bed. ‘Her mouth was so dry and she was so weak it was heart-breaking. I started taking in Ribena lollipops, the ones that are in the tubes, because that was all I could find. It was only after a physiotherapist spotted Mrs Aston's health deteriorate and reported it to a senior doctor that the family were told how serious her condition was. She is pictured on her 70th birthday in 2004 . ‘The doctors and nurses weren’t happy about me taking them in but I just said, “no, we’re taking them in” and they let me in the end.’ After three days of persistent complaints, nurses finally began using wet sponges on Mrs Aston’s lips. After her mother’s death, Mrs Holmes complained to Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. ‘If we had known she had cancer she could have gone into a hospice and died with dignity instead of ending up so uncomfortable in a horrible room,’ she added. ‘The saddest thing was that Mum loved that hospital and had always chosen to go there. The place she put her faith and trust in let her down in the end.’ The trust’s chief nursing officer Helen Blanchard has written to Mrs Holmes, offering a ‘heartfelt and sincere’ apology. She added: ‘We have taken action to improve care.’ Mrs Ashton's family have received a formal apology from Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, after they complained about the appalling care she received .","Sandra Aston, 79, died of lung cancer at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch .

Neighbours raised the alarm after spotting them using bins to climb up on to the balcony of the home in Ipswich, Suffolk. Caught in the act: Slowik, left, and Majewski, right, were each jailed for a year for pretending to be asleep when police raided a house they were burgling . When police arrived they found a trail of destruction throughout the property which led them to the bedroom. Inside, the two Polish men were pretending to be asleep in bed. Officers also found a torch under a cot. Slowik and Majewski, a carpenter, were each jailed for a year by Judge Rupert Overbury at Ipswich Crown Court. Det Insp Eamonn Bridger, of Suffolk Police, said: 'Officers arrived to find a messy search had been carried out at the address with items of property tipped from drawers and cupboards gone through.

But quite how that makes a fly-swat an offensive weapon – and one which a 33-year-old mother needed ID to buy – is a mystery. Nicola Butcher visited her local hardware shop to buy the flimsy utensil when her kitchen became plagued with flies. 'Offensive weapon': Nicola Butcher was eventually allowed to purchase the flimsy fly swat, deemed an 'offensive weapon' at her local store, once she showed them ID . But she was stunned when the assistant refused to sell it to her unless she produced her driving licence or passport. The till - at Home Hardware, in Romsey, Hampshire - flashed up a warning sign, which indicated the fly swat was classified as an 'offensive weapon'. It means bosses considered the swat as dangerous as knives, fireworks, and lighters, which can only be sold legally to over 18s. Mrs Butcher - mum to two-year-old daughter India - said: 'The fly swat is a flimsy piece of plastic - certainly not an offensive weapon. 'I’d like to say it wouldn’t hurt a fly but that’s probably the only thing it could come close to hurting. 'I could swat somebody with it using all my strength and I doubt it would leave even the slightest of marks or bruises.' Mrs Butcher, who was recently made redundant from her project manager job at insurance firm Aviva, took the request for ID as a compliment. Only once the 33-year-old produced her passport did the shop attendant at the hardware store in Romsey, Hants (pictured), let her buy the swat . She said: 'The number of flies has . rocketed in the hot weather and unfortunately some of them have made . their way from my garden into my kitchen. 'I broke my old fly swat from overuse and went to the local shop to buy a replacement. 'I only expected to be in the store for a couple of minutes but it turned into a bit of a drama at the checkout. 'The . shop assistant - who was in her fifties - told me a warning had flashed . up telling her the swat was an ""offensive weapon"" and she should check . the customer is over 18. 'I thought she was having a laugh but she invited me round the other side of the till to show me the screen. This is not the first time shops have asked people for ID when buying apparently innocent items. Parents . Kirsty Breeze, 19, and Ian Jackson, 24, had to prove their age when . buying a Fireman Sam DVD from Sainsbury’s in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs. Office . worker Christine Cuddihy, 24, was told she had to be aged over 21 to . buy a cheese and onion quiche from Tesco in Coventry, West Midlands. And writer Elinor Zuke, 25, was asked for ID when buying a £1.19 pack of six teaspoons at Sainsbury, in Crawley, West Sussex. Anybody convicted of selling a knife to a person aged under 18 can be jailed for up to six months or fined up to £5,000. An offensive weapon is any article made or adapted for use for causing injury to the person, including knives and hidden knives. 'We were both laughing and joking but she asked if I had my driving licence or passport on me, which I thought was ridiculous. 'I’m . 33 years old and think I look my age but I did take her request as a . compliment. In the end I had to get my driving licence out. 'How can an innocent plastic fly swat be an offensive weapon? What is the world coming to when you can’t buy a fly swat without producing ID for it. 'I can understand why you would ask for ID when you were buying fireworks, alcohol, or a high voltage electric fly swat - but not a cheap plastic one. 'The shop also sells spades and frying pans which would cause much more damage if I smacked somebody over the head with one of them.' Lindsey Waude, the store’s assistant manager, said: 'We think it might be an error on our till system. 'Sometimes it flashes up that something is an offensive weapon, but our guy who does the computers has been on his honeymoon for three weeks .

A bride-to-be was 'disfigured' at her engagement party when a woman who had once appeared on the Jeremy Kyle show deliberately smashed a glass into her face, a jury was told today. It should have been one of the happiest days in Lucy Steers’ life - but Jennifer Eckley’s attack on her made it one of the worst, said prosecutor Julian Kesner at Gloucester Crown Court. Miss Steers, of Gloucetershire, suffered a broken nose, a ‘gaping’ 2cm wound on the bridge of her nose and two other cuts - one to the side of the nose and one to the eye, he said. It was suggested during the trial that Eckley's past appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show was the trigger which led to the alleged attack. Scarred: Lucy Steers (left), the bride-to-be who suffered wounds to her face following an attack at her engagement party. Jennifer Eckley (right) is alleged to have glassed Miss Steers . The defence suggested that Miss Steers had been 'taunting' Eckley about her appearance on the controversial show and the violence then broke out. Details of why Eckley appeared on Jeremy Kyle were not given to the jury. Just before she glassed Ms Steers, the . defendant told her: 'I suppose you think you’re f****** pretty - well you . won’t be now,' it was alleged. Child-minder Eckley, 27, of Newent, Gloucestershire, denies wounding Miss Steers with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm on the night of 1/2 December last year at the George Hotel in Newent. She also denies assaulting another woman guest, Kate Taylor, by beating. The jury was told that she has, however, admitted a less serious assault on Miss Steers and a charge of assault on Kate Taylor’s sister, Nicola Taylor. Mr Kesner told the jury that the assaults on the Taylor sisters happened between about 10.30-10.45pm that night. They were sparked, he said, by Nicola Taylor bad-mouthing Eckley’s boyfriend Mark Beacham. The George Hotel in Newent, where the alleged attack took place . Nicola Taylor had gone out with Mr Beacham before Eckley became his girlfriend, Mr Kesner said. Surprisingly, in view of the attacks on the sisters, Eckley was still at the pub an hour later when she glassed Miss Steers, he added. 'She left the most serious assault until last,' he said. 'Glass in hand she hit and disfigured Lucy Steers.' 'Rather than being one of the happiest days of Lucy Steers’ life, her engagement party, it turned out to be one of the worst.' Lucy had thrown the party at the George with her fiance Craig Mortimer because her father was a manager at the hotel, he said. Mr Kesner told the jury the first assault happened when Nicola Taylor was in an alleyway and Eckley approached her and said she was fed up with what she was saying about her bloke. 'She grabbed Nicola Taylor’s hair and banged her head against a wall. Two people intervened to stop her. One of those who intervened was Nicola’s sister Kate. 'During that intervention and the general melee the defendant punched Kate in the face.' Mr Kesner said Eckley was pulled away. An hour later she approached Miss Steers in the bar and was ‘having a go at her’ when pub landlord Rhodri Yendle pulled her away. The case is being heard at Gloucester Crown Court. Eckley denies wounding Miss Steers with intent to cause her grievous bodily harm . He was talking to her in the alleyway and telling her to calm down when she saw Miss Steers in a back smoking area . 'Understandably Miss Steers was upset about the earlier incident and was saying something about the defendant which Ms Eckley overheard.' 'On hearing her the defendant responded by going to the smoking area. It is an undisputed fact in this case that she went there to have another go at Lucy. 'The prosecution say she was on the warpath and it was obvious to everyone in the smoking area that she was after Lucy.' Eckley was arrested about an hour after the glassing and made no comment - except to say to a police officer: 'No-one is going to want me to look after their kids now that I have glassed someone in the face.' Yet in her defence statement Eckley has denied saying that to the officer - and denied that she had a glass in her hand. She also disputed that Lucy’s injuries were caused by a glass, said Mr Kesner. It was suggested during the trial that Eckley's past appearance on the Jeremy Kyle show (pictured) was the trigger which led to the alleged attack . Cross-examining her, defence lawyer Jason Coulter asked her about CCTV footage of her and Eckley talking in the hotel bar. 'I suggest it was a reasonably friendly chat but it got a bit difficult after that because you made reference to her appearing some time earlier on the Jeremy Kyle TV show?' asked Mr Coulter . 'She appeared live on the show discussing a subject which is not desperately important to this case but no doubt it caused some local interest in Newent to all who knew her. Did you watch the show?' Ms Steers said she did. 'It was when you mentioned that that things became heated between you I suggest?' said Mr Coulter. 'Do you remember?' Ms Steers said 'No.' The trial continues.

The young couple, who have not been seen since August 21, are believed to be travelling around the country together. Officers have appealed for the couple or anyone who sees them to contact police. Nicola Barr, 15, has disappeared and is believed to be with her boyfriend Jamie Bloomfield, 18 . Detectives were keen to stress they were not treating this as an abduction or exploitation scenario. It is thought that the pair could be in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Stoke on Trent in Staffordshire or Rochdale, Greater Manchester, since going missing. Nicola was last seen at her home at 7am on August 21. She was reported missing to police when she failed to return home at the agreed time. Missing: The pair have not been seen for nearly a week and police appealed for help in tracing them. Nicola is from Caversham, near Reading, Berkshire, and Jamie is from Rochdale, Greater Manchester . Nicola is described as white, 5ft 6ins, slim, with red hair and hazel-coloured eyes. It was previously thought she was wearing a black baseball cap with Heat written on the front, however this has since been found so it is not known what she is wearing. Police believe that she is with her boyfriend, Jamie Bloomfield, who lives 220 miles away from the teenager in Rochdale. Detective Constable Paul Jacobs said: 'We are very keen to trace both Nicola and Jamie, who we believe are together and maybe travelling around the country. 'They may have possibly been in Leamington Spa, Stoke on Trent and the Rochdale area since going missing. 'They have now been missing since Wednesday and we need to trace them to check they are okay as soon as possible. 'There is nothing to suggest Nicola has been removed from her home against her will and we are not treating this as an abduction or exploitation scenario. 'I would urge anyone who sees Nicola and Jamie anywhere in the country to contact us as soon as possible. 'I would also like to appeal directly to both Nicola and Jamie. You are not in any trouble, we are trying to trace you to check your welfare, not to take any action against you.

Bosses at Foxtons are expected to make around £100million after announcing plans to float the company on the stock exchange yesterday. It is the second time in six years that the estate agency, famous for its aggressive sales tactics, has given its top team a cash bonanza. In 2007 founder Jon Hunt sold Foxtons for £360million at the top of the market to private equity firm BC Partners. Pushy estate agent: Foxtons is likely to come to market with a value of between £400million to £500million and has appointed three investment banks to float the business . Back then the business was saddled with £260million worth of debt that it found itself unable to pay back. When . the bottom fell out of the housing market at the height of the downturn . its banks – Bank of America and Mizuho – stepped in and took control of . the firm. Well-known sight: Foxtons is famous for its fleet of 1,000 branded Mini Coopers and aggressive sales tactics . The private . equity bosses, who had been made to look foolish by the poor timing of . their investment, were said to have internally referred to the business . as the ‘F-word’. Property mogul: In 2007 founder Jon Hunt sold the business for £360million at the top of the market . However BC . Partners, which also controls mobile retailer Phones 4u, managed to . retain a stake in Foxtons after investing a further £50million. It . then decided to buy the business back from the banks last year after . the company’s performance improved on the back of the recovery in the . housing market. This time . the chain is likely to come to the stock market with a value of between . £400million to £500million. And the management team, led by chief . executive Michael Brown, will share around £100million for the 20 per . cent stake they have accumulated. After . a shaky start Foxtons, which has 40 offices in London and two in . Surrey, has been starting to show signs of a better performance in . recent months. Much of the . boost in trading is due to the strong property market in London and . Government schemes to kick-start house purchases – such as Funding for . Lending and the first phase of Help to Buy. But over the years the aggressive tactics used by the firm’s estate agents have come in for criticism. A 2003 report by the Office of Fair Trading heaped criticism on Foxtons for its underhand tactics. For real? A report heaped criticism on Foxtons for removing For Sale signs of rival firms outside houses. Its staff replaced them with Foxtons signs even though they did not represent the house (file picture) Foxtons has come under fire for some of its practices over the past decade. The Office of Fair Trading won a case against the company in July 2009, when a judge agreed that its terms - which forced landlords to continue paying commission even if the agent was no longer involved in letting or managing a property - were a ‘trap’. The OFT later said in July 2011 that it had saved people who rented out flats and homes through Foxtons at least £4.4million after forcing the estate agent to change its terms. And in June 2003 the estate agent admitted it had ordered workers to take down For Sale boards belonging to rivals ‘for a limited period in 2001’, including those placed legitimately. These included removing For Sale signs of any rival firms outside . houses and getting staff to replace them with Foxtons signs – even . though the house was not represented by the estate agent. Mr Hunt, who founded the company in a former pasta restaurant in London’s Notting Hill, is no longer connected to the business. Since . leaving the firm he has managed to almost triple the cash he received . for the sale by investing in property – leaving him with an estimated . fortune of £925million. The . multi-millionaire has spent some of the money on his mansion in . Kensington Palace Gardens, which has an underground museum specially . designed to house his collection of vintage Ferraris. A spokesman for Foxtons refused to comment on the flotation.","Known for 1,000 branded Mini Coopers and aggressive sales tactics .

The cost of sending a child to school has spiralled 27 per cent this year after a sharp rise in the price of uniforms and an increased demand for high-tech equipment. Parents will be forced to spend an average of £224 compared with £177 in 2012 according to research by Santander credit cards. And the cost of daily essentials such as lunch, bus fares and school trips has also risen - by 13 per cent to £44. Earn to learn: The cost of sending a child to school has rocketed by 27% to £224 since 2012 . The cost of the basic necessities - uniform, sports gear, books, stationery and technology - was found to be £210.31 for children at community schools pay. For children at Grammar schools the figure rose to £284.40, those at academies cost £242.59 and foundation or trust school pupils cost £276.20, the Daily Mirror reports. One reason why the costs has risen so dramatically is that more children are wanting to take high-tech equipment such as iPads and other electronic equipment into class. A recent study found that a typical schoolchild will carry a staggering £450 worth of stationary, books and gadgets in their bag. Many youngsters are now using expensive high-tech equipment such as iPads in class . A typical satchel costing £19.70 now contains a smartphone worth £362.10s and school books valued at £40.80. Parents also fork out £7.60 on food and drink, including a lunchbox, and spend £14 on stationary. The research shows children carry a pair of headphones in their rucksack as well, worth £5.80.And parents spend £100.80 pounds on their children's school uniform - bringing the total to a mighty £550.80. Matt Leeser, head of buying for communications technology at John Lewis, said: 'The good old fashioned exercise book and pencils have made it into the top 3 must-have school bag items for the last 50 years. 'But there's no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and classroom. 'Technology is evolving at such a rate that we predict in another 10 years' time the top 10 school bag list will be unrecognisable as today's digital natives grow up and become parents themselves. 'In the run up to back-to-school we're predicting we'll sell a computing device every two minutes during the two weeks over Bank Holiday.' On a national level the Britons now spend £2.3billion kitting their children out for class with an additional £447 million paid out for transport, food and outings. Department store John Lewis said children were more likely to want a tablet or e-reader than a geometry set. It was expecting to sell a hi-tech device like an iPad every two minutes over the Bank Holiday. Spokesman Matt Leeser said: 'There’s no shying away from the fact that technology is making its way into the school bag and the classroom.'","Parents must spend average of £224 compared with £177 in 2012 .

A fearless mother and daughter used a pair of salad tongs to capture an escaped red-eyed snake they spotted slithering along their garden wall. Bridie Denniss, 24, was enjoying a cup of tea in her kitchen with her mum Ann when she looked out of the window and saw the 3ft long snake. Brave Ann, 54, grabbed a pair of tongs from the kitchen draw along with a garden sack and went after it. Feisty: A fearless mother and daughter, from Weymouth, Dorset, captured an angry Californian King snake with a pair of salad tongs after finding it on the loose in their garden . The rancorous reptile started hissing, rattling its tail and even tried to bite them - but after a short struggle the plucky pair got the tongs around it and bundled it into the sack. It was then placed in a glass tank they used to used to keep geckos in. After checking with neighbours and asking friends on Facebook to see if anyone had lost a pet snake, Bridie contacted a pet shop and a member of staff came to collect it. The reptile was identified as an . albino California King Snake, which are common as pets but are known for . their feisty temperament. Bridie, . a mother of three from Weymouth in Dorset, said: 'We were having a cup . of tea as we do every morning and were sitting in my kitchen when I . looked out of the window. 'I could see something crawling along the wall and I told my mum it looked like a snake. 'When . she agreed we looked at each other for a second in disbelief and went . outside, we thought we had better catch it because it must belong to . someone. The angry snake tried to bite Bridie (left) and her mother Ann Denniss (right) but the defiant pair eventually grabbed it with the salad tongs and put it in the bin bag . 'She went inside and came back with a sack and a pair of salad tongs and I tried to scoop it up but it fell on the floor. 'My mum was running around saying ""just grab it"" but it started hissing, rattling its tail, and tried to go for my hand. Luckily I was wearing a garden glove. 'My children were screaming every time it did something. 'Eventually I managed to get it inside the bag and place it inside a vivarium I had at home, and we asked the neighbours if it was their pet snake. 'It wasn’t theirs so I put it on Facebook and contacted a pet shop, and a member of staff came along and collected it.' Pet shop manager Chris Hewlett said: 'It is an albino California King Snake. They are quite a common pet snake.' The snake will be looked after by the pet shop until its owner is found. California king snakes are non-venomous reptiles, commonly found in western United States and northern Mexico. It is also found in the wild in Gran Canaria, Spain, due to captive animals having been released on the island. California king snakes are smaller relatives of the common king snake and are one of the most popular species to be kept as pets. They are powerful constrictors and feed upon rodents, other reptiles, birds and amphibians. They are even known to hunt and kill other snakes, including venomous rattle snakes, which is why they are named 'King' snakes. They are largely impervious to the rattlesnake's venom, but not completely. Both species live in similar habitats, side by side; the King snake will only eat a rattle snake when the opportunity arises. King snakes are considered harmless to humans but if handled they often bite and females can excrete a nasty musk and faecal contents. The King snake is one of the most popular in captivity since it is easy to care for and can also be tamed. They can now be found in many different colours and patterns due to breeding.","Mother and daughter Ann and Bridie Denniss, spotted the 3ft long snake in the garden .

The culling of badgers in the countryside to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis has begun, the National Farmers' Union said this morning. Militant hunt saboteurs have vowed to disrupt the cull by infiltrating animal rights groups planning peaceful protests. Police have increased patrols in the countryside fearing violent clashes between farmers and hardcore opponents following the start of the cull. The Environment Secretary today insisted that the cull was necessary for the health of badgers as well as livestock, saying that he was concerned for the animals' welfare as he used to have pet badgers - but added that it could take 25 years before the work of the cull is completed . Outrage: A protester expresses her opposition to the badger cull at a vigil in Minehead, Somerset . Plans: Protesters crowd around a map as they embark on a walk around the proposed cull zone . In a letter to farmers today, NFU . president Peter Kendall revealed that culling had already begun in west . Gloucestershire and west Somerset. He . said that the move, which will see around 5,000 badgers killed over the . next six weeks in two pilot schemes, was 'an important step not just . for cattle farmers but for the whole farming industry'. He . continued: 'We cannot go on culling tens of thousands of cattle every . year because of TB while knowing the disease exists in wildlife . uncontrolled. 'Badger . control remains a controversial subject and we understand that some . people will never agree with controlling badgers in this way. 'I . am confident however that through the combined efforts of farmers, the . NFU and government over the last year to illustrate the impact TB has on . farms, and the scientific basis for badger control, more people than . ever recognise the need to address the disease in badgers.' Arrest: Protester Jay Tiernan is arrested while trying to gain access to a Defra compound in Gloucestershire . More than 500 protesters are expected . at the sites of the cull, with even some of those planning to . demonstrate peacefully saying they are prepared to run from footpaths . into the line of fire of the farmers culling the badgers to force them . to put down their arms. But . Mr Kendall insisted: 'I hope that when time shows that these culls have . reduced TB in cattle - just as has happened in Ireland - that even more . people will understand that while sad, these culls are absolutely . necessary. 'I hope that you . will continue to show support for those farmers who are facing the . nightmare of TB on farm and especially for those who are in the culling . areas.' The cull is an attempt to tackle bovine . TB which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 . cattle in the UK over the past decade. 'I've . actually had pet badgers as a child, and I want to see healthy . badgers,' Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told Sky News. 'If . we had a workable vaccine, we would use it. A badger vaccine would have . no effect on the high proportion of sick badgers in TB hotspots who . would continue to spread the disease. 'We . are working on new badger and cattle vaccines but they are years away . from being ready and we cannot afford to wait while TB gets worse.' Protest: A vigil was held in Minehead, Somerset last night to demonstrate against the badger cull . Vigil: Somerset Badger Patrol claimed that more than 200 people attended the event hours before the start of the cull . He added: 'The intention is to roll out this policy in other areas next year subject to these two culls proving effective, efficient and humane. My target is that the UK should be TB free in 25 years. 'We know that, despite the strict controls we already have in place, we won't get on top of this terrible disease until we start dealing with the infection in badgers as well as in cattle. That's the clear lesson from Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and the USA. 'That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly.' Labour claimed the coalition had cut spending and research on vaccines for badgers and cattle, and said the Environment Department's official assessment of the pilot culls had revealed it would cost £4million to police the two schemes. Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh said: 'The Government's divisive badger cull will cost more than it saves and will spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers are disturbed by shooting. 'We need a science-led policy to manage cattle movements better and a vaccine to tackle TB in cattle. Ministers should listen to the scientists and drop this cull which is bad for farmers, bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife.' March: Animal rights activists paraded in the area where the cull was due to take place in a last-minute protest . Anger: Passionate protesters have vowed to block the cull from going ahead this week . Police have said militant campaigners . have infiltrated local campsites and have been spotted patrolling . farmers’ fields wearing balaclavas at night. One group, Bristol Hunt . Saboteurs, said it would trespass on to sites with large horns to scare . the badgers away and remove bait left by farmers. Last night Somerset Badger Patrol held a vigil event in Minehead against the cull. A . statement on its Facebook page after the event said: 'Over 200 people . tonight at the procession, thank you all so much for coming... We fight . on, knowing that we are right helps.' It comes as a protester, named as Jay Tiernan, was arrested yesterday . for allegedly trying to break in to a Department for Environment, Food . and Rural Affairs site in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Joe . Mossman, of Bristol Hunt Saboteurs, said ‘extensive research’ had been . carried out to find out where the badgers’ setts are and where peanut . bait had been laid by farmers. He . added: ‘The intention is to just turn up in large numbers, making lots . of noise, getting in the way and having a massive presence. We will try . to locate the shooters, which will involve trespass if necessary. Protest: The sign yesterday outside an anti-cull camp near Watchet in Somerset . Controlling disease: 5,000 badgers could be killed in two trials culls . ‘Spoiling bait is one of the  most effective ways you can sabotage the cull, because if the bait’s not there the badgers won’t be drawn away.’ Dozens of people have also set up a camp, dubbed Camp Badger, on the outskirts of the sleepy harbour town of Watchet, Somerset. Mostly members of campaign group Stop The Cull, they intend to carry out nocturnal patrols looking to document evidence of wounded badgers. Protest: Animal rights groups say badgers should be vaccinated instead of culled . Carla Kidd, 39, a gardener from Penzance, Cornwall, said: ‘If it came down to it and I was in the killing zone, then yes, I would run in front to try and stop the shooting. That would be my natural reaction.‘It’s your natural instinct to protect an animal as if it was a pet or your own child.' 'Our intention is to carry out peaceful protest while on patrol at night and stick to the footpaths, but I couldn’t say that I’d stick to that if I saw culling. Our main task is about raising awareness.’ Miss Kidd added that protest groups had been buoyed by recent anti-fracking protests in Balcombe, West Sussex, when hundreds of activists were able to stop exploratory drilling temporarily. The past 15 years has seen a boom in bovine TB which is spread to cattle when badgers urinate on grass which is eaten by cows. The trial scheme is due to continue every year for the next four years, and is predicted to cut bovine TB by 16 per cent. Two . companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling in the . counties, but both Defra and Natural England, the public body . responsible for the operation, have kept their identities a secret in . case activists target them directly. Last . week the National Farmers Union was granted an injunction in the High . Court barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers’ homes, . business premises and cull sites. Animal . rights groups, which include support from guitarist Brian May and . actress Dame Judi Dench, say the authorities should vaccinate badgers . instead.","Badger culls have now started in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset .

On the up: Former GMTV presenter Esther McVey at the height of her TV fame in 2001, left, looks set for a Cabinet promotion just three years after we was elected as a Tory MP on Merseyside . But sources inside Downing Street have admitted she is likely to be promoted because No 10 'love putting a northern woman up on television to speak for the government', the Daily Telegraph reported today, . Meanwhile it has also emerged that the son of Iraqi refugees is also to get a top job from the Prime Minister. Born in Baghdad to Kurdish parents who fled to Britain, Nadhim Zahawi, Tory MP for Stratford-on-Avon, made his fortune co-founding pollster YouGov. Success: Ms McVey has flown up the ranks since becoming an MP in 2010, and is now Minister for the Disabled with another promotion likely to follow . Change of scene: Esther McVey on the GMTV couch where she made her name as a broadcaster . Both he and Ms McVey are seen as good with the media and comfortable attacking Labour and defending the government. Promotion? Nadhim Zahawi, Tory MP for Stratford-on-Avon, is seen as a safe pair of hands by David Cameron (pictured together) Last month the Prime Minister gave his strongest hint yet that his shake-up of ministers expected shortly will dramatically increase the number of women at the top table. Three years into the coalition, he insisted he now has a ‘much bigger talent pool’ to draw on to fulfil his promise that a third of jobs would go to women. Childcare minister Liz Truss is tipped for promotion to the Cabinet as is Health Minister Anna Soubry, who was also a former TV presenter. Only four women are full members of the Cabinet – Home Secretary Theresa May, Culture Secretary Maria Miller, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and International Development Secretary Justine Greening. Baroness Warsi, senior foreign office minister, also attends Cabinet. Mr Cameron revealed he would use the opportunity to fast track women elected in 2010 to the upper levels of government. He said: ‘What I’ve done is consistently try to change the Conservative party. We went from 17 Conservative women MPs before the 2010 election to 48 women MPs. ‘That’s still not enough out of just over 300, but it’s progress.’ Mr Cameron has faced criticism for his . failure to promote women in the past, amid claims he left two female . Cabinet ministers in tears when he sacked them in last September’s . reshuffle.

Cash-strapped Croydon has been named as the place in Britain where people are the most likely to worry over their spiralling levels of debt. People in the south London suburb fret more about paying off loans and mortgages than anywhere else in the UK, according to a survey of 40,000 people by debt management firm PayPlan. Nearby Redhill in Surrey is also in the top ten, as is Taunton in Somerset and Brighton in Sussex. The Midlands features heavily, with Coventry, Nottingham, the Nottinghamshire town of Arnold, Nuneaton in Warwickshire, Margaret thatcher's birthplace of Grantham, Lincolnshire, and Northampton all appearing on the list. Debt fear capital: Residents of Croydon are the biggest worriers about loans and mortgages in the UK . Jason Eaves, Payplan Director, said: 'We know that on average only one in six people with debt problems will seek help. 'Often these people feel isolated and alone and don’t know where to turn. What this map clearly shows is the scale of the problem throughout the UK.' The research also found that the average debt level of people calling PayPlan is £83,465 – that adds up to over £3.4billion worth of debt. 'Right now we are being told that the . economy is “out of intensive care” but there are still a few years ahead . where people will continue to struggle financially,' Mr Eaves added. Grantham in Lincolnshire, the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, also features on the debt-worry top ten . He added: 'Many families have seen their budgets squeezed. Some parts of the country are in recovery while other parts are still in decline, but even in more affluent areas if wage increases have not matched the rising cost of living then debt is still a problem. 'Many people are struggling to make ends meet, so if mortgage rates rise and gas and electricity prices increase it will push many more people into problem debt.' Although there are signs of growth in . the UK economy - Britain’s economic output expanded by 0.9 per cent in . the first six months of the year - the situation for many ordinary working families remains bleak. The problems facing families have been fuelled by a toxic combination of poor pay rises or pay freezes and rising household bills. Many have been forced to borrow to meet the rise in the cost of living. The Office for National Statistics said recently the average annual increase for the whole of the last decade was just 1.3 per cent, the lowest figure since records began in 1948. At this level, the average household’s spending money is rising at less than half the current rate of inflation, currently 2.8 per cent. Household bills from the cost of keeping their home warm to the bill for filling up their car with petrol are going up, but families have little or no extra cash to cover the cost. Meanwhile, a report from the National Children's Bureau found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with just two million in the late 1960s. Although house prices are slowly rising once more, property experts say it could take until 2021 to return to their pre-recession peak. House prices have fallen by around 18 per cent in real terms  - but only three per cent in cash terms - since their peak in the summer of 2007.

Fighting back: Wylie the rescued dog from Afghanistan is preparing to compete at Scruffts with his new owner Sarah Singleton . He was a fighting-dog who endured brutal beatings, had his ears and tail severed and was left for dead on the streets of Afghanistan. But now the only adversaries Wylie has to worry about are the other crossbreeds at Crufts. The four-year-old mongrel was rescued from his ordeal in Kandahar by British soldiers – and has battled through to the final qualification round of the dog show. Fittingly, it is to be held on Remembrance weekend in central London. Whatever the outcome of the ‘Scruffts’ section of the Kennel Club competition – for ‘crossbreed dogs of mixed blood’ – there will be no other dog with a story to match Wylie’s. ‘It is an extraordinary life and journey,’ said Sarah Singleton, Wylie’s owner – a life made possible by the charity founded by former Marine Commando Pen Farthing that rescues dogs befriended by servicemen and aid workers in Afghanistan before reuniting them back home. So far Nowzad, based on the outskirts of the Afghan capital Kabul, has sent more than 550 dogs to new lives. By the time Wylie reached the clinic, he had already cheated death repeatedly. A convoy of British soldiers on patrol in Kandahar had gone to his aid in February 2011 when a crowd watching a dog-fight were beating Wylie with lumps of wood. Back at base, Wylie was patched up by an Australian woman soldier, who feared he would not last the night. Astonishingly, he did but days later was back after dog-fighters had hacked off his ears, before cutting his muzzle open. He was again patched up only to return with new injuries that included a stab wound to the chest and a severed tail. Brutalised: Wylie when he was rescued in Kandahar . After thugs threw him under a car the Australian soldier began planning to take him home. Nowzad has launched an urgent appeal to help fund a new clinic in Kabul after being forced to leave its present secure premises. Founder Pen Farthing warns the failure to secure sufficient funds threatens its existence. More than 550 dogs have so far passed through Nowzad’s kennels, with the charity arranging chipping and the taking of blood samples – which are then sent to the British authorities – followed by four months’ quarantine for the UK, 30 days for the US. To donate go to www.justgiving.com/NowzadClinicAppeal. Like many soldiers who befriended dogs during Afghan tours of duty, she knew of the work of Nowzad, which had been set up by Farthing, then a Marine Sergeant, after he broke up a dog fight in the Helmand town of Now Zad in 2006 and adopted one of the dogs . Within months, the charity was formed. ‘The relationships built up between a dog and soldier on bases can be very special,’ Sgt Farthing, 43, from Exeter, said. ‘A dog can ease the stress and provide five minutes of normality that is hugely important in that kind of environment.’ Wylie was treated by Nowzad vets before being placed in kennels in the West Country during his quarantine. But he was refused entry to Australia. One of his regular visitors was Sarah, 35, from Yeovil, Somerset. She says quickly a ‘love affair with a lovely dog’ began. As a way of highlighting the work of Nowzad, Sarah decided to enter Wylie for Scruffts – and to her delight he has reached the ‘semi-final’ on Remembrance Day. ‘It would be so wonderful, so fitting, if he was to win on that day,’ she said.","Mongrel rescued from the streets of Afghanistan to compete in Crufts .

One respondent said: 'I saw a picture of Michelle Keegan without make-up and she looked stunning. 'To be honest I actually think she looks better without it, she was dressed down in a jumper and joggers but she still looked amazing.' Another woman said: 'I think Jennifer Aniston is absolutely flawless without make up, she has hardly aged since being in Friends and if I look that good at 44 then I definitely won’t be complaining.' A spokesperson for PromotionalCodes.org.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'All the women voted for in the top ten are beautiful without make up and absolutely deserve to be there. 'It’s nice to see celebrities looking natural now and then just so we can remind ourselves they are actually human too, it’s also a great thing for the younger generation to see so they can understand make-up isn’t always necessary.' First, there was the selfie.Then, just as we all learned how to keep outstretched arms out of the shot, the healthie - where celebrities shared snaps of themselves exercising - became the latest slightly smug trend favoured by the famous. Now comes the turn of the barefaced selfie, with stars from Rihanna to Kerry Katona and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley choosing to broadcast what they look like without their slap. However, while some of them genuinely look like us post-workout or early in the morning (thank you Fern Britton), the majority of those choosing to post bare-faced snaps just seem to be, well, showing off. Rihanna manages to combine a bare-faced selfie with a shot of her amazing body . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley demonstrates the typical slap-free selfie, complete with doe eyes and soft lighting . Cara kisses a friend with her trademark brows more prominent than ever against her perfectly (make-up free) smooth skin . Taken with soft lighting and a kind filter, the bare-faced selfie generally involves a wide-eyed expression - and usually makes clear somewhere that the subject is make-up free, just in case you missed it. Holly Willoughby caused something of a media storm when she posted a picture of herself with no slap on last year – with many saying that the perfect image she projected put unfair pressure on normal women. The Mail’s own Liz Jones weighed in saying: ‘Not admitting all the effort that goes into looking so radiant and ‘bare-faced’, not showing us the join, as it were, is tantamount to denying you have had a facelift, wear Spanx, or have a personal trainer. ‘We all need help, don’t we? To deny this is to denounce womanhood itself. It is arrogant, over-confident one-upmanship.’ Kelly Brook casually drapes herself over the back of a boat - note makeup-free yet dewy complexion . Kim Kardashian famously loves her selfies - and the make-up loving star has even posted a few bare-faced snaps . Model Adriana Lima reminds us how hard she works out to maintain her perfect figure - and still manages to look beautiful when sweaty and red-faced . Kylie Jenner is probably too young and fresh faced to need this bleached-out lighting . However, the negative reaction has done little to stem the tide of barefaced selfies and it is hard to find a celebrity nowadays who hasn't posted one to prove their good looks remain once cosmetics have been stripped away. These celebrities have either won the genetic lottery or employed the softest of lighting - but a few have actually had the courage to post pictures where they look less than perfect. Fern Britton, Kerry Katona and Fearne Cotton have all bravely shared their red blotches, dark circles and un-perfect pores with us, to prove that you can still be beautiful - even with your flaws on display to the world.

Restaurant customers tip more generously if the bill arrives in a heart-shaped dish, a new study has found. Psychologists believe the symbolic shape generates feelings of love and compassion, which leads people to act more altruistically. They said restaurant managers would be well-advised to use heart-shaped dishes as this could have benefits for both staff and customers. Psychologists believe the symbolic shape generates feelings of love and compassion, which leads people to act more altruistically . The findings come from a study that compared tipping behaviour when customers were served the bill in either a round, square, or heart-shaped dish. Lead author Professor Nicolas Gueguen, of the University of South Brittany, in France, said: ‘Customers gave tips more often to a waitress when the bill was placed in a dish with a cardioid (heart) shape and, when they did, they gave her a larger amount of money. The heart shape has been used to express the idea that the heart is a person's centre of emotion and love for hundreds of years. There are many theories as to how the symbol came about - some experts believe it is reminiscent of a person's lips or a female's genitalia. Others, however, believe it took its original form from plants, more specifically the ivy leaf. The symbol was first used in the Middle Ages but it was not widely recognised until the 16th century. The 'scalloped' shape of the now-familiar heart symbol, with a dent in its base, first arose in the early 14th century, at first only slightly dented. The red colour symbolises blood, passion and strong emotion. ‘This effect was found for both male and female patrons. ‘We can conclude that inducing love by the symbolic shape associated with this concept (the heart) is a strong technique to enhance people’s altruistic behaviour.’ The study, published online in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology, involved 365 customers and five waitresses working in three seafood restaurants in France. Customers sat alone at a table to eat and the waitresses were told to always act in the same way and to serve the bill with the same words in a dish with two sweets. The dishes were all red, of similar size and made by the same company, so all that changed was the shape. Professor Gueguen found no difference in tipping behaviour in relation to the different waitresses and different restaurants. But nearly half of people - 46 per . cent - who got their bill in a heart-shaped dish tipped, compared to 31 . per cent who got a round dish, and 26 per cent who got a square dish. Restaurant customers tip more generously if the bill arrives in a heart-shaped dish, a new study has found . Tips left in a heart-shaped dish were 1.38 euros on average, compared to 1.19 euros in a round dish and 1.17 euros in a square dish. The difference was seen despite the fact that tipping in France is not expected because a 12 per cent service charge is added to prices listed on a menu. ‘Managers, then, should encourage these methods, in so far as they may create a greater state of fulfilment in the workplace for the employees,’ the authors concluded. ‘Furthermore, these methods may, in turn, result in much more contentment and satisfaction for the customer, thus encouraging the customer to come back or to recommend the restaurant.’","Experts at the University of South Brittany found the symbol generated feelings of love which led people to becoming more generous .

With just a small amount of basic information taken from a person's email account, researchers in the U.S are able to create a 'constellation' of your friends and family that maps your closest relationships and how they all intertwine. The project, called Immersion, has been designed as a way of visualising the data held in a person's Gmail or Exchange account and even shows you which of your friends are at the centre of your electronic universe based on how often you contact them. Each contact is represented as a node that changes size depending on how many emails have been sent to and from them, and node colours are determined by what group the contact has been put into, such as friends, family or colleagues. Researchers at MIT have created a project called Immersion that takes basic metadata from emails including the names of people messages have been sent to and from, into an interactive display that also shows how contacts are connected. The size of the nodes are determined by the amount of correspondence . Clicking a contact creates a graph, pictured, that shows exactly how many messages have been exchanged with the account owner . Any contacts that know each other are then connected by lines and this is detemined by whether they have ever been included on the same email thread, for example. Clicking a contact creates a graph that shows exactly how many messages have been exchanged between the account owner and that person. It also highlights when the first email to that person was sent, as well as the most recent. Once a user logs in and grants Immersion access to their email account, the project gathers the metadata from the From, To, Cc and Timestamp fields of any emails in that account - even emails that have been deleted. It does not access the subject or the body content of the emails. Immersion uses a technology called OAuth to authorise users through a Google website. According to the site, the email address and passwords used to log in to Immersion are not shared and are only seen by Google. Immersion will only scan a total of 300,000 emails per user and a contact only appears if a minimum of three emails have been sent to or from that person. By default, the display shows the top one hundred contacts but users can increase or decrease this number. Another slider lets users change the timeframe included in the display, from the past week, the past year or of all time . This means it can filter out newsletters, social network notifications, spam and junk, for example. By default, the display shows the top one hundred contacts, although sliders on the left let users increase or decrease this number. A slider along the bottom of the screen additionally lets users change the timeframe from the past week, the past year or from all time. If a person has multiple email addresses, Immersion will also attempt to link them together and clicking on a contact shows all associated addresses. 'When you see it all together, it is, in a way, an out-of-body experience,' the creators told the Boston Globe. 'You're seeing all of your network and you're seeing yourself out of it and you're seeing it from afar and you're seeing it in one picture.'","Immersion uses basic contact and email history from Gmail accounts .

Gareth Stephenson’s son, Noah, one, contracted meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia in March, when he was just eight-months-old, and had to spend six weeks in hospital fighting for his life. The disease caused the lower part of his left leg to die meaning that it had to be amputated. Noah Stephenson contracted meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia in March, when he was just eight-months-old, and had to spend six weeks in hospital fighting for his life . Noah, from Cardiff, also lost the ends of all of his fingers and some of his toes. His parents realised that there was something wrong when he became lethargic and lost his appetite. As this is not unusual for a baby, they were not overly concerned. However, later that day his lethargy increased and he stopped reacting to his parents entirely. As a result, they rushed him to the local hospital where a doctor thought he might have bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection. He was not entirely sure of the diagnosis so suggested that Noah be taken to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Noah (pictured with his parents, Nicki and Gareth, and his brother, Zak) lost the lower part of his left leg, the tips of all of his fingers and some of the toes on his remaining foot . Noah's parents realised that there was something wrong when he became lethargic and went off his food. He deteriorated rapidly and soon became unresponsive and developed breathing difficulties . When he arrived, he started to deteriorate rapidly. Mr Stephenson said: ‘Noah was struggling for breath and his heart rate and blood pressure were low. ‘He started getting a few spots around his eyes and mouth and luckily for us the doctors could see his symptoms developing and they quickly suspected meningitis and acted accordingly. ‘He was put on numerous drips, and was sedated with help from a ventilator machine to regulate his breathing. Noah was rushed to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, where doctors diagnosed his meningitis and put him on a ventilator to regulate his breathing . ‘Very quickly it became apparent that he was losing and leaking fluid internally, so they were forced to replace the liquids very quickly.’ Within a few hours, Noah’s body had swelled up and he was fighting for his life. His parents were told that he might not survive the night. Mr Stephenson said: ‘We were told to prepare for the worst but to take things minute by minute. At the hospital, Noah's parents were told to prepare themselves for the worst. As the disease took hold, he lost the circulation to his extremities which meant his lower leg and the tips of his fingers died . ‘What was easily the most horrific and scariest few hours of mine, and my family’s, life, then turned into a waiting game as we couldn't see Noah as the medical staff were working furiously to keep him alive.’ As Noah’s body fought the disease, he lost circulation to his hands and feet and they quickly turned black. Doctors made three cuts along his lower left leg in an attempt to ease the pressure, and to try and restore the circulation. Noah's left leg was amputated below the knee and the tips of his fingers and toes fell off without surgery. His parents say that he started to crawl again very quickly after leaving hospital . Despite this effort, it was soon clear that his lower left leg was dead tissue and that it was only acting as another hindrance to him as he battled for his life. As a result, the decision was made to amputate Noah’s lower left leg below the knee. Mr Stephenson said: ’After the amputation, Noah started improving day by day, but the tips of his fingers and toes remained black and dead. Over the next few weeks, he stayed in hospital improving all the while. ‘After ten days he was brought out of sedation and, after what seemed like an eternity, our little boy woke up. Noah's father, Gareth Stephenson said: 'I can only say the whole experience was surreal, horrifying and extremely concerning.' Noah is pictured with his brother, Zak . ‘His fingertips and toes gradually settled at being black, shrivelled and dead and we were informed they would probably fall away over time - it was just a hope for him to get as much back of them as possible.’ Noah finally left hospital after six weeks and returned home to recover. His father said: ‘Noah started crawling again very quickly, and once his fingers tips had fallen away he started using his hands like nothing had ever happened - like he wasn't missing parts of them. ‘In total he lost his lower left leg, the tips of all his fingers in varying degrees and half of his remaining toes - except the big one on which he just lost the nail.’ Mr Stephenson said: 'I knew about the effects of meningitis beforehand from what I'd seen on the news, but I never thought something so cruel could happen so indiscriminately to an innocent, beautiful child' Mr Stephenson added: ‘I can only say the whole experience was surreal, horrifying and extremely concerning. ‘The thought of losing our baby was inconceivable and thankfully we got most of him back to where he should be, home. ‘I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. I knew about the effects of meningitis beforehand from what I’d seen on the news, but I never thought something so cruel could happen so indiscriminately to an innocent, beautiful child.’ ‘I can never ever thank the medical staff who treated and saved Noah’s life enough, I owe them everything.’ Noah is now learning to walk with a prosthetic leg (pictured). His parents hope he will be able to walk down the aisle as a page boy at his uncle's wedding next year . Mr and Mrs Stephenson have just secured Noah his first prosthetic leg and say that within 15 minutes of having it fitted, he stood up on it for the first time. They are raising money to pay for the specialist prosthetic leg that he will need in the future. They hope that he will now learn to walk so that he can be a page boy at his uncle’s wedding next year. To donate, visit www.gofundme.com/2iyhc8 .

NHS officials have been criticised for letting promotions company Bounty have access to women hours after giving birth . NHS officials have been attacked for letting sales people have access to new mothers just hours after they have given birth. Some parents are approached by promotion company workers while they are still on postnatal wards, a GP has warned. Glasgow-based GP Dr Margaret McCartney questioned whether it was 'desirable' for representatives from promotions company Bounty to be allowed on wards. In an editorial, published on bmj.com, . Dr McCartney writes that Bounty profits by selling parents’ details to . other companies. But she said the hours after birth are 'hardly an . optimal time' to obtain consent for giving out data. Parenting charity NCT said it was angry about the way some NHS organisations let Bounty access new mothers. 'Within . hours of giving birth, they are being asked questions - their name and . address, details of life insurance - and they give them in good faith, . thinking they’re speaking to a hospital person,' said charity chief . executive Belinda Phipps. 'In . fact it’s a commercial person. The NHS is condoning a sales team . collecting data from mothers in order to sell their name on to . commercial interests.' When parents fill out their contact . details, the form states that: 'by providing your email address and/or . telephone number you agree to be contacted by these channels as well as . post.' But Ms Phipps said that many parents have told her that they did not understand what they were signing up to. Dr . McCartney said commercial advertisers are also getting access to new . parents through 'baby bags', which contain sample products as well as a . dozen flyers, which are given out by Bounty. She writes that some 2.6million Bounty . bags are given to new mothers and fathers every year. Some are . distributed through Bounty representatives on wards and others are . handed out by NHS workers. GP Margaret McCartney said the hours after birth are 'hardly an optimal time' for mothers to provide data . The packs have an 'air of officialdom' because they also contain application forms for child benefit, she said. The article states that HM Revenue and . Customs pays £90,000 a year to Bounty to distribute the forms - even . though they are available online. 'So families supply their details, which can be sold on by a commercial company, which in turn is paid by the Government to supply freely available child benefit claim forms,' writes Dr McCartney. A spokesman for Bounty told the BMJ: 'Over a decade ago Bounty offered to conduct a small scale pilot which satisfied HMRC that Bounty could distribute child benefit forms directly and quickly into the hands of parents as soon as they need them.' He added that a poll of 4,000 parents earlier this year found that 90 per cent said they were 'satisfied' with the packs. A HMRC spokesman added: 'We are committed to keeping our costs as low as possible. Bounty distributed 82 per cent of all child benefit claim forms in 2012, averaging around 10p for each claim. If HMRC posted the forms individually the cost would rise to 33p for each claim making this option much cheaper and more direct than the alternative.' In her article, Dr McCartney says that the NHS, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP), Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), and Government have 'embedded commercial advertising into routine contact with pregnant women during antenatal and postnatal care'. Some 2.6million Bounty bags are given to new parents ever year and some are handed out by NHS workers . She raises concerns that pregnant women are handed out a free booklet called Emma’s Diary from their GPs, which has got an RCGP stamp of approval, which contains 25 pages of medical information and 119 pages of advertising. The RCGP told the BMJ that: 'All content is quality assured by our RCGP editorial board who do a sterling job in ensuring that it is updated to reflect any changes to medical working practices, latest research findings [and] government guidelines.' Dr McCartney also questioned a marketing sales pitch from a publishing company, purporting to be selling 'advertorial' for RCOG’s magazine Baby and You. Mark Green, managing director of crib company Bednest, told the BMJ that a sales person tried to sell him advertising space for a 'guaranteed minimum' audience of 500,000 mothers and parents through 'their obstetrician/midwife... the most trusted and influential person throughout this entire time.' An RCOG spokeswoman told the BMJ that the college is investigating, adding: 'If such practice is happening, it is unacceptable and the RCOG in no way approves.' She said the magazine has 'strict policies on its advertising and sponsorship and does not seek advertorials for any of its publications.' Dr McCartney concludes: 'Is it right that the NHS imply its approval for the thousands of products being promoted at parents? Do we really want parents placed under advertising pressure and for NHS doctors, radiographers, and midwives to be the conduit? Some conflicts of interest in medicine are hard to avoid. Others are not. These should be easy.'","Parenting charity angry at hospitals giving access to promotional companies .

More than 1,500 teachers with criminal convictions, including paedophiles and attempted murderers, have applied for jobs in schools in the past year, MailOnline can reveal. Candidates also included drug dealers, burglars, thieves, fraudsters, flashers and blackmailers, and some may already have been working in a school or were given the job they wanted. Officials do not know exactly how many of the criminals were taken on, as recruitment decisions are often at the discretion of individual schools. An MP today demanded more transparency on the issue because 'public confidence' is at stake and 'parents have the right to know'. Shock: More than 1,500 teaching staff who applied for jobs in UK schools . were found to have previous convictions, including serious sex, . violence and drugs offences (file image - the man pictured does not have any criminal convictions) Around 100 headteachers applied for new jobs even though they had criminal convictions, new figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show. These individuals had carried out offences including wounding, cottaging, ABH, theft, battery, burglary, benefit fraud, drugs offences, hit and runs, violent disorder and one even planned a bomb hoax. On top of this around 800 teachers and 600 teaching assistants with criminal records also asked schools for work in 2012, many with some of the most serious convictions possible, including for child sex offences. The data also shows murderers, rapists and paedophiles were among 1,700 individuals who applied for jobs as caretakers, cleaners and dinner ladies. The details have been revealed by the . Disclosure and Barring Authority, who carry out criminal record checks for schools. Every year there are also dozens of . teachers and headteachers who carried out crimes while in work and were . allowed to keep their jobs. Controversial: Geoffrey Bettley, 36, got his job as a teacher back despite being caught with child porn, and Tory MP Priti Patel says there needs to be a crackdown and more transparency . In June a teacher who downloaded child porn was allowed to resume his career by the Department for Education. Geoffrey . Bettley, 36, was sacked, given a police caution and ordered to sign the . Sex Offenders’ Register after  admitting viewing sickening images over . several years. But a professional conduct panel said the married RE teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘excellent teaching’. Pledge: The Department for Education (pictured) says there are strong safeguards in place but schools will often make the final decision . Conservative MP Priti Patel told MailOnline: 'This is an issue of safety and parents need to have confidence about who is having contact with their children at school. 'There needs to be an element of transparency about who has been employed and where. Parents have the right to know.' Certain serious criminals are almost always automatically barred from working with children, but in the majority of cases the final decision is at the discretion of the school. New figures show that almost 10,000 of people who committed crimes applied for jobs in UK schools in the past three years. In Britain there is a list of crimes which automatically bans people from working with children. Usually any child sex offenders cannot work in schools, and nor can murderers and kidnappers, for example. Those who have committed violent acts on vulnerable people including the mentally ill or disabled would also be barred automatically. It is also a crime not to declare your criminal record when applying for a teaching post. But with the majority of crimes candidates are allowed to explain themselves and get the opportunity to convince employers to take them on regardless of their past. The Government said today there are strong procedures in place to protect children from criminals and said systems do stop criminals getting jobs in schools. 'Schools must carry out comprehensive disclosure and barring checks for anyone who applies to work with children', a spokesman said. 'People who have committed the most serious crimes- as set out by the Disclosure and Barring Service - are automatically barred. Employers review all applicants’ criminal records before making a decision about whether to allow them to work in a school.'","Majority of criminal acts do not prevent people teaching in UK schools .

Labour sent out mixed messages on Syria yesterday, with Ed Miliband striking a far more cautious tone than Tony Blair. Mr Blair, now a Middle East ‘peace envoy’, called for a major Western intervention in Syria to prevent it becoming ‘mired in carnage’ and a ‘breeding ground for extremism’. The former prime minister said he understood the ‘impulse to stay clear of the turmoil’. But he added: ‘We have, collectively, to understand the consequences of wringing our hands not putting them to work.’ However, the current Labour leadership struck a much more cautious note. Mixed messages: Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, left, has called for major Western intervention in Syria, but current Labour leader Ed Miliband, right, has said only that he would 'consider' backing an attack . Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said Labour would not give the Government a ‘blank cheque’ on Syria, despite the apparent use of chemical weapons by tyrant Bashar al-Assad last week. Mr Alexander said Labour MPs could even be ordered to vote against military action if Mr Cameron fails to make the case in the Commons tomorrow. ‘We still don’t know what the Government’s strategic objective would be - how achievable that objective is,’ he said. ‘We don’t know the legal basis on which the Government would seek to be acting; we don’t know the international support that it would be seeking to galvanise. Cautious: Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said Labour would not give the Government a 'blank cheque' on Syria . 'So there are very legitimate issues of real concern which I think we’ve got an obligation to be asking the Government in these critical days. I’m not ruling out the possibility that Labour could support the Government, but I’m certainly not prepared to write the Government a blank cheque.' He went on: ‘If we weren’t convinced, yes we would whip MPs (against the Government) - it would be a party position in terms of the case that the Government had made. But frankly, we’re not at that stage because... we still haven’t had from the Government either the evidence or indeed the military objectives that it would need to set out before Parliament to try and justify the course of action that is apparently at least in contemplation.’ Mr Miliband was called in to Downing Street yesterday afternoon for a personal briefing on the Government’s plans, and the case for intervention. Speaking afterwards, Mr Miliband said he was willing to ‘consider’ backing limited military action but did not offer a guarantee. ‘The use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians is abhorrent and cannot be ignored,’ Mr Miliband said. ‘When I saw the Prime Minister this afternoon I said to him the Labour Party would consider supporting international action but only on the basis that it was legal, that it was specifically limited to deterring the future use of chemical weapons and that any action contemplated had clear and achievable military goals. ‘We will be scrutinising any action contemplated on that basis.’ Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw acknowledged that the experience of the Iraq war had made MPs more sceptical about swallowing Government claims in the run-up to military action. But he added: ‘There is an instinct in the British House of Commons to support a British prime minister, of whatever party, where he or she is recommending military action. ‘So that will be part of the instinct, but also there is no doubt that the experience of Iraq has raised the bar of scepticism by the British House of Commons on behalf of the British people about whether military action is justified.’","Former PM Tony Blair calls for major Western intervention in Syria .

St Albans Crown Court, where James Mullen, 23, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was jailed for eight months . After admitting to the girl that their . relationship was wrong and telling her that she was ‘vulnerable’, . Mullen exchanged text messages with her and said he loved her.

School careers guidance has become a ‘ghost service’ with some young people having to pay up premium call rates to contact advisers by phone, a leading charity warned yesterday. Local authorities used to have a legal duty to provide a careers service but this was axed by the Coalition. Instead, a National Careers Service helpline was set up – but although it is free to call from landlines, it can cost 40p a minute from a mobile. Face-to-face: Although schools are supposed to provide impartial careers advice, Barnardo's found many held just one group meeting for 13- to 16-year-olds . This makes it ‘virtually unaffordable’ for many young people who do not have access to a fixed line, according to Barnardo’s. The children’s charity said it was 'wholly inadequate' to replace face-to-face guidance with online or telephone services, and that it would jeopardise youngsters’ chances of long-term work.. In-depth interviews with 29 young people . across the country revealed none were aware of the National Careers Service website or . the similar Government-funded Plotr site. Jonathan Rallings, of Barnardo’s, said ‘ghost services’ were effectively being offered in place of ‘meaningful advice’. ‘Changes to our careers guidance system . risk squandering young futures by failing to guarantee sufficient vital . face-to-face support for people who need it,' he said. ‘It’s crucial that the Government doesn’t . miss the opportunity to step in at this pivotal age, especially when . access to trusted, personally tailored careers advice at an early stage . can help to make the difference between young people sinking or swimming . in the world of work.’ Prioritising: The Department for Education said it had introduced a legal obligation for schools to deliver advice to pupils up to 18 which replaced the patchy old system . According to the report, Helping the . Inbetweeners, young people who were least likely to receive careers guidence were those who were not aiming to go into higher education or . advanced apprenticeships but who were also not considered . vulnerable to being out of work, education or training. Schools and colleges were given the duty of providing 13 to 16-year-olds with impartial careers advice from last September. But pupils have complained of being offered just one personal session or only group meetings. Barnado’s called on the Government to provide detailed guidance for schools on how to use resources to guarantee young people face-to-face . help if they request it and improve the promotion of online services. It demanded the phone line be free from mobiles and accessible from Skype. 'Laissez-faire approach': John Cridland, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said government careers advice left family and friends to 'pick up the pieces' John Cridland, director-general of . the Confederation of British Industry, accused the Government of . adopting ‘too laissez-faire an approach’ to careers guidance in June. He . said it relied too heavily on teachers, leaving formal advice ‘on . life-support’ and assuming family and friends would ‘pick up the . pieces’. The result was . teenagers leaving education with little knowledge of the job market, he . warned, adding children as young as 12 should receive advice. He . also recommended that the National Careers Service, which currently . offers meetings with advisers only to adults, should be given access to . schools. The Department for Education said Ofsted would be prioritising inspections of careers guidance from next month. This would be followed by a report listing improvements needed for careers guidance in schools. A spokesman said: ‘For the very first time this Government has introduced a legal obligation on schools to deliver independent and impartial careers advice for all pupils up to 18. This replaces the previous system which was patchy, costly and often of poor quality. ‘The National Careers Service provides a high quality helpline and webchat service, which has been used over 67,000 times in its first year alone, and a website which has attracted seven million visits. ‘The website offers a free call back service and there is also a smartphone app coming soon.’","National Careers Service costs up to 4p per minute from a mobile .

Le flop: Warburtons' Le Toastie was launched in France last August but it is being withdrawn after shoppers over the Channel failed to take to it . British baker Warburtons has pulled out of the French bread market after its 'Le Toastie' loaf failed to compete with the baguette. Last summer it started selling long life white, brown and seeded loaves - marketed as 'the everyday English bread' - in more than 200 supermarkets across the Channel. But French consumers would not be moved and stuck to their traditional habit of buying fresh every day. Warburtons admitted today it had quit the French market because Le Toastie, which had a ten-day shelf life, proved uneconomical. A Warburtons spokeswoman told The Grocer magazine: 'It was not cost effective to continue to produce and distribute the extended shelf life range solely for France.' In . France where most people buy freshly baked baguettes every day, sliced . bread has more preservatives and lasts longer before going stale because . it is typically bought irregularly for use in emergencies. The decision follows Warburtons’ exit from Eastern Europe at the end of last year. Its bread products were listed in Tesco stores in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland for a year, but the baker pulled out because of high transport costs and a lack of suitable manufacturing partners in the region. As part of its export push, Warburtons also developed a frozen range that is selling successfully to expats in Spain and elsewhere. Faced with a drop in bread sales in the UK, the family owned baker has diversified its range of products. Couldn't kick the habit: The French love for the baguette and other fresh breads meant the long life Le Toastie failed to make an impact . This year it has grown its ‘free-from’ range under the Newburn Bakehouse sub-brand, relaunched its snacks range under the Escapes name and acquired speciality bread maker Giles Foods. Warburtons was founded by Thomas Warburton in 1876 and is based in Bolton, Greater Manchester. For much of its history Warburtons only had bakeries in Lancashire and it remains a family-owned company. The company embarked on a large expansion program in the late 1990s which continued in the 2000s and it has grown across the UK after being relatively unheard of outside the Bolton and Manchester area. The firm has a 24 per cent share of the UK bread market and the Warburtons brand is the most popular bread in the United Kingdom, ahead of rivals Kingsmill and Hovis, a position it has held since 2008. Overall, Warburtons products are the second-best selling food and drink brand in the UK after Coca Cola and ahead of other big British brands such as Cadburys and Walkers.","'Le Toastie' launched across Channel last August but has now been axed .

Patients in England are four times more likely to receive new cancer drugs than those in Wales, according to ministers. Government figures show 15,456 patients in England were given money last year by the Cancer Drugs Fund – which pays for treatments that have not yet been approved by NICE, the NHS rationing body. This works out at 29 people per 100,000. Life-saving treatment: Welsh patients are missing out on cancer drugs that English patients have funding for . The Labour-run Welsh Assembly, whose decision to provide free prescriptions left its budget squeezed, has so far refused to implement a similar scheme. This means just 216 patients in Wales were given money for new cancer drugs by applying for exceptional NHS funding – or seven per 100,000 people. As a result, some Welsh patients have even resorted to renting second homes across the English border to boost their chances of getting life-saving treatment. Yvonne Briscow, 58, decided to take out a six-month lease on a flat in Stockport, 50 miles from her home in Brynford, North Wales, in the hope of getting access to funding for new bowel cancer drugs. Ministers launched the £650million Cancer Drugs Fund three years ago. Doctors apply on behalf of their patients to get any drug they believe will extend or enhance their lives. Budget problems: The Assembly led by Labour's Carwyn Jones has not offered the same cancer treatment service to Welsh patients . But the fund was a temporary measure and is due to be wound-up in April. The Government are getting ready to introduce a system of Value-Based Pricing next year, which is expected to give the green-light to more expensive cancer drugs. Public health minister Anna Soubry said: ‘By protecting the NHS budget, we have been able to provide life-saving treatment to over 30,000 patients in England since the last election. ‘Welsh patients will be outraged that their Labour Government won’t offer the same service.’","Just 216 patients in Wales were given money for new cancer drugs .

'They had a difficult start as we had a cold May and June and they flowered around 10 days later than usual, but they have since flourished in the sun. 'We have had lots of comments from people saying how spectacular they look in the fields.' Black sunflowers were first planted at the farm in 1998 and a new crop is grown every May.

Two Kenyan men have signed a written contract to share a woman they both love, who refuses to choose between them. When the men realised that she had been having affairs with both of them for four years, instead of ending their respective relationships, the men decided that neither of them could live without her. Community policing officer Adhalah Abdulrahman in Kisauni tried to mediate between the pair. Marriage on a rota: Sylvester Mwendwa is one of the men getting married. He will take it in turns to live with his 'wife' Mr Abdulrahman said: 'I heard people . fighting and went to check, but I was surprised to see two men fighting . over a woman who is said to be a widow and a mother of twins. 'I tried solving the issue but they refused, each insisting he could not live without the woman.' Mr Sylvester Mwendwa, one of the ‘husbands’, said he decided to share her with Mr Elijah Kimani. Mr Mwendwa told the BBC he loved the woman and that the contract was intended to 'set boundaries' and 'keep the peace'. He explained how it will work: 'She is like the central referee. She can say whether she wants me or my colleague.' They will both pay her rent and for the upkeep of any children that she has in the future. Disagreement: The arrangement in Kisauni, Kenya has caused controversy as polyandry is virtually unheard of in the country . Mr Abdulrahman explained: 'We discussed everything and they agreed that even if the woman gives birth they will raise the child as their own since they have been taking care of the woman’s children together.' In Kenya polygamy is legal but polyandry is also legal, though almost unheard of. Polyandry is permissible as long as it can be proved that it is part of a tribal custom. The woman wishes to remain anonymous.","Kenyan love rivals sign contract to share the same woman .

She was very insensitive that he does have special needs.’ Bays said she has been a regular at the salon for many years and her been taking her son with her for the past 18 months. ‘This . wasn’t the first time he acted that way at her salon and she was . yelling at us the whole time (Saturday) in front of the staff and . clientele,’ she Bays, whose husband, Josh, and their younger son, .

His . mother has said he was traveling alone and on his way back from . Seattle, where he visited a friend. Croom was due in Arizona on August . 17 to start college in Mesa. Hutson had said that text messages between Croom and a friend indicated Croom wanted to run away. Croom . also talked to his parents about Christopher McCandless, whose journey . to Alaska was documented in the book and subsequent movie named 'Into . the Wild.' McCandless gave up his worldly goods to live in the Alaska . wilderness, only to die there, perhaps from eating wild potatoes. 'I . think we have kind of a combination there,' Hutson said earlier Monday. 'He talked with his parents about 'Into the Wild,' and in text messages . we've looked at, he does specifically talk about running away, kind of . just running away from his life.'

The film, which stars Emile Hirsh, charts the experiences of a college graduate seeking adventure and a simpler life.

Croom . left a friend's home in Seattle on August 16 and was driving home to . Arizona, but he failed to turn up to his first classes at Mesa Community . College last Monday. His abandoned SUV was found in Riddle, southwest Oregon close to Interstate 5 on Wednesday. Inside the SUV were Jonathan's wallet, $200 in cash and a book on outdoor survival tactics. 'Just as in that movie, he left everything behind and took off,' David Croom said early Monday. 'And we just don't know what he left with.' His family said they are worried that he was inspired by the McCandless' sad story. McCandless . headed to the wild with no money and few provisions in a bid to live . simply and appreciate nature. He was found dead in August 1992, when he . was just 24. Croom's father David said the teenager had hinted that he was attracted to the same adventure. 'He was talking to another friend that it . would be great to just leave penniless and just work along the way and . get resources like they did in the movie,' he told MyFoxPhoenix.com. A friend told the family that their son might have planned the trip. Missed: Johnathan (second left) with his father (second right), who feared the boy run away after becoming inspired by the film . 'She said ""he had left to go on an adventure and I haven't been able to get ahold of him for two days"",' Mr Croom said. 'As far as we know he left in shorts . and a T-shirt and a backpack with some socks in it and he left the car . and that's all we know.' His mother Monica added that her son was 'super smart' and had Boy Scout experience. She added that his SUV didn't . break down, wasn't out of gas and was unlocked with money inside. Officers added that the vehicle had not been broken into. Search teams scoured the area for clues to his whereabouts but it wasn't until Monday that they came across the body. Johnathan had visited a female friend but failed to . return home. He had originally left Arizona on July 30. On his blog earlier this year, he described himself as someone looking for excitement and adventure. Sad: On his blog, Croom said he wanted to live an exciting life so he could teach others how to do so . 'I am definitely searching for my purpose in the world and writing about Life,' he wrote. 'I want to teach people to live . extraordinarily unusual, fun, exhilarating lives. In order to do so, I . need to be living the excitement myself.' But he added in a post written in May: 'I do recognize that I make very bad decisions, quite often. 'These . decisions lead to a lot of remorse and unhappiness. I know I should . just let these things go and push forward, as I'd recommend to anybody, . but it's hard. 'I am trying though. I truly am... I will look back and see how far I've come and I will know that anything is possible.' The teen's father had covered Oregon putting up missing posters in the hope someone would recognize his son.

They're called 'super agers' - men and women who are in their 80s and 90s, but with brains and memories that seem far younger. U.S. researchers are looking at this rare group in the hope that they may find ways to help protect others from memory loss. Neuroscientists have become excited, as imaging tests have revealed unusually low amounts of age-related plaques along with more brain mass related to attention and memory in these elite seniors. 92-year-old Edith Stern holds a photo of her father in her studio apartment at a retirement home in Chicago. She is one of the 'super agers' being studied with 'young' brains and memories to help scientists find ways to help protect others from memory loss . 'We're living long but we're not necessarily living well in our older years and so we hope that the Super Ageing study can find factors that are modifiable and that we'll be able to use those to help people live long and live well,' said study leader Emily Rogalski, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University's cognitive neurology and Alzheimer's disease centre in Chicago. The study is still seeking volunteers, but fewer than 10 per cent of would-be participants have met study criteria. Dr Rogalski said: 'We've screened over 400 people at this point and only about 35 of them have been eligible for this study, so it really represents a rare portion of the population.' They include an octogenarian attorney, a 96-year-old retired neuroscientist, a 92-year-old Holocaust survivor and an 81-year-old pack-a-day smoker who drinks a nightly martini. To qualify, would-be participants have to undergo a battery of mental tests. Once enrolled, they have periodic imaging scans and other medical tests. Critically, they also must be willing to donate their brains after death. Neuroscientists have become excited as imaging tests have revealed unusually low amounts of age-related plaques - along with more brain mass related to attention and memory - in elderly people such as Ms Stern (pictured) who works in the gift shop at her retirement home in Chicago . The memory tests include lists of about 15 words and Dr Rogalski said 'super agers can remember at least nine of them 30 minutes later, which is really impressive because often older adults in their 80s can only remember just a couple.' Special MRI scans have yielded other remarkable clues, Dr Rogalski said. They show that in super agers, the brain's cortex, or outer layer, responsible for many mental functions including memory, is thicker than in typical 80 and 90-year-olds. Deep within the brain, a small region called the anterior cingulate, which is important for attention, is bigger than in many 50 and 60-year-olds. The super agers aren't just different on the inside; they have more energy than most people their age and share a positive, inquisitive outlook, according to the scientists. Dr Rogalski said the researchers are looking into whether those traits contribute to brain health and other research has linked a positive attitude with overall health. Dr Rogalski said the project has screened over 400 people willing to participate in the study but only about 35 of them have been eligible for this study, so it really represents a rare portion of the population. Ms Stern, a Holocaust survivor, was chosen. She says she finds it easy to recall conversations and feels young . Some studies have suggested that people who are 'cognitively active and socially engaged' have a reduced chance of developing Alzheimer's disease, but scientists do not know which comes first - a healthy brain or a great attitude, according to Heather Snyder, director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer's Association. Dr Snyder said the super ageing study is an important effort that may help provide some answers. Edith Stern is among the super agers. The petite woman looks far younger than her 92 years, and is a vibrant presence at her Chicago retirement home, where she acts as a sort of room mother, volunteering in the gift shop, helping residents settle in and making sure their needs are met. Stern lost most of her family in the Holocaust and takes her work seriously. 'What I couldn't do for my parents, I try to do for the residents in the home,' she said, her voice still thick with the accent of her native Czechoslovakia. Stern acknowledges she's different from most people at the home, even many younger residents. 'I am young - inside. And I think that's the difference,' she said. 'I grasp fast...If people say something, they don't have to tell me twice. I don't forget it.' The study has shown that super agers like Ms Stern (pictured right) tend to have a larger 'anterior cingulate' in the brain that is important for attention than many 50-year-olds. They also have more energy than most people their age and share a positive, inquisitive outlook . She's different in other ways, too and said: 'When you get old, people are mainly interested in themselves. 'They talk about the doctor, what hurts...You are not so important that you just concentrate on yourself. You have to think about other people.' Study participant Don Tenbrunsel has a similar mindset. The 85-year-old retired businessman doesn't think of himself as a super ager. 'Neither do my children,' he says, chuckling. But Mr Tenbrunsel says his memory has been sharp 'from the time I was born. My mother used to say, ""Donald, come sing with me"" - not because I had a good voice, but because I always knew the words,' he said. 'I think I'm just lucky, not only with respect to my memory, but I'm able to get around very well; I walk a lot and I have a pretty good attitude toward life itself.' Tenbrunsel volunteers several hours a week at a food pantry run by the Chicago church where he is a parishioner. Ms Stern walks through the cafeteria at her retirement home in Chicago and is participating in the research. Scientists hope the Super Ageing study can find factors that are modifiable and that the findings will help people live long and live well . Ken Zwiener, of Deerfield, is another super ager. He had 'more than an inkling he might qualify for the study, and his kids encouraged him to enroll. 'They said, ""Dad, your brain is the best thing about you,""' the 81-year-old retired businessman recalled. He's a golfer and Broadway musical 'nut' who created a 300-plus-page computer database of shows. Mr Zwiener uses an iPad, recently went hot-air ballooning and is trying to learn Spanish. He also pours himself a vodka martini every night and is a pack-a-day cigarette smoker, but says he doesn't think his habits have made much difference. His healthy brain, he says, may be due to heredity and genes, but Zwiener said he hopes the study comes up with more 'scientific insights'. 'My dad lived into his middle 90s and was pretty sharp right up until the day he died,' Mr Zwiener said. His motivation for joining the study was simple: The best man at his wedding died of Alzheimer's disease before age 50. 'To lose a mind ... is just a terrible way to go,' he said.","U.S. researchers are studying 80 and 90-year-olds with exceptional brains and memories to find ways to protect others from memory loss .

Laura Bates, founder of The Everyday Sexism Project and one of the women behind the #FBRape Twitter campaign . A social media campaign calling on Facebook to crack down on content endorsing violence against women is already seeing companies pull their ads from the networking site. Facebook has refused to censor offensive content of the type identified by the group #FBRape, that includes insulting pictures and slogans, as well as entire pages and Facebook groups created to promote violence against women. Examples of anti-women content on the site include 'Violently Raping Your Friend Just for Laughs' and 'Fly Kicking Sluts in the Uterus' groups as well as images of sleeping young women with their trousers pulled down alongside text suggesting they have ingested and enjoyed 'roofie' date rape drugs. Facebook cites its 'free speech' or humour policies in defence and is so far refusing to remove some of the content according to the #FBRape group. They confirm they are in communication with Facebook and hope for a positive solution. The campaign is calling on advertisers like Dove, American Express, Sure and Sky to pull their adverts until Facebook bans such material, and brings its policies on  content endorsing violence against women in line with racism and homophobia policies. Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism Project, writer and activist Soraya Chemaly and Jaclyn Friedman from Women, Action & the Media (WAM!) joined forces to launch the hashtag Twitter campaign #FBRape last Tuesday. 'Specifically, we call on you, Facebook, to take three actions,' they wrote in an open letter. 'Recognize speech that trivializes or . glorifies violence against girls and women as hate speech and make a . commitment that you will not tolerate this content. 'Effectively train moderators to recognize and remove gender-based hate speech. 'Effectively train moderators to understand how online harassment differently affects women and men, in part due to the real-world pandemic of violence against women.' The group said more than 50,000 tweets . and more than 4,500 emails had been sent through its site since the . hashtag was launched last Tuesday. A petition on Change.org has also attracted more than 222,000 signatures. Laura, 26, who lives in London, founded the Everyday Sexism Project which has collected over 30,000 women's experiences of gender imbalance over the last year alone. 'I see and hear stories every single day from women whose lives are directly impacted by sexism, misogyny and sexual abuse,' she tells the MailOnline. 'So these pictures and pages hit very close to home for me. And when I receive emails from teenage girls who have been raped, but won't report it because they think they must be to blame, or they won't be taken seriously, I can't help but think that Facebook has a responsibility to stand up to the normalisation of rape and domestic violence that is created by these pages condoning and depicting it. #FBRape posted this image on their website, drawing attention to advertisements next to the image . 'Of course it's not as simple as saying that one directly leads to another, but it certainly creates a culture in which the message is sent out, loud and clear, that rape and domestic violence are something to laugh and boast about, not something to take seriously. 'Meanwhile, remember, Facebook censors images of women breastfeeding or artistic representations of female bodies... this isn't a case of 'free speech', because it already chooses so much material to ban as 'offensive', yet these images of women battered, bloodied and bruised are considered acceptable... you have to question the double standard.' #FBRape report that Nationwide UK, Nissan, WestHost, House of Burlesque and many others have already joined and backed the campaign by removing their ads until Facebook pulls such offensive content. Impressively, nearly 100 international women’s and human rights organizations, from Eve Ensler’s V Day to Annie Lennox’s Equals Coalition, have signed and supported their open letter. A spokesman for Facebook told the MailOnline that the pages referenced in the open letter have been removed . from Facebook as they broke their terms. They added: 'You have to seek out this content on Facebook. 'It is viewed and interacted with by a tiny group of people on Facebook who choose to do so. 'Offensive . content exists all over the web - but generally there is no mechanism . to report content that goes beyond offensive and becomes hate speech. On . Facebook every group, page or photo can be reported. Nissan and Nationwide UK have pulled ads until Facebook bans material endorsing violence against women . 'Facebook's policy is that removing all offensive content or controversial humour from its site is not the solution to combatting ignorance. Having the freedom to debate serious issues like this is how we fight prejudice. Facebook looks to give people the freedom to describe, depict and comment on the world in which we live.' They added: 'When evaluating speech on Facebook, we analyse the nature of the . speech itself, as well as its perceived intent as indicated by any . additional context we may have. 'We believe this additional information . is important, since identical words may be hateful in one context, or . off-colour attempts at humour in another (such as with stand-up comedy). 'If content satisfies our definition of harm, we will remove it . immediately. 'However, we allow people to use language and images, even . when extremely offensive or inaccurate, to make jokes or express . political beliefs that fall short of harm.' In an official statement in response to #FBRape, a spokesperson for Facebook said: 'There is no place on Facebook for hate speech or content that is threatening, or incites violence, and we will not tolerate material deemed to be genuinely or directly harmful. We try to react quickly to remove reported language or images that violate our terms and we try to make it very easy for people to report questionable content using links located throughout the site. 'However, as you may expect in any diverse community of more than a billion people, we occasionally see people post distasteful or disturbing content, or make crude attempts at humour. While it may be vulgar and offensive, distasteful content on its own does not violate our policies. We do require that any such page be clearly marked - so users are aware that the content may be in poor taste. In many instances, we may also require a page administrator to display their real name on the page, or the page will be removed.' In response to Facebook's comments, Laura Bates has said: . 'While Facebook may be removing some individual pages, a great deal of this content still remains, as evidenced by the fresh content we have been posting to our campaign site over the past few days. 'What is needed is for Facebook to change its policy on representations of rape and domestic violence not sporadically take down pages in response to media pressure while their policies mean such content could be reposted in the future.'

Up to 260 convict mothers every year apply to bring up their babies behind bars, MailOnline can reveal today. Around 75 children are currently spending the first 18 months of life in jail to prevent them being separated from their mother.

Start to life: This prison mother holds her child while watched by a prison warden at the baby unit at HMP Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire . New figures from The Ministry of Justice reveal that 711 new mothers have applied for one of these spaces, but they are so oversubscribed only 220 have been successful since 2010. It means that many will be taken into care or looked after by family outside the prison walls. In most cases, the mother were sent to prison for crimes committed while pregnant. David Green, criminologist and director of the think tank Civitas, . said: 'This is a worrying trend and deeply regrettable for the children . who are spending their infancy in jails. But culpability lies with their . mothers. 'Nobody should be spared a custodial sentence on the ground . that they have children. Prison acts as a deterrent – we cannot send a . message that people with children will get away with crime'. Services: Holloway Prison in north London is one of seven jails with baby units attached for its female inmates . Rules: This baby is one of around 75 that the prison service have space for, pictured here in at the 'light room' at the newly refurbished Mother and Baby unit of HMP Holloway in London . There are seven prison baby units around the UK, including Holloway in London. In order to qualify, the majority of the mothers will have . committed serious crimes while pregnant, including violence and drugs . offences. A woman was jailed for two years last month despite getting pregnant to avoid it, a court heard. Natalie Williams, of Darlington, took a 14-year-old boy to a hotel for sex and got him high on cannabis. Teesside Crown Court heard that after she was arrested, she deliberately got pregnant with a new boyfriend - thought to be an attempt to stay out of prison. But Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told her that would not dissuade him from locking her up - because a man who preyed on a young girl would face jail. He said: 'The law sets out to protect those that are under the age of consent, whether they are boys or girls, from those who would take advantage of their youth. 'They are not to be preyed upon by those who are older than them, and certainly over the age of consent, and that is why these are very serious offences.' In the first 18 months women will be able to feed and play with their child, and are given childcare so they can take part in other elements of prison life. Government guidelines insist young children behind bars must have . contact with their family and see the world outside prison, with trips . outside jail with nursery nurses to go shopping and visit local parks. The cost of formula and nappies would be taken from the prisoner's benefits. After the 18 month period is up, if their mother is still imprisoned, they will be . returned to life on the outside, either with a family member or in . care. A spokesman for the Howard League for Penal reform said: 'Forcibly separating a baby from his or her mother should only be . done to protect the welfare of the child and too many babies are being . taken away from mothers in prison' The Government offers the places in the 'assumption that the best place for a young child is with his or her parent'. Each application by a mother is considered by a board who will recommend to a prison governor if it would be best for the child if they come to prison. 'We provide Mother and Baby Units for the benefit of the prisoners' babies who would otherwise have to be separated from their mothers.

The package had Berry's name on it and was visible in the video. Berry's face was seen in a reflection in one of the videos he posted on YouTube in October 2012 . Berry's name was also seen on this package, filled with marijuana seeds, in the YouTube video, which led police to identify him .

No one was injured, but the family and authorities are scratching their heads wondering where it could have come from. Surprise! A family was shocked Sunday when this chunk of lead smashed through their roof and into their Seattle home . Though the incident happened over the weekend, the family waited until Tuesday to call the police. A responding officer inspected the hole and decided one of two things happened. Either the rectangular hunk of lead fell off an aircraft or, the officer said, 'a really big bird that had stolen a lead bar.' However, the FAA has nixed the first possibility. Damaged: The lead bar left a shoe box sized hole in the roof of their South Seattle home . 'The FAA has concluded its investigation into the metal part that was found in the South Seattle home,' FAA spokesperson Allen Kenitzer told MailOnline. 'After examining the part, investigators have concluded that this object did not come from an aircraft.' So where did the offending metal piece originate? A bird? Police said it likely came form a plane, but the Federal Aviation Administration concluded 'this object did not come from an aircraft' The only clues are two holes in the bar, as if to accomodate bolts, and an only partially readable serial number. King 5 News reports that viewers in Seattle responded to the story and many seemed to believe the bar is a wood chipper tooth. While someone is grinding wood and tree stumps, they said, it's possible for a 'tooth' to fly out along with the wood chips. Chipping in? Viewers of a local news station that ran the story wrote in with a different possibility. They said the hole was made by a grinding 'tooth' from a wood chipper .","Police guessed it came from a plane overhead .

Dubious Facebook 'friends' could stand in the way of you getting a loan thanks to new technology. Savvy start up lenders have started measuring the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by determining whether their pals pay off their debts. The tech start ups, including Lenddo, trawl through an applicants online friends in a bid to determine whether anyone in your network has failed to pay back a loan. 'It turns out humans are really good . at knowing who is trustworthy and reliable in their community,' Jeff . Stewart, a co-founder and CEO of lending start up, Lenddo, told CNN . Money. 'What's new is that we're now able to measure through massive . computing power.' New technique: Savvy start up lenders have started measuring the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by determining whether their friends on Facebook pay off their debts (stock photo) Traditional lenders, such as banks, rely heavily on official credit scores based on payment history. But newer lenders believe social connections can also be a good indicator of a person's creditworthiness. After a quick search, Lenddo can work out if any of your Facebook friends have been late paying back a loan to Lenddo. If so, they're less likely to offer you a line of credit. The situation gets even worse if the delinquent friend is someone you interact with regularly. Another company, German-based Kreditech told CNN it uses eBay or Amazon accounts as well as Facebook to check whether a potential borrower is high or low risk. Kreditech also gathers information from the manner in which a customer fills out the online application - if someone uses all capitals or no capitals they'll lose a few points. The business can determines your location based on where your computer is, and therefore takes into account where you live or work - the posher area the better obviously. The range of information about a would-be borrow doesn't mean much apart but when brought together it paints a pretty good picture of the applicant, Sebastian Diemer, a co-founder of Kreditech, told the news website. Other ways: Other non-traditional lenders use eBay or Amazon accounts as well as Facebook to check whether a potential borrower is high or low risk . Kabbage, an online service that offers cash advances to small businesses, says it can get 'much better, faster data' than a traditional credit score by checking PayPal, eBay and other online payment accounts for real time proof of creditworthiness. The company told CNN it can determine whether someone is worth the risk and put money into their account in just seven minutes. Most lending start ups currently attract niche borrowers, for example Kabbage wants to lend to small businesses who operate online, where as Lenddo and Kreditech target middle-class people in emerging markets where credit is hard to access. But using social data to assess credit risk is on the verge of going mainstream, according to the report. Kreditech has began selling its technology to national online lenders in Russia and the Czech Republic and Kabbage sees itself taking similar steps. But the method has its critics. John Ulzheimer, a credit expert at CreditSesame.com, claims Facebook friends aren't necessarily indicative of whether someone will pay back a loan on time. Where as the more tradition FICO considers factors that are all 'incredibly predictive of risk,' Ulzheimer said. It is also easier for individuals to control their credit score, by ditching dubious friends on Facebook for example. 'To me, using social media is a little bit dangerous,' he said.","Savvy start up lenders have started measuring the creditworthiness of potential borrowers by determining whether their Facebook friends pay off their debts .
The tech start ups, including Lenddo, trawl through an applicants online friends in a bid to determine whether anyone in your network has failed to pay back a loan .
If they are successful, it dents your credit score .
Others are using payment information from eBay, Paypal and Amazon rather than or as well as more traditional methods ."

Students from Sydney and London have developed an amphibious prosthetic limb that lets wearers run on sand and swim full speed in the sea. The Murr-ma limb has a split-toe design that helps a user balance on the uneven terrain of a beach and has studs that give a larger surface area when running on soft sand. When worn in water, Murr-ma has 'fins' fitted at the top of the prosthesis that channel the flow of water along the limb and propels the swimmer faster - and this can give wearers more thrust and faster speeds than able-bodied people.

The fins of the Murr-ma were inspired by the dorsal fin of the sailfish, which is capable of swimming 100 metres in under five seconds. The split-toe also reduces the amount of drag in water. Because of its design and the material it is made for, the limb lets the wearer go seamlessly from running on the beach to swimming at full speed. The makers even claim that this specialised design could make wearers swim faster than able-bodied people. In a demonstration video, one of the developers claims he wanted to give the wearer a 'superpower' with the design of Murr-ma. The limb has been made to be lightweight and durable and could also be used daily on other terrains and during other sports. According to the Murr-ma website, the design is just a prototype and there are no immediate plans to sell it commercially.","Murr-ma was designed for high-performance water and beach activities .

A wildfire raging out of control in Northern California and threatening the city of San Francisco power supply has grown so large that it's creating its own weather pattern. The Rim Fire has already scorched some 250 square miles and breached Yosemite National Park. And recently published NASA photos from the International Space Station shows the extent of the inferno that remains just 5 percent contained. As the fire rages on, it begins to create its own weather events within the blaze, which officials say makes it even harder to predict and contain. Huge: A NASA astronaut on the International Space Station snapped this photo of the massive smoke plume from California's raging wildfire August 24 . 'As the smoke column builds up it breaks down and collapses inside of itself, sending downdrafts and gusts that can go in any direction,' CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant told NBC Bay Area. 'There’s a lot of potential for this one to continue to grow.' Extreme terrain is hampering efforts by firefighters to stop the fire, which has now forced closures to the pristine Yosemite National Park after blacking out 12,000 acres of park land by early Saturday. NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg tweeted a photo Saturday evening of the Rim Fire as seen from her perch 230 miles above the earth. From above, the dire situation only appears more grave. Between billowing clouds an astronaut like Nyberg is accustomed to gazing upon from orbit, Earth is also now sporting a black scar on North America’s West Coast and ominous sooty smoke trailing eastward with prevailing winds. It is nearly impossible to gauge the size of the plume from Nyberg’s astonishing photos when both the curve of the earth and endless smoke are visible in the same frame. Devastation: Another snapshot from space shows a wildfire that has already consumed more than 200 square miles, now raging out of control in California's Yosemite National Park . Looking down: Astronaut Karen Nyberg posted the startling fire photo to her Twitter account late August 24. She took the shot from 230 miles above the earth . In another striking NASA photo of the destructive fire, the thick smoke can be clearly seen above much of Yosemite, and the flames themselves are outlined in the satellite shot, all but dwarfing the 55,000 acre Mono Lake nearby. The blaze tripled in size to 128,000 acres between Thursday and Friday, more than three times the size of San Francisco. Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency for the city, which lies 150 miles away, because of the threat to the city's utilities, with two of three hydroelectric power stations shut down. City water supplies were also threatened. Scorched: Burned land surrounds a welcome sign near Yosemite National Park August 24. San Francisco's power and water supplies are in danger in addition to the pristine park 150 miles away . Emergency: A cow passes a flare-up of the Rim Fire near the Yosemite National Park border in Groveland, California, August 24. With its utilities under siege, a state of emergency has been issued for San Francisco . Battle: Firefighters continued battling at the front lines of the Rim Fire August 24, which has raged since August 17 . Mystery: The cause of the so-called Rim Fire remained under investigation Saturday . The Hetch Hetchy Reservoir provides water to 2.6 million customers in the San Francisco area and Brown in his declaration said the city's water supply could be affected if the blaze harms the reservoir. The reservoir provides about 85 percent of San Francisco's water needs and has not been disrupted by the fire, said Tyrone Jue, spokesman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. San Francisco could draw on water from neighbors if the supply is compromised, he said. There have been no reports of blackouts in San Francisco, which is drawing on a reserve of power stored for emergencies. It also has spent around $700,000 buying power on the open market after two powerhouses in the path of the fire were shut down. Firefighters continue to battle at the front lines of the fire, which started August 17. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

A shark scientist has found a 200lb sea lion inside the stomach of one of nature's largest predators. The animal was lunch for the a gigantic 12-foot Mako shark that was caught off the coast of Southern California by commercial fishermen. Dr Antonella Preti has dissected over 2,000 stomachs in a bid to unravel mysteries of aquatic food chains, but the Mako shark's is her biggest yet. Scroll down for video . A shark scientist has found a 90 kilogram sea lion inside the stomach of a 12 ft long Mako Shark. The shark's blanket-sized stomach lining is pictured along with its last recent meals including the remains of a sea lion, which are laid out on the table . Dr Preti at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found a sea lion weighing 200lb (91 kg) that was largely intact but had a flipper missing and multiple puncture-like bites to its body, inside the shark's stomach. The stomach also harboured other bones that she plans on cleaning and identifying, according to the video which shows the dissection. To date, Ms Preti has dissected more than 200 from Mako shark stomachs to work out what the 'apex'  predators eat at the top of the food chain, LiveScience reported. Shark scientist Antonella Preti at the NOAA has dissected more than 200 Mako shark stomachs to work out what the apex predators (pictured) eat at the top of the food chain . The shark scientist found a 90 kilogram sea lion inside the stomach of the Mako shark. While parts of the animal have been bitten off, it appears that the majority of it was swallowed whole . The huge sharks regulate the populations of mid level predators, such as sea lions by mainly eating old and sick animals, which keeps the overall population healthier. Consequently if the sharks disappear, there is a negative knock-on effect to their local ecosystem and the food chain. According to the NOAA, up to 100 million sharks are killed each year for their meat - particularly their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup and can fetch up to £380 a pound. Here the scientist examines the sea lion's head, which is remarkably intact considering it has been eaten by a shark and has been sitting in the digestive juices of its stomach . The soup is a delicacy in China and can cost up to £108 a bowl despite containing high levels of toxins such as mercury. Some species of shark such as the Gulper, are also at risk of 'livering' when their liver is removed by fisherman and their carcass tossed overboard as waste. Shark livers are in demand as their livers and specifically a substance found in them called squalene, that helps control their buoyancy in water, is used in some luxury beauty creams. Ms Preti spends time washing bones and straining gastric juices from the shark's stomach to build up a thorough picture of the animal's recent meals . The premium substance costs up to £18,000 a ton. Mako Sharks eat anything but are partial to fish, squid, sea birds, other sharks and of course sea lions. Ms Preti spends times washing bones and . straining gastric juices to build up a thorough picture of the animals' recent meals and said 'you can find all sorts of things in there.' This is the shark's stomach before the contents are emptied and examined.

A mother has given her first television interview since she was ordered to stop breastfeeding her baby in a public swimming pool. Appearing on This Morning, Stephanie Wilby, 22, mother of four-month-old Leo, defended her right to breastfeed in the toddler pool at Manchester Aquatics Centre - an issue which divided public opinion when it came to light last week. 'I don't see the unhygienic part of this,' she said, when host Ruth Langsford expressed her misgivings about the potential dangers of feeding her son in the water - citing the veruccas, germs and bacteria present in public baths.

Stephanie Wilby (right) defended her right to breastfeed in the pool, but journalist Sally Windsor (left) described it as 'gross' Stephanie said it would have . been more dangerous to feed in the changing rooms - where staff . directed her - saying they were 'dirty and unhygienic.' It was reported last week that Stephanie . was 'waist-deep' in the toddlers' pool, but she now denies this, saying she was standing in the shallow end, with Leo raised up out of the water. When asked why didn't initially sit beside the pool to nurse Leo, she explained: 'This wasn't about a feed - it was to soothe my son. If I'd left the pool, it wouldn't have been right for Leo. 'There was no safety risk, there was no health risk.' Stephanie, with her four-month-old son Leo, who she attempted to breastfeed in the toddler pool at the Manchester Aquatics Centre . At the end of the interview, Leo joined his mother on the This Morning sofa. 'How could you not feed him?' the doting mother asked Eamon and Ruth. 'He shouldn't be the boss all the time,' was Eamon's reply. And viewers seemed to agree with him, with only 26 per cent in favour of breastfeeding in public pools in a poll conducted by the show. Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford (right) debate the issue with Stephanie (left) and journalist Sally Windsor (far left) Thousands of readers have had their say on the website and on Twitter about whether Stephanie Wilby should have been breastfeeding little Leo in the pool: . Lily McPhilimey @PixiegirlLily tweeted: 'No breastfeeding #MailOnline I'm all for feeding but even I wouldn't there!' Martin, from Oxford commented: 'I don't see there is a problem. breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world.

But it's not ""indecent""'Linda Malaga, from Malaga in Spain added: 'I agree wholeheartedly with breastfeeding in public provided it is done in a discreet manner and not in full view of everyone. Feeding in a public swimming pool is completely wrong! After all you wouldn't eat your lunch whilst waist deep in a public swimming pool would you????' Kim from North Lincs said: 'Totally disgusting, why should the rest of us and our kids be exposed to her feeding her baby in a pool, there is a time and a place for heavens sake.

Diamonds are forever, from Hampshire, added: 'Yes he was right !!! There is a time and place for every thing...I wouldn't want to swim in her breast milk...nor if or when her child throws it back up again......Get real its a public bath !!' Last week, Mrs Wilby, who is on . maternity leave from her customer service job at British Gas, said: ‘I . should be allowed to breastfeed where I want. ‘As long as I do so tactfully and I . am in within the law then I should not be harassed by people  telling me . to stop. I was  humiliated and it was very distressing.' She said one staff member told her . breastfeeding in a pool was akin to a swimmer urinating in the water and . also amounted to ‘indecent exposure’. ‘They made a real scene,' said the mother-of-two. 'They were . saying me breastfeeding was indecent exposure but I was covered more . than most of the other swimmers. ‘One staff member also said he would . stop a man urinating in the pool and that is why they did not want me . breastfeeding in the water.’ Bosses at the state-of-the-art . Manchester Aquatics Centre, a training venue for last year’s Olympics . and Paralympics, have now apologised about the incident on Sunday . afternoon. Mrs Wilby from Denton, Manchester, said she had only moved to the side of the toddlers’ pool for a few moments to feed her son. ‘It was just a matter of a few . seconds but the response from staff was dreadful. The manner in which . they treated me was aggressive and upsetting and caused me major . embarrassment. ‘If they did not like it they could have asked me quietly to stop,’ she added. ‘I would have still questioned their reasons but it would not have been as inappropriate.’ Mrs Wilby, whose husband also works . in customer  service, added: ‘This was the worst possible customer . service I have ever come across.’ The family have made an official complaint. The aquatics centre, one of the . largest in the country, is run by Serco and Manchester Sport and Leisure . Trust, part of Manchester council, which is investigating. The Equality Act 2010 has made it . illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place . such as a cafe, shop or public transport. However, it is not against the law to . prevent a woman breastfeeding where there are legitimate health and . safety risks. Although restaurants and cafes . generally do not have separate breastfeeding areas, some store chains . such as Tesco and Boots do provide dedicated areas away from women’s . toilets. Other businesses have begun displaying stickers on windows telling mothers that breastfeeding is welcome on the premises. New mother Stephanie Wilby was ordered to stop breastfeeding her four-month-old son Leo in a swimming pool at the Manchester Aquatic Centre after staff claimed feeding her son was 'indecent exposure' and similar to someone urinating in the pool . Councillor Rosa Battle, executive . member for culture and leisure at Manchester council, said: ‘We keenly . encourage new mothers to use our leisure facilities and they have every . right to breastfeed their babies when they need to do so, in line with . existing legislation. 'We have also asked that the Trust and Serco review their existing policies, to make sure that they reflect the law. ‘As a breastfeeding mother myself, I . expect staff contracted to work in our leisure facilities to understand . and respect women’s right to breastfeed in public places.’ A spokesman for Serco said: ‘We are fully supportive of mothers breastfeeding their child whilst in our centres. ‘Serco’s operating practices are to . encourage breastfeeding in a safe and comfortable environment for both . the mother and child rather than it taking place in the swimming pool. ‘We will fully investigate this . matter and where appropriate we will amend our policies and put in place . appropriate training for staff. ‘We apologise for any inconvenience that was caused.’ Tara Powell was asked to stop breastfeeding her son Preston at the Jobcentre in Bromley . The Mail Online revealed last Wednesday a mother of five burst into tears after she said she was kicked out of a Jobcentre for breastfeeding her baby. Tara Powell had taken her four-month-old son Preston with her to an appointment at the centre in Bromley, south-east London, where she was meeting to discuss her income support money. Miss Powell, of Orpington, said the interviewer then told her she felt 'uncomfortable'. But the mother replied: 'There's nothing uncomfortable about me breastfeeding my son, it's natural.' However the interviewer was said to have told her the breastfeeding was 'disgusting', adding: 'If you do not stop it, I'm terminating this interview'. Mrs Powell added: 'She was raising her voice then she kicked me out and ended the interview. 'I was crying because she did that to me.She kicked me out for breastfeeding my son. I have never ever felt so embarrassed.' Miss Powell said a manager apologised following the incident, and told her the appointment would have to be rebooked. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said Miss Powell was offered a private place to feed her baby after the meeting was ended, adding that the incident was being investigated.

Not only can excess sugar intake led to health problems and obesity, it can also make you look old too. A diet high in sugar can damage the skin leaving it more prone to wrinkles and dryness. Nutritionist Brooke Alpert and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris explain why in their new book, The Sugar Detox. They write: 'So, do people who eat too much sugar really look older? The answer is a resounding YES! In a large study published in the journal AGE, 602 people were examined by independent evaluators. Moment on the lips, lifetime on the face: Too much sugar can prematurely age your skin . 'Healthy people with lower blood sugars . typically looked a year younger than did those with higher blood sugars, . and a year and a half younger than did diabetics of the same age.' They explain: 'Too much sugar also has another negative effect on skin: Simply put, it makes skin unhealthy. Skin is our largest organ; one of its main functions, called barrier function, is to protect us from environmental insults such as pollution, dirt, bacteria, and fungi. 'Anything that disrupts the epidermal barrier leaves us more vulnerable to skin irritation and infections. Some very interesting recent studies have shown that long-term hyperglycemia (too much sugar in the blood) leaves skin more vulnerable. 'This explains why diabetics and others with long-standing hyperglycemia so often suffer with dry skin. This is why controlling your blood sugar is so important if you want healthy skin.' Pamper and protect: Nutritionist Brooke Alpert, left, and dermatologist Dr Patricia Farris have developed a diet plan and skincare regime to help people look younger . The pair explain how the skin begins to produce less collagen as we age, making it wrinkly and saggy, and poor nutrition can accelerate this process. But they believe sugar junkies still have time to turn back the clock by following their detox plan. As previously reported in the MailOnline, the plan begins with a strict three day diet of no sugar. On the low carb plan, dairy, fruit (with the exception of lemon and lime), starches, wheat and any added sugars are all banned. Some of these foods are then gradually reintroduced as the plan progresses. The pair say going 'cold turkey' for three days is the best way for people to start on the path of a life low in sugar. The foods they recommend are all beneficial for the body - and especially for the skin. For example, they suggest snacking on nuts because they are high in protein and other vitamins and minerals that help repair tissues in the body and boost collagen production. Turn back the clock: Swap coffee with added sugar for green tea . Process in a blender: . Apply a thin layer of the mixture to your face, leave on for ten minutes then wash off with warm water.Why . it works: The yogurt contains exfoliating lactic acid, oatmeal is a . natural anti-inflammatory, honey has healing properties and acts as a . natural moisturizer, and the blueberries contain powerful antioxidants. At meal times they recommend . regularly consuming fish high in Omega 3 such as salmon. This is because . they contain essential fatty acids that are 'the building blocks for . the natural moisturisers in your skin and help keep skin hydrated.' When . it comes to drinks, their superhero product for the skin is green tea - . which can also be used as an extract in moisturisers. They also . recommend using green tea bags as a compress on the eyes to reduce under . eye bags and puffiness. They . explain why it's so good for helping the skin look more youthful: . 'Studies have confirmed that ingestion of green tea extract effectively . blocks collagen cross-linking and inhibits AGE accumulation associated . with ageing. 'Green tea can also be prepared as an extract for use in cosmeceutical skin care. Topical green tea extract protects against UV-induced inflammation and oxidative stress, making it a powerful, topical skin care agent. Using skin-care products containing GTPs is an excellent way to inhibit collagen glycation and protect skin from damaging UV rays.' Read all about it: The Sugar Detox is available to buy as an ebook . As they are aware many will find the three day detox difficult, the book also includes DIY beauty treatments you can do at home over the three days to boost your mood and rejuvenate your skin. Their spa treatments include a sea mud mask, an 'ancient beauty bath', i.e. one where you soak in bathing salts, and a 'moisturising antioxidant mask'. This can either be bought in the shops (they provide a list of recommended products) or made yourself using their recipe (see pink box above, right). The aim of the treatments is to make people feel better with some pampering as they detox but also give their skin a head start on recovery before the benefits of the new diet kick in. Beyond the three day pampering, the pair outline a skincare regime that people should follow in tandem with their diet plan to look and feel good on the inside and out. They guarantee people who follow their advice will notice a difference in the appearance of their skin which will look younger and healthier. What could be sweeter than that?

Thousands of Syrians were treated for nerve gas symptoms following an alleged chemical attack in Damascus, the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has said today. Three hospitals in the city reported 355 deaths on Wednesday after around 3,600 people were admitted to hospital following exposure to a 'neurotoxic agent'. The Syrian opposition has accused . government forces of gassing hundreds of people by firing rockets that . released deadly fumes into rebel-held suburbs, killing men, women and . children as they slept. Bloody conflict: Medical charity Medicin Sans Frontieres said hospitals in Syria treated thousands of people for symptoms of inhaling nerve gas . Accusations: The Syrian opposition has accused the government of carrying out a deadly chemical attack on its own people . Confirmation: The charity said around 3,600 people in total were treated for nerve gas symptoms in Syria . Dispute: Syrian state television said soldiers found chemical materials on Saturday in tunnels that had been used by rebels . Battle: The bloody civil war continues to rage - pictured, an injured Syrian army soldier is evacuated following heavy clashes with rebels . Opposition estimates for the death toll have ranged from 500 to well over double that number, but, with U.N. observers unable to visit the site, there has been no independent verification. MSF has no staff of its own in the Damascus region, but has been supporting hospitals and medical networks there since 2012. 'The reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events - characterised by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers - strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent,' MSF director of operations Bart Janssens said in a statement. 'This would constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, which absolutely prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons.' Deadly attack: Activists say that somewhere between 200 and 1,300 were killed in a chemical weapons attack Wednesday near Damascus. Syria has one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons of any country . A new low: If the reports are true, the chemical attack Wednesday will have been the largest chemical attack on citizens since Saddam Hussein's gassing on ethnic Kurds in 1988 . Janssens said MSF could not confirm the cause of the symptoms or say who was responsible for the attack, but that it had sent 7,000 vials of atropine - an antidote against nerve agents. The Assad regime has denied allegations . that it was behind the attack, calling them 'absolutely baseless' and . suggesting they are an attempt to discredit the government. Syrian state media has accused rebels of using chemical arms against government troops trying to storm a contested area of Damascus. A major army offensive in recent days had forced the opposition fighters to resort to such weapons 'as their last card', it was claimed. Escalation: Angela Kane, the UN's high representative for disarmament, arrives in Damascus, Syria on Saturday to press President Bashar Assad to let UN investigators look into the reported chemical attack . At the ready: Four battleships have been moved to within striking range of Syria as President Obama weighs his options following a reported use of chemical weapons against citizens Wednesday . State TV broadcast images of plastic jugs, gas masks, vials of an unspecified medication, explosives and other items that it said were seized from rebel hideouts. It did not, however, show any video of soldiers reportedly affected by toxic gas in the fighting in the Jobar neighbourhood of Damascus. The attack has spurred demands for an independent investigation and renewed talk of potential international military action if chemical weapons were indeed used. Just hours before the state media reports, the UN disarmament chief arrived in Damascus to press President Bashar Assad's regime to allow UN experts to investigate Wednesday's alleged attack. The US, Britain, France and Russia have urged the Assad regime and the rebels fighting to overthrow him to co-operate with the United Nations and allow a team of experts already in Syria to look into the latest purported use of chemical agents. Counter accusations: The Syrian regime says allegations of a chemical attack are 'absolutely baseless' Tension: The apparent chemical attack on Wednesday has led to calls for Western powers to do more to end the bloodshed in Syria . Evidence: The Syrian government says it found canisters and other material in a rebel hideout . The UN secretary-general dispatched Angela Kane, the high representative for disarmament affairs, to push for a speedy investigation. She did not speak to reporters upon her arrival in Damascus Saturday. With the pressure increasing on the regime to comply, Syria's state media alleged today that rebels in the contested district of Jobar had used chemical weapons against government troops advancing into the area. The state news agency said several government troops who took part in an offensive experienced severe trouble breathing or even 'suffocation' after 'armed terrorist groups used chemical weapons.'","Medicins Sans Frontieres says victims were exposed to 'neurotoxic agent'

'Death preventable': Compulsive eater Mark Lawrence (pictured) choked to death on a chip after blundering care home staff housed him in a room next to an unmanned kitchen . A care home has been £150,000 after a compulsive eater choked to death on chips which he took from an unmanned kitchen, a court heard. Blundering staff housed 55-year-old Mark Lawrence in a room adjacent to the cooking area despite being fully aware of his disorder. When the kitchen was unmanned, he crept in and took a bowl of chips which were cooking in the oven. He was later found dead on his bed after choking on the food which he had crammed into his mouth. Today, a judge fined the owners of Mr Lawrence's care home £150,000 and ordered them to pay almost £50,000 in prosecution costs after hearing of the vulnerable man's death. The court heard that Mr Lawrence had previously eaten a dishwasher tablet, cat food, raw joints of meat, including chicken, and had also tried to stomach a rubber glove. He also ate half a bag of frozen Brussels sprouts and, just three weeks before his death, had to be treated by paramedics after choking on cheese. The home's owner, Caretech Services Ltd, was fined after admitting breaching regulations at the home in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Judge Patrick Eccles said: 'In my judgement, this is a death that was preventable and was foreseeable.' The local authority prosecuted Caretech Services Ltd under Health and Safety legislation, arguing that Mr Lawrence was should not have been placed in such a position next to the kitchen. Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Lawrence had an obsessive-compulsive eating disorder, which had been recognised at least since 2003. 'It involved compulsive overfilling of his mouth. Mr Lawrence had been known to eat raw meat, raw chicken and even cat food. He would eat anything if it was in front of him. He didn’t chew his food and was known to be at risk of choking.' Mr Lawrence, who was originally from Surrey, had a number of mental health problems and learning difficulties, but was said to be generally polite, well-mannered and well-liked. He was on one-to-one supervision, particularly during meal times, when he was given liquidised food. His compulsive eating was compounded by a fixation on opening cupboards and the oven, 'presumably looking for food', the judge was told. The fridge and cupboards were locked, but not the kitchen or oven. 'Shortcomings': Owners of the now-closed care home (pictured) in Banbury, Oxfordshire, have been fined £150,000 after admitting a breach of health and safety regulations . Mr Berlin said at 5.45am on March 9, 2008, Mr Lawrence fell down the stairs at Greenacres, the small home in Banbury, where he had lived for 12 years. Despite suffering a broken arm and screaming in pain, paramedics were not called by staff until 8am, when the home's manager Deborah Bleach arrived. Mr Berlin said: 'He was thereafter put, as a temporary measure, from his upstairs bedroom to a room downstairs, which was previously the dining room and was of course very close to the kitchen. 'It was 140cm from the oven to his bedroom. It was an inappropriate place to put him.' He said that while a risk assessment was carried out in relation to Mr Lawrence’s mobility, none was carried out concerning his eating compulsion and the location of his new room. Although the move was meant to be temporary, it remained in that room until his death in May 2009. At 5pm on March 28, 2009, support worker Bonny Mukababege was baking some chips in the oven. She was called to deal with another resident and when she returned minutes later she found the oven empty, and chips on the kitchen floor. 'She went to Mark’s room and saw him slumped on his bed. There were chips in his mouth,' said Mr Berlin. Prosecutor Barry Berlin . Ms Mukababege tried to remove the chips, but she and her colleague were unable to revive Mr Lawrence. Paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead. Investigators from Cherwell District Council found Caretech staff had not reported Mr Lawrence’s fall down the stairs breaching official regulations. Keith Morton QC, representing Caretech, extended the sincere condolences of the directors of the company towards Mr Lawrence’s family and friends. He said the firm had cared for around 5,000 vulnerable adults and children since it was founded in 1993 and that it took its responsibilities to those in its care very seriously. 'The circumstances surrounding the death of Mark Lawrence reveal shortcomings which should not have occurred and for which the company wishes to apologise,' he said. 'The company has admitted that the shortcomings were a cause of Mr Lawrence’s death. 'There was a failure to review the risk assessment with regard to his propensity to eat food. There was a failure to enforce the control measures that had been identified.' He stressed that Mr Lawrence had been happy at Greenacres and after his fall his family had not wanted him moved to another establishment. He also said that since the incident Caretech, which runs more than 150 homes, had imposed new structures within the company and invested heavily to ensure there would not be a repeat incident. Judge Eccles added: 'Those failures led to his untimely and shocking death. There were failures to respond appropriately to what are described as ""near misses"".' Yet he acknowledged the company’s previous record, its response to the incident and its guilty plea. For breaching Health and Safety regulations he fined Caretech £140,000. For the breach of the reporting of injury regulations, he fined them an additional £10,000. Caretech must also pay court costs of £48,540 pounds and a £15 pounds victim surcharge. Greenacres is now empty and no longer belongs to Caretech. A spokesman for Cherwell District Council said: 'We trust that the outcome will serve to underline the inadequate care and attention paid to those disabled people who have the misfortune to experience life in sub-standard care homes in this country. We also hope it will obviate any further tragedy such as we have endured.'","Blundering staff housed Mark Lawrence next to eating area despite disorder .

Stress fuels cancer by triggering a 'master switch' gene which allows the disease to spread, according to new research. The 'unexpected' discovery could lead to the development of drugs that target the protein and stop tumours spreading to other organs and causing death. Stress has long been linked to many forms of the disease including breast and prostate cancer, but the reason has remained a mystery. Doctors have discovered the 'stress gene' ATF3 can make immune cells behave erratically, giving cancer an 'escape route' to other areas of the body . Now a team at Ohio State University say our own bodies help turn cancer against us by turning on a 'master switch' gene known as ATF3 which is expressed in response to stressful conditions in all types of cells. Usually, it causes normal and benign cells to commit suicide if they decide they have been irrevocably damaged. But cancer cells somehow coax immune-system cells recruited to the site of a tumour to express ATF3. It is unclear exactly how, but the gene promotes the immune cells to act erratically and give cancer an escape route to other areas of the body. Professor Tsonwin Hai said: 'If your body does not help cancer cells, they cannot spread as far. So really, the rest of the cells in the body help cancer cells to move, to set up shop at distant sites. And one of the unifying themes here is stress.' Her researchers first linked the expression of ATF3 in immune-system cells to worse outcomes among a sample of almost 300 breast cancer patients. Experiments on mice then found those lacking the gene had less extensive spread of breast tumour cells to their lungs than ones that could activate it. 'The cancer cells were always the same, but we had different hosts. The primary tumors were similar in size, but only in the host that can express ATF3 - the stress gene - did the cancer cells metastasize efficiently. The 'stress gene' could one day function as a drug target to combat cancer spread . 'This suggests that the host stress response can help cancer to metastasize. 'If the body is in perfect balance, there isn't much of a problem. When the body gets stressed, that changes the immune system. And the immune system is a double-edged sword,' she said. In general, when cancer cells first appear, the immune system recognises them as foreign and various immune cells travel to the site to attack them. Prof Hai said if further research bear out the results 'the stress gene could one day function as a drug target to combat cancer spread, or metastasis as it is known medically.' Meanwhile, the results published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation provide important insights into how tumour cells use their signalling power to co-opt the rest of the body into aiding cancer's survival and movement to distant organs. Although the work suggests a drug to dampen ATF3's effect could lower the risk for metastasis, Prof Hai noted scientists do not fully understand what the overall effects would be. She said: 'We have this gene for a reason. It is a gene that helps us adapt to changes. So it is a question of how and when to target ATF3.' Another new study has found restricting calories for a set period of time - combined with targeted cancer therapy - can increase the success of cancer treatment in mice. The journal Blood reports that we eat, the body metabolises food to produce energy and assist in the building of proteins. If . we consume less, the amount of nutrients available to the body's cells . are reduced, which slows the metabolic process and limits the function of . certain proteins - including one protein associated with several cancers. Dr . Jean-Ehrland Ricci, of the French Institute for Health and Medical . Research in Nice, said: 'By . understanding the link between metabolism and the body's natural cancer . suppressors and activators, we can perhaps improve the efficacy of . therapy and improve survival for patients suffering from specific types . of cancer.' Although more research in a clinical setting is needed, the promising results are believed to apply to humans too. 'We . next want to examine what component of a reduced-calorie diet - fats, . sugars, or another food compound - influenced the lymphoma cells' improved sensitivity to treatment.'","Study found that stress triggers a 'master switch' gene called ATF3 .

A 25-year-old Oklahoma prison inmate who has spent his entire adult life behind bars is suing the state Corrections Department over claims he was forced to have sex '50 to 100 times' with his caseworker. Philip Thomas Burris Jr. says he had no choice but to have sex with 38-year-old Kasey McDonald whenever she demanded it while he was serving at Joseph Harp Correctional Center, a medium-security facility in Lexington, Oklahoma. McDonald was arrested last year on rape charges after prison officials obtained a recording of a phone call between her and Burris that included her making sexually explicit comments to him. Charged: Kasey McDonald, 38, was arrested last year on charges he forced Philip Thomas Burris to have sex with her and brought marijuana into the prison . Allegations: Philip Thomas Burris Jr., 25, says he was forced to have sex with McDonald, his caseworker, 50 to 100 times between January 2010 and June 2012 . Any sex between an inmate an a Corrections Department employee is considered rape under Oklahoma law. The Oklahoman newspaper reports that Burris claims that none of the sex with McDonald was consensual. His lawyer says that if he had been in a position to refuse McDonald, he would have. 'These things happen,' Corrections Department spokesman Jerry Massie told the newspaper. 'I would say every prison system in the country has to deal with this problem.' The state prison system handles four to five cases of sex between prison workers and inmates every year. In his federal lawsuit, Burris says McDonald began demanding sex in January 2010 when Burris was 22. Burris was being held at Joseph Harp Correctional Center, a medium-security facility, on charges of attempted robbery and burglary . The inmate, who has three swastikas tattooed on his body - including a large symbol with lightning bolts and the words 'Soldier Born' on his chest - is serving a 13 year sentence for attempted armed robbery, burglary, vehicle theft and weapons possession. He began serving his prison term in 2007, at age 19. Burris told investigators that he had sex with McDonald in her office at Joseph Harp Correctional Center and also in the adjacent office. McDonald was arrested in June 2012 for the sexual contact with Burris. She is also accused of smuggling a cellphone into the prison and with supplying marijuana to prisoners. In a police interview, she admitted to having sex with Burris, but denied the contraband charges. McDonald, whose police booking records indicate is 5-foot-4 and 240 pounds, is still contending the criminal charges in court.","Philip Thomas Burris Jr., 25, said he had no choice but to have sex with the woman who oversaw his case .

Dressed head-to-toe in a festive berry shade the Duchess of Cambridge couldn't stop beaming as she celebrated her first Christmas at Sandringham. All eyes were on the 29-year-old as she attended a community service with her husband, Prince William yesterday morning. She teamed a simple knee-length frock coat with black £180 platforms from LK Bennett, but the real head turner was a hat by milliner Jane Corbett, who regularly creates pieces for the Middleton family. A pair of diamond drop earrings – possibly a Christmas present - were also on display as she wore her hair in a half up, half down creation . Other members of the royal family who attended the private service included the Queen, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge. Kate's presence helped attract a record 3,000 well-wishers to St Mary Magdalene church on the Norfolk estate and police were on hand to manage crowds. The Queen opted for a lavender wool boucle coat by her dressmaker Karl Ludwig, upon which she had pinned a diamond shell brooch with a pearl at the centre, with a matching white and ivory hat by Angela Kelly. She accepted dozens of bouquets helped by three of her grandchildren, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and the Wessexes’ daughter Lady Louise Windsor. Zara Philips, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie also looked elegant in understated ensembles.with clutch bags to hand. Zara  – who now uses the surname Tindall – attended the traditional event with her husband,  Mike, wearing a black collared coat topped with a . black ruched hat. Sisters Beatrice and Eugenie, who accompanied their father Prince Andrew, both selected smart double breasted pea coats in shades of black and grey accessorised with matching berets. Many were eager to hear about Prince Philip's health after the 90-year-old was admitted to Papworth Hospital in Cambridge last Friday after suffering chest pains. Greeting members of the public, Prince . Charles told Carmilla Fitt, 71, from Dover, that his father’s health . was ‘coming on’. He added: ‘He is very well and in very good spirits. He . is very determined.’ Asked . by other wellwishers about his grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge said . he was ‘very well, thank you – getting much better’. Commentators were surprised by the turnout on Christmas Day, and thousands of fans battled to get a photograph of the Duchess as she walked along the church pathway. Alison Croose, from King’s Lynn, said: ‘I have not seen crowds like this since back into the Diana days.

Christmas lunch and, of course, the Queen’s Speech on television, the . royal grandchildren left the family gathering to visit Prince Philip in . hospital, arriving at 4.14pm. William . drove his cousins, Peter Phillips and his sister Zara, in a Land Rover. Behind him Prince Harry was at the wheel of another 4X4 accompanied by . Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. The group stayed for 45 minutes – just enough to raise the elderly duke’s spirits on Christmas Day without tiring him out – before returning to Sandringham. Buckingham Palace officials said Philip ‘remains in good spirits’ and added: ‘The Queen will continue to be briefed on his condition. We do not have details of a release date at this stage.’ The duke was airlifted to hospital on Friday night after complaining of severe chest pains and was discovered to have a blocked artery which was starving his heart of oxygen. He underwent a ‘minor’ invasive procedure under local anaesthetic to insert a stent into the artery, freeing the flow of blood. The prognosis is extremely good, although doctors are understandably cautious about a man of his age.

Sadly, she said, it often brought tragedy to bring out the best in people but stressed that in time of hardship, families provided the strength to see the hard times through. ‘In this past year my family and I have been inspired by the courage and hope we have seen in so many ways in Britain, in the Commonwealth and around the world,’ she said. ‘We’ve seen that it’s in hardship that . we often find strength from our families; it’s in adversity that new . friendships are sometimes formed; and it’s in a crisis that communities . break down barriers and bind together to help one another. ‘Families, . friends and communities often find a source of courage rising up from . within. Indeed, sadly, it seems that it is tragedy that often draws out . the most and the best from the human spirit.’ Christmas cheer: Prince Harry beamed as he met the crowds who offered the Royal family flowers and well-wishes while Zara looked chic in a black ruched hat . Adored: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is presented with a rose by a little girl . Wrapped up warm: Princess Eugenie of York and pregnant Autumn Phillips waited outside the church after the service and prayers for Prince Philip . She . added: ‘The importance of family has, of course, come home to Prince . Philip and me personally this year with the marriages of two of our . grandchildren, each in their own way a celebration of the God-given love . that binds a family together. ‘For . many this Christmas will not be easy. With our Armed Forces deployed . around the world, thousands of service families face Christmas without . their loved ones at home. The bereaved and the lonely will find it . especially hard. And, as we all know, the world is going through . difficult times.’ With his elder brother taken off the market, it was Prince Harry who was the subject of most female attention. Several shrieking girls in the crowd  tried to attract the 27-year-old prince’s attention. He obliged by giving one a kiss. Inundated with requests from other fans, he blushed and said: ‘I can’t give you a kiss. I’ve already kissed her.’ Also in the royal party, Canadian-born Autumn Phillips – daughter-in-law of Princess Anne – patted her bump protectively.

Twelve have been on three times and a whopping 225 have appeared twice. In 1992, John Major became the first, and only, serving Prime Minister to have appeared on the show. When programme researchers invited Alistair MacLean on to the programme, they were expecting the best-selling author of books such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns Of Navarone. Unfortunately, by mistake they invited Alastair MacLean, the European director of tourism for Ontario, Canada. Ever the gentleman, Roy Plomley, the original presenter and creator of the show, covered up the error and the interview went ahead anyway, although it was never broadcast. Guidebook author Alfred Wainwright agreed to go on the show in 1988 on condition that Sue Lawley went to Manchester to record the programme, as he refused to go to London. A friend drove him to the studio and on the way they had to stop at Harry Ramsden’s for fish and chips. For his ‘book’ he chose two photographs: one of his wife and the other of the 1928 Blackburn Rovers FC team. One listener wrote in to criticise the emphasis on famous guests and offered himself instead. ‘As a retired Post Office worker,’ he wrote, ‘I think I qualify and I enclose a list of my eight records. I am available most days except Thursdays, when I go to Old Time dancing.’ THE THINGS THEY SAID . Lauren Bacall (1979) was a difficult guest. When Plomley asked her to pick just one of her eight records, she exploded. ‘What is this? You said I had eight records. Now you’re saying I only have one?’ Jack Lemmon (1989) revealed that his mother was so keen to finish  her bridge game that he ended up being born in a lift, while Fay Weldon (2010) said she believed she has psychic powers. In 2002 Gordon Ramsay told presenter Sue Lawley he’d played first-team football for Rangers: ‘I got my first-team games. I was with the first-team squad. I played three first team games.’ It was later reported that, according to the club, he was just a trialist: ‘He trained with us for a few months but then got injured.’ Iain Duncan Smith (2002) revealed that his father was once chatted up by Marilyn Monroe. ‘I’m told nothing happened, but that’s what my mother tells me, so I’m not quite certain.’ Wendy Richard (1995) didn’t like being asked anything other than anodyne questions. She stopped Sue Lawley four times in the course of the recording and was distressed when she wasn’t allowed to take her pet Cairn terrier to the island as a luxury. ‘She asked why the dog was such a life-and-death business,’ said the actress, ‘and I told her the truth: because she is my best friend. I had to take my tapestries instead.’ Cowell's Collins and mirror: Simon Cowell is the only castaway to have picked Jackie Collins's Hollywood Wives for reading material and a mirror as his luxury item . DISCS . The . most popular classical works from which excerpts have been picked are . Mozart’s The Marriage Of Figaro and Handel’s Messiah, which have both . been chosen 109 times. The most popular hymn is Ave Maria, having been . selected 42 times. Topping . the Christmas carols list are In The Bleak Midwinter, Once In Royal . David’s City and Silent Night, all on 13. Where words have been chosen . over music, Dylan Thomas comes out on top, being selected 45 times. T. S. Eliot is second, on 17, and Sir John Betjeman third, on nine. The . only castaway to choose silence as a record was poet Ian McMillan, who . picked John Cage’s 4’33 which is, of course, four minutes 33 seconds of . silence. It was also his favourite record. Only a few seconds were . played, during which McMillan’s stomach was heard to rumble. A number of castaways have chosen . recorded sounds. Ann Widdecombe chose those of a hippo. Ice skater Robin . Cousins chose the Thunderbirds theme tune by Barry Gray. Nigella Lawson . was the only castaway to choose a song by the cartoon pop band The . Archies. Patrick Stewart was so keen to appear on the show that he . claimed to have carried around a list of his choices. Fortunately for . him, he was picked in 2005. The former Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, . who was said to have kept a permanent selection in his top pocket, never . did appear. In 2006, when David Cameron picked . This Charming Man by The Smiths, the group’s guitarist, Johnny Marr, was . angry enough to tell the future Prime Minister to stop saying he was a . fan of the group. Cameron also chose Benny Hill’s Ernie (The Fastest . Milkman In The West), which he said was the only song whose words he . could remember. Liar, liar: When Gordon Ramsay was a guest in 2002 he said he played first-team football for Rangers . THOSE WHO CHOSE THEIR OWN WORK . In . 1981 Princess Grace of Monaco chose a recording of herself and actor . Richard Pasco delivering The Proud Horse from Shakespeare’s poem Venus . And Adonis. And in 1990 Barbara Windsor picked herself singing the theme . song from the film Sparrows Can’t Sing, in which she starred. Max . Bygraves (1955) couldn’t resist himself singing You’re A Pink . Toothbrush, while in 2011 Professor Brian Cox chose King Of Spades by . Dare, a band of which he was a member. Emma . Thompson (2010) looked to her own father for inspiration, choosing . Florence, It’s A Lovely Morning, from the film version of The Magic . Roundabout, which was created by her father Eric. LUXURY ITEMS . Archies fan: Nigella Lawson . The luxury item was introduced in 1951. The first castaway to choose one was actress Sally Ann Howes, who went on to play Truly Scrumptious in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Her luxury was garlic. The only time a castaway has been allowed to take a living person as a luxury was when Dame Edna Everage insisted on taking her bridesmaid, Madge Allsop. According to the then presenter, Sue Lawley, ‘I reminded her that the luxury had to be an inanimate object. She assured me that Madge was exactly that. So I allowed it.’ When David Dimbleby was asked in 2008 by presenter Kirsty Young for his luxury, he replied, ‘I’ll take you.’ Duncan Goodhew chose a wig, and when Morecambe and Wise appeared on the show, Eric chose a deckchair and Ernie chose a deckchair ticket-machine. Julian Clary chose an all-purpose prosthetic arm, Alison Steadman went for hot lemon flannels (as provided in Chinese restaurants), and Kathy Burke picked a life-size laminated photo of James Caan from Dragons’ Den, on which she planned to bodysurf. John Cleese wanted Michael Palin (stuffed), Noel Edmonds chose a motorway service station and while Helen Mirren opted for silk underwear, Sue Lawley requested an iron and ironing board when she was a castaway. Ian McEwan asked for Italian hand-stitched walking boots, but Lynn Barber insisted she needed a cyanide pill. Kevin Whately couldn’t live without Northumbrian bagpipes and Simon Cowell chose a mirror. BOOKS . The most popular novelist is Charles Dickens, chosen by 61 castaways, followed by Leo Tolstoy on 50 and Marcel Proust on 48. Prunella Scales chose Shakespeare’s complete works in  German, as well as the complete works in English automatically offered. Simon Cowell is the only castaway to have picked Jackie Collins’s Hollywood Wives. George Clooney (2003) chose Tolstoy’s War And Peace as his book, ‘as there may not be toilet paper . . . and that’s a huge book’. Some castaways are not great readers. Showjumper Harvey Smith told Plomley: ‘I’ve never read a book in my life and I don’t intend to start for you, sir’, while Jamie Oliver admitted, ‘I don’t read books’, and instead requested note-paper and pens to write recipes. THE THEME TUNE . Eric Coates’s By The Sleepy Lagoon has always been the show’s theme tune. It was inspired by a view from  Bognor Regis.

Sarah Murnaghan, the 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl whose need for new lungs sparked a national debate on how donor organs are prioritized, is finally back at home after six months in the hospital. A family spokeswoman has said Sarah was discharged today from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She later was carried into her family's Newtown Square home, where the entrance was festooned with balloons and bore a big sign saying 'Welcome Home, Sarah!' Scroll down for video . After SIX months in the hospital and agonizing surgeries, 11-year-old Sarah Murnaghan finally arrives home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania . We've been tracking the 11-year-old girl's battle with cystic fibrosis since June, when her family began a public campaign to get their little girl a new set of lungs . Sarah received two sets of lungs this summer as she struggles with the effects of end-stage cystic fibrosis. The operations came after a federal judge intervened in her parents' lawsuit challenging national transplant rules that put her at the end of the waiting list for adult lungs. Hmother, Janet Murnaghan, wrote in a Facebook post late Monday that she and her daughter had 'cried tears of joy' and wrote: 'WE ARE GOING HOME TOMORROW'. 'We entered CHOP on Feb. 19, more than six months ago. I never could have imagined the journey that lay in front of us,' Murnaghan wrote in the post, thanking God, Sarah's donors and all those who supported the family. She said she plans to speak with reporters today.

On Sunday, Murnaghan said her daughter was taken off oxygen, although she still gets support from a machine that helps her to breathe, and had started to walk with the aid of a walker, even venturing outside. 'My sister pointed out that today is our Mom's birthday - she died 11 years ago,' Murnaghan wrote Saturday on her Facebook page.

Out-of-hours GPs are being left to care on their own for up to half a million patients. Cost-cutting NHS chiefs are routinely assigning just one family doctor to districts that stretch over hundreds of square miles. A third of primary care trusts, which manage GP services, have slashed night and weekend spending over the past 12 months. On call: A third of primary care trusts, which manage GP services, have cut night and weekend spending (file) In Cornwall, some nights have seen one GP looking after 535,000 patients. In Mid Essex just one doctor is in charge of 370,000 between 7pm and 8am. And after axing one of its two doctors, North East Essex has the same cover for the 325,000 patients on its books. Stuart Gray, a GP whose father was killed in 2008 by an incompetent locum doctor, said: ‘I am appalled but not surprised. ‘It would appear some trusts really don’t care about patient safety or put it high on their agenda. I fear many PCT managers are driven by their desire to balance the books. This is morally repugnant. ‘Patients are still put at unacceptable risk by apparently negligent practices.’ The standard of out-of-hours care has been under scrutiny since 2004 when a new contract enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend duties. Now only one in four works out of hours. 'Appalled but not surprised': Stuart Gray, a GP whose father was killed by an incompetent locum doctor . Many trusts have since outsourced the cover to private firms who hire locum – or temporary – doctors to fill the shifts. Trusts have been found to be employing doctors from overseas without checking they have the necessary skills or can even speak English. 'I fear many PCT managers are driven by their desire to balance the books. This is morally repugnant' Stuart Gray, GP whose father was killed by incompetent locum doctor . In 2008, Dr Gray’s pensioner father David, from Cambridgeshire, died after a German doctor, Daniel Ubani, gave him ten times the recommended dose of a painkiller. It later emerged Ubani had been hired by Take Care Now, a private firm which had not carried out any checks on him. Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Mail asked every PCT in England a series of questions about out-of-hours cover. Of the 90 that responded, 35 had slashed their out-of-hours budgets in the past year. The average cut was 10 per cent. Coverage: 11 trusts employed only one doctor at night to cover between 180,000 and 535,000 patients (file) And 11 trusts employed only one doctor at night to cover between 180,000 and 535,000 patients. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association, said: ‘These stark figures confirm what patients are telling us - it is incredibly difficult to get access to a GP out of hours either to talk by phone or to arrange a home visit.’ A spokesman from Serco, the private firm which runs out-of-hours cover in Cornwall, said there had been a ‘limited’ number of occasions in the past year when just one GP was on call. 'It is incredibly difficult to get access to a GP out of hours either to talk by phone or to arrange a home visit' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association . He said Serco now ensured there were at least two GPs on call at night to cover all of the county’s 1,316 square miles. In addition at least five nurses and paramedics are on duty in cars. Surgeries should provide a separate out-of-hours number and patients can also call NHS Direct. GPs now have to provide care between 8am and 6.30pm only. Usually locums are based at an out-of-hours clinic for the duration of the night and will only make a handful of home visits to more serious cases. A Department of Health spokesman said local NHS groups were obliged to ensure high quality care was in place and should take action over any failings.","A third of primary care trusts have slashed night and weekend spending .

An elderly woman driver who had broken down in the middle of a motorway was killed when a Porsche car slammed into her vehicle and caused it to burst into flames, a jury heard today. Mollie Haines, 73, was killed when her stranded Nissan Almera was struck from behind by 48-year-old Daniel Mitchell’s Porsche Cayenne on the M40 near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. The collision’s force sent her vehicle spinning along the southbound carriageway, before it burst into flames. Mitchell was today accused in court of falling below the standard expected of a careful driver. Trial: Mollie Haines (left), 73, was killed when her stranded Nissan Almera was struck from behind by Daniel Mitchell (right)’s Porsche Cayenne on the M40 motorway near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in July 2012 . Judge Francis Sheridan told jurors it was ‘a very sad case’ but warned them to consider the evidence clinically and not emotionally. Rachel Drake, prosecuting, said: ‘The Crown says the death of Mollie Haines was caused by the careless driving of the defendant. ‘The only issue in this case is whether or not Mr Mitchell’s driving was without due care and attention. There’s no question but that the collision was the cause of Mrs Haines’s death. ‘The question is whether Mr Mitchell’s driving was careless. The assessment you have to make is whether or not you are sure his driving fell below the standard of a careful, competent and prudent driver.’ She explained the case concerned events shortly before 10am on July 18 last year. Mrs Haines had, along with a lot of other drivers, been stuck in stationary traffic on the southbound M40. Fireball: The collision's force sent Mrs Haines's vehicle spinning along the southbound carriageway of the M40 motorway, before it burst into flames . ‘She was in the second lane,’ said Miss Drake. ‘Unfortunately when the obstruction cleared and traffic began to flow freely again, she was unable to restart her car. So she was stationary in the second lane with traffic flowing around her.’ Jurors heard that a number of drivers will give evidence about seeing the Nissan and some about manoeuvring round it. One stopped on the hard shoulder and called the police to alert them. Mrs Haines, who had illuminated her flashing hazard lights, contacted the AA, and her call and the other driver’s 999 alert prompted a highways camera operator to zoom in on her car. ‘The Crown say you can actually see the point where the Porsche Cayenne collides with the back of the Nissan Almera, causing it to spin and burst into flame,’ Miss Drake said. ‘As a consequence of the impact Mrs Haines died immediately.’ Wreckage: The jury was told it would also hear evidence about whether Mitchell had been changing lanes shortly before the collision on the M40 motorway near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire . She showed the jurors footage from the camera in which the vehicles could be seen passing the Nissan, before the car was propelled towards the hard shoulder and flames appeared in the road and the car. 'There’s nothing to say. I didn’t see her' What Daniel Mitchell allegedly told police at the scene following the crash . Mrs Haines’s husband and children left the court while the footage was screened. Mitchell, a truck driver, had been on his way to work when the collision occurred. After the impact he managed to get out of his car but needed treatment to an injured wrist. Police officers arrested him while he was still in the back of the ambulance at the scene, and he responded: ‘There’s nothing to say. I didn’t see her.’ He was taken to hospital but later discharged himself and was taken to High Wycombe police station for questioning. Investigation: Mitchell was today accused in court of falling below the standard expected of a careful driver . He said: ‘All I remember is looking and noticing the car in front is stationary. I don’t think I even had a chance to swerve.’ He told investigators he was used to driving a speed-limited lorry and when driving in his car he would normally travel between 60 and 70mph. But Miss Drake said experts had calculated he was more likely to have been travelling between 75 and 80mph. The jury was told it would also hear evidence about whether Mitchell, of Flackwell Heath, Buckinghamshire, had been changing lanes shortly before the collision. The trial, at Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting in Amersham, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mollie Haines, 73, killed when her stranded Nissan Almera was struck .

Does your other half constantly put you down or treat you badly - then when you react, act as if YOU are the crazy one and accuse you of being 'oversensitive' or 'paranoid'? Worse still, have you started to believe them? If so, you may be the victim of 'gaslighting'. ‘Gaslighting’ describes any relationship with a power imbalance, where one partner emotionally manipulates the other into doubting their own perception of reality. The term has in fact been around for over 60 years - it comes from . the play Gaslight which was made into a film in 1944, starring Ingrid Bergman. In the movie, Bergman's husband tricks her into thinking she's going insane. 'Gaslighting' is where one partner manipulates the other into doubting their own perception of reality. However, it's become a psychology buzzword recently, with psychologists recognising and publishing on the subject. Now, writer Elizabeth Forbes has tackled the phenomenon in her new novel, The Nearest Thing To Crazy. In the book, a novelist moves to a new village and finds herself prey to emotional abuse. The main theme of the book is about psychological manipulation - in . other words, gaslighting - used to undermine someone to the extent that they begin to doubt their sanity . Although it can occur in any relationship; within families, between boss and employee and even friends, it most commonly occurs within romantic relationships. According to psychologists, men most often target women in this way, although some women are 'gaslighters' too. More... Disturbing new surgery trend creates permanent Joker-style smiles in Korea . Are women creating their OWN glass ceiling? Survey finds lack of confidence holds 48 per cent back in workplace . Yes men DO notice a woman's breasts the first time they meet her (but not until after they have appreciated her eyes and smile) Speaking to MailOnline, author Elizabeth Forbes says the image of a weak victim is entirely wrong for gaslighting: ‘The women I’ve talked to who have experienced gaslighting abuse are often strong, intelligent women. ‘It is almost as if their developed sense of rationality acts as a conduit for the abuse to flourish. One judges other people’s behaviour by the standards we set for ourselves, and if we wouldn’t lie about such things, if we would consider such manipulation to be devious and immoral, we find it difficult to believe that others could behave in such a way, especially those who profess to love us. Ingrid Bergman starred in the film 'Gaslight' in which she is tricked by her husband into believing she is mad and has lost touch with reality . New novel 'Nearest thing to Crazy' by Elizabeth Forbes (pictured left) tells the story of a woman who becomes prey to gaslighting . 'It is more logical, perhaps, to accept that the fault must lie with ourselves.’ Additionally Elizabeth explains that the dynamic develops subtly: . ‘Gaslighters keep their victims close, and the abuse starts off slowly, almost imperceptibly until it escalates to a level where the victim’s self-doubt trumps all else. ‘No one else would have you...’ ‘I don’t know why I put up with you you’re such a screwed up mess...’ ‘You’re lucky I don’t leave you...’ While it might be easy to advise reaching out to others to help the person reassert their worth, and confirm that they are not irrational and that it is their partner who is behaving badly, this is not always easy. So, the man in your life says to you: ‘I did NOT have my hand on her bosom! Honestly, I don’t know how you could say such a thing.’ But you saw it with your own eyes. ‘I don’t know how you could accuse me of that. I love you, I feel really hurt that you should even think that.’ You know you saw it. But he’s so vehement, so convincing, that there’s just a teeny little shadow of doubt. Could you be wrong? Was the light playing tricks? He wouldn’t lie to you so convincingly, or be so obviously affronted, would he? Could he? Another time he says: ‘I told you I wasn’t going to be home until after midnight... that I’d got a meeting out of town. Your memory is so bad these days – I’m beginning to worry about you.’ And actually, you know that your memory isn’t what it was. So perhaps he’s right. The fact is that these seemingly innocuous incidents can begin to wear you down; taken to extremes, over a prolonged period of time, they can begin to make you doubt your sanity. Elizabeth explains: ‘When one’s sanity is questioned to the extent that one begins to believe it might be crumbling, talking to friends can also be a terrifying option. ‘What if they confirm our neuroses, albeit in a clumsily well-meaning way that they imagine will make us feel better? ‘I’m sure he wouldn’t do that. It’s obvious how much he loves you.’ Or the oft quoted response: ‘my husband does exactly the same... it’s normal marriage. Just ignore it.’ ‘And once more the victim’s view of herself as irrational and neurotic is confirmed.’ Psychologist and relationship expert Susan Quilliam says: ‘Gaslighting usually happens when one partner feels threatened or wrong footed in their life for some reason’ ‘It may not be deliberate or conscious, but their realty becomes more important than their partners. 'The relationship may have been good for years, and continue to have positive aspects, so the other partner has no reason to believe that their partner is imposing his reality onto them. ‘It is a type of bullying and the longer it goes on the more they buy into the partner’s reality and lose their own. ‘What keeps it going is silence on behalf of the partner being bullied. My advice for anyone in this situation would be to seek someone objective to talk to about it, then speak to your partner about it, preferably with evidence of their behaviours.’ The Nearest Thing To Crazy by Elizabeth Forbes is published by Cutting Edge Press and is available on Amazon.","'Gaslighting' involved tricking someone into doubting their own sanity .

Nigella Lawson has finally broken her silence two months after she was pictured being throttled by husband Charles Saatchi. The TV chef took to Twitter last night to share a photograph of a cake she'd made to mark the return of The Great British Bake Off. She made no reference to the high-profile dispute, nor to her impending divorce from her art-collecting billionaire husband. Return: Nigella Lawson tweeted last night for the first time since her public row with husband Charles Saatchi . Home-made: The TV chef baked this Victoria sponge to celebrate the return of the BBC2 show . Since the pictures of Mr Saatchi with his hand on Ms Lawson's neck were published by a Sunday newspaper in June this year, the chef has made no public comment. By contrast, the advertising mogul has repeatedly spoken out over the controversy - including an announcement that he was divorcing his wife of 10 years. Ms Lawson returned to her micro-blogging account yesterday, writing: 'Yum: settling down to The Great British Bake Off with a slice of this blackcurrant Victoria sponge #GBBO'. When one of her 430,000 followers asked whether she had baked the cake herself or bought it in a shop, she replied: 'I MADE IT - though it wouldn't get me far in the #GBBO!' Couple: Mr Saatchi and Ms Lawson are divorcing after he was pictured with his hand on her neck . Ms Lawson then retweeted a quirky message from the official account of BBC quiz show QI. The tweet read: 'Elizabethan ladies kept apple slices under their armpits to absorb sweat, before passing them to potential suitors as keepsakes.' The chef had previously tweeted just once since the scandal broke, sharing a photograph of her son Bruno's birthday cake without any accompanying comment. The Great British Bake Off, whose fourth series began last night on BBC2, has become embroiled in its own love split row after co-presenter Paul Hollywood left his wife for colleague Marcella Valladolid. Ms Lawson has repeatedly been pictured in public as she has moved her belongings out of the home she shared with Mr Saatchi, but has refused to comment on her divorce. Return: Ms Lawson tweeted while watching The Great British Bake Off, starring Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry . Mr Saatchi - who has frequently returned to Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, the scene of the argument with his wife - initially tried to dismiss the fight as nothing more than a 'playful tiff'. He drew increasing ire from campaigners who accused him of trivialising domestic violence as he continued to defend himself.

The couple were granted a decree nisi three weeks ago, nearly a decade after they married in September 2003 following the death of Ms Lawson's first husband John Diamond. Since the divorce, Mr Saatchi's teenage daughter has complained that Ms Lawson had effectively abandoned her, while friends of the art collector suggested that he was nursing suicidal thoughts.","TV chef takes to Twitter to share photograph of home-made cake .

Officials say a bear that attacked a 12-year-old girl near Cadillac earlier this month is not the same one that was shot two days later a couple of miles away. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources said that DNA from the bear's carcass did not match fur and saliva samples taken from clothing that Abby Wetherell was wearing when she was attacked and mauled on August 15th. The tests showed that the bear that harmed Abby was a female, while the bear that was killed was a male. Brave: Abby Wetherell, from Michigan, miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back . Injuries: The animal knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help . Abby was jogging on a trail near her . grandfather's cabin in a wooded area of Wexford County when the bear . came after her. About 100 stitches were needed to close her wounds. She . sped up, but the bear knocked her down twice and lashed one of her . thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help. Her father and a . neighbor chased the animal away. She miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but . sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back. The attack happened on grandfather Dave Wetherell's wooded property near Cadillac. Dave . Wetherell, Abby's grandfather, tells the Detroit Free Press that . Abigail Wetherell is a strong person who realizes 'she was in a lot of . danger and she beat it.' Abigail was treated for abrasions and puncture wounds before being released from a Traverse City hospital. The DNR says the search for the bear is continuing. Wanted: The black bear knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful claws before fleeing into the woods . Speaking to Good Morning America last week she said: 'I see this bear. Oh, my gosh. I start running the way I was coming . from. All of a sudden, the bear stopped me and put me down . on ground, scraping me and clawing me. 'I was terrified. I was thinking, ""I shouldn't have went for this jog. This is it, I'm a goner'."" The bear suddenly stopped attacking . her and she took the chance to get up and run away but the bear came . back. She decided to pet it to see if she could get the animal to like . her. 'That did not work. Then it just got me again. 'And then I heard that you should . play dead. So that's what I did,' she told GMA. 'And then it kind of . went away and then it looked back and . then it just took off.' Her father Chris told GMA: 'I was in . shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I . saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible.' Abby was taken to hospital and had to get 100 stitches on her wounds over two hours of surgery. She is recovering at home. She said of her injuries: 'When the bear was attacking me, I couldn't feel it. I was . just numb. I don't know how or why but my whole body went numb and when I . started getting up it hurt bad. 'It's over. But, I'm not going to go in the woods without anybody. I'm OK and I'll be all right.' Father Chris Wetherell said: 'I was in shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible' Back home: Abby Wetherell is now recovering from the attack at home after undergoing two-hour surgery . Tough cookie: Abby, who is a hunting enthusiast, a soccer goalie, and loves the great outdoors, plans to return to the site of the bear attack in the near future - but not on her own . People who venture into likely bear territory should carry pepper spray, travel in small groups and make noise to avoid startling them, the DNR said. ‘If you encounter a bear, stand your ground and then slowly back away,’ the agency said in a news release. ‘Do not turn away.’ It advised people not to show fear, run or play dead, but instead to make themselves look as big as possible and talk to the animal in a stern voice.","Abby Wetherell was jogging in Michigan woods earlier this month when bear started to chase her .

Cadbury has ditched the all time classic chocolate Bournville in favour of foreign invader Toblerone in its Christmas tins of Heroes causing outrage among fans. The move has been dubbed ‘unpatriotic’ by one of Britain’s top chocolate tasters Angus Kennedy, who considers the inclusion of the Swiss sweet an insult to fans of the nation’s favourite chocolate. American food giant Kraft took over Cadbury in 2010, despite fierce backlash from lovers of the iconic English confectionery brand - now under the umbrella of multinational group Mondelez International. Anger: Chocolate fans are furious the classic Bournville has been replaced with Toblerones in Heroes tins . Chocoholics were worried the takeover would lead to a demise of the Birmingham-based firm. And they fear their nightmares are beginning to come true with Toblerone being heralded as a special treat at the expense of Bournville, the home of Cadbury. Kraft previously came under fire from British confectioners for cutting the size of the country’s favourite chocolate bar, Dairy Milk. Despite it only being August, Cadbury has already launched its Christmas tins of Heroes, decorated with Santa hats, snow, tinsel and reindeer antlers. Controversial: Toblerone is being heralded as a special treat at the expense of classic Bournvilles . Classic: Fans are furious the miniature pieces of dark chocolate have been replaced by Toblerone . Mr Kennedy, editor of Kennedy’s Confection magazine, said: 'Kraft couldn’t care less about Cadbury as a symbol of national pride. 'To replace Bourneville with Toblerone is unpatriotic. 'It’s like replacing the fish in fish and chips with mussels. American Irene Rosenfeld, the current chairman and CEO of Mondelez International . 'To Kraft, its not about what the British care about any more or our heritage, it’s all about making money. 'If big companies think our heritage can make them money then they will buy into it. 'Cadbury fans have had a rough ride. 'I’m always pleasantly surprised to learn that there are still some left. 'But sadly many Cadbury fanatics have lost hope. This is just another nail in the coffin. 'The focus now is all about sales and any thing that can be done to increase profits will happen even at the expense of traditional sentiments. 'They ignore what their core customer base wants to chase new ones. 'Heroes is worth over £40 million and is a very successful brand. 'British chocolate - if we can call it that - has stiff competition now from Lindt and Fererro and many other new companies on the block. 'Traditional brands like Heroes need a boost as new creative chocolate marketing campaigns and team ups between different sweets are eating into their market share. 'They see Toblerone as a hero too. Whether heroic enough to do the job we will see.' One angry chocolate lover, Anna Cook, said she couldn't believe Toblerone has been added to tins of Heroes. 'It’s not even a Cadbury chocolate bar. 'If I wanted a Toblerone, I would go out and buy one. 'But when I buy a tin of Heroes I expect it to be full of my favourite Cadbury treats.' Feeling festive: Despite it only being August, Cadbury have already launched its Christmas tub of Heroes . The Bournville miniature pieces of chocolate are considered a classic in tins of Heroes . The addition of Toblerone to Cadbury products is just the next in a line of collaborations between Cadbury favourites such as Dairy Milk with big name brands such as Oreo. A spokesperson for Mondelez International said: 'Toblerone is a Christmas favourite which has been added to the Heroes assortment. 'The tub makes it clear that Toblerone is a guest unit within the Heroes mix. Mondelez International will also stop delivering chocolate parcels to its 14,400 former workers at Christmas . 'It has been well received by our customers. 'Not only has Mondelez International mixed different brands to make them even more popular, we have also mixed categories together such as the very successful Cadbury Dairy Milk with Oreo biscuit and we continue to look for new opportunities.' Early this month it was announced that Mondelez International will stop delivering chocolate parcels to its 14,400 former workers at Christmas - ending a 20 year tradition.","Move has been dubbed 'unpatriotic' by one of Britain's top chocolate tasters .

Two Polish men who raped a teenage girl after a taxi dropped her off at the wrong house have been jailed for eight years and nine months. The 19-year-old victim was attacked by Roman Smentek and Krzysztof Drozdz after she inadvertently gave a taxi driver the wrong address following a night out. The court heard how a concerned passer-by was thwarted by the pair as he tried to stay with the girl after noticing her state and rang her mother when the victim dropped her phone. Roman Smentek (left) and Krzysztof Drozdz (right) have been jailed for eight years and nine months after admitting raping a 19-year-old woman . The stranger suggested calling the police but was told: 'No police, it's ok. One hour, she fine'. When police were called to the house they found one of the men in bed with the victim. One of the men smirked at police as he was arrested, the court heard. Speaking after the hearing at Hull Crown Court today, the victim, who can not be identified for legal reasons, said she was 'happy with the sentence'. She said: 'In the days afterwards, I couldn’t talk to anyone, I was being sick. I didn’t really communicate with anyone and I didn’t want to talk about it and just stayed in my room. 'It has devastated our family and we can’t put the past five months into words. I’ve found out who my true friends are who have stuck by me throughout this. 'Sorry is not good enough and never will be. I’m just going to try and keep myself occupied with my studies and live my life as normal as I can. The court heard how Roman Smentek (picutred) smirked at police when they arrived to arrest him . 'I hope the two men are deported once they are released as that will allow me to try and forget what happened a lot easier. 'I have many unanswered questions from the night. I am scared someone is watching me sleeping at night, and I still have occasional nightmares. 'The lack of sleep has affected my studies and I’ve had to take time out from them. I am terrified to be alone at night and sleep at my friends when I’m home alone.' Describing the night of the attack, she said: 'I’ve never got in that state. I’m convinced my friend and I were both spiked, as we were both sharing a drink from the same glass. 'The passer-by was a complete stranger, and he stayed right through. I’d like to personally thank him for helping me and all the support I’ve had since from everybody.' Mark McKone, prosecuting, said the passer-by had suggested calling the police but was told not to. Mr McKone said: 'The victim then struggled to her feet but fell into the garden. She was then sick and carried by two men into the hallway. 'The helper was asked to leave but stayed because he was concerned for her. 'Smentek came downstairs and spoke to the other Polish men in the house before carrying the girl upstairs with Drozdz. They went into a bedroom and locked the door behind them. 'The helper then phoned the girl’s mum after she had dropped her phone outside, and went to knock on the bedroom door, but was told she was sleeping and he should go. 'He was challenged aggressively by Smentek to leave but he stayed and asked Drozdz why Smentek had locked the door. 'When Drozdz went back into the bedroom, the helper could see Smentek and the girl in bed with Drozdz sitting on the same bed using his laptop. The man who was trying to help was then ushered out of the house by Drozdz. The pair were jailed for eight years and nine months at Hull Crown Court (pictured) 'It took some time for police to wake her when they arrived, and she was confused and distressed when awoken. Smentek smirked at police, as if he was proud of himself, and was arrested. 'Mr Drozdz was arrested at 11pm the same night.' The Honorary Recorder of Hull Judge Michael Mettyear told Smentek and Drozdz: 'You both pleaded guilty on the last working day before the trial was due to begin, but up until then, you had both lied and lied about your involvement with this girl. 'It has devastated our family and we . can’t put the past five months into words. I’ve found out who my true . friends are who have stuck by me throughout this' - The 19-year-old victim . 'You pleaded guilty, not out of any sense of remorse, but because the evidence grew and you were persuaded to. 'Clearly she was incapable and she gave the person who tried to help her the wrong address. 'How she will manage her life in the future is uncertain, but perhaps she will draw a line under this case when it has finished.' Judge Mettyear awarded the passer-by who alerted the girl’s mother and stayed at the scene £250 pounds for his bravery and commitment. In front of a packed public gallery, the two men bowed their heads as they were sent down to the cells. The pair were ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life and were banned from working with children in the future. Smentek had worked and lived in the UK for two years. Drozdz had been working as a supervisor in a factory for the five and a half years since he arrived in the country.","Roman Smentek and Krzysztof Drozdz jailed for more than eight years .

Seriously injured: Iosif Lole, 41, is being treated in hospital after being beaten unconscious by thugs in the street . A father-of-four has been left fighting for his life after being attacked by late night revellers he asked to keep the noise down and go home. Iosif Lole, 41, was battered unconscious by the ‘pack of animals’ following a disturbance outside his house on Moston, Manchester, in the early hours. Neighbours said knives and bricks were used in the attack, which was witnessed by his children from an upstairs window. Iosif, who come to England from Romania three years ago, had hosted a party to celebrate moving into a new family home. But trouble flared when he asked a gang of men to leave because he had to get up to work on his home in the morning. A neighbour said that Iosif was knocked unconscious when his head hit the kerb, but that thugs continued to attack him as he lay on the ground. Police arrested a 20-year-old at the scene on suspicion of assault. They later made a second arrest of a 19-year-old, also on suspicion of assault. Iosif’s partner, Paraschiva Martin, was last night at his bedside in Salford Royal Hospital where he is being treated. She said doctors had told her they are ‘90 per cent sure he will have a disability’. She . said: 'We had a party to celebrate us moving to a new house. Then some . other guys came round with alcohol and Iosif said he had lots of work to . do on the new house the next day and wanted to go to bed so he asked . everyone to leave. 'That’s when it all started. Someone slapped one of his friends and that started it all. 'Iosif . had gone upstairs as he wanted to check on the children. But then he . went outside to make sure no one was fighting and to ask them to leave. He didn’t do anything wrong. 'He didn’t push anyone or say anything wrong. I opened the window, looked outside and could see everything. Devastated: Iosif's partner Paraschiva Martin said their young children witnessed the attack from their bedroom window . 'Someone threw at a stone at him - he didn’t see him and I shouted at him to take care. 'Then someone punched him and he fell and hit his head. I have never seen anything like this, ever. 'The . girls saw everything. Today one of them said to me ‘mummy, I saw daddy . with blood on his face’ I told her that he was in good hands now. The . couple, who have a 21 year-old son and three daughters aged 11, eight . and two, moved to England from the Romanian city of Arad three years . ago. She told how the attack was witnessed by their daughters - who . looked on helplessly in horror. 'Seeing . him in the hospital was just horrible. The doctors have said they are . 90 per cent sure he will have a disability. What disability they do not . know. I am very, very scared. I want to cry but I know I must stay . strong for the girls. 'He didn’t deserve something like this. He is such a nice man. He would always help people.' 'People who had no benefits used to ask him for help and he would help them with their letters and give them money and food. 'Now I will just visit him in the hospital and pray he gets better. I just hope he is able to come home.' Brutal attack: A gang of men set upon the father-of-four like 'a pack of animals' in this street in Moston, Manchester .

A corrupt traffic warden who issued nine bogus tickets against a former colleague during a ‘campaign of bullying’ has today (Fri) been jailed for six months. Robert Ives, 59, dished out the dodgy parking notices to Kevin Phillips while based at Tooting police station in south London. Ives also forged Mr Phillips’ signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public, pensioner Shamim Gilani. He was caught out after being linked to the tickets by his handwriting, Southwark Crown Court heard. On one occasion, Mr Phillips, with whom Ives had an ‘unpleasant relationship’, was given a ticket when he was parked miles away in a completely different part of south London. In a victim impact statement, Mr Phillips told how he suffered from high blood pressure and that his head had been left ‘spinning’ from the stress of disputing the tickets. Mrs Gilani, 73, said she paid the £65 fine ‘with a tear in her eye’ as she and her husband were on a tight budget. She has since been reimbursed. Ives, a Jack the Ripper enthusiast, who had been employed for the past 45 years, issued the parking notices in November 2011 - the same month he was made redundant. He has yet to find another job. Mr Phillips had left four months earlier to work as a PCSO. Ives, a father-of-one, insisted he had been ‘set up’. But a jury of four women and eight men took just 24 minutes to unanimously convict him of misconduct in a judicial or public office, after a trial at the court last month. Sentencing, Recorder Edward Cole told him: ‘Your misconduct appears to have been an unpleasant way of bullying Mr Phillips. ‘Why you picked on Mrs Gilani is not clear. ‘In the case of Mr Phillips, your misconduct amounted to a campaign of bullying. ‘Your conduct in each case was a . malicious abuse of power and a breach of trust put in you to administer . the system of parking regulation fairly and accurately. ‘Your conduct was in some ways similar those who pervert the course of justice. ‘Like all such offences, this investigation involved a waste of public resources. ‘Your behaviour involved a gross breach of trust and was persistent. ‘Public trust and confidence in those in public office is likely to be eroded by this sort of misconduct.’ Sentence: Ives was jailed for six months after a jury at Southwark Crown Court convicted him of misconduct in a judicial or public office Southwark Crown Court heard . Ives buried his head in his hands during the hearing but was stony faced as he was led out of the dock. Prosecutor Piers von Berg had earlier told the jury that Ives ‘wilfully or deliberately misconducted himself to such a degree to amount to abuse of the public trust in his office and he did so without reasonable excuse or justification.’ A handwriting expert who examined them concluded that there was a ‘strong possibility’ that they were penned by Ives and ‘certainly not by the other wardens’ at the unit, Mr von Berg added. Callous: Ives also forged his former colleague's signature on another ticket handed to an innocent member of the public . After getting wise to Ives’ handiwork, Mr . Phillips alerted his supervisor, prompting an investigation during . which it was noted that Citroen had been spelt incorrectly as ‘Citreon’ on several of the bogus tickets. ‘Mr Phillips was asked if anyone bore a grudge against him or ill will,’ Mr von Berg added. ‘He said he had a poor relationship with Robert Ives when they worked together and police decided to question the defendant.’ Ives claimed he had not been working on the days the tickets were issued and suggested the handwriting expert could be mistaken. David Parvin, defending Ives said he continues to maintain his innocence but has acknowledged that Mr Phillips and Mrs Gilani had endured ‘a lot of stress’. ‘Mr Ives believes he and Mr Phillips shared some friendship, they had some common interests and were both fans of Neil Diamond. ‘Their relationship can be described as up and down and this was really a practical joke that went horribly wrong. ‘As time went on it got more serious and Mr Ives felt he was unable to admit it.’ Ives, who has raised money for children’s charities, is a keen member of the Whitechapel Society, dedicated to keeping the east end alive. Mr Parvin added: ‘His hobby is learning about Jack the Ripper and he has quite a collection of books.’ Ives, of Tooting, denied the charge against him.","Robert Ives, 59, dished out dodgy tickets to ex-colleague Kevin Phillips .

He added: 'This is the last of this chapter guys, but thank you very much and I encourage everyone to look at the evidence and understand I did not do anything wrong, and I'll be out for four years appealing this and we will win the appeal.'

Francis . met the three women as they celebrated a college graduation at a the .

A former head concierge who worked at some of London’s most exclusive hotels including The Savoy has been jailed for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old schoolgirl. Ward Giroux, 49, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after a judge heard how he had become 'sexually besotted' with the youngster. The father-of-three had looked after the rich and famous at top hotels including The Savoy and The Waldorf for more than two decades during his successful career. Ward Giroux, former head concierge who worked at some of London's most exclusive hotels including The Savoy has been jailed for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old schoolgirl . A judge heard how the married church-goer had been trusted by his young victim’s parents when he first groped her in his car under the pretence of giving her a massage. He later molested the girl in a similar way in the kitchen of his detached £600,000 Surrey home while members of his own family were also in the four-bedroom property. The court was told that in a sinister development, Giroux later crept into a room where the girl was trying to sleep - while another girl slumbered yards away - and put his hand inside her clothing. She finally told her parents about what was going after she had turned 13 years of age. The last straw came when she went to a supermarket with him and before going in he told the girl - 36 years his junior - that she should pretend to be his girlfriend and stuck his hand inside her top and groped her breast. Prosecutor Alisdair Smith told Guildford Crown Court: ‘He was arrested. He accepted he was sexually attracted to her but denied the sexual contact.’ Before he realised police were involved, Giroux sent the girl a text message apologising and telling her he would not do it again. The father-of-three had looked after the rich and famous at top hotels including The Waldorf for more than two decades during his successful career . Mr Smith said Giroux had been alone with the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, because he would sometimes drive her to and from events. The four charges he admitted related to incidents between April 2012 and January this year. Giroux, of Chaldon, Surrey, explained in an interview in May 2010 how he began his career in the hotel industry as a linen porter, then a luggage porter at The Savoy where celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey runs a restaurant. He then moved to The Royal Lancaster Hotel where he decided to become a concierge. Giroux later worked as head concierge at The Savoy for almost three years as well as at the Jumeirah Carlton and The Waldorf. He ended up at The Kensington in 2009 where he was employed until earlier this month. Saul Herman, defending, began his mitigation by expressing Giroux’s remorse for the shame he had brought on his victim and on his own wife and children. He said of the offences themselves that the contact was 'fleeting' or 'minimal', adding: ‘These were not situations that he had instigated.’ The defendant’s family situation had to be assessed in light of what had happened to see if he should be allowed to remain with his own children. Officials decided there was no risk to them, said the defence barrister.‘He is unlike some of the offenders for these sort of offences,’ said Mr Herman. ‘He is not socially isolated - he has the support of his family and continues to have the support of his church.’ Guildford Crown Court heard he became sexually besotted with the girl and allowed his interest in her to become 'completely inappropriate' At the sentencing on Wednesday, Judge Suzan Matthews QC told Giroux: ‘You expressed your remorse from a very early stage and I give you full credit for your pleas of guilty which spared the girl and her family from having to give evidence.’ She said she had read numerous supporting character references from family, friends and former colleagues, who expressed their surprise at his situation. ‘You were regarded as hard-working and loyal and a supportive member of the family and someone people had respect for. ‘She was a young girl. She must have been very perplexed and puzzled why you were showing this kind of attention to her. ‘This is a case of a clear breach of trust by an adult in a position of control over a young girl. ‘It seems to me you became sexually besotted with her and allowed your interest in her to become completely inappropriate and to cross boundaries which are clearly there and you knew were there.’ She rejected a Probation Service recommendation and suggestion by the defence of a community penalty and instead passed an 18-month jail term on each of the three counts of sexual assault on a girl under 13 and a further 18 months for sexual assault on a girl aged 13. All four terms were ordered to run concurrently. The judge described the case as “a very sad outcome” and told Giroux: ‘Your Christian conscience will tell you to accept your punishment.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Ward Giroux, 49, worked at top hotels - The Savoy and The Waldorf .

A publishing company has released a colouring book aimed at children which features one of the Boston Bombing suspects on the front cover. The controversial black and white line drawing parodies last month's infamous Rolling Stone cover in which prime suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - currently awaiting trial for the deaths of four people, plus 30 counts of using a weapon of mass destruction - featured in the style of a hippy rock star. The amended magazine title reads: 'Rock Him and Stone Him'. Reignite: A publisher from St Louis released its answer to Rolling Stone magazine's controversial cover (right) when it released this colouring book for children (left) Educational: The company behind the controversial colouring book have said they want to help youngsters understand terrorism.

Missouri-based Really Big Coloring Books has defended it's latest offering called 'Tell the Truth - Tell it Often - Tell the Children', which went on sale this week. The firm claims it was 'designed to help youngsters learn and understand more about terrorism as they read or colour'. They say the series will engage . parents, teachers, educators and children from an honest, direct point . of reference that may elicit public response for open discussion. Demands: The colouring book has called on Imams to acknowledge Sharia Law is secondary to the US constitution . Publisher Wayne Bell said: 'In . regards to our initial comic publication, we listened to customer input . and decided to cover the subject of terror.

The edition also features a graphic drawing of Osama Bin Laden's body at the bottom of the sea. The St Louis publisher's CBC Coloring Book Comic line of publications will feature real life 'true-to-culture' hero and villain comics. The new title comes as a 12-page supplement when ordering older books from the company called 'We Shall Never Forget 9/11 The Kids Book of Freedom' and 'The True Faces of Evil Terror'. Educational: The company behind the controversial colouring book has said it wants youngsters to 'understand' terrorism . Mr Bell added: 'People say they only want the truth without influence of personal opinion or hidden agenda. 'Americans are more than fed up with politically motivated correctness to the point of frustration that quickly turns into disgust, distrust and then anger. '""Do not mislead my children; kids are smarter than you think"" - we hear that often, especially from grandparents.

Despite its name, the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act may be leaving some public school children wanting for more as choose to starve rather than eat the vegetables and ‘brown wheat’ required by the law. ‘They say it tastes like vomit,’ Harlan County, Kentucky school board member Myra Mosley. At least someone's happy: The First Lady has long pushed for healthier school lunches but some Kentucky school children and their parents are pushing back . Hers was among a chorus of angry voices at a recent Harlan County school district board meeting, where many parents said their kids are coming home hungry, reports the HarlanDaily.com. ‘It’s strange and different for them, so they don’t like it,’ said Jack Miniard, director of school and community nutrition, who was on hand to explain that the new lunches were required by law. But Mosley held her ground and repeated that the milk ‘tastes like vomit.’ The new regulations have a calorie cap and require that school meals include only one portion of meat or protein. They also stipulate that milk be either skim or one percent fat and that bread be ‘brown wheat.’ In an effort to curb obesity, . carbohydrates like French fries may only be served in three-fourths of a . cup portions and kids in elementary school—where the complaints mostly . seem to originate—may only be served a total of 650 calories per meal. Forcing a smile? A Harlan County school student poses with his lunch. Many parents in the Kentucky County say their children wont' eat skim milk and wheat bread--food items they're not accustomed to . Fair? The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 established new standards for all foods sold in schools with an emphasis on more veggies and fewer calories. Students with extra money may buy extra lunches, however . The restrictions and lack of enthusiasm over unlimited fruits and vegetables have some parents concerned their children won’t get enough to eat. ‘Kids can’t learn when they’re hungry,’ many parents moaned. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act only applies to the lunch-per-day provided by the school. An additional lunch may be purchased by students who have the cash. Which leaves students in Kentucky, a state among the nation’s fattest and poorest, in a pickle. Backed into a legal corner by the First Lady’s law and students and parents more accustomed to calorie dense meals from a box than they are to unlimited fruit, Miniard could only play the role of soothsayer. He assured Mosley and the other parents that a taste test of the milk would be conducted. Angry: In Kentucky, one of America's fattest and poorest states, a law that allows only those with extra cash to eat more than 650 calories per meal has come with predictable outrage .","Harlan County, Kentucky parents say their children are going hungry because of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 ."

The SAS has launched a probe into how claims that it was involved with Princess Diana's death were made public, it emerged today. Earlier this month an SAS sniper accused the service of assassinating Diana in 1997 and then covering up its actions, sparking a fresh round of conspiracy theories. Military chiefs are now apparently investigating how the claim came to be made public amidst fears it could harm the reputation of the SAS. The allegation that the service helped to kill Diana and her lover Dodi Al Fayed in a car crash in Paris surfaced in a letter linked to the trial of former sniper Danny Nightingale. The document was written by the mother-in-law of 'Soldier N', Nightingale's housemate, in September 2011 and sent to military prosecutors. It came to the attention of the Metropolitan Police this month, and officers are now examining the information to see whether there is anything which merits investigation. But Army bosses are said to be angry that the SAS has been dragged in to the controversy over Diana's death, which has continued for more than a decade despite the official finding that the death was an accident. A source close to General Sir Peter Wall, head of the Army, told the Daily Express that the incident was 'the most embarrassing and potentially damaging event in the regiment's 70-year history'. The SAS is supposed to operate in secrecy, so any public discussion of the unit's activities is likely to be poorly received by top brass. Crash: Conspiracy theories have long surrounded Diana's death in Paris in 1997 despite the official finding that it was an accident caused by paparazzi photographers . In addition, officials are said to be investigating how Soldier N was handled around the time he made the allegation about Diana in a conversation with his wife. 'This whole mess was all entirely preventable,' a source told the Express. 'All the warning signs were there but were ignored. 'Instead of dealing with Soldier N's family issues he was sent to Afghanistan for six months. This is a problem of the SAS's own making.' The letter containing the claim - which was censored to remove all explicit references to the SAS - was written by Soldier N's mother-in-law, who claimed that he had threatened his wife during an acrimonious break-up. 'He also told her that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana's death and that has been covered up,' it read. Revelation: The new claim emerged in connection with the trial of Danny Nightingale, pictured with his wife . Dodi's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has called for police to investigate the new evidence fully, while the family of driver Henri Paul, who also died in the accident, said it supported their theory that the couple were murdered. Soldier N was jailed for illegally storing firearms at the house in Hereford which he shared with Nightingale. Last month, Nightingale was convicted of illegally possessing a pistol which he allegedly took from Iraq as a 'trophy' and sentenced to two years in prison. The SAS has suffered a number of public-relations setbacks this year, including the deaths last month of three Territorial Army volunteers training to join the service.","Claim made by SAS sniper came to light in letter linked to Nightingale trial .

A measles-like virus is being blamed for the death of more than 330 dolphins whose bodies have washed up on America's East Coast. Scientists say that cetecean morbillivirus is the cause for nine times the usual number of bottlenose dolphins stranding on shores between New York and North Carolina since the beginning of July. Most are dead by the time they reach the shore with many already decomposed and more than half of the deaths occuring in Virginia. Deadly: Virginia Aquarium Stranding Response Team members Krystal Rodrique (left) of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and intern Liz Schell examine a dead male dolphin that was washed up on the beach, one of 330 killed by a measles-like virus . Investigation: Danielle Monaghan, from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine New Jersey, photographs a dead dolphin that washed ashore in Spring Lake on Wednesday . Dolphins infected by the virus typically suffer symptoms such as skin lesions, brain infections and pneumonia. The virus is usually spread through inhalation of respiratory particles or direct contact between animals. Officials confirmed that there's no risk of the virus being caught by humans. Teri Rowles of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration described the number of dolphin deaths as 'extraordinary'. The NOAA announced earlier this month that the number of dolphins dying this year is above average and devoted extra resources to trying find the cause. It had suspected that the virus was behind the extra deaths and has now confirmed it as the 'tentative cause' with research ongoing. Record: This picture shows an identification tag - the equivalent of a dolphin toe tag - for a dolphin that had died on the Spring Lake beach, New Jersey . Examination: Equipment is ready to perform a necropsy on a dead dolphin at the Virginia Aquarium Marine Animal Care Center, in Virginia Beach . Officials believe that many more dolphins may have succumbed to morbillivirus but haven't washed ashore. The virus, which affects a broad range of mammals, was the cause of some 740 dolphin deaths between New Jersey and Florida in 1987 and 1988. The disease is expected to spread south and to last until next spring. Eventually, dolphins will build up a resistance to the disease as they have been known to with similar strains in the past. A new generation of dolphins could become susceptible to the disease again in the future however. There are two different stocks of dolphins that populate the affected region, with the northern stock having between 7,000 and 9,000 dolphins, while the southern stock has between 9,900 to 12,000 dolphins, according to federal estimates. Bottlenose dolphins are typically found in groups of two to 15 and live for between 40 and 50 years.

Guilty: Steven Berkoff, 75, at City of London Magistrates, where he was found guilty of driving without due care and attention and fined £400 . Actor Steven Berkoff berated a woman as she lay injured in the road after he had knocked her down, a court heard yesterday. The . 76-year-old, who was the Bond villain in Octopussy, showed ‘no concern’ for Fiona Scully and leapt from his VW Beetle to say ‘I didn’t touch . you’. He had knocked her . down when he pulled out to pass another car that had stopped to let her . cross Oxford Street in central London. Miss . Scully, who needed hospital treatment and had to use a walking stick . for ten days, told City of London magistrates: ‘I was quite shocked at . the time and am still quite shocked that he didn’t say “Are you OK?” ‘There was no apparent concern or offer of assistance. What struck me was a very aggressive man in a rush.’ Miss . Scully was with a friend last New Year’s Eve when the driver of a Mini . halted to let her cross the road – and was passed by Berkoff in his . Beetle. She said: ‘It . hit me and knocked me to the ground. 'At that stage the car would have . been on the other side of the road, I was lying on the road. ‘It . had hit me on my right leg. The driver got out of the car and his words . were something to the effect of “Oh, I didn’t hit you, I didn’t touch . you”.’ Passing shoppers rushed to help and Miss Scully was taken to hospital with severe bruising and swelling. When the actor was stopped by the police, he could only . produce a Californian driving licence, which was no longer valid in this . country. Representing . himself in court, Berkoff blamed Miss Scully for the accident and . insisted only his ‘speed and reflexes’ saved her from worse injury. He . told the court: ‘I was totally shocked and somewhat agitated because I . couldn’t believe someone would walk straight in front of the car. 'I . didn’t lose my temper, but I was angry because of the situation. ‘Had they looked round they would have certainly seen me.’ Headded : 'I was shocked how they had suddenly rushed. I sounded my horn . and slowly pulled out and so it would be impossible to hit anybody . unless they had run out in front of the car. If they were to be hit it . would mean I would have to speed around the corner.' But magistrates did not find his evidence credible and Chair of the Bench Dr Andrew Pairmley said: 'We find you guilty of driving without due care and attention. 'We . find the witness' evidence credible. We felt in these circumstances . your standard of driving fell below that of a reasonable and competent . driver.' Incident: The actor, 76, knocked down Fiona Scully with his Volkswagen Beetle on Oxford Street (pictured) last New Year's Eve . Berkoff was fined £350 for driving . without due care and attention and £50 for driving otherwise than in . accordance with a licence at City of London Magistrates. He . was given three penalty points to be added to his UK driving licence . when he applies for it to be restored. It expired after he was banned . for six months in February for jumping a red light. Berkoff was also ordered to pay £250 towards prosecution costs and a £35 victim surcharge.

The giant wildfire burning at the edge of Yosemite National Park has unleashed a smoky haze that has worsened air quality more than 100 miles away in Nevada. The plume from the Rim Fire in California triggered emergency warnings in the Reno and Carson City area. Schoolchildren were kept inside for the second time in a week, people went to hospitals complaining of eye and throat irritation and officials urged people to avoid all physical activity outdoors. Scroll down for video . A smoky haze from a huge California wildfire burning more than 150 miles away hangs over Virginia Street in Reno, Nevada . The wildfire threatening Yosemite National Park is still burning its way into the huge US tourist attraction and spreading unhealthy air all the way to Nevada (pictured on August 28) 'It's five hours away,' said 22-year-old bartender Renee Dishman in disbelief after learning that the source of the haze was more than 150 miles away. 'I can't run. I can't breathe. It makes me sneeze.' The Rim Fire, so far, has burned through 293 square miles, destroyed more than 100 structures, including 85 tent cabins at a camp run by the city of Berkeley, and threatened water supplies, hydroelectric power and giant sequoias. This morning, authorities said the blaze was 23 per cent contained, with crews aided by higher humidity continuing to make progress against it overnight. In Nevada, evidence of the Rim Fire is in the smoke-filled sky. The air quality index briefly surpassed the rare 'hazardous' level east of Lake Tahoe before improving slightly. It hovered around the next-most serious stage of 'very unhealthy' for all populations in the Reno-Sparks area 30 miles north. Dennis Fry, a Reno auto body specialist for nearly 30 years, remembered smoke this thick when he worked on a logging crew and helped fight fires in Oregon during the 1970s. Most of the Sierra's eastern front from south of Carson City to north of Lake Tahoe has been under an air quality alert for nearly a week (Reno, Nevada pictured) Angel City fire fighters Cody Stephens, left, and Kevin Brown, center, wait as helicopter dumps water on hot spots battling the Rim Fire in the Stanislaus National Forest along Highway 120 near Yosemite . 'But never in Reno, not this bad,' he said. 'You could actually see the smoke inside my body shop.' Everyone should avoid all physical activity outdoors when the air quality index reaches 'hazardous,' considered 'emergency conditions,' the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection said on its website. 'People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children should remain indoors and keep activity levels low.' Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno has experienced a 'slight increase' in emergency room visits as a result of the smoke, said Jennifer Allen, the hospital's clinical nursing supervisor. 'Patients are experiencing shortness of breath, eye and throat irritation, cough and headache due to the heavy smoke and poor air quality,' she said, adding that people with asthma and other respiratory ailments were most affected. The pollution levels are among the worst ever recorded for small particulates around Carson City in the state's air monitoring records dating to 2000, according to JoAnn Kittrell, public information manager for Nevada Division of Environmental Protection.

The air quality briefly moved into the 'hazardous' level in some areas on Friday as well, she said. 'It's very unusual,' she said. 'We just happen to be in the direct path of the plume from Yosemite.' The previous peak reading in Reno came on Friday when the air quality index closed in on the 'very unhealthy' stage. Schoolchildren were kept indoors during recess, high school football practices and scrimmages were canceled through the weekend and an annual air show at Lake Tahoe was canceled due to low visibility. Carol Chaplin, executive director Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority, said some hotels and motels reported cancellations earlier in the week, but so far there hasn't been any major impact for the upcoming Labor Day weekend. 'I could lie and say it's not affecting anything, but it is,' she said. She said visibility in the scenic Tahoe Basin ebbs and flows with the shifting winds. This NASA Earth Observatory image obtained August 27, 2013 shows what the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi NPP satellite tracked on the growth of the Rim Fire August 26 . 'I still see people out on the lake,' she said. 'At least we're not on fire.' The fire caused air pollution problems in California cities far away from the fire, including those in the Sacramento region. Two dozen competitors in the 25th annual Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-Off were taking it in stride as they prepped their grills for the barbeque festival running Wednesday through Labor Day in Sparks, Nev. The air around the event is usually filled with smoke, albeit a different kind when the barbeque festival's in town. 'You can't have too much smoke at a barbeque,' said Mike Peters of Springfield, Mo., a member of the Kansas City Barbeque Society's Great American Barbeque Tour Team.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 27 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:51 EST, 27 August 2013 . A former billionaire hedge-fund manager who is supposed to be doing eleven years of hard time after he was busted for insider trading in 2009 is still living the good life as he sits in the medical unit at the federal clink in Aver, Massachusetts, according to a prison snitch. For Raj Rajartnam, hard time includes private toilets, a shared balcony where inmates can sun themselves, televisions and adjustable beds. Additionally, Rajartnam has his very own 'manservant.' Living the life: Wall Street thief Raj Rajaratnam (left) reportedly has things pretty good in his life behind bars . 'He’s doing his time in the lap of luxury compared to the other inmates,' the source told the New York Post. Rajaratnam founded the Galeon Group - a New York-based hedge-fund management firm - and quickly became one of the richest men in America. In 2009, Forbes ranked him as the 236th richest man in America. On October 16, 2009, FBI agents arrested Rajartnam on allegations of insider trading that U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara estimates was worth about $60 million - 'the largest hedge-fund insider trading case in United States history.' Rajartnam was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison. He's serving his time at the Federal Medical Center Devens, where the source claims 'he's reigning like a king.' Manservant: Rajaratnam has reportedly recruited a 'manservant' to things like make his meals for him . The source told the Post that Rajartnam is in Unit P3, which is on the top floor of the hospital ward and is usually designated for the most seriously ill inmates - the same unit housed geriatric mobster John 'Sonny' Franzese, who is  96 years old and in failing health. According to the source, Rajartnam 'has a very delightful guy doing all sorts of stuff for him - sort of . like a ‘manservant.’ The manservant is described as a 'gentle giant' American Samoan named Eddie. Eddie's primary job in the P3 unit is to push prisoners in wheelchairs around the prison. He got that job and was moved the medical unit after befriending Rajartnam. 'He became enamored of Raj, and Raj started talking about how much he once paid his chauffeurs. Now Eddie wants to be Raj’s driver when he gets out,' the insider said. The source said Eddie often cooks for Rajaratnam in a nearby microwave so the Wall Street crook doesn't have to walk all the way down the hall. Diabetes: a prison source says Rajaratnam is getting special treatment and should be in the prison's general population . The source said that other inmates who are much older and sicker than Rajaratnam are held in parts of the prison that are a half-mile from the hospital and chow hall. According to the source, Rajaratnam should be housed in general population in Building H, but he's getting 'special treatment' and is allowed to live in the medical ward. In Building H, there are two prisoners to each cell, a communal bathroom - and no manservants. At sentencing, Rajaratnam's attorneys argued that he should get a more lenient sentence because he is extremely ill with diabetes and might need a kidney transplant - a risk that anyone with diabetes runs. 'Big deal,' the source said about the diabetes claim. 'Up there, diabetes is like a common cold.' He adds that Rajaratnam gets around the prison just fine and actually has lost weight.","Raj Rajaratnam was the 236th richest man in America in 2009, according to Forbes .

Suspect: The battered body of a man was found at the home he shared with Jetaun Wheeler (pictured) A mother-of-three from Minnesota has been charged with murder after the battered body of her boyfriend was found hidden in a freezer, wrapped in plastic and sealed with duct tape. Detectives found the frozen body of a 58-year-old man stuffed in a chest freezer in the garage of the home he shared in Shorewood, near Twin Cities, with his 29-year-old partner, Jetaun Wheeler. Wheeler, whose three children aged ten, eight and seven are missing, was charged with second degree murder on Monday and is being held in police custody. The authorities have refused to name the victim, but have not said why. It is believed she attacked him after he tried to split up with her. Hennepin County Attorny Mike Freeman said: 'It (the body) was in a big trunk freezer, the kind your grandmother had.' According to the criminal complaint, a friend told investigators that the victim had called on July 31 to say Wheeler had assaulted him and that he was leaving her and heading back to Chicago. The victim had been left with scratches and had told the friend that Wheeler was 'crazy'. The call had ended abruptly but with the victim promising to call back. That never happened. The same day, a Carver County deputy spoke to the victim in a . school car park about a complaint they had had involving a loud phone call. A report in the Star Tribune claimed the man told the . deputy he was leaving for Chicago, and the deputy noticed a vehicle . nearby that belonged to Wheeler. There was a duffle bag inside. On August 15, police canvassed the area in an attempt to track down the missing man. One neighbour said that . Wheeler and the victim had argued in their driveway about two weeks . before he disappeared. When questioned, Wheeler had told the authorities the victim had taken the . bus to Chicago. Spattering: A trail of blood led police to the gruesome discovery in the freezer. County attorney Mike Freeman (pictured) has described wheeler as 'uncooperative' But when investigators returned and searched the home on August 21, . they found a piece of carpet under Wheeler’s mattress that was apparently . soaked in blood. Further blood stains led detectives to the garage, where they found the new freezer, which had been bought on August 5, hidden behind two mattresses. They found the frozen body stuffed inside. Several bags of . clothing and shoes were found in rubbish bags hidden beneath a . kitchen microwave. Murder scene: Police sealed off the house the couple shared in Shorewood following the grim discovery . According to the complaint, the clothing the man was wearing was heavily . soaked in blood. He had injuries to his face that appeared to have been made with a blunt instrument, plus cuts to his left eye and the left side of his head. There was hemorrhaging in the muscles of his . neck. The closet rod in Wheeler’s bedroom was missing. Although the children are missing, no Amber Alerts have been issued suggesting the authorities do not believe they are in any danger. Mr Freeman said: 'We don't know what the children went through.' Wheeler, whom Mr Freeman described as 'uncooperative', is being held in custody.

The American Atheists, based in New Jersey, told the mayor of Princeton this week that they will take the town to court if the side of a beam recovered from the World Trade Center site was displayed on public property or publicly funded. The letter says the beam must be placed in a ‘designated free speech zone that enables members of all other religious groups or otherwise to place their own memorials with their own unique symbols,’ according to the Times of Trenton. Controversial: Atheists are planning to sue the town of Princeton, NJ over a memorial incorporating a beam with this cross carved into it . ‘While the intention to commemorate those who died at the World Trade Center is admirable and appropriate for a community, the use of such a singular religious image will be grossly offensive and alienating to many people,’ attorney Bruce Afran wrote in the letter, which asked for a response by Sept. 3. Princeton Deputy Fire Chief Roy James acquired the beam for the town on his own, according to the Times. He wants to place it on state-owned land near the Princeton Battle Monument, the Times reported. Princeton has also made land for a memorial available near the old borough hall, the paper noted. Designed by an architecture firm donating its time, the memorial is estimated to cost about $100,000, reported the Times. James told the paper the money could be obtained from the town or through donations. Putting the memorial on public land and/or funding it with taxpayer money is where The American Atheists object. They are threatening to file an injunction if either, or both, comes to pass. A tribute: Firefighters carved the crosses into beams and placed where fallen firefighters were found by rescue and recovery workers . 'We have our attorney looking into if we would be open to litigation for this and what the risk is,' Princeton Mayor Liz Lempert told WPVI. The inclusion of a religious symbol also worried some town council members, with one fearing it would give the impression government favors one religion over others and another saying concerned residents planned to file a lawsuit, they told the Times. James defended the cross, saying it is more a part of history than it is a religious symbol, explaining to WPVI that rescue and recovery workers at Ground Zero carved the crosses into the beams where they found fallen firefighters. Heroes: Over 300 firefighters sacrificed their lives to save others at Ground Zero on 9/11 . Afran disagrees. ‘While the image of the cross on the girder is the space remaining after a cross was carved from the girder, it nonetheless presents the indisputable image of a cross on a memorial for those who died in the attacks of 9/11 — a religious image in remembrance of the dead,’ he wrote, according to the Times. ‘It goes without saying that the image of the cross is a common religious feature on the graves of the deceased who adhered in life to a Christian faith.’ The town could avoid all this by simply turning the beam on its side so the cross is not visible. James was initially planning to have the memorial in place by this September, that is now highly unlikely given the possibility of this issue being settled in a courtroom. Calls placed by MailOnline to The American Atheists, Princeton officials and Afran seeking further comment were not answered.","The use of a beam recovered from Ground Zero with a cross carved into it is catalyzing the atheists .

A children's etiquette guru has revealed how she became a go-to for celebrity parents, keen for their kids to learn better social skills. Faye de Muyshondt, who is based in New York City and has just released her first book, socialsklz :-), says people in the public eye turn to her because they are more exposed to the benefits of social and communication savvy. She told The Times: 'Children . are a reflection of parents and, when you’re a public figure, not only . are you under a microscope but so are your children.' Etiquette expert: Faye de Muyshondt is a go-to for A-list parents keen for their kids to learn better social skills . Mrs de Muyshondt, 38, who previously trained celebrities for media appearances, says that she is called upon to teach children everything from table manners to making polite conversation - skills that will last them for life. She will even guide tweens in their social media use, and how to make a 'digital first impression'. 'I go through social media accounts and online . activity to guide them in being more safe, private, savvy and aware of . the fact that the internet is a permanent memory bank,' she explains. Mrs de Muyshondt believes that many of these life lessons are unintentionally overlooked by overstretched parents due to the general chaos of life, and so children often end up getting berated in public for their lack of social awareness. 'It’s all: ""Why didn’t you say . hello?"" and ""Why didn’t you look Mrs Smith in the eye?,""' she said. 'That's the sum total of the lesson many children get, and it . doesn’t work well.' And studies indicate that good social know-how can even give kids a leg-up in school. The Socialsklz website cites the journal Child Development, which published a comprehensive . analysis of 33 studies on the subject. Skills for life: Mrs de Muyshondt says that her workshops teach children everything from table manners to making polite conversation . It read: 'Teaching kids social and . emotional skills leads to an average 11 percentile-point gain in their . academic performance over six months compared to students who didn't . receive the same instruction.' Mrs de Muyshondt's in-demand workshops typically take place over four days and comprise subjects like greetings and introductions, starting . conversations and phone skills. Read and learn: Mrs de Muyshondt's new book features exercises for parents and children to practice together . She welcomes children from the age of four and up, and says her goal is to give them skills that help them build self-confidence - and her new book aims to do the same, with exercises for parents and children to practice together. Typically, she says the most common problems are that children fail to make eye-contact when meeting a new person, they have poor body language, and give one-word responses. Her courses aim to change that. And parents, it seems, can't speak highly enough of the results. Tanya Hill, mother of seven-year-old Ivy, wrote: 'Last Sunday, my daughter met someone new. She smiled, gave a firm . handshake, and confidently looked that person in the eye. I was not . around, but a friend called me the next day to comment on it.'

A Florida jury has recommended a 21-year-old killer be sentenced to death for the 'cold and calculated' murder of a teenager after a dispute over his ex-girlfriend. Michael Bargo and four others were found guilty of killing 15-year-old Seath Jackson by luring him to a home where they beat him, shot him to death, burned his body and hid the dismembered remains in a paint bucket in a rock quarry. Bargo's accomplices have all begun life sentences for their role in the brutal murder; a jury at Marion County Court, Florida recommended late yesterday, by a majority of 10 to two, that Bargo receives the death penalty. He will be the youngest criminal on death row in the southern state if the judge agrees with the decision. Convicted killer: Michael Bargo was convicted in less than three hours for his part in the 2011 murder of Seath Jackson. A jury late yesterday decided he deserved the death sentence . Troubled teen: Michael Bargo listens to his mother talk about his life leading up to the murder of Seath Jackson in 2011 . The court heard yesterday, Bargo . 'wanted Seath alive in the bathtub, so when Seath took his last breath, . the last thing he would see is the defendant standing over him,' prosecutor Amy Berndt is quoted by wftv.com. The . mother of 21-year-old killer took the stand yesterday and blamed her . ex-husband for her son's troubled childhood that she claims led him to . murder, telling Michael Bargo, Sr, 'It's your fault.' His defense attorney argued that Bargo didn't act alone and he was clearly mentally ill. But prosecutors convinced the majority of the 12-person jury at Marion County Court that Bargo was the mastermind of a cold, calculated and premeditated murder and deserved the death sentence. His mother, Tracey O'Brien, 38, said before the decision yesterday her son, Michael Bargo, Jr, had grown up with an alcoholic father with an explosive temper. His . lawyers attempted to avoid the death penalty by arguing that Bargo, Jr . suffered abuse at the hands of his mother and was traumatized by his . parents' divorce. Tracey O'Brien, 38, wept throughout . her testimony as the prosecutor questioned her about Michael Bargo, Jr's . childhood and her marriage to his father, Michael Bargo, Sr. Devastated: A court heard testimony from convicted murderer Michael Bargo's mother Tracey O'Brien yesterday as the jury decided what sentence to recommend . The devastated mother was summoned to the Florida court from her home in Michigan to testify at her son's sentencing hearing. O'Brien . reportedly did not testify at her son's murder trial because, according . to testimony from Bargo, Sr, her son didn't want her there. She . told the court that the hearing was the first time she'd seen her son . in four years and detailed her unhappy marriage with Bargo, Sr, who she . described as an abusive alcoholic who regularly lashed out in anger. 'He would throw . dinner if it wasn't warm, or I said something wrong or we got into an . argument, he would start throwing things,' she said. Disturbing: Seath Tyler Jackson was brutally murdered and his body burned in a pit. His remains were then shovelled into paint cans and thrown in a dumpster . As his son grew older, Bargo, Sr . would encourage the boy to demean and disrespect his mother. She . recalled arriving home to find that her son had scrawled 'Tracey is a . whore' on the front driveway of their house. When . Bargo, Jr was 14 his father moved to Florida. During that time, the . teen was diagnosed with ADD but his father would encourage him not to . take his prescription Ritalin. Bargo, . Jr would explode in fits of uncontrollable rage that O'Brien couldn't . control, having to call the police a number of times, she told the . court. Bargo, Sr . began to call Social Services in an effort to discredit O'Brien as a . parent and gain custody of his son. She testified that . Bargo, Sr put through so many false calls about her, he was . eventually told that if he called again he would be charged for filing . a false report. The father owed more than $20,000 in child support for Bargo, Jr, which O'Brien never received. Eventually, when Bargo, Jr was 16, he went to live with his father in Florida. Callous crime: Michael Bargo (left), and Charlie Ely (right) were both convicted for Seath Jackson's murder . Associates: Justin Soto (left) was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, while James Young Havens III, was eventually found not to have been involved in the crime . Ex-girlfriend: Amber Wright (left) and her step-brother Kyle Hooper (right) were both sentenced to life in prison without parole . Six people were arrested in . connection to the brutal murder of Seath Jackson and four have already been . convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Bargo is the only one who faces the death penalty. Jackson was lured to a home in 2011 by his ex-girlfriend Amber Wright under the pretense of rekindling their relationship. Once Jackson arrived at the house, her new boyfriend Bargo, along with Wright, Justin Soto, Charlie K Ely and Kyle Hooper beat him, shot him multiple times, tied . him up, broke his knees and burned his body alive, disposing of his remains in paint cans . which they threw into a quarry. Relieved: The parents of Seath Jackson, Sonia (center) and Scott Jackson were pleased when their son's killer was found guilty of his murder last week . Scene: 13890 Southeast 53rd Ave in Summerfield where Seath Tyler Jackson, 15, was beaten, shot and burned to death . Tracey O'Brien told the court that until she found out about the horrific crime, she had been under the impression that her son was thriving in Florida. His father would lie to O'Brien, telling her everything was fine and that Bargo, Jr was doing well at school when in fact the teen had dropped out. Bargo, . Sr neglected to tell O'Brien that her son wasn't even living at . home and that he was on drugs and drinking heavily. 'Every time I would ask about Michael, everything was great,' she said. As . the prosecutor wound up his questioning, O'Brien looked out into the . courtroom at Michael Bargo, Sr and, almost choking on her tears, said, . 'It's your fault.' According to WFTV reporter Jeff Deal, Michael Bargo, Sr nodded his head at this comment.","Florida jury voted 10-2 to recommend Michael Bargo gets the death penalty .

An unusual, late-summer heat wave has enveloped much of the Midwest, putting schools and sports events on hold as temperatures have crept toward the mid-90s and beyond in some places. Schools in Illinois announced on Tuesday morning that they would be closing due to the extreme heat, while schools in Iowa, Nebraska, Wisconsin, the Dakotas and Illinois had let pupils out early on Monday. After-school sports practices and . evening games were canceled in St. Paul, Minn., and misting stations . were keeping people cool at the Minnesota State Fair, where about 90 . fair-goers had been treated for heat-related illnesses over the weekend. Scroll down for video . Students carry ice to their first-grade classroom in Minneapolis, cups of ice were handed out to students because the school doesn't have AC to cope with extreme temperatures . The heat wave is supposed to last through much of the week, the National Weather Service said. Heat of this magnitude is unusual for this time of year, but not unprecedented. In Des Moines, Iowa, for instance, temperatures on Aug. 26 have reached at least 100 degrees at least six times since 1881. School districts took precautions, not wanting to put students and teachers in sweaty - and possibly dangerous - situations. In central Iowa, Marshalltown Community . School District administrators canceled afternoon preschool classes on . Monday and Tuesday and were planning to release other students two hours . early. Roofers take their lunch break in the shade of a tree in rural Nebraska as a late summer heat wave has sent temperatures into the high 90's . Parts of all 10 of district buildings have air conditioning, but some rooms aren't connected. 'The buildings can heat up pretty fast, especially when you have kids in there,' district spokesman Jason Staker said. 'It's not a good environment for students or teachers.' Five elementary schools in Fargo, North Dakota, have canceled classes through Wednesday because the buildings aren't fully air-conditioned. Temperatures inside them on Sunday ranged from 85 degrees to 90 degrees, Fargo Schools Superintendent Jeff Schatz said. In South Dakota, the Sioux Falls School District continued with classes as scheduled, but spokeswoman DeeAnn Konrad said teachers kept window blinds closed and turned off lights in classrooms. Swimmers use a rope swing over Airport Lake in Winona, Minn. as temperatures hit a record 98 in the Twin Cities . The district was also prepared to move students into cooler rooms at nearby churches and a Christian school, she said. School administrators in the western Nebraska town of Alliance decided to send students home early after local forecasters predicted temperatures in excess of 90 degrees. Some classes in the 1,600-student district are held on the third floor, and temperatures rise when students fill the room. 'It can get uncomfortable even when the temperatures are in the upper 80s,' superintendent Troy Unzicker said. Minneapolis students had to go to school all day, but administrators canceled after-school activities and distributed 750 cases of water to schools. Officials also sent industrial fans to the 18 buildings that lack air conditioning, district spokeswoman Rachel Hicks said. Five year-old Grace Kennedy cools off from the heat in a water fountain in Stinson Park in Omaha, Nebraska . Parents were advised to dress their kids in light clothing, while staffers watched for any symptoms of heat-related illnesses. In Des Moines, organizers of a downtown farmers market set for Wednesday postponed the event out concern over the extreme heat. The Iowa Department of Public Health issued a statewide advisory for vulnerable populations, including young children and the elderly. In some cases, the heat can become so extreme that sweating isn't enough for people to lower their body temperatures, Dr. Patricia Quinlisk said. 'Especially when the humidity is high, sweat will not evaporate as quickly, preventing the body from releasing heat quickly,' she said.","Much of the Midwest is experiencing unseasonally high temperatures .

'I was just like, ""I need to go somewhere and release. I need to feel different."" There were times where I said, ""Yo, I gotta go away for two days."" I would go to practice, then nobody could find me.' In the interview, Lamar claimed he had not smoked marijuana since his second suspension and put his drug use behind him. He declared he would 'probably start crying' if he did the drug again. However, recent reports allege that Lamar is now in far deeper trouble, with his 'drug problem' reportedly the real reason behind his 'split' with wife Khloe, according to TMZ. (Representatives from both Lamar and Khloe have yet to comment on the drug use allegations and reports of a split.) Khloe has reportedly been attempting to 'save' her husband of four years from his alleged abuse of drugs after recently driving to see him at an undisclosed location. The website alleges . that Khloe and her family attempted to stage an intervention last week which resulted in Lamar leaving the marital home. He was pictured on Wednesday as an associate loaded a number of large . suitcases into his car in Calabasas, California. Sources familiar with the situation told TMZ that 'Khloe has not given up on Lamar' but 'will never get back with him until he's clean. The 29-year-old TV personality is . also said to have taken 'no steps to file for divorce because she . believes there's still a chance for Lamar to be saved,' the report adds. 'They . really do love each other,' a source told People. 'But she really feels . that this problem is out of control, and she's hurt that he won't get . help.' Sad: Lamar's mother, right, died of colon cancer when he was 12-years-old and his father, right was not around when he was a child . No other members of the Kardashian . family have commented on the alleged issues between the couple, with . Kris Jenner looking in good spirits as she visited a friend in Beverly . Hills on Sunday. But Khloe appears to be feeling the pressure, taking to her Twitter page in an expletive filled rant following more reports about her NBA star husband. She wrote on Sunday: 'Really hard to sit here and listen to . people talk s*** about my family! F*** you and shame on you! I'm too . protective for this s***!' Solace: Kris Jenner was spotted visiting a friend in Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon amid reports her daughter Khloe has separated from husband Lamar Odom . Reports included the allegation that people close to the NBA star had been unable to find or . contact him for 72 hours over the weekend although a representative for Lamar denied this. A spokesperson for the basketball star told TMZ on Sunday afternoon that he was fine but would not reveal his whereabouts. 'Lamar is not missing. His wife knows exactly where he is,' his agent Jeff Schwartz told ESPN. Back in August last year, Khloe is said to have . urged Lamar to go to rehab and after he entered a San . Diego facility she hired private investigators to make sure he didn't . leave. At her breaking point: Khloe finally tweeted her frustration with people talking 's**t' about her current marital situation . Online affirmation: Khloe posted a tweet on Friday citing the importance of strength to survival . Heartfelt: Lamar posted a tweet last month supporting Khloe as claims of his infidelity surfaced . Lamar reportedly . constantly threatened to leave the rehab clinic and Khloe visited . several times to convince him to stay, but he left after three weeks, . sources said. Lamar, who won two championships with . the Los Angeles Lakers, stayed clean and played well last season for the . Los Angeles Clippers, but sources said he resumed using drugs after the . season. The . couple have also been subject to persistent rumours that their marriage is . in trouble after Lamar, allegedly cheated on Khloe with two . different women. 'Thrown out': Lamar was seen outside the home he shares with Khloe in Calabasas, California on Wednesday . Packed bags: A man was seen loading large amounts of luggage into Lamar's car while the basketball star stood by . TMZ reported Khloe is 'convinced it happened' as regards reports of Lamar's infidelity, but feels his drug . abuse has been the main problem in their relationship. 'Khloe is more concerned about saving Lamar than ending her marriage,' a source told TMZ. The couple got married in 2009 about a month after meeting each other.

The diamond as big as the Ritz: The world's biggest and round-cut diamond is going on sale . The world's largest and rarest round-cut diamond is creating a stir among millionaires, who are set to fetch bid more than £12million at auction for it. The 7.59-carat round vivid blue diamond, named Premier Blue, is the only one of its kind on record. It will go sale in Hong Kong at Sotheby's on October 7. The exceptionally rare gem is approximately the size of a shirt button. The brilliant-cut, internally flawless gem  is that largest of its type as round cut is rarely used in coloured diamonds due to high waste in the cutting process. And the rarity of the sale is expected to spark a bidding war among East Asian collectors - who have followed it around its world tour across London, Geneva, New York and Doha. Luxury auctioneers Sotheby's have predicted a record £12million ($19million) sale, and selected bustling jewellery market Hong Kong as the final destination. Quek Chin Yeow, deputy chairman of Sotheby's in Asia, said: 'No significant round fancy vivid blue diamond has ever appeared at auction worldwide thus making the Premier Blue a rare and exceptional gem. 'For around seven years Hong Kong has ranked alongside Geneva and New York as a centre for jewellery sales. 'It is now the third pillar of the global jewellery market.' Eagerly-anticipated: Sotheby's in Hong Kong says the diamond could set a price-per-carat record . The choice of Hong Kong as a place to sell the stone underlines just how important Asia has become as a consumer of luxury items, as rapid growth has swelled the ranks of the ultrarich. Despite the nation's rapid growth seemingly reaching its peak, it has not dented the ability and willingness of these superrich to spend - as the rich generally remain rich even when times are worse, luxury industry analysts said.

She rose to fame with her large brood on Jon & Kate Plus Eight, before stepping away from the spotlight in 2011. Now, Kate Gosselin is back in the headlines as she seeks multimillion dollar compensation in a lawsuit filed against ex-husband Jon Gosselin. As reported by RadarOnline, the mom-of-eight is suing her ex for wiretapping, computer hacking, identity theft and invasion of privacy. A woman scorned: Kate Gosselin has filed a multimillion dollar lawsuit against ex-husband Jon Gosselin, alleging wiretapping, computer hacking, identity theft and invasion of privacy . Filing paperwork in the United States District Court Of Pennsylvania on Monday, the blonde star has alleged that Jon conspired with his business partner, tabloid reporter Robert Hoffman - who is also named in the lawsuit along with as many as 20 unidentified John and Jane Does - to access her records without her knowledge or permission. Hoffman is said to have used the information Jon obtained from his former wife's bank accounts and personal email correspondence to pen unauthorised e-book Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled The World. While the defamatory tome has been pulled from retailers such as Amazon due to the alleged illegal nature in which the information was obtained, the damage was already done. As her lawyer, A Jordan Rushie, states: 'Jon violated a federal anti-hacking statute in order to publish salacious, scandalous and defamatory information about Kate. It's damaged her reputation.' Conspiracy theory: Jon is alleged to have conspired against his ex with pal Robert Hoffman, who went on to publish unauthorised and defamatory e-book Kate Gosselin: How She Fooled The World . While Kate has never confirmed the authenticity of the supposed 'journal' extracts that were published in their entirety in Hoffman's book, passages included talk of spanking her children and her fears that she would harm them. 'After the couple was separated, Jon illegally hacked into Kate’s email account and her phone and bank accounts. Jon also stole a hard drive from Kate’s house, which contained private and confidential material,' the suit alleges. 'Jon then gave the contents... to his friend and business partner, tabloid reporter Robert Hoffman. 'Hoffman used the illegally-acquired data to publish a defamatory book about Kate.' Suit filed: Kate's lawyers filed the 17-page lawsuit in the United States District Court Of Pennsylvania Monday . Conflicting stories: Hoffman says he obtained the hard drive to Kate's computer after rifling through her garbage, however the suit counters, 'He did not find this trove of personal information while engaging in his trash-picking endeavors' It also goes on to state that Hoffman is still in possession of the material, having 'bragged' that he has 5000 family photos, as well as tax records, personal documents and contracts. According to Radar, 38-year-old Kate cites that Hoffman falsely alleged that he had recovered said computer data from her garbage after digging through the trash. 'This demonstrates his knowledge that the materials were obtained illegally, as it is a sign of an attempt to cover up his unlawful activities,' the suit states. 'He did not find this trove of personal information while engaging in his trash-picking endeavours.' Kate Plus Eight: Kate has primary custody of the couple's twins and sextuplets, who rose to fame on TLC series Jon & Kate Plus Eight, since their 2009 divorce . Kate alleges that Hoffman and her ex were cohorts who used the information and 'distorted the facts to make stories more salacious for the tabloids'. The so-called conspiracy was initially exposed by James McGibney, an anti-bullying activist who revealed the deceit via a number of text messages, which he published on BullyVille.com. The cell-phone number was confirmed as belonging to father-of-eight Jon and contained such incriminating texts as, 'Grabbing Kate’s computer before she gets home. I need that hard drive,' which was dated October 14, 2009. Another conversation read: 'I’m giving it to a good friend of mine to hold. 'No one will know. Rob is going to say he took it from our garbage.'

MailOnline has learned that Virgin Chairman Sir Richard Branson may be the person behind at least onee of the massive tips left in the Ogden, Utah area around August 17. Sir Richard was in town and seen going out, according to multiple sources. Big tipper: Sir Richard Branson is rumored to be the man throwing generous tips around Ogden, Utah . The three tips, totaling $7,000, have garnered worldwide attention as people try to figure out who left gratuities big enough to bring one server to tears and to take down a bar’s computer system. The small town 40 miles north of Salt Lake City was abuzz last weekend when a bar patron left a $5,000 tip on a check just over $214 at a local bar named Brewski’s. Playland: Ogden, Utahs's 'Historic 25th Street' is filled with bars, restaurants and shops . Jackpot: A lucky bartender at Ogden bar Brewski's received a $5,000 tip on a $249 check . This act of kindness was followed the . next night by a tip of $1,000 on a $49 check at Alleged, another local . bar. The tip was so big that it had to be charged as a separate sale . since the bar’s computer system only allows for tips up to 100 percent, . not 2,000 per cent. Monster tip: It may have been Sir Richard who left a $5,000 tip August 17 on a $214 check . These two acts of generosity were preceded by a $1,000 tip being given to a girl running the beer cart at a local golf course. The girl was brought to tears by the gesture, according to a local paper. Alleged owner Jared Allen, when reached by MailOnline, denied that his bar saw Sir Richard the night the large tip was dropped, but Allen did say the famous billionaire was in town that weekend. It also has not been confirmed that only one person left all three tips. When reached by phone at Brewski’s, a person identified only as ‘Delaney’ would not comment on the tip to MailOnline and said a manager who wasn’t in for several days would have to be reached. ‘The owners are hardly ever here,’ she added. Brewski’s owners have not spoken to other outlets looking for comment on the tip. Sir Richard may have been in town as part of the planning for the Summit Series, an annual conference for entrepreneurs that recently bought an entire mountain to make its home base, according to the conference’s website. Ogden is the closest town to the mountain. 'The rumor is that Branson was in town meeting with organizers of the Summit Series,' another source wrote in an email MailOnline. A keynote speaker at the 2011 conference, Sir Richard has been said to heavily involved in planning future events. Sir Richard is Britain's sixth-wealthiest person with a net income of $4.6billion, according to Forbes.

Clint Eastwood, the star of the Super Bowl's most controversial TV ad, has denied the Chrysler spot was a booster for President Obama's re-election campaign. The ad, which declares 'it's halftime in America,' has received mounting criticism from Republicans, who say it was a thinly-veiled nod to President Obama, who bailed out the auto industry during the recession. The ad was subject to additional . backlash today after it emerged that it wasn't even filmed in Detroit at . all -  but in New Orleans and Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . 'Halftime in America': Clint Eastwood leads a cast of major celebrities featuring in this year's Super Bowl ads . 'l am certainly not politically affiliated with Mr Obama,' Eastwood told Fox News Monday. 'It was meant to be a message about just about job growth and the spirit of America. I think all politicians will agree with it.' In a short statement to the network, the 81-year-old actor and director said he believed the ad was being 'spun' by political partisans, though that was never the intention of the clip. The comments come as it was revealed the ad, which speaks prominently of the hardship in Detroit was not even filmed in the Motor City. The news was reminiscent of the . Jennifer Lopez controversy in November, when it was discovered that the . singer was featured in a Fiat commercial set in her hometown of the . Bronx, New York - but in reality, she never left Los Angeles to film her . part. Chrysler spokeswoman Dianna Gutierrez told the Weekly Standard that Mr Eastwood's tunnel scenes were actually shot at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. She added that stadium shots were done in New Orleans. Among the goofy Super Bowl ads aimed . at selling beer and Doritos, Chrysler's commercial stood out as the . automaker sent the veteran actor to strike a serious chord with viewers. A strong message: Chrysler's commercial stood out as the automaker sent out Mr Eastwood to strike a serious chord with viewers . Should NBC have been allowed to broadcast Clint Eastwood's politically-charged Super Bowl ad for Chrysler? 'People are out of work and they’re . hurting. And they’re all wondering what they’re going to do to make a . comeback. And we’re all scared, because this isn’t a game,' The . Dirty Harry star says in his trademark vocal growl. 'The people of . Detroit know a little something about this. They almost lost everything. But we all pulled together, now Motor City is fighting again.' But on Monday Karl Rove, a former political adviser for President George W. Bush, told Fox News that he was 'offended' by the advertisement. He said: “I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, I thought it was an extremely well-done ad, but it is a sign of what happens when you have Chicago-style politics, and the president of the United States and his political minions are, in essence, using our tax dollars to buy corporate advertising'. Another Republican pundit, Michelle Malkin, took to Twitter to vent her rage, saying: 'Agh. WTH? Did I just see Clint Eastwood fronting an auto bailout ad???' Mr Eastwood stepped into the shoes left vacant by rapper Eminem, who delivered his own Motor City unity speech for Chrysler last year. Motor City: Mr Eastwood says in the ad that the people of Detroit know something about mounting a comeback . The ad drew praise from the Obama camp. White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer tweeted: 'Saving the America Auto Industry: Something Eminem and Clint Eastwood can agree on'. Last year, the Treasury Department reported that taxpayers likely lost up to $1.3billion in the Chrysler. However, the agency touted the finding as a ‘major accomplishment,’ as the government originally predicted that the government would lose $40billion on the deal, CNN reported. Attack: Karl Rove, left, said he was 'offended' by the ad, while Michelle Malkin took to her Twitter page, right, to call out Mr Eastwood for 'fronting an auto bailout ad' Criticism: Despite what may be perceived as political undertones in the ad, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne insisted the ad has 'zero political content' Despite what may be perceived as . political undertones in the ad, Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne insisted . the ad has 'zero political content'. Before 'Halftime in America,' Chrysler was in the Super Bowl ad business last year with a two-minute commercial starring rapper Eminem. The ad, which was set over Eminem's anthem Lose Yourself from the film 8 Mile put him and his hometown in the national spotlight. In 2011, Chrysler was trying to reinforce itself as a luxury brand in the year’s biggest advertising showcase. CEO Sergio Marchionne said that the automaker purchased the ad in an effort to convince people that the company has changed. He didn't give an exact cost but said Chrysler paid less than $9 million for the ad. Mr Marchionne added: 'We are as . apolitical as you can make us... and I sincerely hope that it doesn't . get utilized as political fodder in a debate. Mr Eastwood himself is no stranger to the political fray. He served as an unaffiliated mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, from 1986 to 1988, and has contributed to both Republican and Democratic causes over the years. The ad is sure to ignite tensions on the 2012 campaign trail, as Obama can hold it up as a triumph for the controversial bailouts he authorised for Chrysler and GM three years ago. But it could come back to bite Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney, who argued in November that the bailouts in his home state of Michigan, were the 'wrong way to go'. Mr Eastwood joined a class that included comedian Jerry Seinfeld, actor Matthew Broderick and Victoria's Secret model Adriana Lima (twice!) who took turns in various TV spots aimed at selling products ranging from cars to Doritos.

If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen... but even then you'd be hard pushed to escape the 'fiery' surroundings of this household. Spice-obsessed Vic Clinco is believed to have the world's biggest hot sauce collection - a whopping 6,000 bottles and counting. The condiments line shelves, from floor to ceiling, in the dining room of his home in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as being crammed into cupboards and the fridge. Spice-obsessed Vic Clinco is believed to have the world's biggest hot sauce collection - a whopping 6,000 bottles and counting . The condiments line shelves, from floor to ceiling at his home in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as being crammed into cupboards and the fridge . Mr Clinco has been collecting the jars for the past 17 years . He has been collecting the jars for the past 17 years and is widely thought to hold the world record for a private collection. Mr Clinco, who works as a staff cook at the Four Seasons hotel, said his most expensive bottle is worth about $900 (£580) - a one of a kind - and the most he has ever paid for a bottle is $400 (£260). His obsession started when his wife bought him 12 bottles as a gift in 1996. He said: 'It was simple enough. My wife Wendy had purchased them for me for our first Christmas together. 'I had lined the bottles up on the kitchen counter and when our friends and family were coming over for the holidays, we would laugh and giggle over some of the funny and crude labels on the bottles - that's what sparked the obsession.' Mr Clinco, who gave up a career in retail after 23 years in order to properly pursue his passion for spice, said he believes there are still 'hundreds of thousands' of bottles still to collect . The chilli fanatic's obsession started when his wife, Wendy, bought him 12 bottles as a gift in 1996 . Mr Clinco added it's impossible to put a price on his collection but to him it's 'priceless' Mr Clinco added it's impossible to put a price on his collection but to him it's 'priceless'. He said: 'I can't honestly say how much the entire collection is worth but I know it's a lot - it's impossible to put an accurate dollar amount to it. 'I have bottles made specifically for me and many bottles from companies that are no longer in business. 'I've also got tons of sauces signed or autographed, and many promotional and special event sauces that makes me unable to put a price tag on.' Among his collection are an extremely rare pair of Adam And Eve sauces from CaJohn's Fiery Foods and one of his 'prized' items is two bottles of Blair's Calderas (caldera means 'volcanic cauldron') that are incredibly hard to find. Blair's also make the Guinness World Record certified hottest sauce on the planet - the Caldera 16 Mil. This is short for 16 million Scoville units - the measurement used to gauge the pungency and spiciness of chilli peppers. And, of course, Mr Clinco managed to get his hands on a bottle. Apparently, there are only 499 bottles in existence - and on specialist hot sauce websites, a bottle retails for almost £3,000. He said: 'To put how hot that is in perspective, 11 million Scoville units is hotter than most police pepper sprays in the States - they mostly range from between 2 Mil and 9 Mil. 'It is actually not even a true sauce, it's in crystallised form. And that's pretty darn cool. Mr Clinco also writes for Chile Pepper magazine and is an old pro on the hot-sauce circuit. He even has his own heat tolerance competition at the shows called the 'CaJohn's Execution Station'. He said: 'It's a seven-sauce challenge, beginning at hot and each sauce climbs a little more, getting hotter and hotter as it goes. 'The challenge is to make it from level one all the way up to level seven without passing out on me or throwing up on my table - which does happen. 'It's no joke and most people quit around level number four or five. 'Only the strongest survive until the end and walk away with bragging rights and is the envy of all their friends.' Mr Clinco, who gave up a career in retail after 23 years in order to properly pursue his passion for spice, said he believes there are still 'hundreds of thousands' of bottles still to collect because the industry is constantly growing. He added: 'I'm not a hot sauce producer or manufacturer, I consider myself a voice, an educator of the industry I love so much. 'I am in no way trying to sell anyone on a sauce I made. I am trying to sell the world on hot sauce in general.

"PUBLISHED: . 12:45 EST, 16 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:45 EST, 16 August 2013 . For men, growing their facial hair throughout the month of November has become a brilliant, if itchy, way to make money for charity. Dubbed Movember, the winter month sees chaps of all ages, occupations and facial fur levels get sponsored to grow impressive moustaches in a bid to raise awareness and funds for prostate cancer. Last year, an enterprising group of feminists were inspired by the movement to start their own hair-growing charity enterprise and Armpits4August was born. Armpits4August is a charity event encouraging women to grow their armpit hair for August to raise money for PCOS charity Verity.  One of the organisers Tasha Skerman-Gray appeared on This Morning to encourage women to throw away their razors . The idea is simple, throughout the month of August women are encouraged to let their armpit hair grow, asking friends and family to sponsor them to raise money for Verity, the charity for people with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS affects up to 10% of women and a common symptom can be excessive hair growth, so by growing their hair the group say that they are 'working towards having pride in our body hair, not shame'. As well as raising money and awareness for the PCOS charity the group hope that the action, if picked up by enough women, will be successful in changing attitudes about body hair and femininity. Currently the idea of growing body hair, especially armpit hair, is alien to most western women. But why does the subject cause such controversy, and can Armpits4August succeed in making body hair on women norm rather than niche? One of the organisers of event Tasha Skerman-Gray, 25,appeared on This Morning today to discuss the charity event and encourage women to throw away the razor. The feminist campaigner, who hasn't shaved any part of her body for four years, proudly showed off her full armpit hair as she debated the issue with hosts Jenni Falconer and Jeff Brazier. She said: 'I stopped shaving because I was working as a nanny and thought that the children won't care, then I realised that I actually really liked it so decide to stop completely. The Armpits4August website has full information on the initiative and upcoming events for part or full-time hairies . Movember encourages men to grow moustaches to raise money for prostate cancer and the girls can get involved with moustache merchandise . 'The reactions aren't as bad as you think. Sometimes people stare, especially on the tube, but I just stare back. 'Originally I was really embarrassed because I wasn't really comfortable with it and I had never seen my own body hair. I worried that people were staring at me and worried what they might think, but after a while I realised ""it's totally fine, it's just a part of my body"". 'I think my body hair looks really nice. I take pride in my appearance and I don't see why that should include shaving.' As part of the Armpits4August campaigning group Tasha, who fondly calls her hairy armpits her 'pit kittens', is often demonstrating with other women who refuse to shave, and while most people are sympathetic to their cause, some women have been overtly hostile. She said: 'When we were doing activity for Armpits4August and there were a lot of us with hairy armpits one women walked past and started retching, and one woman walked past and said she would rather have cancer then hairy armpits, which is obviously really insensitive.' The subject proved a hot topic on Twitter following the TV debate with hundreds tweeting in support of letting female body hair do its own thing. One feminist blogger said: '""My bf wouldnt go near me if i had #hairypits"" says one Tweeter. Um, change your boyfriend then, not your pits. #saynotobodypolicing' Another tweeted: 'I think of my body hair as a d!ckhead repellent.' It's not to late for women to get . involved and the group is organising a Pit Party in London at the end of . August for people to show off their newly-grown pits with pride. See armpits4august.org for more details . Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects how a woman’s ovaries work. PCOS affects millions of women in the UK. There are three features which lead to a woman being diagnosed with PCOS. Even if only two of them are present, this is enough to confirm the diagnosis. The features of PCOS include: . These can lead to the following symptoms: . What are polycystic ovaries?Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless cysts that are no bigger than 8mm each. Normal ovaries have only about half this number of cysts. The cysts are under-developed follicles which contain eggs that haven’t developed properly. Often in PCOS, these follicles are unable to release an egg, meaning ovulation doesn’t take place. Many women have polycystic ovaries without having the syndrome (without the symptoms). Some women have the syndrome, but have normal-looking ovaries on ultrasound. Causes of polycystic ovary syndromeThe exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but it often runs in families. Women who are overweight are more at risk of developing PCOS. Many women with PCOS have a family history of diabetes and high cholesterol. It’s also believed that insulin may play a role. Insulin is a hormone that controls sugar levels in the body. Many women with PCOS have too much insulin in their body, which contributes to the increased production and activity of male hormones. Being overweight increases the amount of insulin that your body produces. - http://armpits4august.org/ .","Armpits4August encourages women to grow their underarm hair for charity .

For a Scottish climbing challenge that goes a bit beyond the natural beauty of the Cairngorns, look no further than the train. Visitors to Edinburgh could be able to don hard hats and carabinas to scale one of the most iconic monuments in the country - the Forth railway bridge. Network Rail is planning to offer guided tours to the top of the bridge in time for its 125th anniversary in 2015. All aboard: An artist's impression of the visitor centre designed by Network Rail to act as a start point for tours of the Forth railway bridge . Groups of 15 people would be taken from South Queensferry along an existing walkway under the approach span close to Dalmeny Station. Wearing the requisite safety gear, they would climb to the top of the south tower, where a small bridge has been proposed. The railway authority has also proposed a second concept for less adventurous climbers that includes a visitors' centre and viewing platform linked by a lift on the north side, which would take groups to the top of one of the towers more than 100 metres above the Firth of Forth. A video outlining the proposals suggests a glass-ceiling centre could be tucked under the massive steel structure at North Queensferry, opening up a 'cathedral-like' view above. The proposals would costs an estimated £12-15 million to deliver and could be 'partially realised' within two years, Network Rail said. Going up: A lift would link the visitors' centre and viewing platform to the north side of the bridge . To scale: A second plan would allow visitors to do more challenging walks from a smaller base to the top of the south tower . David Simpson, route managing director at the rail authority, said: 'After 10 years spent restoring the bridge to its full glory, and in advance of the application for world heritage listing, these plans will offer the public the chance to visit the bridge and see it close-up for the first time. 'We are hugely excited by these proposals and believe that they have the potential to be developed into an important new visitor attraction for Scotland.' Network Rail said the visitor attraction could be developed without any serious changes to 'the well loved view of the bridge'. It said the bridge would remain a key part of the railway service, with any profits going to fund its upkeep. The Forth railway bridge carries more than 200 trains a day between Edinburgh and Fife. Masterpiece: Designers Sir John Fowler and Benjamin Baker wanted the bridge to look indestructible . Rights of passage: The bridge provided the first non-ferry link between Edinburgh and Fife, linking key cities such as Aberdeen . Iconic: HRH Edward, Prince of Wales, added the final rivet to the structure when it opened on 4 March 1890 . Along with the Forth road bridge, it provides the key link between the capital and northern Scotland, including key cities such as Aberdeen. Mr Simpson said: 'We are committed to working with communities, local authorities and relevant government bodies to develop plans that have a sustainable positive impact on the area. 'While we expect that visitor numbers will be high, we're committed to encouraging as many of those visitors as possible to travel by rail and we will develop plans alongside train operators to incentivise that option.' Transport Minister Keith Brown, speaking on behalf of the Forth Bridge Forum, said: 'I welcome Network Rail's exciting and ambitious plans to combine an historic and vital part of Scotland's transport network with a breath-taking attraction for visitors to enjoy.'","Network Rail designs visitors' centre and viewing platforms at Forth railway bridge .

Budget supermarket Aldi, the go-to shop for the recession-hit middle classes, has won a prestigious gold medal award for its own brand scotch. Experts at the International Wine and Spirits competition awarded the chain the top award for its Highland Black 8 Year Old Scotch Whisky, which costs £13.19. The accolade is the latest in a long line of awards given to the chain's world-class alcohol range. A bottle of Aldi's Monsigny champagne, which costs just £12.99, beat some of the world's most renowned champagnes in a blind taste test in May. Its £10 gin was praised in April for its 'clear, crisp, complex flavour' which beat well-known brands up to ten times the price. Judges of the supermarket's whiskey said it has a, 'super balance, and super smooth flow leading into long, fruit filled finish.' The Highland Black is made from a blend of grain and . malt whiskies and previously secured top prizes at the Scotch Whisky . Masters and International Spirits Challenge earlier this year. Tony Baines, MD Buying at Aldi, said: . 'It’s a massive achievement to win just one gold medal for our . own-label whisky, but three is just fantastic. 'We’ve always been very proud of it, but it’s great to see the world’s leading drinks experts agree with us. 'It just goes to show that buying world-class drinks doesn’t have to cost the earth.' Aldi has benefited from the economic downturn as hard-up shoppers defected to . the cheaper supermarket chain for affordable, high quality goods. The . store beat the 'big four' chains- Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and . Morrissons- to be named Britain's best supermarket by Which? last month. Which? said it was named the winner for its range of best buys, quality food and good pricing. The . consumer champion said: 'Its low prices don't seem to compromise on . quality. Within Aldi's keenly priced range it has produced a number of . best buys. Middle class haven: The budget supermarket has become popular with shoppers who would traditionally buy their groceries from Waitrose . What to buy: The Grocer magazine named Aldi Grocer Of The Year and gave 16 products a coveted gold medal . Proud: Managing director of Aldi Tony Baines said the award validated their sought-after product. He said: 'We've always been very proud of it, but it's great to see the world¿s leading drinks experts agree with us' 'We've seen . everyday items, such as Magnum Eucalyptus Antibacterial washing-up . liquid and Almat with Stain-Lift Bio Powder, do better than costly . rivals.' Aldi has made huge efforts to attract Middle Britain shoppers by introducing a range of superior products at budget prices from fine wines and spirits, to coffee, olive oil and Aberdeen Angus steaks. The group slims down its overheads and profit margins to the minimum with minimalist stores, fewer staff and charges for plastic bags. It does not stock any of the big brands, like Kellogg’s and Heinz, however it has run into trouble for creating its own cheaper copycat versions.","Highland Black 8 Year Old Scotch Whiskey received the top prize .

Chris Horner, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said the scrutiny over the alias emails tied to coal regulation, which will be publicly released next month, is clearly a factor behind EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson’s decision to step down. ‘Life's full of coincidences, but this is too many,’ Horner told FoxNews.com. ‘She had no choice.’ He called Jackson's account a ‘deliberate, several stage deception.’ Stepping down: EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, who set up a 'secondary' alias email account possibly to conduct business inside the agency, announced her plans to resign on Thursday . 'She had no choice': Chris Horner, an outspoken skeptic of climate change, said the scrutiny over the alias emails tied to coal regulation is clearly a factor behind Jackson's decision to resign . Horner and the CEI sued the EPA in the fall for ignoring requests for documents tied to Jackson's use of the alias email account. The conservative lawyer, who is an outspoken skeptic of climate change, said on Thursday that the increased scrutiny on the account combined with what the thousands of secret emails might contain regarding the Obama administration's alleged ‘war on coal,’ led to Jackson's announcement earlier in the day. ‘She, by her action, told us that these are records she doesn't want the people to see,’ Horner said. The EPA, represented by the Justice Department, agreed two weeks ago to release as many as 12,000 emails related to CEI requests beginning January 14, and continue at a rate of 3,000 documents per month, court documents state. Jackson, 50, the agency's first black administrator, said in a written statement on Thursday that she is leaving the EPA after four years on the job, for ‘new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference.’ The EPA did not offer further explanation. Her departure also comes as environmental activists are increasingly . questioning Obama’s commitment to dealing with climate change and . other environmental problems, according to the New York Times. President Obama, in a written statement, made no reference to the alias emails. ‘Over the last four years, Lisa Jackson has shown an unwavering commitment to the health of our families and our children,’ the President said. ‘Under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.’ It was revealed in November that Jackson’s secret identity email account name is ‘Richard Windsor,’ which derived from her family dog Richard and her hometown East Windsor, New Jersey. Jackson has said that she used the second account because her public email address was widely known. 'New Challenges': Jackson, the agency's first black administrator, said she is leaving the EPA after four years on the job, for 'new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference' Earlier in December, the EPA inspector general's office said that it was opening an audit into the agency's ‘electronic records management practices.’ The office said it would look into whether the EPA was encouraging the use of ‘private or alias email accounts to conduct official government business.’ Horner told WND in October that the Obama administration has routinely tried to hinder his requests for information by forwarding them to the wrong agencies and saying he would have to pay large fees for the documents to be processed. Other times his requests were flat out ignored, he said. Horner has filed multiple Freedom of Information Act requests to get documents from the past three administrations. Jackson's tenure at the EPA was marked by a string of high-profile brawls over global warming pollution between her agency, the energy industry and Republicans in Congress. Under her leadership, the EPA established the first standards for emissions of mercury, arsenic and other airborne toxins from power plants. Jackson played a key role in pushing for a delay in the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline. During her four years as EPA chief, congressional Republicans repeatedly tried to block the agency's regulations on coal and other industries. Jackson's resignation is effective following the President's State of the Union address next month. No successor was immediately named. It is expected that the EPA's deputy administrator, Robert Perciasepe, will take over temporarily. Political career: Jackson led New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection from 2006 to 2008 under Governor Jon S. Corzine before Obama chose her to head the federal environmental agency .","It was revealed in November that EPA Chief Lisa Jackson, 50, had sent thousands of emails tied to coal regulation from a secret alias account .

For Maximus Thaler one man's rubbish is his treasure as he stocks his fridge full of the food he finds in dustbins. From fresh vegetables and eggs to juicy steaks and ready-made meals, Mr Thaler scavenges food from supermarket bins and uses it to cook delicious meals for himself, his friends and even the local community.

Fully stocked: Mr Thaler's fridges groan under the weight of food he and friends have recovered from rubbish . A bath full of the juices Mr Thaler and friends have found: 'You can find anything you see on the shelves in a supermarket in the bin, organic vegetables, fruit, juices, eggs, milk, yoghurt,' he said . Dining on food from a bin may not sound like the ingredients for a perfect meal to most, but for Mr Thaler 'dumpster diving' is a way of life. The thrifty 22-year-old from Somerville, Massachusetts, is a Freegan, which means he adopts an anti-consumerist lifestyle. He opposes materialism, conformity and greed and believes in consuming little and wasting less. Mr Thaler and his band of fellow freegans dig through bins in search of edible food, flowers and any other usable items. They then sift through the gleaned goodies and determine which are useful. Rotten food is thrown away and salvageable food is washed and used to make meals. Mr Thaler and fellow freegans beam with delight . at their haul of food: Mr Thaler said he's been raiding dustbins since . he was at university, but it is only since last summer he has survived . exclusively off found food . Who needs food banks? As this picture shows, Mr Thaler and friends have more food than they can store . Overflow: They are even forced to keep some of their massive haul outside on the verandah . Variety is the spice of life: Since everything . is free, they can afford to have several different kinds of potatoes in . their larder - plus sweet potatoes to boot . Mr Thaler said: 'I started dumpster diving when I was at university, there was a group of freegan's who regularly got together at the nearby supermarket. 'I've been a freegan for around four years now but since last summer I've got all my food from a dumpster. 'You can find anything you see on the shelves in a supermarket in the bin, organic vegetables, fruit, juices, eggs, milk, yoghurts. Absolutely anything. 'When I first heard of dumpster diving I really wrestled with the idea, what does it mean to buy food in a supermarket and then see that same food in thrown away? 'There's a bunch of food that's thrown . away, just because of a packaging default. No-one wants to buy . something where the packaging is torn so the supermarket can't sell that . and throw it away. 'Sometimes they'll be a box of a dozen . eggs where one yolk has broken and there's egg on the box, so it's . thrown away even though 11 of the eggs are perfectly fine. 'Supermarkets . also purposely buy more than they can sell so their shelves look . plentiful and that excess food ends up in the bin. 'Expiration . dates also a reason why good food is often binned, they say it expires . but there's no legal guidance on expiration dates and the food is still . perfectly fine to eat after it is said to have expired. 'The problem is an economic one, it's not as easy as telling supermarkets to give this food away instead of throwing it away. 'We . shouldn't be shopping at large grocery or convenience stores and . instead buying quantity in bulk from local distributors or farmers . markets.' Cooking up a storm: Mr Thaler has been able to scavenge so much food from bins that it's too much for him to eat, so in order to make the most of this free food he started sharing it with his community .

Organiser . Janet Kalish, who has been practising Freeganism for two decades, said: . 'We're finding these tours to be extremely popular.

'Once . a month, we invite new attendees to come on our trash tours of the . village and then for a meal the next day with the food we've recovered. 'There . is no reason for this food to be thrown out. It is just as good now as . it was 20 minutes ago when it was in the supermarket. 'Many . of the Freegans are young professionals who are environmentally and . politically conscious, but we also find that many of them are people who . cannot afford the high cost of food in New York City.'

A pair of charity fundraisers have driven 10,000 miles to Mongolia across 15 countries, 10 mountain ranges and three deserts - in a Nissan Micra. Friends William Roberts and Liam Squires, both 23, survived six weeks driving some of the world’s worst roads from Anglesey, in north Wales to the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. The pair were driven to 'breaking point' as they battled through baking hot deserts and had to contend with flat tyres, broken axles and a disintegrating roof rack. They completed the Mongol Rally - described as the 'greatest adventure in the world' - in a 10-year-old 1.2 litre Nissan Micra. The pair said the epic journey featured 'some of the toughest and most stressful' moments of their lives. They kept supporters updated with their travels and troubles during their 44 tough days by writing a blog. The Welsh wanderers began their adventure at Dover castle on July 14 and drove throughFrance, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia before ending in Mongolia.

A Green Party-controlled local authority has been accused of plotting a 'backdoor mansion tax' which would see owners of homes worth £2million or more paying over £9,000 a year in rates. Brighton council is said to be the first council in the country to explore the idea of a 'progressive council tax'. The system, which is being opposed by both the town's Labour and Tory councillors, would lead to a 'steep increase' in the amount billed to each of the city's 120,000 households. The Green Party-controlled local authority are considering introducing a 'progressive council tax' that would see wealthy homeowners paying over £9,000 in rates . However, supporters claim only the richest 20 per cent would end up paying the hike as four-fifths of homes would be eligible for a discount. They argue it would be a fairer way of raising revenue as the Government cuts town hall budgets by millions of pounds every year. However, critics slammed the idea as 'dangerous' and 'unworkable', adding it could see the richest pay up to 200 per cent more in council tax every year. Council leader Jason Kitcat said: 'It's really refreshing to see party members coming up with ideas which seek to minimise the draconian cuts being handed down by this coalition Government which have been adding further to the problems heaped on our city by Westminster. Owners of some of Brighton's most expensive properties such as these Grade I listed Regency terraces close to the seafront would faces council tax increases of 200% . 'No other party in the city seems even interested in tackling austerity.' Currently . the Government has placed a cap of 2 per cent on any annual increase in . council tax. Any rise above that can only be introduced after an . area-wide referendum. If . approved, 80 per cent of city residents would be eligible for a . reduction which would be ""means-tested"", based on residents' income and . ability to pay. Advocates claim a majority of households would end up paying less than they currently do. According . to a Green member, 'the higher the increase, the less the majority will . pay'. Exact details and costs of the scheme are now being looked at by . Green Party members. 'Refreshing': Green Party Council leader Jason Kitcat criticised the government's 'draconian' austerity cuts . But a briefing sheet produced for Labour Party members claimed increases of 200 per cent would be needed to pay for administration costs and ensure enough money was raised to limit the impact of Government cuts. If this figure was applied, it means those in band H - the highest council tax category - would see their annual rates increase from £3,014.56 to £9,043.68. Labour councillor Gill Mitchell said: 'This sounds like another crackpot scheme being dreamt up by the Greens where they decide who is worthy of a council tax reduction and they decide who should pay more. 'It sounds dangerous and we would be against it.' Conservative councillor Ann Norman, who said the system sounded like a 'backdoor mansion tax'. She said: 'I just cannot see how it would work. I think we need to keep at the lowest level of council tax we can. 'As a party we normally try and go for a freeze unless there is some near catastrophe.' A Green Party spokesman said the idea was one of 'many avenues' members in the Brighton and Hove were exploring to 'minimise the effects of Government cuts on the city's residents"". He added council officers would not spend any time helping to draw up the plans although they may be asked for information already in the public domain to help develop the idea. The spokesman said a decision on whether it is taken forward will be taken in the coming months.","Brighton council are exploring the idea of a 'progressive council tax'

Most of his gambling involved bets on horse racing, but he also spent thousands of pounds betting on Premier League matches. Claims: Head of the PFA Gordan Taylor has spent millions on gambling, it is alleged . Taylor, who has previously called for a 'zero tolerance' approach to footballers' gambling, is said to have lost £15,000 when England failed to beat Switzerland in 2011. The 68-year-old has been chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), based in Manchester, for more than 30 years and is reputed to be the highest paid union official in the world on a salary of more than £1million a year. Taylor's horse race betting is said to have seen him run up a debt of more than £100,000 with a firm called Best Bet, according to The Sun. Well-remunerated: As chief executive of the PFA, Gordon Taylor is said to be one of the highest paid union officials in the world with a salary of more than £1million a year . The telephone betting company, also based in the North West, is not in administration but has since ceased trading. Taylor has previously talked of a 'zero tolerance' approach to gambling in football, with the intention that footballers should not be allowed to place bets of any kind on matches. And the union boss has also argued that players must improve their behaviour on and off the field to set a better example to young fans. In a recent interview with the Daily Mail he said: 'Part of being a professional footballer is to understand that they are considered to be a role model. The football pitch is not an oasis from law and order. With the high profile position the players are in comes an added social responsibility.' Despite repeated calls from The Sun yesterday, Taylor has refused to comment on the claims. MailOnline was also unable to reach him for comment this morning. A union worker said Taylor was expected in the office as normal but did not know if he would comment on the allegations.","The head of the PFA allegedly spent £4million on 2,000 bets in 30 months .

Motorist Steven James Conlan hit cyclist Grahame McGregor on a crossroads earlier this year while paying too much attention to his sat- nav . A motorist who killed a cyclist because he was relying too much on a satnav has been spared jail. Steven Conlan’s car hit Grahame McGregor after he missed a stop sign and illegally drove through a junction. The satnav system had failed to register the junction and had not instructed the motorist to stop, a court heard. District Judge Roger Elsey told Conlan he should have paid more attention to the road rather than the in-car guidance system, adding: ‘I don’t believe the accident would have occurred if the satnav had been switched off.’ Conlan, 51, of Gateshead, had been relying on the in-car technology to guide him, his wife and their two children during a family day out to High Force, in upper Teesdale, when the sat nav failed to register the A692/A68 junction near Consett, County Durham, at 12.35pm. Having missed a stop sign westbound on the A692, Conlan drove his Saab 93 straight out into the road, sending Mr McGregor, cycling north on the A68, hurtling across the road onto a footpath. The 55-year-old cyclist, of Pelton, near Chester-le-Street, died in hospital five days later. In a statement read out in court, Mr McGregor’s parents said they had been forced to bury their only son in the prime of his life. His sister, Linda Williams, said the devastating loss had blown her family apart and called for action to make the junction safer. Judge Elsey said the stop line was not very visible and drivers on the A692 could get the impression they had precedence. The scene of the accident, the A692/A68 junction near Consett, County Durham . However, prosecutor Lynne Roberts-Plowman told Peterlee Magistrates’ Court that there were several junction signs while Judge Elsey said had Conlan paid sufficient attention to the road he would have seen the stop sign. Conlan, described by his lawyer Kate Meek as a trustworthy, loving, decent man, a devoted husband and father and a great friend, admitted causing death by careless driving. He was at a loss to say how he missed the stop sign and was struggling to cope with the dreadful legacy of the accident, she added. The judge said the accident would not have occurred if Mr Conlan's sat-nav had been switched off. File picture . Judge Elsey told Conlan: 'Mr McGregor was a healthy young man in the prime of his life and his death is a devastating blow, a devastating loss to the family and friends that love him. 'No sentence I impose is ever going to make up for the grief they have suffered.' He accepted Conlan was of good character, had behaved responsibly after the accident and had shown genuine remorse and sentenced him to a 12-month community penalty. Conlan will have to complete 240 hours of unpaid work, pay a £60 surcharge and £85 court costs and will be banned from driving for two years.","Steven Conlan, 51, ploughed into cyclist Grahame McGregor on a junction .

The pair are undergoing genetic tests . to determine whether the children were killed by a hereditary condition . - and fear that other young relatives could be at risk.

Blackburn Hospital three weeks after her birth when her parents noticed . she was struggling for breath. Doctors . diagnosed her with bronchitis, but on New Year's Eve they allowed her . to go home as her condition had improved over the two days she was in . hospital. However, in the early hours of the . morning, Miss Gray and Mr Monaghan found that she had stopped breathing . and she was rushed to hospital, although she could not be saved.

Tragic case: Jordan Monaghan and Laura Gray outside Blackburn Coroners' Court where they attended the inquest into the death their 23-day-old daughter Ruby . An initial post-mortem was inconclusive, but an inquest later ruled that she had died from bronchopneumonia. On August 17, tragedy struck the family once again when Miss Gray, 20, went to wake Logan up from his afternoon nap and found him lying dead. 'He went for his nap and just didn't wake up,' she said. 'He woke up in the morning absolutely fine, and he was playing around. There was nothing wrong with him whatsoever. 'He went for his afternoon sleep as normal. I went in to wake him up and found him like that. I knew when I looked at him, I knew he'd passed away.

'They're checking our genes, we don't know whether it could be genetic,' Miss Jordan said. 'But we've already said we won't have any more children. We can't take that risk.' Her fiancé Mr Monaghan, a construction worker, added: 'They've taken biopsies but the results will take up to three months to come back. 'It's a waiting game, which is really hard - we just want answers now.' Miss Jordan said she was worried about the health of her four-year-old nephew Connor, who could be affected if it turns out that the children's health problems were hereditary.

Death: Ruby was born in December last year, but had to return to the Royal Blackburn Hospital three weeks after her birth when her parents noticed she was struggling for breath . She paid tribute to her family for supporting them through the ordeal of losing two children in eight months. 'We'd like to say a big thank you to all the family for all the support and help,' she said. 'We're a close family. We've got great family support, they're helping us to get through it. 'We're all absolutely distraught, absolutely devastated. We're all shocked, we can't believe it. He was beautiful, a little monkey, so mischievous.

He was such a daddy's boy and his face lit up every time he saw any of us.' During the inquest into Ruby's death, the coroner said: 'I can't begin to imagine the loss of a child and certainly one as young and as precious as Ruby.

A police worker groped two women colleagues at his office Christmas party but claimed it was all part of the festive fun, a court heard today. Darren Hislop, 42, of Newport, South Wales, cupped the breasts of one shocked office worker and grabbed the bottom of the other. Hislop had also trapped another woman colleague in an office saying: 'What are we going to do then ... just the two of us?' Civilian support worker Hislop claimed his groping was just an innocent part of office life. But Cardiff Crown Court heard all three women were left 'unsure' in the company of men. Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: “Hislop and other civilian workers were out at a Christmas celebration party when he touched the women. “One of his female colleagues was waiting to be served at the bar when he went behind her and grabbed her bottom. 'Later he approached another female colleague, put his arms around her from behind and cupped both her breasts in his hands. 'When he was interviewed by police officers, he accepted it had happened but claimed it was all in keeping with the spirit of a Christmas party.' The court heard the office incident happened five months earlier at a police station in Cwmbran, near Newport, South Wales. Mr Griffiths said: 'She wanted some boxes moved from her room and asked him to help. Hislop, of Newport, was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 160 hours unpaid work at Cardiff Crown Court . 'But as they were walking in, he said: “What are we going to do then ... just the two of us?” 'She said he looked quite serious and aggressive, she didn’t know what he was going to do but thought he was going to try it on by kissing or groping her or even more.' The court heard a male colleague walked in and saw Hislop pressing the 'frightened-looking' woman against a filing cabinet. Mr Griffiths added: 'The victims say they have become wary and unsure with male colleagues since.' Hislop denied three charges of sexual assault but admitted three charges of common assault. He was sacked yesterday from his £28,000-a-year job with Gwent Police. Judge Phillip Richards told Hislop: 'Your behaviour was unacceptable and you are likely to suffer serious consequences as a result. 'You now have a criminal record and it will affect your future. 'I have no doubt at all the three ladies were stressed and upset.' Hislop, of Newport, was given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 160 hours unpaid work.

The plane in which seven Britons died en route to Mount Everest may have crashed because it hit a bird just after take-off, when it was already struggling due to being overloaded, a report into the crash has concluded. The twin-engine propeller plane crashed shortly after take-off near Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, last September. Among the seven British victims were Raymond Eagle, 58, from Macclesfield, Timothy Oakes, 57, from Warrington, and brothers Vincent and Darren Kelly, aged 50 and 45, from Lostock, near Bolton. Overloaded?: The picture of rucksacks and personal belongings found at the wreckage site in Nepal . Victims: Stephen Holding, pictured left with his wife Maggie, and Benjamin Ogden, pictured with his girlfriend Stephanie, were both killed in the plane crash that killed 19 people . Fireball: Firefighters battle to douse the burning wreckage of a plane which crashed on the edge of the Nepalese capital, killing 19 people including seven Britons . The plane lost power and slowed down at a crucial point during take-off but investigators were unable to find why this happened. It meant the plane was not high enough to recover when it went off course. The report also records that while . preparing for take-off, the pilot twice noticed a bird and as the plane . accelerated, he said 'watch out for the bird'. The first officer reported being clear of it as he accelerated but the crew later reported a bird strike. However, no evidence of it was found in the engine. Investigators said: 'It is possible . that the bird momentarily disturbed the air flow into the engine before . it was struck by the propeller, causing a surge and the suspected flame . seen in the CCTV footage, but the engine manufacturer considered this . unlikely. 'If the flame seen in the CCTV and . accompanying ""bang"" heard on the CVR were evidence of an engine surge, . then another possible cause is a fuel flow problem.' As the plane turned, it lost power and began to descend, before suddenly hitting the ground just 420 metres from the runway. The report says one engine failed and the other suffered a power loss. Tragic deaths: Britons Raymond Eagle, left, and Timothy Oakes, right, were both killed in the crash . Destroyed: The fire quickly spread to the rear of the plane, but the tail was still in one piece at the scene near the Manohara River on the south-west edge of Kathmandu . The engine was also operating at low power. It said: 'There was no evidence to . suggest that the flight crew recognised that a power loss had occurred . on the ground, possibly because it occurred gradually and progressively . rather than instantaneously. This would account for why the takeoff was . continued.' They concluded there was no evidence . of a bird in the engine, both engines were low on power and when speed . fell, there was no power to accelerate. It added: 'The investigation was unable to determine the cause of the thrust reduction.' Five Chinese also died, as well as three passengers and four crew members from Nepal. The tragedy had been blamed simply on . the plane striking a bird of prey at a height of . 50ft as it took off from Tribhuvan Airport in the Nepalese capital . heading for Lukla near Everest. But . experts doubted whether that alone would have prevented . the pilot from bringing the Sita Air Dornier D-228 back around for an . emergency landing at the airport. Indian government aviation minister . Suresh Acharya said that the combined weight of passengers and luggage . carried by the plane would play a key part in the inquiry, which British . investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch assisted with. Killed: Vincent Kelly, left, from Lostock, Bolton, and his brother Darren Kelly, right, from Isle of Whithorn . Major operation: Hundreds of rescuers and members of the public swarm around the site as investigators begin to piece together the events that led up to the tragedy . Mr Acharya . said: ‘The bird strike may not be the sole reason behind the crash.’ And Kuma Sherchan, an experienced . pilot with the Nepal  Airlines Corporation said: ‘A bird hitting the . plane should not be considered in isolation during the investigation. Traveller: Christopher Davey, 51, from Moulton in Northamptonshire, died in the crash . ‘Several factors, such as technical maintenance, load, pressure on airline operators and many more, lead to an air crash.’ All . those on board – including 12 people from Nepal and China – died in the . inferno when the twin-prop aircraft ploughed into a riverbank minutes . after take off. The Britons, who were due to begin trekking in the Himalayas, were travelling with Hampshire-based company Explore Worldwide. They . were named as Raymond Eagle, 58, from Macclesfield, Cheshire; Timothy . Oakes, 57, from Winwick, near Warrington, and his friend Stephen .

This is the moment two cruel thieves were caught on CCTV stealing a four-year-old girl's pet rabbit from outside her home. Max, a three-year-old male English white rabbit, was still in his hutch when he was taken from the secluded property in Thorne, South Yorkshire, in the early hours of the morning. The treasured pet belonged to Elsa Fowles and her siblings who have been left very upset. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cruel: A security camera caught the moment two thieves stole Max the rabbit from the Fowles' family home . Wanted: The family have posted the footage online in a bid to try and have the culprits tracked down . Her mother Sandra, 41, said Elsa and her brothers and sisters including Jodie, 16, Callum, . 14, Cameron, six, and two-year-old Heidi had been looking after Max since he was seven-weeks-old. The theft was captured on security cameras which her husband Ashley, an electrician, had set up on a wall of their property. It shows a car driving past at around 1am, before two young men appear wearing dark jackets and trainers. After removing cycling bins from on top of Max's hutch, they then pick up the rabbit's home and carry it away. The family have passed the footage to South Yorkshire Police and have also shared the footage online in a bid to catch the culprits. Mrs Fowles, an accountant, said she believes the deliberate targeting of Max implies it was a targeted theft to order. She said: 'We’ve had Max since he was seven weeks old and he’s part of the family. 'It’s a big double hutch and needs two men to carry it, so this was no chance theft – it must have been planned.' Max had been kept outside the front . door because the couple keep their pet dogs, Rottweiler Lemmy and Great . Dane Lexy, in the back garden. Heartbroken: Sandra Fowles and her five children, including four-year-old Elsa, have been left very upset by the theft of Max . Treasured: The Fowles' children had owned Max since he was seven weeks old and he was described as 'part of the family' Mrs Fowles said: 'When I went out at 8am to put rubbish in the recycling bins I was hysterical after realising Max had been stolen. 'The thieves has stacked the recycling bins neatly and had left our guinea pigs and their hutch, so they were plainly targeting Max.' To ensure the guinea pigs did not get stolen should the thieves return Mrs Fowles put them in the playhouse in the back garden, but unfortunately the dogs attacked and killed them, which has further upset the children. Mrs Fowles said: 'Because of these horrible men my children have lost all the furry pets now. 'Someone must know where Max is. Some child went to bed on Thursday night and woke in the morning to find they had a rabbit and hutch. 'We just want Max returned safe and sound.' The theft happened at around 1am on Friday, August 16.","Three year-old white rabbit taken from home in Thorne, South Yorkshire .

Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has written a get-well card to a three-year-old girl with leukaemia. Bronson - dubbed Britain's most violent prisoner - has also donated a drawing to Francesca Allen after being told about her plight by a fan who wrote to him in jail. Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap, sketched a card from his cell in HMP Wakefield with her name being held up by song birds. Charles Bronson drew this get-well card from prison for Francesca Allen, who is battling leukaemia . Bronson, dubbed Britain's most violent prisoner, wrote to Francesca after being told of her illness by a pen pal . Under the picture Bronson wrote: 'Get Well Fast - We all Love Ya!' He also donated a pencil drawing depicting a prisoner in Broadmoor wearing a one-man-band-style contraption labelled 'Broadmoor Lunatic Asylum.' The 60-year-old career criminal has donated the picture which will be auctioned off to raise cash for Frankie’s Fund. His pictures regularly fetch up to £1,000 at auction. Bronson wrote to Francesca, who is known as Frankie to her family, after he was told about her condition by pen pal Darren Holdcroft, who has written to Bronson for eight months. Frankie's mother Karen Allen said: 'At first I was quite taken back by it. The picture he has drawn is really nice and it is very nice of him to be donating one for us to auction off too. 'He isn't the sort of man you would associate this kind of thing with, so I was shocked really, we all were.

A former soldier has been banned from the roads after he purposely rammed his Mercedes into the back of a family car because he was frustrated by the 'namby pamby' driver. Stephen McDougall, 44, of Penmaenmawr, North Wales,  said he crashed into the back of the holidaymakers' car because the driver was being too cautious as he approached a roundabout. Parents Richard and Deborah Woodhead and their two children, aged 11 and six, suffered whiplash in the crash. Crash: Llandudno Magistrates' Court heard how McDougall smashed into the back of a family car . McDougall, a Gulf War veteran, sped off after the rear-end smash but Mrs Woodhead noted down his registration plate and phoned the police. He was tracked down and told officers: 'The other car was being all namby pamby and braking far too early for the roundabout so I rammed into him.' The Woodhead family were driving on the A55 in Llanfairfechan, North Wales, when they were hit by impatient McDougall. Prosecutor Tracey Willingham said: 'Mr Woodhead approached a roundabout and started to brake in order to get around it. 'McDougall collided with Mr Woodhead’s car and shunted it forward. 'The Woodhead children suffered whiplash to their necks and backs and Mrs Woodhead had a hand injury from hitting the dashboard. But the defendant drove on.' Mrs Woodhead noted McDougall’s number plate, rang 999 and officers traced him to a nearby nature reserve. Llandudno magistrates heard McDougall had 58 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the limit is 35mg. McDougall admitted drink driving, driving without due care and attention, and failing to stop at an accident. McDougall was fined £110 for drink driving and given a 16-month driving ban. He was also fined £75 for failing to stop at an accident and £40 for careless driving.","Stephen McDougall, 44, purposely crashed into parents and two children aged 11 and six on A55 in North Wales .

A man who reached out to cuddle his girlfriend in bed was shocked to wake up and find he was holding a fox in his arms. Leon Smith, who works from his suburban home, was enjoying a lie-in after his partner got up and went to work without him knowing . He felt a furry creature climb into the bed and nuzzle into his neck - and assumed it was the couple's cat Bramble. But when he turned around to give his girlfriend a hug he realised the animal had coarse hair - and he opened his eyes to see he was holding a fox. Couple: Leon Smith and Sophie Merrell were terrified when an urban fox entered their home . Intruder: IT consultant Mr Smith managed to snap a photo of the animal before it ran away . The fox had apparently entered the house in Hampton Hill, South-West London through the catflap ahead of the incident on August 7. Mr Smith, 30, quickly whipped out his phone to capture photographic evidence of the intruder - but then man and fox entered a 10-minute stand-off. The vermin only ran off after the IT consultant charged at it shouting. 'I just thought it was the cat, so I thought nothing of it,' Mr Smith said. 'It had walked up my back and was licking my neck for a good couple of seconds. 'I pushed him off and rolled over for a cuddle, forgetting Sophie was already at work. Fear: Ms Merrell is worried the vermin will return to the couple's home in Hampton Hill, South-West London . Mistaken identity: Mr Smith initially assumed the animal nuzzling him was the couple's pet cat Bramble . 'When I touched what I thought was the cat, it was all rough and not like Bramble at all. 'I couldn't believe it. It was so calm - it just stared at me. Then it went to the end of the bed and that's when I grabbed my phone to take the picture. 'It went to the door and just sat in the doorway, still staring. It trapped me.' The animal was apparently not looking for food, as it walked past the kitchen on its way up two flights of stairs to the second-floor flat. His partner Sophie Merrell, who was commuting to her job at a transport company at the time of the incident, initially laughed when she saw the photo of the fox - but now she is worried it will return. Bedroom: The IT consultant reached out to hug his partner, not realising she had left for work, and found himself holding the fox instead . Gaining entry: The fox apparently got in to the house through the catflap and then ran up the stairs . 'When I saw the fox I thought it was hilarious at first,' the 28-year-old said. 'I thought, ""Well serves you right for laying in bed."" 'But then I put the picture on Facebook and a lot of my friends said they would have been terrified. 'If it had got into bed with me, I don't know what I would have done - maybe hide under the covers and scream and cry. 'I'm really scared now that it will come back, I'm really jumpy. I am really paranoid when I am alone in the house that it will come and get me. An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Foxes by nature will tend to avoid human contact and incidents such as these are rare. 'We would encourage people to use humane deterrents to discourage foxes from their gardens, the most effective of which is removing or preventing access to what attracts them - for example food.'","Leon Smith was enjoying lie-in when he felt himself nuzzled by furry animal .

An internet advert that compared a scantily clad woman to a spicy Pot Noodle has been banned by watchdogs for being 'crass and degrading'. The 'Hot Off' advert for Piri Piri Pot Noodle featured on the snack's Facebook page and showed a woman posing in red knickers and a revealing red bra. The image was posted alongside a picture of the snack and a caption asking visitors 'Which one gets you hotter?' Scroll down for video . A Pot Noodle advert comparing a semi-naked woman to the snack has been banned for being 'crass and degrading'. Two other ads, including this one of a woman stripping, were cleared by the watchdog . Three adverts for spicy Pot Noodles - including a video of a woman taking her top off (pictured) - were investigated after 18 people complained to the ASA . It formed part of an internet campaign by the brand featuring three sexually provocative adverts with the strapline 'Peel the top off a hottie'. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched its investigation after receiving 18 complaints that claimed the ads were offensive, sexist and degrading to women. Some complained that it was irresponsible and harmful because it suggested it was acceptable to try and remove women's clothing without their consent. The ASA ruled that the Hot Off ad had breached its regulatory code. It said its 'presentation of the woman in a sexual pose and the blatant comparison with the food product was crass and degrading and therefore likely to cause serious offence.' The ASA ruled the ad comparing women to food with strap line 'Peel the top off a Hottie' was offensive . The watchdog acknowledged the ad was 'tongue in cheek', but ordered that it be removed and told Unilever, the owner of the Pot Noodle brand, to avoid using offensive imagery in future campaigns. Two other adverts that attracted criticism from members of the public were cleared, although the watchdog said viewers may find them 'distasteful'. One showed a man struggling to eat a spicy Piri Piri chicken flavour Pot Noodle before fantasizing about dancing with a female passenger who eventually takes her top off followed by the strapline 'peel a top off a hottie'. After he finished the Pot Noodle he realises he has been dancing with a man. The ASA disputed viewers' complaints that the advert was too sexually provocative or degrading, as the woman danced with the man while the woman removed her top voluntarily. The ASA cleared two of the adverts, including one in which showed a man fantasizes about a woman stripping but when he finishes his Pot Noodle realises he had been dancing with a man (pictured) A second advert on the Facebook page, which showed cartoon versions of the pair alongside two Pot Noodle lids arranged to resemble a woman's bust was judged as having a humorous tone and allowed to stay. The watchdog said: 'We considered that although some visitors . to the Pot Noodle Facebook page may have found the ""Peel the top of a . hottie"" to be distasteful, we considered that none of the ads condoned . the removal of a woman's clothing without her consent or suggested that . such an act was likely to be acceptable.' According to the ASA, Unilever said the campaign was 'cheeky and humorous' in tone and that 'despite an element of light-hearted innuendo, the ads did not in any way condone or advocate that it was acceptable to remove another person's clothing without their consent.'","Advertising Standards Agency said advert 'crass and degrading' to women .

The impressive collection is so big he has six sheds in the garden of his home in Malvern, Worcestershire, to store them all in, which he has dubbed the ‘milk museum’. The bizarre collection, which is worth around £100,000, includes more than 17,000 British bottles and 2,500 from overseas which he has scavenged from farms, hills and everywhere imaginable. Got milk? Steve Wheeler, inside his hand-built milk bottle museum. Remarkably the collector has not drank a glass of milk since he was a boy - as he hates the taste of it .

'I remember getting my 150th milk bottle and being chuffed but the collection has grown incredibly since. 'I like the social history, the people I meet, I like the designs, the advertising they put on the bottles.

However, the collector has not drank a glass of milk since he was a boy - as he hates the taste of it. Mr Wheeler explained: 'I don’t like it. It is baby food. When I at school the milk came from 20 yards down the road. 'In the winter it would freeze. As a milk monitor at school I had to bring it in.

'I am trying to get the national heritage to open a national milk bottle museum. The collection is worth millions to me as it is my pride and joy. 'I will donate the entire collection for free if there is a national milk bottle museum and I will help them run the thing until I die.' He welcomes enthusiasts to the museum regularly and last year had 50 visitors through the doors including milkmen and dairy workers. He added: 'It is great fun collecting them but I try to keep it as serious as I can because it makes it easier to get more bottles. I always say to people don’t throw your old bottles away, give them to me instead. 'The secret is if you want to collect something then make sure it is fun and make sure it doesn’t cost anything.'

'Most important for me is to get the . education and I have the bonus of being a student athlete... if I get my . education sorted then everything goes right,' he said. The . interview was carried out when he was at Redlands Community College, . and he said that after two years there, he hoped to get into a four-year . U.S. college - and maybe reach the major league. 'It would certainly be a dream,' he said. 'But you . know, you can only work hard and I've got hopefully four years, fingers . crossed over here, so there's plenty of opportunity to put my hand up . and see how far I can go.' In . yet a further heartbreaking twist, he assured the host that the . Americans loved having Australians in the country. The host concluded: .

The Ffestiniog narrow-gauge line is one of the most picturesque steam railways in the country. More than 1,000 people a day take the hour-long journey through the stunning Snowdonia mountains and forests between the coastal resort of Porthmadog and the slate quarrying town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in North Wales. Six miles away, on the Conwy Valley line, is one of the quietest railway stations in Wales – just 25 people a week get on or off at Roman Bridge, and to board you need to flag down the driver of one of the 12 two-car diesels a day. Back on track: Roger Latham is selling The Station House at Roman Bridge Blaenau Dolwyddelan in North Wales, for £450,000 after buying it for under £60,000 16 years ago . Now the stationmaster’s house at Roman Bridge is up for sale for £450,000. The ticket office has long gone and there is no waiting room, buffet or toilets. What remains is a single track, the platform and the house. Built in 1879, it has three bedrooms, three reception rooms and stunning views across the mountains and valleys. Outside there are ten acres of meadows and a lake stocked with salmon and trout. The owner, Roger Latham, bought it in 1997 but has known the area for 60 years. ‘I was raised in Macclesfield but started coming here on fishing holidays with my father in the 1950s,’ says Roger, 66, a retired college lecturer. He moved to the region 40 years ago. ‘I had known Flo Williams, the daughter of the last stationmaster, who bought the house from British Rail. ‘As she grew older she became more anxious about things and in 1997 decided to move. She found a buyer for the house, but at the last minute they changed their minds, which caused Flo terrible anxiety, so I bought it for the asking price.’ He paid £59,000, but Roger has since spent tens of thousands renovating it and adding a garden room with splendid views of the 17th Century clapper bridge. This was built to replace the original Roman bridge, from which the station takes its name. Lonely trainspotting: The three-bedroom home is located at the remote station used by just 25 people per week . ‘The Romans came here to mine copper and lead and had a garrison nearby,’ says Roger, who replaced the roof of the house and installed underfloor heating and a solar-powered hot-water system. ‘The work was done by a local craftsman and inside it has a very cosy feel,’ he says. When the renovations were finished, Roger was ready to move in, but a friend asked if her father could rent it temporarily. He ended up staying for more than a decade, and since then Roger has been letting it to tourists. ‘It’s occupied for about 85 per cent  of the year. The area is very popular with walkers, artists and anglers,’ says Roger. ‘The house comes with more than a mile of double-bank fishing on the River Lledr. ‘It is wonderful in late summer and early autumn when the migrant birds are still here and the Atlantic salmon return from west Greenland to the streams to spawn. First-class upgrade: Although Roger bought the house for £59,00, he has spent several thousand over the years improving the old stationmaster's home . ‘The weather is mild and there is  an abundance of food for the wildlife – I’ve seen three otters in the meadow and there are bats, lizards, toads, polecats and weasels.’ The nearby 13th Century Dolwyddelan Castle, which was one of the last to be taken during Edward I’s conquest of Wales, is also a big draw. In high season Roger charges £680 a week, but has now decided to sell up. ‘I’m getting a bit long in the tooth, so it’s time to find a new owner,’ he says. Martyn Haden, of Strutt & Parker’s Chester office, which is selling the property, said: ‘It’s the dream property for anyone who had a model railway while growing up.’ In spite of the tranquil location and the slow pace of the trains that trundle past, you can get to London by rail in less than four hours. ‘It’s 50 minutes from here to Llandudno Junction and then just three hours to Euston,’ says Roger. lStrutt & Parker, Chester,  01244 354880 .","Stationmaster's house at Roman Bridge, North Wales up for sale .

Squatters who have taken over grade-II listed mansion in one of London's most expensive neighbourhoods today claimed they are of benefit to the building's owner. The 300-year-old property built in 1699 on Mare Street in Hackney has been sitting empty for several years but has recently been taken over by a developer. But around 10 squatters have taken up residence in the Georgian villa and are now suggesting that they can come to an 'arrangement' with the owner that would be of 'mutual benefit'. New 'residents': Approximately 10 squatters have moved in to 195 Mare Street, a Grade II listed Georgian villa built in 1699, shortly after a new developer bought the property . They placed a note in one of the building's windows stating: 'We are very willing to negotiate an arrangement for our mutual benefit. 'There are numerous benefits for having squatters in a disused building, we can provide/assist in upkeep, ensure security of the building and provide monetary benefits.' While some neighbours appear to have welcomed the squatters, others were frustrated that people are living rent-free while other residents pay thousands of pounds in rent every month. Michelle Watkins, 36, who runs a pop-up shop, told the Evening Standard: 'We all work really hard. It’s not right - this is a prime location. The rent for my three-bed flat which I share is £2,400 a month.' Fed up: Hackney resident William Cheshire wants the building, which has sat empty since 2003, to be put to good use with a 'permanent solution' Another resident, film maker Dave Aspinall, 34, revealed he pays £1,900 a month for a one bedroom flat. While jewellery designer William Cheshire, who has lived in Hackney for 14 years, is fed up with the building being empty but wants a 'permanent solution to do it justice'. This is not the first time the building, which has been closed down since 2003, has been taken over by squatters. For its first 150 years, the house was one of many grand family homes on Mare Street. In 1860 it became the Elizabeth Fry Institute for Reformation of Women Prisoners. The Institute closed in 1913 and was then replaced by a working men’s club, the Lansdowne Liberal and Radical Club which later became the New Lansdowne Social Club and closed down in 2003. Since then several developers have taken over the property, with one gaining permission to convert it into a restaurant and luxury flats. But each venture failed and by 2009 the building was still sitting empty and squatters moved in. The squatters organised community events and workshops until they were evicted a year later. While residential squatting is now a criminal offence, the currently law doesn't apply to commercial buildings. The new squatters say they also want to see the building used to the benefit of the community. Derelict: The squatters say they want the building to be used to the benefit of the local community instead of just sitting empty while developers 'wait for it to fall down' One of the new 'residents' Max, 23, originally from south-west London, told the Standard: 'The land is probably worth more than the building... there is insurmountable damage and the costs to repair it would be a lot greater so the developer is waiting for it to fall down. We have not seen him, he has not been round. 'If they wanted to fix it up and open it to the community then we would have no problem with that - it’s the wasting we have a big issue with.' He added that they also hoped to campaign against proposed changes to the law which would make squatting in any type of property illegal.","300-year-old mansion on Mare Street, Hackney, has been empty since 2003 .

The remote forest home has a roof made entirely from water-based plants, which also coat several walls. A thatched roof is normally made out of straw, rushes or heather, but when inland vegetation was nowhere to be found, the Danish team behind the eco-home turned to a nearby lake.

A 69-year-old St Louis woman has been arrested for the stabbing murder of her husband after police were called to a Country Life Acres home early Thursday morning and found the body of a 76-year-old man. Mary Ann Mullenix was taken into custody by police for allegedly killing her millionaire former property-developer husband of 42 years, Ivan L. Mullenix, Sr. She has been charged with . second-degree murder, armed criminal action and tampering with evidence . and is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail. Violent end: Mary Ann Mullenix (left) allegedly stabbed her husband Ivan L. Mullenix, Sr (right, in an undated photo) to death in their mansion in an exclusive gated community . Ivan L. Mullenix and his wife had lived in the large house complete with pool and tennis court and surrounded by leafy gardens in the small village of Country Life Acres, near the suburban Town and Country area, for 35 years. Ivan L. Mullenix, Sr was a successful . real estate developer for many years, having only recently passed on his . business to his three sons from his first marriage. Mullenix . Companies, established by Ivan 'Ike' Mullenix, Sr in 1964, managed . several hundred million dollars worth of real estate. The . three eldest Mullenix sons bought out their father’s business in 2006 . and changed it to Equis Hospitality Management. But the handover wasn't . smooth and the sons sued their father a few years later, alleging he had . violated the terms of the buyout. The suit was dismissed last year and lawyer for the three Mullenix sons, Joseph Trad, said it was amicably settled. Mary Mullenix was Ivan Mullenix's second wife. They married in 1971 and had four children. It's not clear who dialed 911, but police have said it was not Mary Mullenix but a different family member. Upscale: The large home in an exclusive gated community where the Mullenixes lived for 35 years is now a crime scene . According to Fox2 Now, when . police arrived at the property in the the exclusive neighborhood, they . found Ivan Mullenix's body inside and Mary Mullenix outside. Neighbor Tim Clark said the village has only 28 homes but that he wasn't close with his neighbors the Mullenixes. He had, however, encountered Mary Mullenix on a number of occasions and described her as 'frazzled' and 'a bit odd'. Reporters asked Clark how he felt about the murder in his neighborhood. 'Honestly? I told my wife it didn't surprise me, just from things I've heard. I've . heard that there's been calls out here for fires and I've heard that it . was maybe someone smoking in bed... I don't think anyone's worried... I . imagine that if she killed him she won't be back,' he said. Country idyll: The tiny Country Life Acres community of 74 people has never had such a crime occur before . A police spokesman said this wasn't the first time officers had been called to the upscale home. 'They . have a history... they have a rather stormy relationship, this is what . is beginning to develop. There's a lot more investigation ongoing,' he . said. Ivan Mullenix's sons said in a statement on Thursday afternoon: 'At this point, we have no comment on the personal tragedy resulting in the death of our father, Ivan L.

The mother-of-two - who earned £30,000-a-year as a legal lecturer - lived 150 miles away with her husband in Nottingham in one of her two homes. Locked up: Barrister Nadine Wilson Ellis obtained a council flat and sub-let it while owning two homes. She has been jailed for seven months . Wilson-Ellis - who recently qualified as a barrister - made £10,000 from . the scam which she used to pay the mortgages on her other homes which were worth £55,000 and £73,000. She was only caught out when she asked Bristol City Council for a bigger flat. Investigators . found she had falsified bank statements and a maternity certificate in . an attempt to prove she was living in Bristol while she lived and worked . 150 miles away. She was teaching law full-time at a higher education college in Nottingham with a £30,000 salary. Judge . Michael Longman jailed her for seven months at Bristol Crown Court today after she previously pleading guilty to two offences under the . Fraud Act. He said: 'The effect was to provide you with . accommodation that you did not need and that was in the place of someone . who was more deserving. Scam: The mother-of-two was given this council flat in Bristol which she then illegally sub-let for £100-a-week while she lived with her family in one of two homes in Nottingham . 'As to the harm [you caused] that too was . high because your behaviour resulted in a more deserving candidate being . denied the accommodation that was offered to you. 'You brazenly lied in the face of the most damning evidence which fortunately the jury saw through.' Prosecutors . on behalf of the council said the scam cost the taxpayer almost £75,000 . - around £35,000 in investigation and court costs. The council say because she had the flat they had to pay for a genuine claimant to live elsewhere at a cost of £39,000. Had she pleaded guilty at the first hearing, court costs would have been just £3,700. The . court heard she applied for a council house in September 2008, but used . forged bank statements showing an address in Bristol, and a form which . had false information about her job. Wilson-Ellis then applied for a . bigger council house in Bristol in September 2011, again giving false . information about her address and income. Jailed: Wilson-Ellis - who recently qualified as a barrister - made £10,000 from the scam which she used to pay the mortgages on her other homes. Wilson-Ellis owns this property in Nottingham . She has since lost her job as a result of the court proceedings, and is now on benefits and going through a divorce. Wilson-Ellis . was sentenced to seven months in prison and wailed loudly as she was . led down to the cells, while members of her family blew kisses to her. Prosecuting, . Alan Fuller had asked the judge to order Wilson-Ellis to pay back some . or all of the council’s costs, but the judge declined to impose that . punishment. Bristol’s Assistant Mayor Gus Hoyt, responsible for . neighbourhoods and council housing, accused her of a 'shocking abuse of . the system'. He said: 'It is hard to think that our investigation . officers will come across a worse example of fraud. Tenancy fraud is . theft, pure and simple. Homeowner: This shows another of Wilson Ellis's properties in Nottingham . 'It robs those who are in genuine need of social housing of a precious and scarce resource. 'There . are currently more than 14,000 people on the waiting list in Bristol. The need for social housing has never been greater. This was . scandalous.' If Wilson-Ellis had not been caught she would . eventually have qualified for the right to buy a larger council house in . Bristol, depriving a family in genuine need of much sought-after social . housing. Speaking during her trial, Wilson-Ellis told Bristol Crown . Court she had not rented out her council flat and insisted the tenant . was a friend. She claimed: 'The lady who stayed with me was not living there. 'She . was paying me back. I had leant her some money previously, to help her . out so she could help her mum out back in Jamaica for her mum’s . surgery.' Defending Wilson-Ellis, Shahida Begum said her client did not financially benefit from the scheme. Miss Begum said: 'When she came to Bristol she did just want a haven away from her ex-partner. 'She has lost her job. She has had to put in a claim for income support because she has no other means.

Mrs Berg's lawyer,Jenny Brandt, released the undated photographs which show her client in hospital recovering from injuries after police found her bloodied and bound in her San Jose home. The Swedish born woman filed charges against her 74-year-old husband, Clyde Berg, after claiming he chained her to a bed for two days while she was pregnant and sexually assaulted her with a golf club. Ms Berg's lawyers released this photographs after a judge dismissed all charges against her husband who she has accused of assaulting her . Mrs Berg's lawyer released the photographs after a judge dismissed claims Clyde Berg had assaulted his wife. It is not known when the pictures were taken . A judge ruled in favour of her husband, Clyde Berg, who claimed earlier this week his wife had invented the story as away to get around the couple's strict prenuptial agreement. Mrs Berg took the stand on Thursday to testify about the night her husband had allegedly raped her with a golf putter after she rushed out of the courtroom the day before. She stunned the San Jose court Wednesday when she refused to answer several questions about the alleged incident that took place last fall while the woman was nine months pregnant with a baby from a sperm donor. Mrs Berg has accused her 74-year-old millionaire husband of outfitting her with a spiked dog collar and a leash, chaining her to a bed for two days and sexually assaulting her with a golf club. Armed . with notes and smelling salts to keep herself calm, the statuesque . blonde took the witness stand on Thursday to address several issues that . have been raised by Clyde Berg's defense, namely, how she was able to . dial 911 with her hands restrained behind her back, and why she did not . call for help sooner. Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in her San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband chained her to the bed . The . Swedish-born Ellena, who reportedly met the twice-divorced Clyde Berg a . decade ago while working as an au pair, said in court that after . enduring years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, . she has developed a habit for submissiveness, which could explain why . she offered no resistance when Mr Berg allegedly put a gun to her head . September 5, 2012. 'Mentally, physically, I wasn't there,' she said. 'It's a response system to fear and stress I learned very early,' the San Jose Mercury reported. It . was also her deep-seated submissiveness and fear of challenging . authority that kept her from trying to escape or summon help, according to Mrs Berg. After . initially refusing to answer questions about the 911 call, on Thursday . the woman finally offered an explanation, telling the court that she had . stashed a prepaid phone under the mattress sometime before the . September 2012 incident because her husband was known to take away her . possessions. After allegedly spending . two days chained to her bed and suffering abuse, Ellena Berg said she . finally summoned the courage to retrieve the hidden phone because she . feared her husband might kill her . ‘I decided I had to save my [unborn] daughter,’ Ellena Berg testified. Millionaire: Silicon Valley tycoon Clyde Berg, 74, accused of sexually abusing his third wife, attends a preliminary hearing at the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice in San Jose Tuesday . Berg . then went on to describe how she slid off the bed, got down into a . kneeling position on the floor and pushed her hands cuffed behind her . back under the mattress. Prompted . by prosecutor Alison Filo to explain how she managed to dial 911, . Ellena Berg haltingly said that she counted the keys on the phone, which . had raised buttons rather than a flat screen. The woman then dropped the device and pushed the 'send' button with her tongue, she recalled. Prior . to her testimony, Ellena Berg surprised those present in the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice by handing out copies of a letter she had written, in which she . complained about being treated in an unfair manner by everyone involved . in the case, even her own lawyer. Later . that day, Allen Ruby, Clyde Berg's attorney, got a chance to . cross-examine Mrs Berg, questioning her claim that her notoriously . tight-fisted husband, who once berated her for spending $15 at a car . wash, has agreed to a postnuptial contract, which called for the real . estate mogul to pay Ellena $2million in case of a divorce. Ruby . also cast doubt on Mrs Berg’s assertion that as part of the deal, . her husband has agreed to pay all the expenses incurred by her sperm . donor, a renowned California ballroom dancer. Details . of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during . 74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal . injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force. His . third wife was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home . last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly . husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while . sexually assaulting her with the golf club. She took the stand Wednesday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial. The real estate magnate - who is worth $200million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement. Family pet: Mrs Berg also has claimed that her estranged husband abused the couple's beloved Weimaraner named Rudy (pictured) During her Wednesday testimony, Ellena stunned the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended. The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened. Claims of innocence: The real estate magnate vehemently denies the abuse charges, contending that he's the victim of a scam . She then abruptly left the courtroom, leading the judge to suggest that Ellena might be 'disturbed' and 'paranoid.' The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband. The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse. She said he made her drink out of a dog's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness. There have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of September 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show Ellena Berg did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back. Clyde Berg is the brother and business partner of billionaire Carl Berg, one of the richest people in the United States. Ellena Berg has also obtained a restraining order against Clyde Berg and has custody of Rudy, the couple's beloved Weimaraner, whom she claimed was also abused by her estranged husband.","Ellena Berg, 37, is photographed with bloodied face in pictures released by attorney .

Legal action: Donald Trump was on the receiving end of a $40 million lawsuit from New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Saturday . Donald Trump has come out with all guns blazing today after New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman launched a $40 million lawsuit against him, claiming that the real estate mogul’s ‘Trump University’ had ‘falsely’ promised to make students rich. Speaking on Fox & Friends on Monday morning, Trump proceeded to trash talk Scheiderman before going as far as to suggest that the president was behind involved the legal action. The lawsuit was filed on Saturday, just days after Schneiderman had met with the President on Thursday evening, said Trump. ‘They meet on Thursday evening. I get sued by this A.G. Schneiderman, I get sued on Saturday at one o’clock. Think of it. What government agency in the history of this country has ever brought a suit on a Saturday? I never heard of such a thing,’ Trump said. Trump, who described the lawsuit as ‘incompetent’ and ‘terribly drawn,’ predicted that the lawsuit had the potential to be another scandal for the Obama administration. ‘They obviously did it very quickly, but probably Obama - maybe this is a mini IRS. Maybe we have to get the Tea Party after these people because this could very well be a mini IRS,’ Trump said. After receiving the lawsuit on Saturday, Trump quickly took to twitter where he accused Schneiderman of ‘trying to extort me’ and described him as a 'total sleazebag,' a 'lightweight' and 'dopey.' New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, right, met with President Obama on Thursday but says they didn't discuss Donald Trump . On Monday morning, Trump took to the airwaves to defend his reputation, claiming that the school had a 98 percent approval rating from students. On Good Morning America he called Sneiderman ‘a political hack.’ ‘I know him very well. He comes up to my office looking for campaign contributions. He tells me lots of unflattering things about Obama, he tells me lots of unflattering things about Governor Cuomo,’ said Trump. ‘He was very upset with the fact that we didn't help him. He thought we should have helped him much more. He is a political hack from beginning to end.’ Beleaguered: Donald Trump, pictured with his university emblem in May 2005, has been sued for $40 million after a lawsuit claims the classes were mostly useless and failed to live up to their promises . Schneiderman hit back during an appearance on CNN on Monday morning, reports Politico. He confirmed that had met with Obama on Thursday, but that they never discussed Trump. ‘The president and I had much more important stuff to talk about than Donald Trump. [The president] was giving a speech about education in Syracuse about affordability. I’ve never discussed Donald Trump with the president,’ Schneiderman said. Schneiderman also accused Trump of using the scandal to generate publicity for himself. ‘He is a showman. He doesn’t seem to think there is any such thing as a bad headline,’ Schneiderman said. He said many of the 5,000 students who paid up to $35,000 thought they would at least meet Trump but instead all they got was their picture taken in front of a life-size picture of him. 'Trump University engaged in deception at every stage of consumers' advancement through costly programs and caused real financial harm,' Schneiderman said. Schneiderman has accused Trump of using the scandal to generate publicity for himself. 'He doesn't seem to think there is any such thing as a bad headline,' he said . 'Trump University, with Donald Trump's knowledge and participation, relied on Trump's name recognition and celebrity status to take advantage of consumers who believed in the Trump brand.' State Education Department officials told Trump to change the name of his enterprise years ago, saying it . lacked a license and didn't meet the legal definitions of a university. In 2011 it was renamed the 'Trump Entrepreneur Institute', but it has since been . dogged by complaints from consumers and a few civil . lawsuits claiming it didn't fulfill its advertised claims. Schneiderman's . lawsuit covers complaints dating to 2005 through 2011 and it claims that students paid . between $1,495 and $35,000 to learn from the mogul. He said the . three-day seminars failed to teach consumers everything they . needed to know about real estate, as the 'university' had promised. The Trump University manual tells . instructors not to let consumers 'think three days will be enough to . make them successful', Schneiderman said. At the seminars, . consumers were told about 'Trump Elite' mentorships that cost $10,000 to . $35,000 in which students were promised individual instruction until they made . their first deal. Schneiderman said participants were urged to extend . the limit on their credit cards for real estate deals, but then used the . credit to pay for the Trump Elite programs. Angered: Trump accused the attorney general of being politically motivated with his lawsuit and said it was a way for Schneiderman to try to extort campaign contributions from him . The attorney general said . the program also failed to promptly cancel memberships as promised. The lawsuit added that many of students were unable to land even one real estate deal and were left far . worse off than before the lessons, facing thousands of dollars in debt. But . Trump's attorney accused Schneiderman of trying to extort campaign . contributions from the real estate mogul through his investigation. Attorney Michael D. Cohen told The Associated Press on Saturday that Schneiderman's lawsuit was filled with falsehoods. Cohen insisted that Trump and his university never defrauded anyone. 'The attorney general has been angry . because he felt that Mr. Trump and his various companies should have . done much more for him in terms of fundraising,' Cohen said. 'This . entire investigation is politically motivated and it is a tremendous . waste of taxpayers' money.' State Board of Elections records show Trump has spent more than $136,000 on New York campaigns since 2010. He contributed $12,500 to Schneiderman in October 2010, when Schneiderman was running for attorney general, records show. An outspoken conservative, Trump himself flirted with a presidential run last year. 'Donald Trump will not sit back and be extorted by anyone, including the attorney general,' Cohen said. Schneiderman is suing the program, Trump as the university chairman, and the former president of the university in a case to be handled in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. He accuses them of engaging in persistent fraud, illegal and deceptive conduct and violating federal consumer protection law. The $40 million he seeks is mostly to pay restitution to consumers. He dismissed Trump's claim of a political motive. 'The fact that he's still brave enough to follow the investigation wherever it may lead speaks to Mr. Schneiderman's character,' Schneiderman spokesman Andrew Friedman told AP.","Donald Trump received a lawsuit on Saturday from New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman .

Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or pick them up during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to crafting a cuppa. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy,' which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said flagging workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz, loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. Biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy,' which claims to be the world's first caffeine-based energy spray absorbed through the skin . The website says the product 'can be taken in seconds, doesn't make you crash, is more affordable than current products and isn't full of mystery ingredients.' Mr Yu, 26, and his venture capitalist business partner, Deven Soni, 33, are raising funds for their spray on crowd-sourcing site Indiegogo and have already exceeded their $15,000 target. The patent-pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee. The creators claim the product 'can be taken in seconds, doesn't make you crash, is way more affordable than current products, and isn't full of mystery ingredients. They recommend the product is sprayed on the neck or wrists, like perfume . Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe. Mr Yu told Inc. Magazine that he came up with the idea as an alternative to coffee, which is 'like a roller coaster ride of energy,' The Huffington Post reported. In a bid to develop an alternative, the biochemist researched nicotine patches and asked his father, who has a PhD in Chemistry to work with him to find out how caffeine can be easily absorbed. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which the pair found can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which the pair found can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes and is very similar to nicotine in structure . The scientists found that as caffeine is not easily dissolved in water, it is difficult to transport enough of the stimulant in a spray to have a significant effect. After months of research, they discovered they could increase caffeine’s solubility . five-fold by using a simple derivative of a naturally produced amino . acid, tyrosine. This breakthrough 'opens up a whole new realm of . possibilities when it comes to energizing as effectively as possible . without all the drawbacks and side effects,' said Mr Yu. Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup.

Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: 'The reason for this is our product not . being ingested, isn't almost entirely metabolised by the liver before . entering your system and becoming available to your body. 'Thus, a . smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large . amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee.' The founders of Sprayable Energy have already reached and exceeded their $15,000 investment target on Indiegogo where they are selling the product for $15 each as well as a 'zombie apocalypse stockpile' of 52 bottles for $449 . Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as the neck or wrists, but warns users not to exceed 20 sprays a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel 'awake and focused without being over-stimulated,' which is common with coffee and energy drinks. 'Since our product enters your system gradually over a period of several hours, you wont have the 'buzz' that you get from caffeine products you drink (or the crash afterwards),' it said.

President Gerald Ford recalled seeing a gun pointing at him during his attempted assassination by a Charles Manson disciple, according to his video testimony released for the first time yesterday. The 38-year-old footage was used in the trial of Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme, who was jailed for life in 1975 for trying to kill the 38th U.S. president with a Colt. 45-caliber pistol. The video was released by a federal court judge this week following a motion filed by a local historical group. The case was the first in history featuring oral testimony from a sitting president in a criminal trial. Scroll down for video . President Gerald Ford recalled his attempted assassination in a 38-year-old video released for the first time . President Ford recalled seeing the gun before being shielded by Secret Service staff (pictured) During the 20 minute video filmed in Washington President Ford calmly and carefully . recalled the assassination attempt at a Sacramento park. He gestures gently with his . hands in the footage and sips water as he answers questions from a lawyer about what . began as a routine morning in September 1975, before Fromme pushed . through a crowd on the street, drew a semi-automatic pistol and pointed . it at Ford. The gun was not fired and Ford was not hurt. He said he noticed a 'weathered' woman . coming through a crowd of well-wishers and he stopped because he thought . she wanted to speak to him but then he saw a large handgun. Ford told the lawyer a Secret Service agent lunged at Fromme before he was ushered away by other staff. In the taped testimony posted online by The Sacramento Bee, . Ford said he initially noticed a woman because of her brightly colored . dress as he walked toward the building, where he planned to meet with . the governor. He said he was walking along next to assembled crowd and shaking hands and speaking to them. Watch the full testimony here . Charles Manson disciple Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme is arrested after pointing a loaded gun at the president . The president's testimony was used in Fromme's trial and she was jailed for life but released in 2009 . In the 20 minute interview the president told lawyers he noticed Fromme's bright red dress . Ford told the lawyer: 'I noticed a person in the second or third row in a brightly coloured dress who appeared to want to either shake hands or speak or at least wanted to get closer to me. 'My first impression was that she wanted to come closer and extend - I thought at the time - a hand to shake or to say something to me.' He said he 'hesitated' to wait for her, instead of walking along as he normally would have done, when he saw a gun. Ford told the lawyer: 'As I stopped I saw a hand come through the crowd in the first row and that was the only active gesture that I saw. In the hand was a weapon.' The gun was about two feet away from him, Ford said, but he did not see who was holding it. 'It was simply the hand with the weapon in it, at a height between my knee and my waist, approximately,' Ford said. He recalled Fromme (pictured in the police car) had a 'weathered' face in his taped testimony. The case was the first in history featuring oral testimony from a sitting president in a criminal trial . Fromme was one of the disciples of Charles Manson (right). She pointed a Colt.45 caliber pistol at President Ford in 1975 that she had carried in a holster strapped to her leg (pictured let in police custody) He then described a frantic moment when a security agent seized the suspect and Ford was rushed away. Fromme was sentenced under a law covering assaults on U.S. presidents and was released from prison in 2009. The tape, which represents a historical footnote in the widely publicized case, had been sealed since the case and was largely forgotten in the years since. It was released as a result of a motion filed by the Eastern District Historical Society, a nonprofit that seeks to preserve the history of the federal court based in Sacramento. Fromme received her nickname from Manson's 'family' because of her voice. She was never implicated in the 1969 murders of actress Sharon Tate and eight others, for which Manson is serving a life term in California. Ford died at his Southern California home on December 26, 2006 at the age of 93.","Lynette 'Squeaky' Fromme pointed a loaded gun at president in 1975 .

An 80-year-old has pleaded guilty to waging a five-year harassment campaign against his neighbours which they described as 'like a form of water torture'. William Seed would beep his car horn at all hours of day and night, make loud animal noises, scrape shovels along the ground in order to make a racket, and slowly drive past Carolyn and William Maxwell while staring at them in a bid to intimidate them. He repeatedly accused Mrs Maxwell of having an affair with an ex-policeman, and swore at the couple in front of children, a court heard. Mr and Mrs Maxwell told Blackburn Magistrates' Court that Seed's behaviour was 'like a form of water torture' and 'had a ruinous effect on what should have been the best years of our lives with our young family'. Seed, who was previously convicted of killing cats, started his campaign against the Maxwells when they erected a fence on their property in Longridge, Lancashire, soon after they moved to the town. When the couple complained about his behaviour, police asked them to keep a diary of his misdeeds. Officers also examined video footage captured on mobile phones and CCTV, and saw Seed banging on his neighbours' fence with a spade in an effort to wake their dog. Seed, a retired lorry driver who has lived on the same street with his wife for 44 years, initially refused to co-operate with police, but pleaded guilty at the last minute. However, he insists that he was provoked by the neighbours, and denies making up the affair rumours and swearing at the Maxwells. In an impact statement read to the court, the couple said: 'It has been absolutely soul-destroying and puts a chill in our blood. 'It means that we never get a lie-in at weekends as we wake up when Mr Seed does, and it makes the children think that this is what people do. 'This is not like living near to a public house or a train line, it’s an entirely voluntary act by this man who didn’t get his own way over one thing and has decided to make his neighbours' lives hell. 'We deeply regret ever having moved next to Mr Seed. It has had a ruinous effect on what should have been the best years of our lives with our young family. 'We thought about using the same mechanisms against him, but what example would that set for the children?' Street: Seed had lived with his wife for 44 years on this road in Longridge, Lancashire . Defence lawyer Scott Parker said that his client was 'apologetic about what's been going on', adding: 'Mr Seed is 80 years of age, and by his own admission is not as educated as his neighbours. 'He has been retired a long time and has a lot of time on his hands, and that's the problem in this situation. 'He maintains that he is always careful of his language in front of young people, but he was a working man and swearing is part of his common parlance.' The Probation Service drew up a report on Seed, which stated that he 'accepts that it has reached a point where a line has to be drawn'. He was sentenced to a 12-month supervision order and has to pay a total of £250 compensation to his victims. Speaking after the case, Mr and Mrs Maxwell said: 'All we ever wanted was to have quiet lives and now we want to be left alone.' Seed previously avoided jail in 2003 after he admitted killing up to 10 cats by smashing them over the head with a hammer and then drowning them in a dustbin filled with water.","William Seed harassed Carolyn and William Maxwell in Longridge, Lancs .

Chelsea Manning wants estrogen treatments that would help her develop breasts and other female characteristics - and she'd be willing to pay for it, her lawyer has said. But the soldier, who was previously known as Bradley Manning but announced last week that she wishes to live as a woman, said she does not expect to live separately from male inmates in her all-male military prison and is not seeking sex-reassignment surgery. Manning, 25, is at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas serving 35 years for leaking mountains of classified material to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. Her attorney David Coombs told The . Associated Press on Monday that Manning hoped the prison 'will simply do . the right thing' over their request for hormone treatment so she won't have to sue. New identity: Bradley Manning has announced that she wishes to be referred to as Chelsea Manning. In this undated photo provided by the U.S. Army, Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick . Coombs said Manning decided to announce that she wanted to live as a woman the day after her sentencing because the prison said publicly it would not provide hormone treatment. He said that he had seen people objecting to taxpayer-funded hormone therapy online and said if the Army would not pay for it, then Manning said she would. 'It's just to be comfortable in her own skin,' Coombs said. Coombs said that the soldier had known for a long time she would make a statement about her identity, but 'she wanted, essentially, for the media surrounding the trial to dissipate'. He added that 'people might think it was an effort to get further attention', but that Manning did not want people to think the statement was insincere. Coombs said he and Manning knew the . Army might not provide hormone treatment, but they were hoping the . military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, would allow it since . Manning had been diagnosed with gender-identity disorder by an Army . psychiatrist who testified at his trial. New life: Manning, pictured outside the Maryland court on Tuesday, said she has felt she is a woman since her childhood and hopes to take hormone therapy to develop breasts and other female characteristics . Support: Manning's lawyer David Coombs announced the soldier's new identity on the Today show last week . Below is the full statement Manning shared with the Today show last week: . Subject: The Next Stage of My Life . I . want to thank everybody who has supported me over the last three years. Throughout this long ordeal, your letters of support and encouragement . have helped keep me strong. I am forever indebted to those who wrote to . me, made a donation to my defense fund, or came to watch a portion of . the trial. I would especially like to thank Courage to Resist and the . Bradley Manning Support Network for their tireless efforts in raising . awareness for my case and providing for my legal representation. As . I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know . the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I . feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as . soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition. I . also request that, starting today, you refer to me by my new name and . use the feminine pronoun (except in official mail to the confinement . facility). I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and . having the opportunity to write back. Thank you, . Chelsea E. Manning . It . wasn't until they read a Courthouse News Service story published before . the sentencing that Manning decided to make the announcement after it . quoted spokeswoman Kimberly Lewis saying the prison would not provide . hormone therapy. 'It was . Chelsea's intent to do this all along,' Coombs said. 'It was only after . Fort Leavenworth had said that they would not provide any sort of . medical treatment that we decided not to wait.' Coombs also said on his blog on Monday that Manning chose Elizabeth as her middle name, replacing Edward. He . said Manning knows there could be confusion over her name, and she . expects to be referred to as Bradley when it has to do with events prior . to sentencing, the appeal of the court-martial and the request for a . presidential pardon. Prison mail must be addressed to Bradley Manning. 'There's a realization that most people know her as Bradley,' Coombs said. 'Chelsea is a realist and understands.' The 25-year-old soldier made the announcement about her new identity through Coombs last Thursday. 'As . I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know . the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female,' Manning wrote in the . statement first released on the Today show. 'Given . the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin . hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in . this transition.' She added that she now wishes to be referred to as Chelsea and as a 'she' rather than a 'he'. Hours later, an Army spokesman responded to CBS News: 'The Army does not provide hormone therapy or sex-reassignment surgery for gender identity disorder.'

Speaking out: Manning has received support from across the world - including in Dublin, Ireland, pictured . During the 12-week trial, the Army . released an image showing Manning wearing a . blonde wig and makeup in a photograph she had taken herself. Manning had . sent the picture to her therapist in an email with the subject 'My . Problem' as she struggled with her gender identity in April 2010. 'She . never really wanted this to be public,' Coombs added of Manning's . identity and the photograph. 'Now that it is, unfortunately, you have to . deal with it in a public manner.' Throughout . the trial, her lawyers had argued that Manning was under incredible . stress at the time of the leaks as she struggled with gender identity . disorder in the masculine environment of the Army. 'The . stress that he was under was mostly to give context to what was going . on at the time,' Coombs told Savannah Guthrie on Today. 'It was never an . excuse because that's not what drove his actions. What drove his . actions was a strong moral compass.' A . psychiatrist, Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, testified during . Manning's trial that she suffered from gender dysphoria, or wanting to . be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive . disorder. Younger years: Manning, who was apparently considering transitioning to become a woman when she returned from the warzone, has said she does not like seeing pictures of herself as a young boy . Struggle: Manning, pictured as a child, was bullied throughout school for being gay, friends have said . Defense lawyers . had argued that Manning had been increasingly isolated and under intense . stress when she leaked the files, and that her superiors had ignored . warning signs. They cited erratic behavior, including sending a picture of her dressed as a woman to a superior and punching another soldier. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking an unprecedented volume of classified documents to WikiLeaks. Coombs . added that he did not expect Manning to serve her full sentence - and . even expected President Obama to pardon the soldier. The . first class Army private appeared not to show any emotion when her . long-awaited fate was read out, though spectators gasped inside the . military courtroom at Fort Meade, Maryland. Because . of the 1,294 days she has already spent in custody, Manning will . immediately shave three and a half years off her 35-year term. Emotional: In this courtroom sketch made Wednesday, Manning is escorted from the courtroom as spectators gasp and cry. She will be eligible for parole after eight years . The . former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes, . including six violations of the Espionage Act, as part of the Obama . administration's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks. But . the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, . an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole. Prosecutors portrayed Manning . as 'the determined insider,' an anarchist hacker and traitor who started . working within weeks of his 2009 deployment to provide WikiLeaks and . its founder Julian Assange with exactly what they wanted. But Manning . and her defense team maintain she was an idealistic soldier with a pure . motive - to expose brutal truths about America's military and . diplomatic corps. The . leaked material included video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed . at least two civilians -- a Reuters news photographer and his driver. 'I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people,' Manning said in a courtroom apology.","Last week, Bradley Manning revealed she wishes to live as a woman .

The mysterious Lycurgus Cup is made of dichroic glass and appears green when lit from the front and turns bright red when a light is shone on it from behind. The chalice, which is on display at The British Museum, London, uses similar techniques to 'modern' nanotechnology - the manipulation of materials on an atomic and molecular scale - which scientists believe could be used for everything from diagnosing diseases to identifying bioharzards at airports. The mysterious Lycurgus Cup is made of dichroic glass and appears green when lit from the front (pictured) and turns bright red when a light is shone on it from behind and scientists have only recently found out why. The chalice uses similar techniques to 'modern' nanotechnology . Scientists only solved the mystery of the colour-changing chalice in 1990, after being baffled by its behaviour for decades, Smithsonian Magazine reported. After putting broken fragments of glass under a microscope, scientists found the Romans had impregnated it with particles of sliver and gold, which they ground down to tiny proportions - around 50 nanometres in diameter - a thousand times smaller than a grain of salt. The precise amount of metals has lead experts to hail the Romans as 'nanotechnology pioneers' who really knew what they were doing. Archaeologist Ian Freestone, of University College London, who researched the cup and its unusual optical properties, called its construction an 'amazing feat'. The cup appears to change colour as when light hits it as the flecks of metals' electrons vibrate in ways that seem to change the colour, depending on where the observer is looking at it.

The chalice appears to change colour as when light hits it, the flecks of metals' electrons vibrate in ways that seem to change the colour, depending on where the observer is looking at it. Here the goblet appears red as it is lit from the inside . The chalice was used to hold drink on special occasions and experts believe that when it was filled, the behaviour of the vibrating electrons changed, as well as it's colour. Gang Logan Liu, an engineer and nanotechnology expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign told the publication: 'The Romans knew how to make and use nano-particles for beautiful art.' Of course scientists could not investigate the effects of the one-of-a-kind cup by filling it with liquid. Instead, they reportedly imprinted billions of little wells onto a piece of plastic the size of a postage stamp and sprayed them with gold and silver nano-particles to essentially re-create the special configuration of the cup. The scientists then poured different liquids into the wells to note the effect they had. When they filled a well with water it turned the surface light blue, while pouring oil inside turned it bright red. While the experiment may help archaeologists understand how the chalice works, it could also aid scientists in developing devices to detect pathogens in saliva or urine samples, or by identifying liquids terrorists might try and smuggle onto airplanes. The Lycurgus Cup dates from the 4th Century AD and was probably made in Rome. It shows a scene from a Greek story, where bad tempered king Lycurgus is being trapped by vines as a punishment for his latest outburst of anger. The cup is the only complete example of 'dichroic' glass, which changes colour from green to red when light shines through it. It is also one of the best examples of a 'cage-cup' from the time that is made from a solid block of glass that has been carefully carved away until the cup and the figures standing out on it are left. Sections of the figures are almost standing free and connected only by 'bridges' to the surface of the vessel. The scene on the cup depicts an episode from the myth of Lycurgus, a king of the Thracians ruling at around 800 BC. The story goes that the moody king attacked Dionysos and one of his female followers called Ambrosia who called out to mother earth and was transformed into a vine. In response to the king's bad treatment of Dionysos, she coiled herself around the king to hold him captive, while Dionysos and two friends torment him. Historians believe the myth could have been chosen to elude to a contemporary political event; the defeat of the emperor Licinius by Constantine in AD 324.","Lycurgus Cup is made of dichroic glass, which uses similar tricks to modern nanotechnology to change colour depending on lighting .

A Canadian economist has demonstrated that it really is who you know rather than what you know that helps some sons of wealthy fathers get jobs . A Canadian economist has demonstrated that it really is who you know rather than what you know that helps some sons of wealthy fathers get jobs. Wealthy people hire their children as a way of holding onto their money, the study said. Social mobility expert Miles Corak said the strategy enables money and power to stay within a family instead of being distributed to others. He found sons with rich fathers are more likely to work for the same firm at some point in their lives than sons with less wealthy fathers. He believes nepotism as well as other factors including labour markets and public policies, are damaging the American dream. Dr Corak's research shows the likelihood of a son working at the same firm as one that his father either works at or has worked at, at some point in his life. The study examined elite businessmen in Canada and Denmark and found the proportion of sons sharing an employer with their father is high. The Professor of economics at Ottawa University, studied workers in Canada and Denmark, but noted the pattern is very probably applicable to the composition of workplaces in more places, including the U.S. The study said a rise in income of the top one per cent of businessmen, their access to sources of high quality education and enrichment for their children and the inter-generational transmission of employers and wealth, 'implies a much higher rate of  transmission of economic advantage at the very top, in a way that many  will perceive as evidence of inequality in opportunity'. A U.S. economist said nepotism enables money and power to stay within a family instead of being distributed to others. The graph shows the proportion of sons who work or have worked at the same firms as their fathers as well as examining the earnings of the fathers studied . Dr Corak believes declining mobility is eroding the concept of the American dream. Writing in the study, he said: 'Evidence suggests that more inequality of incomes...is likely to make family background play a stronger role in determining the adult outcomes of young people, with their own hard work playing a commensurately weaker role.' The research found inter-generational earnings mobility is low in countries with more inequality, such as the U.S. Italy and the UK. Earnings mobility is much higher in Nordic countries such as Denmark where income is distributed more equally. Dr Corak said countries with more inequality at one point in time also experience less earnings mobility across the generations, which he has illustrated with a chart dubbed 'The Great Gatsby curve'.

Lucy Crawford snuck in and out of privileged New York households for years helping pampered teens with their college applications . A top New York tutor has revealed some of the dirtiest tricks played by parents when trying to score their child a place at Ivy League universities. Lucy Crawford worked as an independent college-applications counselor for 15 years all over the United States, and has revealed desperate measures taken by parents in over competitive New York city were the most shocking of them all. Speaking to the New York Post, Ms Crawford let slip how the majority of these privileged parents set their children up to fail from the beginning of their education and then bully them into complete disbelief when it comes to the dreaded college application essay. Ms Crawford said: 'Here the frenzy is amplified by money and power as it only can be in New York. Here, too, the opportunities for obsessive parents to break a student's heart seem sharper than anywhere else.' The former tutor and author revealed how her students had such low self-belief they would sob in front of blank pages when trying to compose their applications, describing the process as 'hopeless' after their parents had done little to encourage their personal abilities. Ms Crawford revealed how children are placed on the Ivy league fast track from as young as two when their parents employ consultants to deliver nursery school acceptances. If the child shows any kind of academic weakness as they grow older, a tutor is immediately instated and if this fails the parents will try to identify a deficit in the child's capabilities and pass this off as a handicap to get them out of situations where they may fail, according to Ms Crawford. Universities are chosen two years in advance, and are ordered in preference according to which top school the child's parents attended (this is referred to as a ""legacy school"") and then by where the family has most influence. Universities like Harvard (pictured) and Yale are at the top of the list for pushy parents who will make up almost anything to secure their child a place . After schools are selected according to this code, the teenager is required to compose the dreaded application essay - which is where Ms Crawford comes in. Because most of the teens have never had to do things for themselves in the past, the majority struggle with this ubiquitous task. Ms Crawford says: 'Faced with that blank page, the students panic. They freeze. Their entire lives have been pointed towards this one test of their worth. Who wouldn't suffer writer's block? The parents yell. Everyone sobs.' According to Lucy Crawford, the pampered teens of New York become overwhelmed when writing application essays because their parents don't believe in them. Posed by model . 'From 2000 to 2010, more than 90 percent of my students were accepted at their top-choice schools. My name was shared among wealthy families who would not have dreamed of hiring one of the big college-application consulting shops; they wanted exclusivity, someone other students couldn’t have.' Ms Crawford claims she was often requested to fill out false invoices so the wealthy family involved weren't caught out using her services. But the dishonesty didn't stop there as she recalls one frustrated mother who, distraught her French son's English wasn't good enough for Ivy League education, forced him to state he was black on his application to better his chances. '“My ex-husband, he’s not seeing the application, so we’ll say what we want. We lived four years in Senegal. Our name is exotic. So, we will check the box and say he is black ""Why not?” she pressed me. “Can they ask for proof?”', Ms Crawford recalls. The rouse however did not work, and the mortified boy in question was not admitted like so many others whose parents are left astounded and demanding answers when their money and power falls short. Ms Crawford's experience has inspired her first novel, Early Decision, which is out this week.","Former New York City tutor reveals dirty tricks played by pushy parents .
