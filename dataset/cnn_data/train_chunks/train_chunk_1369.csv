"Tony Verna, a television director and producer who invented instant replay for live sports 51 years ago, has died. He was 81. Verna died Sunday at his Palm Desert home after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia, daughter Tracy Soiseth said. CBS used instant replay for the first time in the December 7, 1963 Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia, after Verna developed a method to cue the tape to pinpoint the play he wanted to immediately air again. Scroll down for video . Tony Verna, inventor of the TV instant replay, died Sunday aged 81 from leukemia at his Palm . Verna first used his pioneering technique during a 1963 Army-Navy game in Philadelphia . He said he was looking for a way to fill those boring gaps between plays during a football telecast. The concept was so new that when Army quarterback Rollie Stichweh scored a touchdown, announcer Lindsey Nelson had to warn viewers: 'This is not live! Ladies and gentlemen, Army did not score again!' Instant replay quickly became a staple of sports broadcasting, and Verna's innovation gave fans a new way to look at the games. 'Not many things you can do in life where you can change the way things were happening before,' Verna told The Associated Press in 2008. Verna would go on to produce or direct five Super Bowls, the Olympics, the Kentucky Derby and even 'Live Aid.' His lasting legacy, though, is pulling back the curtain on sports and revealing what really goes on. Verna is survived by his wife of 45 years, Carol, daughters Tracy Soiseth and Jenny Axelrod, son Eric Verna and three grandchildren.","Tony Verna re-invented TV sports with the technique he first pioneered during an Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia in 1963 .

"Paul Mason, pictured, bombarded Brooke Kinsella with messages and even bought her presents . A man has been jailed for six months for stalking ex-EastEnders actress and anti-knife crime campaigner Brooke Kinsella. Paul Mason, 44, was found guilty at a previous court hearing when magistrates heard he bombarded Brooke, 31, with text messages including one which said 'you will be my wife'. He also turned up at an office to present her with gifts and got to hug her when she appeared at a public event at Millwall Football club. Brooke became a high profile figure after her brother Ben Kinsella was murdered in a gang knife attack in 2008. She met government ministers and went on TV and radio to lead her fight for more measures to tackle knife crime. But the actress did not welcome the bizarre attentions of unemployed Mason who stalked her. Last November Bexley Magistrates Court was told he nicknamed her 'pumpkin' and kept messaging her on Twitter and Facebook. Once he even visited her brother's grave. The court heard he had four previous convictions for harassment. Mason, from Catford, south-east London, obtained Brooke's phone number through a website and text messaged her saying: 'Your wedding dress is ready pumpkin.' He also said: 'Pumpkin, I will be coming down Saturday to see you and the kids' - in reference to the True Stars Academy, her performing arts school for children in Hoxton, east London. When he was arrested on April 10 last year, police found a poster of her on his bedroom wall and a series of hand-written love letters on his bed. Brooke, who gave evidence from behind a curtain in court, said she asked for Mason's messages to be blocked from the Facebook page of the Ben Kinsella Trust which was set up to educate schools on knife crime. But Mason continuously set up new Facebook accounts which Abigail Kegg, manager of the trust, recognised due to the personal nature of interactions sent. In August last year, Mason attended the charity's offices where Brooke was working to give her perfume, a ring, oils, a scarf and numerous CDs containing his own recordings. But he was met by Miss Kegg who confronted him on his relationship with the actress. She told Mason: 'I don't think Brooke is expecting you, I don't think she wants your gift and I don't think she is your friend.' Brooke Kinsella, pictured, received a number of presents from Paul Mason who was jailed by magistrates . Ben Kinsella, pictured, was stabbed 11 times after he completed his GCSEs in Islington, north London . Mr Mason, pictured, had four prior convictions and was sentenced to a maximum jail term of six  months . Giving evidence, Miss Kegg told the court how at this point Mason lifted his shirt and showed her a 'huge scar' on his stomach he claimed was the result of being stabbed several years ago. Miss Kegg told Mason she would accept the gifts on Brooke's behalf on the condition he left. On another occasion in April, an open day was arranged at Millwall Football Club where Mason approached and hugged the actress who subsequently informed a police friend and sought advice. During the trial, an erratic Mason lifted his shirt to caress his scar, mumbled to himself in the dock and tried to take evidence claiming the love letters he wrote were part of his autobiography. Mason was found guilty of stalking. Sentencing him to six months' jail, magistrate Alan Dee told him: 'Mr Mason you understand you did not plead guilty to this offence and therefore we needed to have a trial. 'But of course in the process of a trial the victim needed to relieve the memory of the memory of offences when coming to court to give evidence. 'We have taken into account the previous history of harassing individuals. We have also concluded that you have been calculating in your conduct. 'The court will know the maximum sentence we can impose is 26 weeks. 'However for the non violent nature of these types of offences the range is usually 12 weeks, that would be the normal sentence we would impose. 'However we have to take into account other evidence, we have to take into account the prolonged nature of this offence and the impact on Miss Kinsella and those who worked with her. 'She would not have known when you would turn up and the impact on the others who worked with her. 'Let's also take into account your previous record is not good and there are four previous harassment convictions since 2008. 'On that basis, we have concluded that the period of custody we must impose today is the full 26 weeks.' Mr Dee ordered him to pay an £80 victim surcharge. Mason, who wore a grey tracksuit and appeared via video link, shouted at Mr Dee: 'I don't give two shits' - before he was taken away by guards. He also ranted that he had been stabbed and that his mother died from being stabbed. Mason was also subject to a restraining order. He is prohibited to go to Finsbury library in London, not to enter N1, London, not to knowingly attend any location that Brooke Kinsella is at and not to contact her directly or indirectly. Brooke played Kelly Taylor in EastEnders between 2001-2004. Her character was a friend of Martine McCutcheon's character Tiffany Raymond in the BBC1 soap.","Paul Mason was convicted of stalking EastEnders actress Brooke Kinsella .

"A man has been forced to sell his Subaru Brumby ute by his wife because she's pregnant and there's no room for a baby seat. But Stuart Watt, 32, managed to pen a hilarious but gloomy ad for the quirky offroader which has clocked 280,000km since it was first registered back in 1992. The dramatic Gumtree ad hails from the Northern Territory, where Mr Watt is advertising the vehicle under the orders of his wife Zelina Carr. Watt has listed the 1992 Subaru Brumby for $2,500 - but he says finding a buyer has been problematic because everyone thinks the advertisement is just a 'joke'. Stuart Hall has posted a dramatic ad on gumtree offering his 1992 Subaru Brumby . The hilarious advert is filled with melodramatic language, but Mr Watt said the message rings true . And that's perhaps no surprise, given the ad is filled with dramatic language. 'Perhaps rather ironically, the cruelness of fatherhood is now set to callously deprive me of another 50-60 years of driving pleasure in this mighty beast,' he writes. Mr Watt describes how he has owned a string of other vehicles since then- a Hilux, Getz, CRV, Pajero, Pajero Junio - but that only his beloved Brumby has 'faithfully and stoically remained by my side'. He said his wife Zelina was expecting their second child at the time. 'With only days before childbirth is due,' the ad reads, 'my wife is getting a little frantic about irrelevant things. Namely: 'why haven't you sold the brumby yet??' He even accuses her heart of 'icing over' and claims she no longer understands the notion of sentimentality. Stuart Watt says his wife Zelina (pictured) is insisting they sell their car since it cannot offer a baby seat for their second child . Mr Watt said he has been approached by people on social media suggesting he 'keep the car and ditch the wife' After listing the cars extensive usage-which includes 280,000km and a broken speedometer-Stuart wrote 'yes she's old and has some inevitable wear and tear, but is super reliable and clearly super cool.' Mr Hall told Daily Mail Australia the ad has some sparked interest on social media. 'Some people have approached us on Facebook. They suggested I keep the car and ditch the wife. She naturally wasn't too happy about that.' He said since the ute can't fit a baby seat in it, and since his wife has just given birth to their second child, the Brumby is now obsolete as a family vehicle. 'There hasn't been a whole lot of prospective buyers for the car. Maybe people think it's a joke? It's a bit of a gag but the message rings true. The car needs to be sold.'","Stuart Watt has listed his 1992 Subaru Brumby for $2500 .

"An Italian politician has come under fire for suggesting on Twitter that two aid workers captured by jihadists had consensual sex with their captors. Maurizio Gasparri was referring to Vanessa Marzullo, 21, and Greta Ramelli, 20, who were captured by militants in Syria believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August. They arrived back in Rome on Friday, after which Mr Gasparri, the vice president of the Italian senate, tweeted: ‘#Vanessa and Greta [had] consensual sex with their captors? And we pay!’ Scroll down for video . An Italian politician has come under fire for suggesting that two aid workers captured by jihadists - Vanessa Marzullo, 21, and Greta Ramelli, 20 (pictured arriving in Rome on Friday) - had sex with their captors . Vanessa Marzullo pictured arriving back home in Bergamo after being held captive in Syria . A huge row has erupted in Italy over claims that a ransom was paid to guarantee the release of the aid workers. Here Marzullo is jostled by the press as she arrives home . It’s likely that his comment about money was a reference to claims that the Italian government paid the Islamic extremists a £9million ransom to guarantee their release. However, Mr Gasparri strenuously denied that he was suggesting the girls had sex with the jihadists. He claimed he had heard reports they had, and was merely asking if it was true, according to the Daily Telegraph. It reported he told La Repubblica: ‘A [news] site reported the two girls had told the authorities [they had sex]. Greta Ramelli, second from left, and Vanessa Marzullo, right, sit in a car as they leave a police station in Rome after being questioned about their harrowing experience . Gasparri (pictured) found himself in hot water last year when he tweeted disparaging remarks about the English following England's World Cup defeat to Italy . ‘I also wrote that I hoped it wasn’t true. I simply noted the claim and asked if it was true. I didn’t state anything.’ Last year he found himself in hot water after he posted an insult on his Twitter account following England's World Cup defeat. Gasparri labelled English people 'pretentious d***s' just minutes after the final whistle of the 2-1 setback. Diplomatic sources at the British Embassy in Rome said at the time that the reports were ""highly insulting."" Gasparri, a member of disgraced former PM Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, wrote: 'It's always a pleasure to say 'go...themselves"" to the English...pretentious and d***s.' Minutes later he posted another offending Tweet writing: 'Great game, great victory it's great that it gets the English right in that place always arrogant and unbelievable.' His offensive postings were also heavily criticised by Italians on Twitter with many saying it was 'hardly the language of a politician' with others calling on him to apologise. Instead Gasparri, who used to Minister of Communication in Berlusconi's government, later wrote on his account: 'Detestable English, is that OK?' News of Ramelli and Marzullo’s return was applauded in Parliament in Italy, but also drew heavy criticism from opposition politicians after Arab media reports suggested a ransom of 12 million euros (£9m) had been paid. European governments including Italy have long tolerated or facilitated ransom payments to secure the release of hostages although the practice has frequently been denied officially. The leader of the Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, said on Twitter: 'If the government really paid a ransom of 12million euros, it would be disgusting!'","Vanessa Marzullo and Greta Ramelli were held  in Syria for six months .

"Ed Balls admitted yesterday that the falling oil price will make people feel better off. The Shadow Chancellor said the plunging price of oil ‘will help’ households. His words were an apparent admission that the party’s cost of living campaign was being undermined by falling inflation. A report published yesterday showed the public will see a ‘substantial boost to their spending power’ this year as wages surge ahead of prices. The Shadow Chancellor said the plunging price of oil will help households . Mr Balls made his comments at the launch of a major report by the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity into declining middle class incomes in wealthy countries. Mr Balls criticised the government for ‘waiting for things to improve…because the evidence is that’s not going to happen.’ He added: ‘It is true at the moment we have a fall in the oil price which will help.’ ‘But the fall in the oil price is no more a solution to these long term problems than the rise in the oil price in the 1970s was the main cause of economic challenge in Britain. There were considerably deeper economic challenges we faced at the time.’ Mr Balls said: ‘In our country in a couple of months time we will have a general election where the median person in work will be absolutely worse off than they were in 2010. ‘That has not happened in any Parliament in our country since the 1920s. Tory Treasury Minister David Gauke said: ‘Our Long Term Economic Plan is working with real incomes forecast to rise for families this year. But the job is not yet done and we must carrying on working through our plan to secure a better economic future. ‘Even though their economic argument is collapsing, Labour would abandon our plan. Their economic policy consists of more spending, more borrowing and more debt which would lead to economic chaos.’ He criticised the Government claiming they were 'waiting for things to improve' financially . On Sunday, Labour’s deputy leader, Harriet Harman, raised the ‘cost of living’ eight times in a television interview as she argued ordinary people are not feeling better off. But her claims appeared to be undermined by forecasts of a buoyant economy, growing wages and falling prices. Figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show this week that average earnings excluding bonuses are nearly two per cent higher than a year ago.","Report claimed public will see a 'substantial boost in spending power'

"Train delays mean Ella Porter often has to go to bed without a cuddle from her daddy. But rather than complain to him, the six-year-old went to the source of the problem instead – and wrote a letter to rail bosses. And now Ella's moving letter, addressed to 'Dear Mr Railway Man', has been backed by thousands of people after her father Neil posted a picture of it online. She wrote to Southern Rail bosses: 'My daddy is always late home and I miss him very much. Please get him home on time. Daddy says you take all his money that is why I can't go to Disneyland. I really want to go to Disneyland.' Scroll down for video . Short on time: Neil and Michelle Porter with Ella, wrote the letter to railway bosses, and baby Charlie . Ella decided to contact the company because her father, who commutes daily from Uckfield in East Sussex to London Bridge, is often held up by delays. Southern's services have been in a state of chaos for two weeks since a new timetable came in which has led to trains being regularly delayed, suspended or cancelled. And according to official Network Rail figures, none of Southern's 7.29am trains between Brighton and London Victoria reached the capital at the scheduled time of 8.35am last year. Ella's note, written in black biro and carefully checked for spelling mistakes, even caused many social media users to contact Southern Rail directly, demanding Ella be treated to a holiday in Paris. One Twitter user, Hannah Lloyd-Roberts, wrote to the rail company and Mr Porter: 'Hope your daughter gets more daddy time and Disney.' Mr Porter also tweeted the company to say: 'I think @SouthernRailUK should compensate my daughter for her time without her dad.' Neil Porter's six-year-old daughter, Ella, has written to rail bosses to ask them to stop delaying her father's train . Neil Porter spends just over £4.000 a year commuting to from his home in Uckfield, East Sussex, to London Bridge . The 35-year-old, who also has a baby son, Charlie, with wife Michelle, 41, spends £4,000 a year travelling to work as a graphic designer at entertainment firm Mind Candy in Shoreditch, East London. Mr Porter, who also runs his own card-making business, said: 'At six years old Ella is already a strong-headed young girl! 'I love spending time with her and she gets upset when I miss her bedtime. 'Unfortunately this has happened a lot as of late because of Southern Rail and their long delays. I hope they get back to Ella with a response and sort out the trains so I can spend some time with my family.' Last night, one of the peak-time trains between London and Uckfield had six coaches instead of eight, causing one commuter to post a picture online of a packed carriage and write: 'Six carriages on peak Uckfield line service. People crushed. Think some got left behind at platform.' Yesterday, Southern Rail apologised to Ella – but failed to mention anything about her Disney hopes. A spokesman added: 'Trains to Victoria and London Bridge travel over the most congested part of the whole of Britain's railway network and we are constantly pushing against the boundaries of what is physically possible on the infrastructure to provide as much capacity as possible to and from London.' Southern has apologised to Mr Porter's daughter, Ella, for repeatedly delaying her father's train . Commuters are set to experience disruption and overcrowding at London Bridge Station for the next 18 months whilst it undergoes major rebuilding work. The 178-year-old station is the oldest surviving rail terminal. It is due to be rebuilt as part of the £6.5billion Thameslink programme and is expected to take three years. The building work has seen the closure of platforms one to six at the station. As a result services run by the Southeastern train company to and from Charing Cross station will not call at London Bridge main line station until August 2016. A new timetable was also introduced at the station for Southern and Thameslink services, which has led to major disruption. Once the work is completed the station will be able to up capacity by 65 per cent, Network Rail said.","Ella Porter wrote to rail bosses asking them to stop delaying father's train .

"New DNA technology could help reveal the killer in an unsolved murder of a mother and her three-year-old daughter. The technique, known as Snapshot, can generate a digital mugshot of the suspect by using samples such as blood and strands of hair left at the scene. Investigators in South Carolina have used the analysis, generated by Parabon Nanolabs, in a bid to get a breakthrough in the slaying of Candra Alston, 25, and her toddler Malaysia Boykin four years ago. Their bodies were found in the busy Brook Pines Apartments in Columbia on January 9, 2011. Unsolved: Investigators in South Carolina are hoping the DNA technique called Snapshot, generated by Parabon Nanolabs, leads to a breakthrough in the slaying of  Malaysia Boykin, three, and Candra Alston four years ago. There were no witnesses to their deaths in January 2011 . Leads: There were no signs of forced entry at their home and police believe the toddler and her mother may have known the killer. More than 200 people have been interviewed in connection to their deaths . Police have never revealed how they died and would only confirm it was by different means. There were no signs of forced entry - leading detectives to believe they knew the killer or killers. The only piece of evidence left at the scene was an unspecified DNA sample that has, until now, been untraceable. As there were no witnesses, authorities turned to the forensic phenotyping and found the suspect was dark-skinned with brown hair and brown eyes. However the computer-generated image does not have an estimated height or age - traits which the company claim are 'very complex'. Speaking to Fox News, Parabon's director of bioinformatics, Ellen McRae Greytak, said: 'This is particularly useful when there are no witnesses, no hits in the DNA database and nothing to go on. Prediction: Using the phenotyping technique, investigators have been able to determine that the suspect is dark-skinned with brown eyes and brown hair . 'Traditional forensic analysis treats DNA as a fingerprint, whereas Snapshot treats it as a blueprint -- a genetic description of a person from which physical appearance can be inferred. 'Traits are generally predicted with more than 80 percent confidence, and importantly, Snapshot also reports which phenotypes can be excluded with more than 95 per cent confidence.' Mark Vinson, a cold case investigator with the Columbia police department, said that more than 200 people were interviewed in connection with the mother and daughter's death. Around 150 of them submitted their DNA - but none matched the sample left at the scene.","Technique known as Snapshot can create a digital mugshot using samples .

"Middle school Principal Mark Hassell, 35, was arrested on Friday for allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl . A married middle school principal in southern California was arrested last week on suspicion of having sex with a 17-year-old girl. Police received a tip on Tuesday that Barstow Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Academy Principal Mark Lesley Hassell, 35, was engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a female student. Investigators interviewed the unidentified 17-year-old girl who admitted to having been in a 'consensual' sexual relationship with Hassell 'for some time'. However, under the law, the relationship could not have been consensual since the age of consent in California is 18. In a press release, police said they found other evidence indicating the relationship, but would not elaborate. With both sets of proof, they arrested Hassell on Friday and booked him into San Barnardino County jail on charges of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, sodomy, and oral copulation. Jail records indicate he was released on bail Saturday morning. The Barstow Unified School District has since placed Hassell on non-disciplinary paid leave pending the police investigation, according to a news release. He has also been told to stay away from all district students, employees and campuses. It's unlikely that the student attended the STEM academy, which only teaches fifth, sixth and seventh graders. According to online records, Hassell has been married since 2002. 'Due to employee confidentiality rights, the district is prevented from further commenting on this matter,' the district release said. 'However, the district will take any appropriate corrective action when the investigation is complete and facts are known.' Hassell (pictured cutting a ribbon, center) was the first principal for Barstow STEM Academy, a mathematics oriented school for fifth, sixth and seventh graders which opened this past summer. Before that, he worked at nearby Barstow High School . Hassell was the first principal of the Barstow STEM Academy, which was founded this past summer as an institution where teachers and students would be 'thinking out of the box,' according to a story in the Desert Dispatch. Before that, Hassell served as head boys basketball coach and head coach of the girls track and field team at Barstow High School. He also worked as an assistant for the Barstow High School football team this fall. As the investigation is ongoing, anyone with information on the relationship is being asked to contact Detective Keith Libby (760-255-5134) or the Barstow Police Department (706-256-2211).

"It was the annual family holiday which turned into a nightmare for a seven-year-old girl and left two sisters orphans. Now the violent murder of Elaine Jones which triggered her husband's death after he pulled her mutilated body from a river near the family campsite may be attributed to the notorious serial rapist and murderer known as 'Mr Stinky'. Detective Chief Inspector John Lehmann of the NSW Unsolved Homicide Squad said Mr Stinky, the name given to Raymond Edmunds because of the foul odour noticed by his rape victims, may have murdered Ms Jones on January 3, 1980, Fairfax reported. Death on the river: Elaine Jones (right) pictured with her husband Alan before she was brutally murdered in 1980 at Tocumwal on the NSW border and her body dumped in the Murray River where her husband found it and suffered a massive heart attack and died in front of their seven-year-old daughter . Prime suspect: Notorious serial rapist and murderer Raymond Edmunds (pictured) aka 'Mr Stinky' was camping on a nearbvy island in the Murray River in January 1980 when Elaine Jones was raped and her throat slit in a vicious murder which has remained unsolved . Edmunds, who was sentenced in 1986 for life in a Victorian jail for the double murder of  two teenagers in 1966, was reportedly camping on Ulupna Island in the Murray River, just 20km from where Ms Jones was abducted and brutally slain. Elaine Jones, 39, and her husband Alan, a 51-year-old welder from Box Hill in Melbourne, were camping at Tocumwal town beach caravan park, on the NSW-Victoria border, as they had every Christmas New Year period for 18 years. Ms Jones left her husband with their daughters, Nita, 15 and seven-year-old Jennifer in their tent at around 9.30pm on a Thursday night to walk to the shops and buy chocolate and cigarettes. Police believe she reached the shops, but she never returned to the campsite. Mr Jones alerted police the following morning and then decided to go searching for his wife with Jennifer in a dinghy. Over a kilometre downstream, they saw a leg protruding from the water and Mr Jones recognised his wife's shoe on the body which had snagged on a river log. Protruding leg: Alan Jones and daughter Jennifer, 7, spotted a leg poking out from the Murray river at Tocumweal (pictured) and Mr Jones retrieved the body of his wife and pulled her into the dinghy before he had a massive heart attack and died, leaving Jennifer to swim ashore and call for help . Favourite spot: Alan and Elaine Jones had holidayed in the tourist town of Tocumwal (above) on the NSW Victorian border for 18 years before she was raped and murdered and he died from a massive heart attack leaving their two daughters orphans in 1980 . Mr Jones pulled his wife's body aboard. Her throat had been slit from ear to ear, cut so deeply it exposed her spinal column. Mr Jones covered the body with life jackets, started up the motor and was accelerating away when he collapsed and died from a massive heart attack; he had suffered from a heart problem for years. The boat circled for several minutes before Jennifer could stop the motor, jump out and swim 30m to shore. Horrified onlookers then retrieved the boat with the two bodies. Jennifer and her sister, Nita, 15, were taken to a family friend's place in Tocumwal before being sent to their maternal grandmother in Hobart. A post mortem later determined Elaine Jones had died from massive head injuries sustained when a blunt weapon was used to fracture her skull. Her body was also bruised and she had been sexually assaulted. Detectives  described the injuries as 'the work of a maniac' and vowed to hunt down the killer. But at the tim eof the murder, the local population of 1300 had swollen to 10,000 with the influx of holiday makers, fruit pickers and a local nudist convention, and the case remained unsolved. In 2000, police looked at Edmunds as the possible killer. Now 70 years old, Edmunds is suspected of raping at least 30 women in Melbourne's eastern suburbs in the 1970s and 1980s. He was convicted of three rapes and two attempted trapes committed in the 1970s and sentenced to life for raping and murdering 18-year-old panel beater Garry Heywood and 16-year-old Abina Madill; Heywood was shot through the head with a .22  rifle and Madill was raped and bludgeoned to death. Edmunds was said to have  raped and beaten his first wife and sexually abused their three-year-old daughter before he became the man dubbed 'the Donvale rapist' in Melbourne. He is also on the suspect list for Victoria's unsolved serial killings, of women who bodies were dumped in the scrub at Tynong North, in Victoria west Gippsland area 80km south-east of Melbourne. In late 1980 a man dumping animal remains uncovered a human dumping site. Police found the remains of Ann-Marie Sargent, 18,  Bertha Miller, 73 and 14-year-old named Catherine  Headland. All the victims came from south-eastern Melbourne. Three years later, they found Narumol Stephenson, 34, who had been abducted from Northcote in Melbourne's north-east November 1980. Chief Inspector Lehmann said that in 2011 the NSW Government had offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer of Elaine Jones, but a lack of forensic evidence and the number of people in  Tocumwal at the time of the murder had hampered investigations. 'It's obviously difficult dealing with the grief of the family when you have no answers for them,' he said. 'People for whatever reason have knowledge they may have witheld because of relationships with the offender and, hopefully, those relationships have changed over the years.'","Elaine Jones, 39, was viciously murdered while on holiday 35 years ago .

"Harry Potter fans or fairtrade food activists? As it turns out, fans of the boy wizard are concerned about where their magical snacks come from. Fans are celebrating after winning a four-year battle to get Warner Bros. Entertainment to use only fairtrade certified chocolate in all Harry Potter-branded chocolate. This includes the chocolate frogs that are sold at Universal Orlando's theme park in Florida, as well as the Shock-O-Choc and HoneyDukes Chocolate Bars. Scroll down for video . Led by the Harry Potter Alliance (HPA), fans have just won a four-year fair-trade chocolate battle against Warner Bros. The HPA sent petitions and video messages to Warner Bros. arguing against unethically produced chocolate . The Harry Potter Alliance (HPA), a social justice group, has been pushing for such certification since Halloween 2010. HPA founder Andrew Slack and his slew of activists, which includes Harry Potter creator, J.K. Rowling herself, were working to ensure that all chocolate production not rely on child labour and that all producers are paid a decent wage. In a 400,000-strong petition to Warner Bros., which own all rights to the Harry Potter franchise, which includes products and merchandise, the HPA argued that Harry's fans didn't think that the fictional wizard would approve of unethically produced chocolate. 'If 'Harry Potter' [as a franchise] were to be in alignment with the values of Harry Potter [himself], it could be a real symbolic and coherent victory,' Slack told the Washington Post. Any chocolate products affiliated with the Harry Potter series will be made only of certified free-trade cocoa . Chocolate plays an important role in the franchise and is very symbolic to the storyline . After Harry leaves his aunt and uncle's house to attend Hogwarts, the abundance of chocolate available there becomes a symbol for how the school will nourish Harry's body and mind. Since chocolate plays such an important role in the series, the opportunity to turn fans into real-life advocates was an idea that especially appealed to Slack. The group charged Behr's Chocolate, the company that Warner Bros. used to make all of the Harry Potter chocolate, with a poor record of human rights and child labour. Thousands of fans sent complaint letters over the years and in 2013, the HPA took yet another step forward when they teamed up with Walk Free, an anti-slavery movement, to pressure Warner Bros. even further. In December, it was announced that chocolate sold at the Universal Orlando theme park would be fair-trade . In 2014, J.K. Rowling also joined the cause. And it paid off. On December 22, Joshua Berger, the president of Harry Potter Global Franchise Development, wrote an email to the HPA announcing Warner Bros,' decision. 'By the end of 2015, and sooner when possible, all Harry Potter chocolate products sold at Warner Bros. outlets and through our licensed partners will be 100 per cent UTZ or Fair Trade certified.'","Led by the Harry Potter Alliance (HPA), the campaign has been resolved .

"Tragedy: 24-year-old outdoorsman Dasan Marshall died on Sunday after falling 1,000 feet off an Alaskan mountain . A 24-year-old experienced mountaineer died Sunday while attempting to climb a peak in Alaska's Chugach Mountain range. Alaskan authorities say Dasan Marshall of Portland, Oregon was climbing Mount Yukla with a friend Sunday afternoon when he fell about 1,000 feet and died. Rescuers received a call about Marshall around 2pm, and used a helicopter to retrieve the body which was taken to the state medical examiner's office. Marshall's next of kin have been informed and investigators say they do not suspect foul play in the accident. According to Alaska Native News, Marshall had enrolled in a class in Alaska Pacific University's outdoors program, where he regularly climbed mountains, waterfall ice, and rock formations. At 7,535 feet, Mount Yukla is not  exceptionally tall, but is described on climbing website the Mountain Project as 'one of the gnarliest peaks in the Chugach'. 'While its elevation isn't anything to squawk about by Alaska standards, Yukla is a beast of (a) mountain,' one climber wrote. 'The northern side has well over 4,000 feet of elevation gain.' No further details on the incident are being released until after the Monday Martin Luther King Jr holiday. Difficult: Marshall and a friend were climbing Mount Yukla (pictured) on Sunday when the accident happened. The more than 7,000-foot mountain has been described as 'one of the gnarliest peaks in the Chugach' range . Following news of Marshall's death, several of his friends in the mountaineering community wrote touching tributes to their fallen fellow outdoorsman. Friend Simon Frez-Albrecht wrote on Facebook that Marshall was the person who first got him excited about climbing. 'Dasan always dreamed big. His enthusiasm was infectious. He loved climbing and sharing that love with others. Accident: Alaskan authorities notified Marshall's family and said they don't believe foul play was a factor in his death. Above, Marshall pictured on the left with a woman in a photo posted to his Facebook page . Experienced: Marshall, from Portland, Oregon, had reportedly enrolled in an outdoors class in Alaska. Pictured above using pics to climb in an ice shaft . 'But he loved many other things as well, and in remembering him I don't want to neglect those. He practiced many disciplines apart from climbing, including woodcarving and creating art through other media. 'Dasan was loving and caring toward everyone in his life, giving generously of his time and thoughts...My written words are inadequate for expressing how much I will miss him,' Frez-Albrecht wrote. Commenting on a KTVA story about Marshall's death, family friend Michael Cromie wrote: ' Dasan was a vibrant young man and a dear friend. His deep connection to the natural world guided his experience. He was a true explorer. I am deeply saddened.' Lost: Several of Marshall's friends posted touching tributes to him online Monday, when news of his premature death broke.

"Resplendent in a powder blue coat, the Duchess of Cambridge was every inch the glamorous mother-to-be as she arrived to meet volunteers in London this morning. But the brand behind her chic look was no big name designer. Instead, her 'Natasha' cashmere coat came from a small Anglo-French label called Séraphine. To those who have watched the brand grow from a small shop in 2002 to the A-list favourite it is today, the royal endorsement will come as no surprise. Scroll down for video . Favourite: The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in Séraphine yet again during today's visit to Kensington . Pretty stylish: The Duchess opted for a £195 'Natasha' coat worn over a delicate £95 floral maternity dress . Indeed, the Duchess has form when it comes to wearing Séraphine, having repeatedly chosen the label during both her pregnancies. Along with today's £195 coat and £95 blue and green floral dress, she also opted for the brand when making her debut in New York. On that occasion, it was the glamorous £225 plum boucle Marina coat that was chosen - and true to form, the design has since sold out repeatedly. Séraphine is the brainchild of French expat Cecile Reinaud who launched the brand in 2002 from a small shop on High Street Kensington. 'Fashion has always been in my blood,' explains Reinaud. 'My grandparents supplied fabrics to some of the top fashion houses in Paris but it wasn’t until my friends started to fall pregnant that the idea for Séraphine came about. Big moment: Séraphine went stratospheric when the Duchess chose this £39 dress for George's first photo . Old faithful: The Duchess returned to Séraphine for her second pregnancy, seen here wearing it in New York . 'They struggled to find maternity clothes they liked and used to come to me with alteration requests for their clothes. 'I spotted a gap in the market for fashion forward maternity clothes and the business developed from there.' The brand enjoyed modest success from the outset but the real making of the brand as a fashion force to be reckoned with came in August 2013 when the Duchess wore the label for Prince George's first photo shoot. Pictured smiling happily on the sunny lawn of her parents' Bucklebury home, the Duchess looked every bit the yummy mummy as she cradled her son, then just over a month old, in her lap. The dress, a plum coloured wrap style, was a cheap chic £39 number by Séraphine - and swiftly sold out. Since then, the brand has gone from strength to strength and has amassed an A-list following to rival the likes of Chanel. Brains: 40-year-old Cecile Reinaud is the brains behind Séraphine and launched the brand in 2002 . Royal approval: Another to wear the brand is Zara Phillips, seen here in it for an event in September 2013 . Chic: Country singer Carrie Underwood wore a dress by the brand for an appearance on the Rachel Ray Show . Glamorous: Una Foden (left) and Zoe Saldana (right) both wore the brand while pregnant . Singers Shakira and Gwen Stefani, model Doutzen Kroes and actress Zoe Saldana and Mila Kunis are just some of the names who have turned to the brand while pregnant. 'Seraphine has grown from just one shop on Kensington High Street to being stocked in department stores all over the world with a celebrity following to match,' comments fashion expert Wendy Douglas. According to Douglas, it is the brand's insistence on style rather than smocking that has won it so many fans - and its a trend she expects to see continue. 'The label’s pieces are designed specifically for women who don’t want to compromise on style just because they’re expecting,' she explains, 'so it’s no surprise the Duchess of Cambridge has worn Seraphine so often in her pregnancies. 'Her classic take on fashion suits the brand’s sophisticated and elegant aesthetic.' 'At Séraphine, we design all of our maternity clothes with a fashion focus,' confirms Reinaud, who says everything is made with the changing bodies of pregnant women in mind. Looking good: Alicia Keys is pictured here wearing Seraphine during an event last November . Rock chick: Shakira and Gwen Stefani are both fans of the brand and wore it while pregnant . Yummy mummy: Kourtney Kardashian is also a fan of the British maternity brand (not pictured) 'Our collections offer something for everyone, with a wide range of styles from Parisian chic classics to rock chic glamour.' And she isn't wrong. While the Duchess of Cambridge plumps for styles at the classic end of the spectrum, a quick glance at Carrie Underwood looking every inch the rock chick in the brand's £55 'graphic' maternity dress is enough to prove that there's plenty of choice. Others, among them Christina Aguilera, have taken advantage of Séraphine's stretchy separates, while Zara Tindall is among the big names who have opted for the brand's evening wear while waiting for Junior to arrive. 'Most women today want to stay true to their style through pregnancy and this is our brand motto,' explains Reinaud. 'They are looking for maternity clothes that flatter their new shape and to be versatile enough to wear day and night.' If Reinaud's large and growing celebrity following is any indication, Séraphine is certainly living up to its stylish slogan.","Séraphine is a British brand led by French expat Cecile Reinaud .

"A man who violently raped a 14-year-old schoolgirl is pleading to have his electronic monitoring tag removed because it’s making him ‘paranoid’. Darren Michael Costello’s victim hanged herself after he raped her after following her as she walked near a skating rink in southwestern Brisbane in November 1995. His release from jail in 2010, after spending nearly 15 years locked up for rape and his other offences, sparked outrage from the local community when Queensland’s Attorney-General Cameron Dick failed in his bid to keep Costello in jail under the Dangerous Prisoners Sexual Offenders Act. Now, Costello, 43, is asking Queensland’s Supreme Court to take off his ankle tag because he ‘doesn’t want people asking questions’ when it beeps, the Courier Mail reports. Darren Michael Costello served 15 years in jail after he raped a 14-year-old girl . In an application for its removal on December 19, he reportedly said the device makes him feel ‘uncomfortable, paranoid, uneasy and anxious ... with everyone knowing my personal business’. ‘I feel the monitoring device is an obstacle and barrier in my way from (sic) being able to try and live a normal life and engage with people.’ The Courier Mail reports Costello has been offered three jobs if he can get his monitor removed. His case will be heard in court on February 3. He was originally released back into the community under a supervision order in a judgement handed down by Supreme Court Justice Debra Mullins. Costello, 43, is asking Queensland’s Supreme Court (left) to take off his ankle tag (stock photo, right) because he ‘doesn’t want people asking questions’ when it beeps . In her ruling, Justice Mullins said that psychiatric tests revealed Costello was not a paedophile but had a low IQ. She warned that he should stay away from drugs and alcohol. Costello was on parole for two other offences when he attacked the 14-year-old girl. Ankle monitors are designed to be tamper-resistant, if a criminal tries to remove it themselves than it will usually alert authorities. The tags are mainly used on offenders who are on parole or under house arrest and work by sending a radio frequency signal that shows their location to authorities.

"One of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history will be replayed in a Colorado courtroom — but only after an unprecedented jury pool of 9,000 people is winnowed to a handful to decide whether James Holmes was insane when he opened fire in a suburban movie theater. Holmes is one of the few suspects to survive such an attack — many are killed by police or commit suicide. His survival has sparked an emotionally charged debate in which his parents have begged for a plea deal that would save his life, while many survivors and family members of victims have demanded that he stand trial and face the death penalty if convicted. Jury selection begins Tuesday, and the trial could run until October. It could provide a look into the mind of Holmes, whose attorneys acknowledge was the gunman in the July 20, 2012, attack but say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode at the time. Inside Courtroom 201: Here, jury selection in the trial of Aurora movie theater shootings defendant James Holmes is to begin Tuesday at the Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colorado . 'The public is going to get an insight into the mind of a killer who says he doesn't know right from wrong,' said Alan Tuerkheimer, a Chicago-based jury consultant. 'It is really rare. It just doesn't usually come to this.' Holmes, 27, was arrested as he stripped off his combat gear in the parking lot of the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, where 12 people were killed and 70 injured during a midnight showing of a new Batman movie. He later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder. If jurors find him guilty, they must then decide whether to recommend the death penalty. If Holmes is found not guilty, he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital. Under Colorado law, defendants are not legally liable for their acts if their minds are so 'diseased' that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Part of the reason the case has dragged on so long is the battle over whether that standard applies to Holmes. Few details on those arguments have been made public. Prosecutors and defense attorneys remain under a long-running gag order, and court documents detailing the issue have stayed under seal. HOW THE JURY WILL BE CHOSEN: Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. called an unusually large number of people for jury duty, citing the difficulty in finding an unbiased panel. Samour expects it to take until May or June before he can find 12 jurors and 12 alternates. Prosecutors will try to ensure jurors have no reservations about the death penalty while defense attorneys will look for those sympathetic to mental illness and uneasy with the idea of executing a person. On trial: James Holmes is accused of shooting dead 12 moviegoers and injuring 70 others in July 2012 . WHAT JURY LIFE WILL BE LIKE: Jurors won't be sequestered — isolated in a hotel — but will be allowed to go home every night. Samour will tell them they may not discuss the case with anyone, do any independent research on it, or watch, read or listen to news reports about it. Their names won't be made public, and Samour has forbidden news organizations from taking their photos. THREE PHASES IN JURY SELECTION . Source: The Denver Channel . Selection begins: As 9,000 prospective jurors are whittled down to just 24, the men and women will be warned starting Tuesday of the graphic police photos and other evidence they might be subjected to over the course of the trial . Holmes' sanity was evaluated by a state psychiatrist but the results were not made public. Prosecutors objected to the findings and persuaded a judge to order a second evaluation. Those results were contested by the defense. Prosecutors previously rejected at least one proposed plea deal made by attorneys for Holmes, criticizing the lawyers for publicizing the offer and calling it a ploy to draw the public and judge into what should be private plea negotiations. Survivors of the attack and family members of victims have had a long time to get ready for a trial. 'We've all been to therapists and have talked to our families and have our support groups, so we're prepared,' said Marcus Weaver, who was shot in the arm and whose friend, Rebecca Wingo, died in the attack. 'It's gonna be quite the journey.' It could take until June to find 12 jurors and 12 alternates who were not biased by widespread news coverage of the shooting. Insane? Jurors will have to decide both whether Holmes is guilty and if he's sane enough to answer for the crimes . Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado . Jurors will see the majority of the gruesome photographs and video taken at the crime scene, but a handful of images will be barred, the judge overseeing the case ruled on Tuesday. Defense lawyers had argued the photos could prejudice the jury against Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. But prosecutors countered that they were necessary to make their case against the California native, and Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour rejected most of the defense's motion in his ruling, saying images which depict the aftermath of crimes charges are allowed. 'That many of the photographs will be difficult to view does not render them inadmissible,' Samour wrote, adding that the same logic applied to the disturbing video footage recorded inside the cinema following the rampage. Prosecutors have charged Holmes with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder, and have said they will seek the death penalty for the one-time neuroscience doctoral candidate if he is convicted. The judge said he was 'disinclined' to allow into evidence one photo showing a disemboweled woman, if the prosecution could provide a less graphic version. Images of a bloody emergency room where victims were treated are likewise inadmissible, Samour ruled, because their value is 'substantially outweighed by the danger for unfair prejudice.' Victims: Six-year-old Veronica Moser, left, and 18-year-old AJ Boik, right, a popular musician and art student, were among the 12 people who lost their lives in the shooting last July . Photos and video taken inside Holmes' car that show a skull-shaped gearshift, and which the defense wanted barred, will be allowed because they depict part of the crime scene, he said, but prosecutors cannot tell the jury the defendant's choice of gearshift reflects any criminal intent. Samour did agree with defense lawyers who asked that a photo showing an undisclosed poster on the refrigerator in Holmes' apartment be cropped or blurred, saying the poster could offend some jurors. Jury summonses were sent to 9,000 county residents this month, and jury selection is set to begin in January. Samour has told lawyers from both sides to prepare to make their opening statements in late May or early June. Last week, Holmes' parents broke their silence over the killings, saying their son is mentally ill, 'not a monster,' and should be spared the death penalty. Scene: Crosses, flowers and other mementos of the victims of the Aurora movie theater shooting are shown  with the movie theater in the background . Ready to fight: Arapahoe County, Colorado District Attorney George Brauchler, left, walks with an unidentified man out of courtroom after a pre-trial readiness hearing . Equally challenging will be finding jurors who were not personally affected by the attack that sent waves of grief and anger through the Arapahoe County suburbs of Denver. Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. called nearly nine times as many prospective jurors as were summoned in the ongoing Boston marathon bombing trial. That meant the county's 600,000 residents had a nearly one-in-50 chance of being selected. Among those summoned were at least 13 people who were either witnesses to the attack or have family members who work in the prosecutor's office. They were quickly excused. Starting Tuesday, prospective jurors will report in groups of about 250 to fill out a long questionnaire that hasn't been made public. Those who aren't excluded because of their answers will be called back for individual questioning. Potential jurors won't be allowed to read or talk about the case until they know they've been dismissed. That will be difficult in the era of social media, since they have no control over what pops up on their Facebook or Twitter feeds. The final panel won't be sequestered. During the selection process, Holmes' attorneys will focus on picking jurors who are morally opposed to capital punishment, even as prosecutors fight to ensure those on the panel are 'death-penalty eligible,' meaning they would be open to executing Holmes. 'It is really stacked against the defense,' said Joseph Rice, managing partner of the Jury Research Institute, a California-based trial consulting firm. 'Here, you have a horrific crime occurring in a public setting where you think people would be safe. ... Because of the heinous nature of the crime and the number of victims, I can see people who would say, 'In most instances I could not support the death penalty, and in this case, I can.'' Enduring the trial from the jury box would seem more difficult than the selection process. 'This is going to be a life-changing event for every juror who sits on the trial,' Rice said. 'They are going to deal with life-and-death issues that will forever be part of their experience.'

"A British people-trafficker hid an Afghan couple and their four-month-old baby in the boot of his car for five hours as he tried to smuggle them through the Channel Tunnel. Dwight Johnson, 52, who lives in London but was born in Jamaica admitted giving the baby a sedative to silence it as he tried to pass through customs. Johnson locked the family in his boot in Paris before driving to Coquelles, Calais, where he was stopped by border police and arrested. A British people-trafficker hid an Afghan couple and their four-month-old baby in the boot of his car for five hours as he tried to smuggle them into Britain, but was caught near Calais (file picture) A court in Boulogne, northern France, heard  how Johnson had been paid £2,000 to sneak the family across the border and into Britain. He claimed the migrants had climbed into his car a few miles from the shuttle terminal on January 11, but in reality they had clambered into the boot in the French capital. 'You had no regard for the safety of the family, and your actions put their lives at risk,' a magistrate told Johnson at the hearing on Friday. He was jailed for 10 months and banned from returning to the region for three years after his release. Migrants are taking increasingly dangerous risks to try to cross the channel in their attempts to start new lives in the UK. Earlier this month, 17 migrants were found trying to reach Britain hidden in a cargo of talcum powder. Migrants are making increasingly dangerous attempts to get into Britain, including trying to board moving ferries and clinging to the axles of HGVs . In December, 16 migrants were found in Calais hiding aboard a lorry-load of Christmas trees bound for Britain. Last year, two migrants were plucked to safety from the sea after trying to climb aboard a moving ferry off Calais. The desperate refugees had swam almost half a mile from shore in a bid to clamber onto the vast 180m-long vessel heading to Dover. Migrants have also risked their lives by smuggling themselves into refrigerated lorries, clinging to the axles of HGVs and even aboard a cargo of coffins. There are currently an estimated 2,500 migrants massed on the northern French coast hoping for a route across the channel.","Afghan couple paid British trafficker £2,000 to smuggle them into Britain .

"'Steady, loving confrontation.' Those were the first words Lynda Blackmon Lowery says she heard from the mouth of Martin Luther King, Jr. 'And those three words changed my life,' said Lowery, who at 15 was the youngest person to join King for the 1965 march from the Alabama cities of Selma to Montgomery, demanding voting rights for African-Americans. On Sunday in New York, the now 64-year-old mother and grandmother showed the scar she still bears on the back of her head from a brutal beating at the hands of an Alabama state trooper during an earlier march when she was 14. Scroll down for video . Sharing history: Lynda Blackmon Lowery speaks during a pre-Martin Luther King Day appearance at the New York Historical Society, Sunday in New York . It took 28 stitches to close the gash, and seven more for a cut above her right eye. Lowery spoke at the New-York Historical Society on the eve of Monday's federal holiday marking King's birthday. The audience represented all races and ages, including children who sidled up to her for photos, peppering her with questions like, faced with the brutality, 'Why didn't you fight back?' She explained that they would have been killed if they did — unarmed, confronting 'a sea of white men on foot and horseback,' armed with rifles, bayonets, billy clubs and fierce dogs, plus tear gas. 'It was terrifying,' she said. A month earlier, activist Jimmie Lee Jackson was beaten and shot by a state trooper. His death inspired three marches from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery. On Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law. By the time she was 15, Lowery had been jailed nine times. White officers used clubs and tear gas on March 7, 1965 — 'Bloody Sunday' — to rout marchers intent on walking some 50 miles to Montgomery, the Alabama capital, to seek the right for blacks to register to vote. King led a new march later that month that reached Montgomery, with the crowd swelling to 25,000. Four months after the historic march President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

During the earlier march, authorities ordered several hundred marchers to stop at a bridge outside Selma. And when they quietly kept walking, the authorities viciously attacked. 'I just couldn't watch it,' said Lowery. After that day, she said she had to fight her fear to join the bigger march 'because I was sure they would kill me.'

"The mother of a teenage girl who took her own life after naked pictures were shared online has written a heartbreaking letter to the boys who destroyed her daughter's life. Leah Parsons' daughter Rehtaeh was 15 when a teenage boy posed for a photograph in November 2011 while having sex with the naked youngster as she vomited out of a window. After the image was shared among her friends, Ms Parsons, who has just 15 when the image was taken, took her own life. Rehtaeh Parson, pictured, died on April 7, 2013, three days after she tried to take her own life at her home . Both of the boys involved in the case, pictured, cannot be named due to Canadian child protection laws . Ms Parsons, from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia in Canada, took her own life in April 2013. She was kept on life support for three days until she died on April 7, 2013. The two boys who were responsible for distributing the images are not allowed to be named because of Canadian child protection laws. Mrs Parsons wrote the letter as part of a victim impact statement when one of the boys who was 16 at the time of the incident was sentenced to 12 months' probation for distributing child pornography. The other boy involved received a conditional discharge. Mrs Parsons said: 'The photo set into motion a series of emotional turmoil. She was 15 years old when that photo started circulating; the cruelty she received would have been too much for an adult to endure, let alone a child. Leah Parsons, pictured, wrote a highly emotional victim impact statement about her daughter Rehtaeh . Mrs Parson, pictured with husband, Glen accused the two boys of viewing Rehtaeh as a victim . 'Her words continue to haunt me: ""Mom, I’m too young to have all these emotions, I just want my friends and my life back."" ""Mom, I feel like I am waking each day into a nightmare."" While trying to get her the help she required, I lost my daughter. She was never the same person again but she kept trying. She tried to defend herself constantly.' She continued: 'I know that Rehtaeh did nothing to deserve that type of treatment. I know she was not cruel or mean to you [name removed]. You probably knew nothing about her whatsoever. Did you know she loved to read, would drop everything to help an animal or friend in need? That she was bright and funny? Did you know she had two little sisters that she adored? Did you know that the day she was born she changed my life for the better? After she was born I spent the next seven years in university and she was my driving force. No, you would not know these things because you never took the time to view her as a person.' Mrs Parsons accused the man of viewing her daughter as an object claiming that not only her family had suffered a huge loss but so did society in general. She added: 'A spotlight has been cast on the distribution of photos without consent and my only hope is that others will continue to learn from our tragedy.' I want to read an excerpt that Rehtaeh wrote in her high school journal just two months before the night in November 2011. I struggled and spent time contemplating whether to go ahead and write another victim impact statement. Every time I thought of writing one the thought would follow with ""Why bother? What I say will have no impact on him or how he thinks moving forward in life."" Then came the realization that I was looking at this statement all wrong. I don’t have to speak to change your view, values and perspectives at all. That’s where I was stuck. I was stuck with wanting you to feel pain, remorse, regret. What a huge additional burden to carry because how could I possibly achieve that goal? I cannot. I also cannot feel defeated by succumbing to silence. No, that would be a shame for everyone who has been helped, everyone who found their voice and made changes in their community because Rehtaeh’s voice came forward. Her voice was not heard while she struggled to be heard, but it sure is now. Every day, I wake to a huge emotional void of love that I once called Rehtaeh. I promised Rehtaeh the first day I met her that I would protect her and nourish her life in every way possible. I did not foresee that I would have to shield her from such cruelty that she endured before she left this world. I was unable to console her as she crumbled emotionally after that photo was taken and circulated. People often say ""How can someone’s life come crumbling down due to a photo?"" I’m here to say that is exactly what happened. I watched every moment of the tower crumble. Rehtaeh’s tower of strength and the vibrance of a young person on the verge of embarking on her journey into adulthood. While nothing exists in isolation, the photo set into motion a series of emotional turmoil. She was 15 years old when that photo started circulating; the cruelty she received would have been too much for an adult to endure, let alone a child. Her words continue to haunt me: ""Mom, I’m too young to have all these emotions, I just want my friends and my life back."" ""Mom, I feel like I am waking each day into a nightmare."" While trying to get her the help she required, I lost my daughter. She was never the same person again but she kept trying. She tried to defend herself constantly. In all honesty, I was crumbling right alongside of her, seeking some sort of resolve to move forward. She never understood how someone could be so cruel. What could she have possibly done so wrong for someone to share that photo with others? She could not comprehend that and neither could I. What would be the motive other than to harm Rehtaeh on a very deep level by ruining her reputation? A community she once bragged about became one that she feared. Fear of being ridiculed. You may say she was too sensitive, but, you see, that was always her strength. Rehtaeh’s strength was always that she CARED deeply and in the end her loving nature became engulfed in a tunnel of self-doubt and lack of worth. I know that Rehtaeh did nothing to deserve that type of treatment. I know she was not cruel or mean to you [name removed]. You probably knew nothing about her whatsoever. Did you know she loved to read, would drop everything to help an animal or friend in need? That she was bright and funny? Did you know she had two little sisters that she adored? Did you know that the day she was born she changed my life for the better? After she was born I spent the next seven years in university and she was my driving force. No, you would not know these things because you never took the time to view her as a person. That night Rehtaeh was viewed as an object, and instead of helping her you posed for a photo and shared it with others. She didn't get to see any of those goals listed and she never will. I’m not going to go on about all the struggles I now have to endure just to make it through the day. I will say that I always believed Rehtaeh would make an imprint on this world. I just never imagined it would be at such a young age and it would cost her her life. Our family lost a huge part of us but so did society in general, and in our loss we gained insight, wisdom and direction. A spotlight has been cast on the distribution of photos without consent and my only hope is that others will continue to learn from our tragedy. I want to read an excerpt that Rehtaeh wrote in her high school journal just two months before the night in November 2011.

"The family of the Sydney hairdresser who was allegedly stabbed to death by her ex-husband plan to take her body back to her homeland of Iran to be laid to rest. Leila Alavi had reportedly agreed to meet Mokthar Hosseiniamrae on Saturday when she was discovered dead inside her car at a car park at Auburn Shopping Village in Sydney's west. Allegedly killed with a pair of scissors, Hosseiniamrae, 33, who Ms Alavi had taken out an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against, has been charged with murder. The 26 year-old's devastated parents were expected to fly to Sydney this week to transport their daughter's body home to the country she left as a refugee in 2011 to move to Australia for a better life. Scroll down for video . Leila Alavi (right) had reportedly applied for an apprehended violence order against her husband Mokthar Hosseiniamraei (left) Ms Alavi had moved to Australia from Iran and was studying hairdressing at Granville TAFE . Ms Alavi's brother-in-law, Fred Poliena, said her parents, who were in extreme shock about their daughter's horrific death, plan to hold her funeral in Iran. 'Her parents were the most important thing in her life,' he told The Daily Telegraph. 'I think it's better for her parents so they can be close to her while they suffer through this tragedy.' Ms Alavi had reportedly lived in fear at a women’s refuge before she was killed and had taken out an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order against her estranged husband after years of turmoil. This comes as startling figures reveal that almost half of all apprehended violence orders were breached in NSW in the 12 months previous to September last year. Of the 26,491 orders issued as many as 11,788 were breached, the newspaper reported. Police painted a picture of a history of domestic violence inflicted on Ms Alavi as her ex, Mokthar Hosseiniamrae, stood accused of murder during a hearing at Parramatta Local Court on Sunday. 'It is alleged that the accused has physically assaulted his wife in the past, with incidents not reported,' police said while arguing he should be denied bail. Police allege Hosseiniamraei stabbed Ms Alavi in an underground carpark at Auburn Shopping Village in Sydney's west on Saturday shortly after she went to talk to him. One of Ms Alavi's friends at her workplace, Benjamin Hair Studio, revealed it was not unusual for Ms Alavi to meet her ex Mokthar Hosseiniamraei. ‘I’ve seen him over 10,000 times,’ Meneske Cinar told the Daily Telegraph. He was arrested shortly before 7pm at a property on James Street in Guildford West after the death of the apprentice hairdresser and is due to appear at Burwood Local Court on April 1. Her body was found by a distressed colleague inside her Holden Astra shortly after 10am with initial examination suggesting Ms Alavi had suffered a knife wound to the throat. Hosseiniamraei was taken to Auburn Police Station for questioning and was charged with murder and breaching an AVO early on Sunday morning. Apprentice hairdresser Leila Alavi was working when she reportedly received a phone call and left the salon . Shortly before 10am on Saturday, Flemington police were called to the Auburn shopping centre in Sydney where  Ms Alavi was found stabbed inside a vehicle . Court documents opposing Hosseiniamraei’s bail depicted a turbulent relationship between the pair who reportedly married in 2011 in Sydney. ‘The accused has shown a propensity for anger and being unable to control that anger,’ police alleged. A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia could not comment further on the incident as the homicide investigation is underway. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Alavi's distressed co-worker said she didn't know 'how or why this happened.' The former couple's wedding photographer told the Sydney Morning Herald Ms Alavi had been trying to help Hosseiniamraei despite a volatile relationship. 'She tried to manage the relationship and help him out because she did love him and really wanted him to get clean. She still cared for him at the end too,' Fredo Monty said. Mr Monty's photographs from their wedding show the pair happy and in love as the posed in front of Sydney's famous harbour. Her distressed colleague found Ms Alavi dead inside her Holden Astra shortly after 10am on Saturday . Ms Alavi left Iran as a refugee in 2011 and moved to  Australia for a better life . Ms Alavi had moved to Australia from Iran and was studying at Granville TAFE for her future. 'She couldn’t live in Iran and she came to Australia to live her life, to be a successful person but she’s dead right now,' sister Jacklin Poliena told Nine News. According to the Telegraph, cafe owner Zeynep Zabinoglu was one of the last to see Ms Alavi alive on Saturday. 'We both got here at 8am and parked our cars… I said good morning to her and she said good morning and then we both went to work,' she said. 'Then about an hour and a half later I heard the other girls who work there screaming. I called the police and told them to get here as fast as they can. 'It was too late,' she said. Mr Zabinoglu, who is a local barista in the area told 9News: 'It's such a shame. You can tell she wouldn't hurt a soul in her life. If you need anything she'll make sure she's there for you. 'It's really, really upsetting to lose somebody like that - a young person, such a young soul.' Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Alavi's distressed co-worker from Benjamin Hair Studio in Auburn said she didn't know 'how or why this happened' Police speak to distressed witnesses at the crime scene at the Auburn shopping centre .

"Steven Johnson, 53, of Colleyville, Texas, was showing his handgun to friends when it discharged and a bullet struck his 10-year-old daughter . A 10-year-old girl is recovering after her father accidentally shot her in the hand while showing his gun to friends in the family home. Steven Johnson, 53, of Colleyville, Texas, discharged the handgun just before midnight on Saturday, The Dallas Morning News reported. A bullet went through the wall and struck Johnson's daughter who was in another room, Colleyville city spokeswoman Mona Gandy said. The girl, who has not been named, was taken to Baylor Emergency Medical Center at Colleyville by her mother. She was later flown to Children's Medical Center of Dallas to be treated. The child has since been released from the hospital, NBC DFW reported. Police were called to the home after the incident and Johnson was arrested. Johnson was taken to the Keller Police Department Jail and faces charges of injury to a child. 'From the circumstances officers observed at the house, they felt like they had cause to make an arrest for injury to a child,' Gandy told The Dallas Morning News. Gandy could not say if there were other children at the couple's home in the Fort Worth, Texas suburb. The shooting comes just days after The Washington Post reported that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) has not conducted gun-control research since 1996 despite President Barack Obama ordering the organization to resume studies two years ago. Earlier in January, an off-duty Kentucky policeman accidentally shot himself after fumbling with his gun while in an elevator with his wife. On New Year's Day, a Californian man accidentally shot dead his girlfriend as he fired celebratory shots at their apartment complex.

"A Kansas woman was reunited with her class ring after losing it more than 20 years ago thanks to the help of a group of high school students. Rachel Robinson found a 1957 Colorado high school class ring in a playground when she was just a young girl, she told KDVR. Thinking it was a 'queen's ring', the young Robinson tucked the ring away in a special box. That was more than two decades ago. Reunited: Linda Flesher was reunited with her class ring (photographed) after losing it more than 20 years ago thanks to the help of a group of high school students . L.C.: The students searched for the owner of the ring under the initials L.C., as Flesher's maiden name was Crosslen . 1957: Flesher, (left and right) graduated from Lewis-Palmer High School in 1957, in a graduating class of 25 . Help: Teacher Tana Lucido (photographed) enlisted the help of her internet savvy high school students to search for the ring's owner . Robinson rediscovered the ring Jan. 12 in, what she called, her 'baby box,' according to KMBC. Now understanding the importance of a class ring, Robinson contacted the school, Lewis-Palmer High School in Colorado, and the search for the owner of the 1957 class ring began. A teacher at the high school, Tana Lucido, enlisted the help of her internet-savvy high school students to search for the ring's owner -- whose initials were 'L.C.,' according to KDVR. 'They found her in the yearbook and then they found her parents in the obituaries,' Robinson said. 'They found her married last name from that and then found her through Facebook.' KDVR reports that the group of teens used the internet, yearbooks, the yellow pages, and even census records to track down Linda Crosslen -- now Linda Flesher. 'A few months ago, one of my grandsons had gotten his class ring and I was going to get mine out to compare with his,' Flesher told KMBC. Young: Rachel Robinson (photographed) found the 1957 Colorado high school class ring in a playground when she was just a young girl . 25 Years: Flesher (left), who has since moved from Colorado to Kansas City, said she is glad to have the ring back after 25 years, although she doesn't know how it ended up in the Kansas playground . Flesher, who has since moved from Colorado to Kansas City, said she is glad to have the ring back after 25 years, although she doesn't know how it ended up in the Kansas playground. She said the return of the ring is like revisiting the past. 'It's kind of like we go back in time to the high school crushes and the fun of going to the games, Flesher said. Robinson told KMBC that she thought she'd be returning the ring to a a child or grandchild of Flesher, but to get to return it to the actual owner 'is great.'","Linda Flesher got her 1957 class ring back after a group of high school students tracked her down .

"A photographer who went into an abandoned house to take pictures of its antiques found almost $7,000 in bundles of cash - and was then able to reunite it with its rightful owners after tracking them down. The man only known as Dave, of Freaktography came across the derelict property in Ontaria, Canada after being tipped off by a friend and was desperate to go inside and capture images. After entering the property, he found a number of antiques and old family photos, as well as a yellow Home Hardware bag rolled up behind a mattress. The abandoned house in Ontario, Canada, where $7,000 had been hiding underneath mattress and was only discovered by a photographer . The first floor of the derelict property which was visited by photographer Dave  as part of his urban photography project . The $6,800 in tightly rolled bundles that was found in a yellow Home Hardware bag which was stuffed behind an old mattress . On opening the bag, the photographer found $6,800 in both Canadian and US dollars in tightly rolled bundles. But despite finding the cash, Dave was keen to track down its rightful owner rather than keep it himself and then eventually managed to reunite the money with a distant relative of the house's last owner. He explained: 'I hung my coat and got my bearings in the house, unpacked my gear and got ready to shoot a pic of the kitchen when something caught my eye at the corner of the mattress. 'Behind the mattress was a yellow Home Hardware bag - full of stuff. I became nervous and unsure of what I should do. 'But found behind the mattress was nearly $6,800 in cash - old smelly US and Canadian money, tightly rolled. 'Most of it was bundled up in little elastics marked in pencil with dates and amounts throughout the mid 1960s to the 1970s.' Holes in the roof meant the inside of the property had started to decay after being exposed to all of the elements . The house had fallen into disrepair due to the owners becoming ill and then dying with nobody else able to look after the property's upkeep . The living room had been left to ruin and the dining room still had a bed in it, where one of the old residents slept while battling cancer . The abandoned kitchen which greeted the photographer when he first entered the derelict house, with pots and pans still in the sink and a mattress propped up against the wall . After learning that the house had fallen into disrepair due to the owners becoming ill and then dying, Dave and a friend tracked down a female relative of the owner. They eventually met the relative and handed over the cash. Dave said: 'I told her that I was an urban explorer and I am part of a community who finds abandoned houses and takes photos of them. 'I said I had recently photographed an abandoned house in and I believe it may have been her family home. 'I told her we didn't want to leave it there for some kid or vandal to find and to steal and we wanted to return this money to the family, where it belongs . 'Her demeanor changed, she was apprehensive and nervous and she needed to talk to her husband. Some of the old tins and food cans found in the kitchen, which appeared untouched since the owners had left the property . As well as finding cash, Dave also discovered a number of old notebooks, which were also passed on to the family member he tracked down . As well as finding the cash and other antiques, a selection of old pictures were also found having been stashed in the kitchen cupboards . 'Thirty minutes later she called back and asked me if we could meet that afternoon at the house. 'We gave her the money, every penny, she started to cry and overwhelmed by this random act of kindness, and by the emotions she felt at being back at this house. 'We didn't pry or ask about family history, we offered a few hugs and just took in the moment. We posed with her for a photo, at her request, and after many many thank you hugs we went on our way.' They later learned that the money was likely collected over decades by the woman's grandparents from a fruit stand they owned.

Their adorable two-year-old son, C.J. witnessed the nuptials . Bad luck: In 2013, Robinson was shot five times by a burglar. He underwent eight surgeries and spent several months in the hospital. In August 2014 he was found to have cancel and given months to live . Dying wish: Knowing that his time was limited, Robinson checked into MJHS Hospice, determined to marry the woman he once fell in love with in college - despite his fragile body and reliance on an oxygen tank . His doctors are giving him few more days but it didn't stop his bride from saying 'I do'. Robinson was determined to marry the woman who had already stayed by his side for better and worse. A city clerk brought the licensing paperwork to Robinson and the hospice staff got decorations, a cake and a musician.

"Poundland has teamed up with builder Tommy Walsh, pictured, to launch a range of DIY essentials . Poundland is making a new assault on Middle Briton by moving from Jane Asher cupcake tins to hammers and nails. The budget chain has signed a partnership with TV building expert Tommy Walsh to launch a DIY range with all items costing just £1. The company is keen to challenge the DIY warehouses like Homebase and B&Q which have been forced to announce the closure of some outlets amid changing lifestyles and shopping habits. The DIY specialists claim the closures reflect the fact that people don’t have the skills, time or interest in doing their own house maintenance and make-overs. However, Poundland believes there is a need for some DIY essentials in the high street, where there are relatively few specialist stores offering these products. Ironically, decorating products, nuts and bolts used to be sold by Woolworths before the chain went bust, leaving empty stores which have subsequently been taken over by Poundland. At one time, the chain was shunned by middle and upper income families who fought to keep the stores out of their high streets, however the pound stores are now at the heart of many communities. Poundland has won new customers with baking equipment under the brand of celebrity cake maker Jane Asher, while a new range of beauty products, such as lipstick and mascara, was praised in the fashion press. Now it is making an assault on the DIY market with a range of essential tools and packs of screws and nails for £1 each. A spokesman said: ‘The 200-strong ‘DIY:Time’ range, which includes decoration and preparation essentials as well as tools, fixtures, fittings and adhesives. It will be aimed at anyone, novice or professional, looking to complete everyday DIY projects.’ It will not reveal the specific products until the range is launched into stores in March. Poundland has won new customers with baking equipment under the brand of celebrity cake maker Jane Asher - and now believes there is need for DIY essentials in the high street . Tommy Walsh, who is best known for his work on the BBC series Ground Force, said: ‘I’m a great believer in value for money. I was raised with the view that if you look after the pennies, the pounds will look after themselves. ‘I’ve been working with Poundland for over a year now, developing and testing the ‘DIY: Time’ range to produce good quality products at the lowest possible price of just £1. It is a great opportunity to make DIY more affordable to everyone.’ Poundland chief executive, Jim McCarthy, said: ‘We are delighted that someone with Tommy’s expertise and reputation in the DIY sector has chosen to work with us to create this high quality affordable range.’","Company is keen to challenge the DIY warehouses like Homebase and B&Q .

"A British charity worker has been trapped in Africa since November after claiming to have fallen victim to a conman. Des Cordery, 65, had travelled to Gambia where he had been visiting the grave of his late partner, who had died there in 2010 following a battle with cancer. Mr Cordery had also been checking on the progress of a charity venture he set up with a local businessman and hotelier during a previous visit in August. Des Cordery, 65, had travelled to Gambia in November where he had been visiting the grave of his late partner, who had died there in 2010 following a battle with cancer . However, when he returned to the country three months later, he claimed that nothing had been done on the project. Mr Cordery says he immediately pulled out of the project, but the hotelier called police and the British pensioner became caught up in a legal wrangle which ended with police confiscating his passport. The incident comes more than four years after his partner of eight years, Veronique McPake, went to the West African nation in 2010 to die following a lengthy battle with thyroid cancer. He said: ‘Veronique had been struggling with thyroid cancer for a while, and had always loved Gambia. ‘She didn't want to be a burden on her family, so when the time was near she went to the place closest to her heart. She was only 52.’ When Mr Cordery returned over the summer he said he witnessed the lack of resources for those with learning disabilities, and decided to set up a charity to help. Mr Cordery had also been checking on the progress of a charity venture he set up with a local businessman and hotelier in Gambia during a previous visit to the West African nation in August . The grandfather-of-three, who lives in Kent and who has volunteered and worked for mental health charity Mencap, was befriended by a hotel owner and businessman. According to Mr Cordery, the pair planned to build a day centre to help locals with learning disabilities in honour of his dead partner, and that he donated a sum of money to get the project off the ground. He named it the McPake Educational Foundation. But when he returned to the country in November to visit Veronique's grave and check progress on the foundation, he claimed that nothing had been done on the project. Instead he claims that his business partner has spent his money renovating his hotel. He was arrested thrown in a  cell after his partner allegedly called police when he pulled out of the deal. He was unable to pay bail set by the local court, so his passport has been confiscated and he cannot get it back until he wins the case or stumps up 257,000 Gambian Dalasi (£4,000). The retired schoolteacher added: ‘My charity partner basically turned round and tried suing me for loss of earnings because of the time he spent working on the project while I was in England.’ Mr Cordery, who has three grown-up children from a previous relationship, said: ‘I came out here to give some money to help set up a centre of people with learning difficulties and make the centre accessible for people in wheelchairs. Mr Cordery says he planned to build a day centre to help locals with learning disabilities in honour of his dead partner and  donated a sum of money to get the project off the ground . ‘I think I have had a good life and it's time to give something back. I donated £800 to a police run local disabled school. ‘The directors of that school put me in contact with a local businessman who they said had been trying to open up a handicap school. ‘But it seems they have just spent the money on painting and decorating to make the hotel look good for resale. I believed him - I thought he was genuine all the way. ‘I don't want to pay this guy the money, partly because I can't afford to, and also because I want the money I can afford to spend to go to helping the needy, not lining the pockets of the greedy.’ So far seven hearings have been postponed at Kanifing Magistrates' Court in Serekunda. Mr Cordery's brother Andrew, 67, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, said: ‘It's a bit of a pain for him. 'It's not clear what's going on and it's very unfortunate that he's got into this mess for his good intentions.’ The 65-year-old volunteered at East Kent Mencap, in Margate, for three years until he was employed as a case worker two years ago. Alison Fengas, HR manager of East Kent Mencap, said: ‘His work with us involves dealing with people with learning difficulties in this country and he hoped to use his experience to help others in Gambia. ‘We all wish him well and we hope it's resolved as soon as possible.’ A spokesman for the British Embassy in Gambia said: ‘We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Gambia. We are providing consular assistance.’ But the embassy was unable to divulge further information on an ongoing civil matter, the spokesman said. Mr Cordery will next appear before magistrates on Tuesday, but expects it may be months before he is free to return to Britain.","Des Cordery, 65, had passport confiscated by Gambian police in November .

"He may have be linked to Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, but Freddie Fox has suggested that he could be bisexual. The actor, who reportedly enjoyed two dates with Cressida in the space of a week, opened up about his love life in an interview with The Telegraph. The 26-year-old Cucumber star said: 'I’ve had girlfriends, but I wouldn’t wish to say ""I am this or I am that"", because at some time in my life I might fall in love with a man. British actor Freddie Fox was recently linked to Prince Harry's ex, Cressida Bonas, but has now suggested that he could be bisexual and says the 'appreciation of both sexes is nothing new' 'I hope that I am the type of person who would fall in love with another person, as opposed to a sex. Most of my life to date has been as a straight man, but who knows what will happen next?' Freddie, the son Edward Fox, star of classic 1973 film The Day Of The Jackal and actress Joanna David, spoke openly about sexuality and the misconceptions often associated with it. He continued: 'Appreciation of both sexes is actually not new; it’s incredibly old, it’s Roman, it’s Greek, and it is something people can do throughout an entire lifetime, having hugely meaningful relationships, no matter what sex they are.' Freddie, the brother of Silent Witness actress Emilia Fox, and Cressida were romantically linked after making their first public appearance together at a West End screening of Tim Burton’s movie Big Eyes earlier this month. A few days later, they were spotted at celebrity hotspot Chateat Marmont in Los Angeles. Cressida Bonas and Freddie Fox attend a BAFTA Special Screening of Big Eyes hosted by Harvey Weinstein in early January, where a guest revealed the pair were 'very close and affectionate' ‘Freddie and Cressida were very close and affectionate,’ a guest at the London screening told The Mail on Sunday at the time. ‘They spent half an hour deep in conversation in a corner by the bar. When the film started, they had to sit separately because there weren’t any seats together and they both looked very disappointed.’ The event also proved a valuable networking opportunity for 25-year-old Cressida, who was introduced by Freddie to veteran actor Charles Dance. She got on so well with the White Mischief star that when the film finished, Dance, 68, was seen embracing her warmly. Freddie has quite the thespian family. He is the the son Edward Fox, star of classic 1973 film The Day Of The Jackal, left, and actress Joanna David . Later in the week, Freddie and Cressida jetted off to the United States, and enjoyed an evening at Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. Miss Bonas, who dated Prince Harry for two years until last spring, is getting set to star alongside model Cara Delevingne as well as Oscar-winners Dame Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz in Tulip Fever, but acclaimed film producer Harvey Weinstein has singled her out as one to watch. He said: ‘Cressida is great and people will see what a fantastic actress she is. It will be the first of many roles for her.’ He praised her for not trying to use her fame to secure roles, saying: ‘She is not taking advantage of any media profile.’ However, friends of Miss Bonas have denied the pair are romantically linked. Freddie, meanwhile, dated actress Tamzin Merchant for two years. The pair decided to call time on their relationship in September 2013 with a source telling the Mail On Sunday at the time: 'Sadly their relationship has fizzled out. Freddie is so focused on his acting and is considering a move to America.' Freddie has had an illustrious acting career for someone so young and made headlines when he starred as the president of the Bullingdon Club - an Oxford University club notorious for loutish behaviour. He starred alongside his good friends Douglas Booth and Sam Claflin. Freddie dated actress Tamzin Merchant for two years.

"Mike Huckabee has played down his insults of Beyonce and Jay Z as 'X-rated trash', insisting he believes 'she is an amazing talent'. In his new memoirs, the potential Republican presidential contender slams the married hip-hop duo for their explicit lyrics - and brand President Barack Obama irresponsible for letting his daughters listen to their music. 'How can it be that the Obamas let Sasha and Malia listen to that trash?' the onetime Arkansas governor-turned-Fox News host asks. 'Apparently they do.' 'Jay Z is a very shrewd businessman,' Huckabee adds, 'but I wonder: Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?' The exact revealed on January 9 sparked uproar. On Sunday, the former Baptist minister back-pedaled, insisting 'you have to read the whole chapter'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . BACKPEDALING: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (left) insists his new book that slams hip-hop duo Jay Z and Beyonce (right) as 'X-rated' and 'trash' needs to be read 'in context' and really, he is looking out for the diva . He told Fox News: 'You know, if people read the full chapter, it's in the context of, first of all, saying, ""Beyoncé is a wonderful talent."" 'My point is, she doesn't have to do some of the things that she does in the lyrics because it's not necessary. She has nothing to make up for. She's an amazing talent.' In his book, Huckabee writes: 'Beyonce... has an exceptional set of pipes and can actually sing. She is a terrific dancer – without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom.' But that's where the love-fest ends in the book God, Guns, Grits and Gravy. The book hits shelves on January 20 and is seen as a vehicle for Huckabee to take a second bite at the presidential campaign apple in 2016. He last ran in 2008, winning the Iowa caucuses and five Super Tuesday primaries before conceding the Republican nomination to Arizona Sen. John McCain. Huckabee's weekend Fox News show has positioned him as a conservative culture warrior who may find it difficult to attract an audience in an increasingly secular America. And nowhere in his book is the culture war between the coasts and 'flyover country' more present than in his backhand dismissals of Jay Z and Beyonce. The music video for 'Drunk in Love,' the song Huckabee criticizes in his book, includes explicit lyrics and images of a sultry Beyonce strutting on a beach . 'FROM HUSBAND TO PIMP': Jay Z makes an appearance in the 'Drunk in Love' video, rapping 'Slip the panties right to the side / Ain't got the time to take drawers off' as his wife dances seductively . The pair headlined the 2014 Grammy Awards, opening the broadcast with a performance of their hit 'Drunk in Love.' Huckabee calls it a 'song' – air quotes included. 'Beyonce must have been confused,' he writes, 'when she agreed to humiliate herself by performing in a way that prompted this comment from author Charlotte Hays (whose book When Did 'White Trash Become the New Normal?' says it all): 'Honestly, I didn't want to watch Jay Z and Beyonce's foreplay'.' 'The song contains words and imagery so graphic that they would never make it through the editing process of this book. (Not that I would want them to!) 'But the onstage gyrations, bare flesh, and (most of) the lyrics did make it onto CBS, again during the smoldering remnants of what used to be the 'family hour'.' Huckabee's latest culture-war book hits shelves on January 20 . Beyonce's rap lyrics in Drunk in Love include 'I get filthy when that liquor get into me.' Her husband enters the song halfway through, intoning about 'foreplay in the foyer / f***ed up my Warhol.' 'Slip the panties right to the side,' Jay Z continues in the wildly popular track. 'Ain't got the time to take drawers off.' The song's video has been played a stunning 245 million times on YouTube, treating viewers to repeated shots of Beyonce gyrating in a swimsuit and swapping lines with Jay Z about their sex life. Beyonce, Huckabee reflects, 'was a huge, breakout star before going X-rated. She proved she doesn't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar.' 'She must know that millions of young girls look up to her as a role model to emulate. And she even has a daughter herself now. So why has she done this?' First lady Michelle Obama is a close Beyonce friend, taking Sasha, her younger daughter, to a concert in July. The singer serenaded the first couple as they danced at their first inaugural ball, and performed America's national anthem at President Barack Obama's second inauguration. She later admitted she had lip-synched the patriotic song. But Beyonce has been to the White House numerous times with Jay Z and remains close to the Obamas. She was the star attraction at the first lady's 50th birthday party a year ago, and the A-listers hosted a fundraiser for the president in 2012. In a December 2013 People Magazine interview, the president said that both of his daughters have 'gotten to know Beyonce, and she has always been very sweet to them.' 'THAT TRASH': Beyonce performed onstage at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum in Inglewood, California . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was a force to be reckoned with in 2008, winning the Iowa Caucuses and five Super Tuesday primaries before conceding the GOP presidential nomination to Sen. John McCain . He told Glamour magazine in a softball 2012 interview that he and the first lady 'don't constrain' the music elder daughter Malia listens to. 'We expect her to show some good judgment.' 'We actually share tastes in hip-hop and rap music,' the president added, 'but we don't listen to it together, because some of the language in there would embarrass me – at least while I'm listening to it with her.' 'Folks like Jay Z, Nas, we both like them, but when it comes on and I'm sitting with her and Sasha, then I fast-forward because it would make me blush.' Huckabee pounces. 'Oh. I see. The important thing is for him not to be embarrassed,' he snarks in the book. 'It's no small wonder why the culture has become so crude when fathers and mothers allow and even encourage their children to devour vulgar, misogynistic, and violent material when it's performed by 'cool' people like Jay Z and Beyonce.' 'With the first lady so concerned about making sure her daughters' bellies don't ingest unhealthy food, how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics? If lived out, those lyrics would be far more devastating to someone's health than a cupcake.' RAP FAN? An image apparently showing Malia Obama, 16, wearing a t-shirt for hip hop collective Pro Era was shared on Instagram by the group, which claimed a 'mutual friend' gave them the image . SULTRY: Huckabee writes that Beyonce 'doesn't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar' Beyonce is close to the first family, performing at inaugurations and headlining Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party in January 2014 . Malia attracted attention this month when the hip-hop collective Pro Era posted a photo on Instagram in which she appeared to be wearing a $40 t-shirt emblazoned with their logo. The first daughter's picture was shared online just days after one of Pro Era's founding members was arrested for breaking a security guard's nose at a concert in Australia. The White House is investigating how the photo of the elder Obama daughter found its way to the group. Huckabee signed off from his eponymous Fox news show on January 3, announcing that it would be the last episode. He is expected to make a final decision about whether or not to join the presidential race in the coming months. His first stop will be in the state where he first cruised to victory eight years ago: Huckabee is scheduled to speak at the Iowa Freedom Summit on January 23. 'God, Guns, Grits and Gravy' also includes a chapter about the indignities of airport searches at the hands of the Transportation Security Administration – titled 'Bend Over and Take it Like a Prisoner!' 'Where else would I be ordered to stand still, put up my hands, and have my personal belongings taken and searched without a warrant or probable cause?' he asks, referring to his frequent commercial airline flights. 'After years of this indignity, much of the flying public thinks little of it, and they usually don't complain. They just dutifully stand there, bend over, and take it like a prisoner.'","Baptist-minister-turned Fox News host slams the hip hop duo as 'trash'

"Survivors: Donna Lawrence has overcome her fear of dogs following a vicious attack by a pitbull thanks to her pet Susie . A pregnant woman who miscarried after a savage dog attack  has overcome  her fear  with the help of a puppy who suffered abuse at the hands of its last owners. Doctors said Donna Lawrence was lucky to be alive after the vicious mauling by a pitbull left her requiring 45 stitches. With her leg ripped open to the bone, it would be another two months before she could walk after the attack in 2008. The animal lover was left with a fear of dogs and even after her physical wounds had healed she said she suffered nightmares and struggled to cope emotionally. But that all changed when she met young mutt Susie- who had a tragic tale all of her own. In August 2009, the dog survived unspeakable animal abuse when her former owners set her on fire and left for dead in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was picked up ten days later by Guilford County Animal Shelter who began treating her for third-degree burns to 60 per cent of her body, a broken jaw and missing teeth. On her blog, Donna wrote she had recognised a fellow survivor in Susie. 'You can see Susie and I shared something in common: she was a pit bull mix that had been had been tortured by a human and I was viciously attacked by a pit bull just a few months before we met. 'I forgave the dog for my wrongful attack, and Susie forgave the human for hers.' Ms Lawrence was attacked in 2008 after she tried to help a neighbor's dog that she says was underfed and left chained up outside. She began feeding the animal every morning until the fateful day the dog attacked. 'I will never forget that day,' added Ms Lawrence. 'My life flashed before my eyes as I found myself on the ground in the angry animal's jaws. He clenched my right leg between his teeth, and I knew that he could overpower and kill me. I tried with all my might but I couldn't loosen his grip.' She grappled with the pitbull and was eventually able to escape to a neighbor's house where she collapsed. Bleeding profusely from her leg and hand, she was rushed to the emergency room where she had 45 stitches. Doctors found the bites had penetrated her leg and left the bone exposed. Susie had a tragic story of her own, having been set on fire and left for dead by her former owners . Donna, who does not blame the pitbull that attacked her, said she had recognised a fellow survivor in Susie . Mrs Lawrence added: 'The doctor told me I was lucky to be alive. He said that most people either do not survive or lose a limb to attacks like this. I thanked God for saving my life.' Despite the terrifying attack, Mrs Lawrence said she did not blame the dog. 'I blame the owners who turned their dog into what it was,' she added. 'Their neglect and abuse made their dog fearful and territorial.' Understandably, Mrs Lawrence, who had been a big dog lover, was left scared and suffering nightmares from the attack until she and husband Roy decided to adopt Susie a year later. The pooch has since become a trained therapy dog who works with  burn victims. Mrs Lawrence used her plight to highlight animal abuse  in North Carolina and in 2010, former Governor  Bev Perdue signed Susie's Law to bring in tougher penalties on animal cruelty. Their extraordinary stories were turned into a film, Susie's Hope in 2013 starring Emmanuelle Vaugier as Mrs Lawrence. Mrs Lawrence has since used Susie's story to successfully campaign for stricter penalties on animal cruelty in North Carolina .","Donna Lawrence survived a near-fatal attack by her neighbor's pit bull .

"Saying goodbye? The Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid has featured topless models for 45 years . They have been featured among the newspaper's pages for 45 years. But The Sun appears to have dropped its topless models - with no bare breasts featured on Page 3 since Friday's edition. Today's edition features 'Hollyoaks babes' Jennifer Metcalfe and Gemma Merna in bikinis on a beach - with their breasts mostly covered. And another story below it about an actress sacked from Coronation Street is headlined 'Platt's yer lot', which could be seen as a coded confirmation of the end of topless women on the page. The images of the models have long drawn protests from feminists and a petition calling for the abolition of the controversial feature has attracted more than 200,000 signatures. Now, it appears the call to end topless women on Page 3 may have been heard. Yesterday, The Sun showed model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley wearing a bra - but it is not clear whether the cover-up is permanent. The Guardian reported that the newspaper's management had made a 'landmark decision' to drop the pictures topless women, dubbed Page 3 girls. In addition, The Times reported that it understands last Friday's print edition 'was the last that will carry an image of a glamour model with bare breasts on that page'. The Sun's Irish edition stopped using topless models in 2013. Last year, Sun owner Rupert Murdoch asked his Twitter followers for their opinion on the issue last year. He wrote: 'Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes?' Scroll down for video . Topless photos: Among the most famous Page 3 models is Katie Price (pictured), formerly known as Jordan . Stars in the Sun: Ex-Page 3 models Kathy Lloyd (left) and Karen White (right), pictured in the late Nineties . Mr Murdoch, 83, went on: 'Brit feminists bang on forever about Page 3. I bet never buy paper. I think old fashioned but readers seem to disagree.' Last night, Sun spokesman Dylan Sharpe cryptically tweeted that Page 3 would remain 'in the same place it's always been - between page 2 and page 4'. A spokesman for the No More Page 3 campaign said: 'We're hearing the Sun may have dropped Page 3. This could be truly historic news and a great day for people power. 'We don't know the details for sure and there's still lots to be done, but this could be a huge step for challenging media sexism. 'And we are so incredibly grateful to all of you who stood up and said 'No More Page 3'.' The newspaper's editor has defended the controversial feature in the past, saying women readers fully support it. In 2013, David Dinsmore told BBC Radio 5 Live he was 'standing (his) ground' despite pressure from politicians, anti-sexism campaigners and student bodies. Former glamour models Linda Lusardi (left) and Sam Fox (right) also had their careers launched by Page 3 . Backlash: Former glamour model Jodie Marsh wrote a series of angry messages on Twitter . Page 3 girl Rhian Sugden, 28, also lashed out at the reported move when she took to Twitter today . He said: 'I think that it is a lively issue for people who don't buy the paper and we've done the research, done the focus groups and in many ways listened to the campaigners to say: 'What does it mean to our readers?' The result comes back a resounding ""keep it there, don't take it away"".' The No More Page 3 campaign group was founded in August 2012 by actress Lucy-Anne Holmes. It has support from a wide variety of groups such as Girlguiding UK, Mumsnet, several trade unions including Unison, the Scottish Parliament and Breast Cancer UK. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who also holds the women and equalities brief, said the move was 'long overdue'. The Tory cabinet minister said: 'This is a long overdue decision and marks a small but significant step towards improving media portrayal of women and girls. I very much hope it remains permanent.' It also received the backing of Liberal Democrat women's and equalities minister Jo Swinson - though she criticised the alternative content in today's edition. 'I am delighted that the old fashioned sexism of Page 3 could soon be a thing of the past. 'I welcome this apparent step forward from the Sun, but I would encourage its editors to consider whether parading women in bikinis is really a modern reflection of the contribution women make to society. 'We need to ensure that media representation of women reflects the great achievements that women make to business, to families and to society. I'd like to see us providing positive role models for young girls instead of suggesting that women's contribution is in how they look.' Girlguiding UK's Advocates panel  has today welcomed the move. They said: 'We are thrilled to hear that the Sun has decided to stop printing images of topless women on Page 3. This is a hugely positive step for girls and women and shows the difference we can all make when we speak out together. The No More Page 3 campaign group was founded in August 2012 by actress Lucy-Anne Holmes. Protesters said they wanted the feature to be 'removed voluntarily' rather than banned . Delight: A spokesman for the No More Page 3 campaign said on Twitter that it 'could be truly historic news' 'It is impossible for girls to nurture their ambitions if they are constantly told that they are not the same as their male equivalents. This is what Page 3 did. It was disrespectful and embarrassing. 'We would also like to congratulate Lucy-Anne Holmes for having the bravery to speak out about this issue and we join her in celebrating this great success.' Russell Hobby, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said: 'We are delighted by today's news that the campaign has finally been successful. 'School leaders understand the importance of protecting children and young people from inappropriate adult material, whether online, on television or within the pages of the popular press. 'Our members have told us about the problems the easy availability of pictures like these can cause. Children - especially very young children - can find such images confusing and embarrassing.' But former glamour model Jodie Marsh has led the backlash against the move, insisting on Twitter that 'telling girls they shouldn't do page 3 is not being a feminist'. In a series of tweets she said: 'So-called ""feminists"" really annoy me. Telling girls they shouldn't do page 3 is not being a feminist; women should do whatever they want.' Commenting on her career as a Page 3 pin-up, she said: 'I loved doing page 3, it was good money, I felt powerful, I was definitely in control and all the people (mostly women) I worked with were fab. 'I never felt exploited - in fact the opposite. I thought ""Blimey, people are willing to pay to see my boobs"". 'I am very much a feminist. I believe women can do it all and have it all. Women who slag off other women are just jealous and insecure. 'Women shouldn't be fighting to be equal to men. We are there already.' She said campaigners should focus on more important issues that affect women, such as female genital mutilation. Page 3 girl Rhian Sugden, 28, also lashed out at the reported move, saying: 'It's only a matter of time before everything we do will be dictated by comfy shoe-wearing, no bra-wearing, man-haters.' Cryptic: Sun spokesman Dylan Sharpe tweeted that Page 3 would remain 'in the same place it's always been' Sun owner: Last year, Rupert Murdoch said he found Page 3 'old-fashioned, but readers seem to disagree' In 2013, the media mogul also seemed to hint that he was in agreement that the idea was outdated . Former glamour model Nicola McLean said she did not think Page 3 is a 'sexual equality' issue. She told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'It has been going for many years, which is one of the reasons I feel so sad that it has seemingly come to an end. 'I don't think it is outdated. I think the girls still look fantastic on the page, they still clearly enjoy what they are doing, people still want to see it. 'Everybody still wants Page 3, apart from the feminists who are fighting an argument I just don't agree with. 'If you meet any Page 3 girl who has gone on to pose for the Sun, we are all very strong-minded women that have made our own choice and feel very happy with what we are doing. 'We certainly don't feel like we have been victimised.' The protesters said they wanted the feature to be 'removed voluntarily' rather than banned. Among those delighted at the potential news was comedian and Great British Bake Off presenter Sue Perkins, who tweeted: 'Goodbye Jugs - Hello Actual News! Congrats to No More Page 3 and all those who campaigned. Hurray!' No More Page 3 founder Lucy-Anne Holmes said last night that the group would not claim victory if scantily clad women continued to appear in the paper but it was a 'step in the right direction' if they were no longer topless. She told BBC2's Newsnight: 'I'm not going to stand here and say 'there's going to now be women in underwear on page three and isn't that great'. 'The Sun could have gone 'OK we are going to celebrate women's sport on page three because we never cover that and there are women doing great sport and we would like to use the space for that'. 'The Sun hasn't suddenly decided that women say, think and do interesting and incredible things, it's still basically saying women are here for decoration, but it's a step in the right direction.'","Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid has featured bare breasts for 45 years .

"Comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing sexual assault allegations from a string of women, was given a standing ovation by an audience in California at his latest show. The 77-year-old was welcomed by the audience at the Turlock Community Theatre and they rose to their feet at the end of show, which is part of his comedy tour. Only one protester showed up outside the venue in the central Californian city after Cosby began his tour in Denver, Colorado on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Comedian Bill Cosby was given a standing ovation after a performance in California as part of his comedy tour. He is pictured performing in Denver on Saturday . The single demonstator, Suzette Sims, 51, who came with a sign that read 'I Believe The Women', said: 'It's sad. I am very disappointed there aren't more people. 'But someone has to stand up so I came.' The comedian is facing sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women, with some of the claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his attorney and has never been charged with a crime. Cosby kicked off his tour at the weekend in Colorado, where he released a statement thanking his fans for their support since the allegations surfaced. He said: 'I have thousands of loyal, patient and courageous fans that are going to leave their homes to enjoy an evening of laughter and return home feeling wonderful.' However, the show in Denver attracted 100 people who chanted 'Rape is not a joke!' and 'No means no!' outside the theater. The comedian is facing sexual assault accusations from at least 15 women, with some of the claims dating back decades . Protesters had also interrupted a handful of his previous shows with hecklers standing up and chanting repeatedly 'we believe the women' at Cosby's third and final performance of a Canadian tour earlier this month. The protesters then marched out of the theatre as Cosby asked his audience not to react. More recently, a model who claims Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008 met with Los Angeles police on Wednesday to pursue criminal charges. The comedian's tour comes as NBC's top entertainment executive has said the door is firmly shut to Cosby's return to the network. Thirty years ago, Cosby was the sitcom king with NBC's 'The Cosby Show'. On Saturday, 100 protesters turned up at a theatre in Denver, where Cosby was performing, holding up signs and shouting 'Rape is no joke!' Protesters have also interrupted a handful of his previous shows with hecklers standing up and chanting repeatedly 'we believe the women' But on Friday, the network's Entertainment Chairman, Bob Greenblatt, confirmed the network would never do a project with Cosby again. Speaking with the Television Critics Association, Mr Greenblatt went on to explain: 'Fifteen women came out and accused him of what they accused him of. When that many people come out and have such similar complaints, it became a tainted situation.' The network said late last year it was dropping plans to develop a 'classic' family sitcom with Cosby.","Bill Cosby was performing at a California theatre as part of his comedy tour .

ABC closed the cinema on the 2nd of November, 1963 and was converted into a Bingo Club, which has operated periodically up until 2010.","Royalty Cinema in Harborne was designed by architect Horace G Bradley at height of Britain's love affair with films .

"An Irishman couldn't walk into a bar, so he tried to get in through the roof. It may sound like a bad joke but it turned into an expensive night out for an Irish tourist on the Gold Coast who ended up having to be cut out of the roof cavity. Hugh McMahon, 18, has been forced to pay $2600 in fines and damages after having to be freed from a roof near the Sin City night club in Surfers Paradise. Scroll down for video . Hugh McMahon, 18, got stuck in an air vent while trying to re-enter a nightclub he'd been thrown out of . McMahon was trying to get back into the club via the roof after being kicked out twice, the first time after he was spotted sleeping on a couch inside the popular night spot. The teenager, in Australia on a 12-month working holiday, broke into the roof space through a sliding door at the Promenade Apartments on Orchid Ave. He damaged the door's lock in his failed entry bid before becoming entangled in wires and stuck among the pipes and internal struts in the cavity. The teenager has been forced to pay $2600 in fines and damages after having to be freed from a roof near the Sin City night club in Surfers Paradise . During his botched entry McMahon also damaged plasterboard. He faced court charged with trespass, wilful damage and two counts of refusing to leave a licensed premises. Magistrate Ron Kilner failed to see the funny side to McMahon's antics, fining him $900 and ordering him to pay a total of $1700 in damages to the building owners and the Queensland Fire Service. 'Drunk or sober, it was an absolutely remarkably stupid thing to have done,' Mr Kilner said. 'You only have yourself to blame.' McMahon, who plans to return to Sydney on Thursday, has been given three months to pay his fine.","Hugh McMahon, 18, was kicked out of Sin City club in Surfers Paradise twice .

"Oluwaseun Adenubi, 30, allowed a British couple to register as her new baby's parents, pictured leaving Croydon Crown Court . A Nigerian mother allowed a British couple to register as her new baby's parents in bid to get free NHS care and secure a UK passport for the child, a court heard. Oluwaseun Adenubi, 30, also pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation after using the passport of her friend, Rita Ogunkunle, 32, to obtain free medical care after giving birth to Moses. Ogunkunle and her boyfriend Michael Adebambo, 46, registered the baby as theirs at Bromley Civic Centre the following day and have now pleaded guilty to giving false information. Staff at Farnborough's Princess Royal University Hospital realised the medical records of Ogunkunle, who had received acne treatment, conflicted with the patient claiming to be her. 'The probation service are there to report what they have been told and they say they don't believe a word of it and neither do I,' added the judge. Prosecutor Alexandra Bushell told the court: . Prosecutor Ms Alexandra Bushell told the court: 'Maybe there was a motivation to secure the nationality of the child as a British citizen and free NHS treatment. 'After the baby was born on June 20 staff realised something was not right because Ogunkunle has severe scarring, which the baby's mother did not have and there were two different blood types for the same patient.' Adenubi was granted a family visit visa which allowed her to stay in the UK for up to six months and claimed that she found Ogunkunle's passport on a bench, Croydon Crown Court heard. But when Ogunkunle was arrested in August, she claimed Adenubi took her passport after moving into her spare room. The couple have now fallen out with Adenubi over the conflicting claims about the passport. Ms Bushell said: 'She admitted falsely registering the birth of the baby and said she had been introduced to Adenubi by a friend of her mother's and took pity on her because she was pregnant and had no friends. 'She told police she was angry at Adenubi using her identity and tried to beat her to it by registering the child. Rita Ogunkunle (left) and her boyfriend Michael Adebambo (right), 46, registered the baby as theirs at Bromley Civic Centre . Judge John Tanzer said: 'The probation service think this is a Nigerian plot to use the 'International Health Service' and then take further advantage' '[Adebambo] said his girlfriend asked him to go to the register office to register a birth and said she told him she did not want another woman to use her identity. 'He said he did it out of love for his girlfriend and was very remorseful.' '[Adenubi] claimed she was fleeing a violent partner in Nigeria and claimed to have no family here and no contact with her family in Nigeria. 'She said she arrived with nowhere to go and met a Nigerian man at the airport and others via a church, but had no details of those she stayed with. 'She claimed to have found Ogunkunle's passport on a bench and only used it to get free medical services.' The offences, contrary to the 1911 Perjury Act, carry a maximum sentence of seven years 'penal servitude'. Judge John Tanzer said: 'The probation service think this is a Nigerian plot to use the 'International Health Service' and then take further advantage.'

"Waking up with a giant spot on your face prior to an important event is a scenario most women know only too well, but how far would you go to get rid of it? You may have tried tea tree oil and serums that claim to zap it away in an instant but, failing those, would you dare dab your own urine on your face in a desperate attempt to banish the pesky zit? One author claims that applying  urine to your visage can be extremely effective when it comes to treating troublesome skin. Scroll down for video . Would YOU use urine on your skin to banish a spot? One healthcare author claims that the trick works wonders on pesky zits thanks to urine's nutrient dense properties . In Your Own Perfect Medicine, author Martha Christy outlines scientifically-proven and medically-documented studies. She explains that urine therapy - or urotherapy - has historical roots in ancient Egypt, China and India. Essentially, she claims that thanks to its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties, urine helps boost immunity to disease. Martha says that the enzyme, vitamin and mineral-rich liquid should be applied topically to the skin to help with acne, eczema, psoriasis and fungal infections. Martha goes as far as to suggest that drinking your own urine will boost your health immensely . The nutritional and natural healthcare consultant, who also works as a medical research writer, goes as far as to suggest that drinking your own urine will boost your health immensely. She refers to JW Armstrong, who fasted on his own urine and water for 45 days, and recommends massaging yourself with urine and even using it as an eye and ear drop. Urine baths, she says, are beneficial and refers to the women who took urine baths in eighteenth century France. Indeed, pop star Madonna once claimed to swear by the gross ritual. Speaking on the David Letterman show, she said: 'Peeing in the shower is really good, it, it fights  athlete's foot. 'I'm serious,  urine is like an antiseptic, it's all got to do with the enzymes in your body.' Ultimately, Martha argues that urine isn't promoted by the healthcare world because it's free. Writing for The Telegraph, Rebecca Reid claims that putting urine in your face cream is the latest UK health trend. She explains that her friend was advised to apply it topically by the local while living in Ashram, India. 'They  initially encouraged us to mix some of our urine in with whatever moisturiser we’d brought with us. I just put some in my Nivea. And it was amazing. My skin was so, so soft,' she writes. Shona Wilkinson, Nutritionist at NutriCentre, said: 'Urine typically contains breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, beauty products and waste metabolites of the body. 'For this reason, the actual content of each individuals urine is totally different. On the whole though, it is approximately 95 per cent water and then 5 per cent nutrients such as calcium, iron, magnesium and zinc. 'There is no research to show any other benefits than just the 5 per cent nutrients. There has to be a simpler way of getting any benefits of urine that are claimed. I would suggest a glass of water and either a healthy meal or a multi vitamin and mineral tablet - the benefits will far exceed a glass of urine. 'Overall – not something I would recommend!’ Urine therapy is said to date back to the Bible. Historical documents suggest that the Aztecs disinfected wounds with it, while the benefits are also mentioned in Indian and Chinese literature. Urine is highly sterile, consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins, vitamins and minerals. During the digestive process, the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted. The blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine. But GP Dr Rob Hicks said: 'Over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine, but as far as I'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back-up these claims. 'The kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body doesn't need, so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive. 'Personally, I believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking, eating a healthy diet, and keeping stress under control.'","Natural healthcare consultant says urine helps treat skin conditions .

"Jeremy Paxman said he believes former prime minister Sir Winston Churchill (above), who died in 1965, would be ‘suffocated’ by modern-day politics . Steering the country through a savage war, Sir Winston Churchill is proudly remembered as one of Britain’s greatest ever leaders. But the former prime minister would no longer be seen as electable, according to Jeremy Paxman, who said he would be ‘suffocated’ by today’s politics. Ahead of the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death on Saturday, the veteran broadcaster also said the politician could be a ‘ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan.’ And speaking to The Radio Times, presenter Jonathan Dimbleby added Churchill was a ‘democratic dictator’ who would not be suited to modern day Westminster. The former prime minister died on January 24, 1965, just days after suffering a severe stroke and, to mark his passing, the BBC1 is broadcasting Churchill: A Nation’s Farewell, next Wednesday. In the programme, Paxman, 64, tells the story of the politician’s state funeral, the first granted to a commoner since the Duke of Wellington in 1852. But speaking to the magazine ahead of the programme’s broadcast, the former Newsnight presenter, said: ‘Any rounded assessment of Winston Churchill’s life has to acknowledge that he was a ruthless egotist, a chancer, and a charlatan at times. 'Would he be electable now? I fear not. He was a man of his time, a parliamentary one-off who’d be suffocated by the spinning and posturing that pass for politics today.’ Jonathan Dimbleby, 70, whose father Jonathan provided the commentary for the millions watching Churchill’s funeral on television, agreed with this assessment and added that those would wish to see a Churchill-style figure save modern Britain are living in a fantasy. He said: ‘I’m not sure whether a Churchill would be appropriate for the complexities of peace-time politics. 'The greatness of Churchill was that he was, effectively, a democratic dictator. 'He ruled Britain. That was an extraordinary power in the hands of one man. I don’t think that would work very well today. In a documentary marking the 50th anniversary of Churchill’s death, which is to be aired next Wednesday, former Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman (pictured), describes the  politician as a ‘ruthless' and a 'chancer' 'The idea that a “strong men” could wave a wand and everyone would automatically follow, and our problems would be over, seems to be to be an indulgence that should be left to the birds.’ Then, suggesting no modern politician would have the ability to step into Churchill’s shoes, he continued: ‘In a way I rather hope that there aren’t. 'Churchill is the greatest man of the last century, don’t get me wrong. 'He was a very great leader with extraordinary energy, and he also had a much greater strategic sense than critics give him credit for. 'But I don’t think people today would relish dictators, however democratically elected they might be. In the programme, Paxman, 64, tells the story of the politician’s state funeral, the first granted to a commoner since the Duke of Wellington in 1852 . ‘I think it’s very difficult for an individual who can’t comfortably command a majority of his or her party to succeed. 'To command in a modern democracy, you have to be willing to compromise, to give and take. 'If you march forward from the front, you end up leading your troops into the valley of death, politically, or you find that you’re marching by yourself and your troops have deserted you. 'That is the challenge that modern politicians face.’","Jeremy Paxman said former PM would be ‘suffocated’ by today’s politics .

"A trainee lawyer at one of the world's biggest law firms has posted a rant claiming the Paris terror attacks may not have happened if the West had not 'killed our people and pillaged our resources'. Aysh Chaudhry, 22, from magic circle law firm Clifford Chance, criticised Muslims for allowing their minds to be 'colonised' and claimed Islam was 'superior' to Western ideology. In a 21-minute YouTube video posted two days after the kosher supermarket massacre, the lawyer said freedom of speech should not be put on a pedestal 'as though it is some godsend'. Referring to non-Muslims insultingly as 'kuffar', he addressed the Paris terrorist atrocities, which left 17 people dead, and said that any Muslims who apologised were offering a 'weak' response. Scroll down for video . Aysh Chaudhry, 22, posted an online diatribe claiming the Paris terror attacks may not have happened if the West had not 'killed our people and pillaged our resources' In the online diatribe, where he speaks mostly in English with some Arabic, Mr Chaudhry said: 'Brothers and sisters, we would not be here had it not been for the fact that the kuffar had gone to our lands and killed our people and raped and pillaged our resources. 'This, brothers and sisters, is what we need to understand. We need to move away from this apologetic tone and have confidence in Islam because we are enslaved otherwise.' 'We need to remove this Western cultural lens with which we are viewing and responding to attacks on Islam from our eyes. 'Stop putting freedom on this pedestal. This is a value stemming from secular, liberal beliefs. We don't need a value which stems from a bankrupt ideology.' During the video - which was watched 700 times before being removed - he claimed that freedom of speech is an ideal which does not exist in reality. 'You wouldn't walk around Germany denying the Holocaust,' he said. He said freedom of speech should not be put on a pedestal 'as though it is some godsend' in a 21-minute YouTube video posted two days after the kosher supermarket massacre. 'The ideal of freedom of speech doesn't exist in reality. But there seems to be an absolute freedom to insult Muslims. 'The people being held out as Islamic personalities with an Islamic response are not giving a correct Islamic response. You [Muslims] have to accept their [Westerners'] freedom to insult you. 'That is what freedom of speech means [in the West]… I guess Muslims just need to grow up, is the concept they want to put across.' He calls freedom of speech a 'bankrupt ideology', adding: 'We are becoming infatuated with the civilisation of the kuffar and their beliefs and their values and indeed we have latched on to these. 'Now you know who you are if you are of those who state 'I will die to protect your freedom and I believe in freedom of speech'. The Kouachi brothers  were filmed by eyewitnesses in a Paris street after they'd slaughtered 11 members of the Charlie Hebdo editorial team in cold blood . 'But understand that it is not the Islamic response to this issue. It represents a defeatist mentality, brothers and sisters. It is understood the trainee started at Clifford Chance six months ago and earns £40,500 per year. The 22-year-old from Walthamstow, east London has now offered a grovelling apology claiming that he just wanted to encourage intellectual debate. He said: 'I apologise for any offence caused by my video. I have a deep and serious Islamic faith, I had no intention other than to encourage intellectual debate and would never support or condone violence.' Clifford Chance insisted today that the firm did not share the views of Mr Chaudhry, pictured is the headquarters in Canary Wharf . Clifford Chance insisted today that the firm did not share the views of Mr Chaudhry, who works in their mergers and acquisitions department. But the firm refused to comment on whether he would be would lose his job or face any disciplinary action. A spokesman for the firm said: 'The views expressed in this video are personal and not those of Clifford Chance. 'The firm is committed to establishing an inclusive culture where people with diverse backgrounds and views work effectively together and feel confident to develop their potential. 'We ask our people at all times to consider how their personal conduct and actions may affect those around them, their professional reputation and that of the firm.' Mr Chaudhry's video was posted on January 11 from an account called 'Call of Dawah', which describes itself on Facebook as a 'local Islamic youth group based in east London'. The video was set to 'private' three days later but the full video later re-surfaced on YouTube on an account called 'Magic 2015'. His LinkedIn page has been removed, but it said he gained a first-class honours degree in law from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at London University. Before working at Clifford Chance, he interned at Slaughter & May, White & Case, Freshfields, and BLP. Speaking outside the family home in Walthamstow, east London, today, his father Zahur Chaudhry said: 'The whole thing has been totally blown out of proportion. It's a non-story. 'I won't pass comment, but if you read his statement that will tell you our stance on it. 'He's working hard on a very big project for Clifford Chance, lots of long hours, so he's not normally home until very late.' But Sam Westrop, director of Stand For Peace, a Jewish-Muslim interfaith group that tackles religious and political extremism in the UK, said Mr Chaudhry had used 'the language of terror' and that Clifford Chance's response was 'weak'. He told MailOnline: 'From our position - and for anyone involved in counter-terror - this is a familiar type of rhetoric, directed at non-Muslims. It is not just political ramblings. 'We saw it after the Woolwich murder, when Michael Adebolajo made similar comments on camera about victimhood in foreign lands. 'This man might not be directly involved with terror but he is certainly using the langauge of terror. I'm sure he will be someone that the police and security services are going to look at very closely from now on.' He added: 'That Clifford Chance has responded so weakly is deplorable. I'm sure they would have no hesitation in taking immediate disciplinary action against someone with neo-Nazi views, so I'm not sure why this is different. 'I don't believe any respectable company or organisation would hesistate in taking immediate discplinary action against an employee who has made these comments.'","Aysh Chaudhry, 22, criticised 'apologetic' Muslims in online diatribe .

"The family of the NHS boss  stabbed to death by her husband before he hanged himself have paid tribute to the 'devoted mother' who had a 'successful career'. Yvonne Davies' body and that of her husband Andrew, 45, were found on Friday in a suspected murder-suicide after they failed to collect their seven-year-old daughter Emma from school. The mother introduced celebrities such as  David Hasselhoff to sick children as part of her work as  the head of PR  at Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Andrew Davies (left) was found hanged after stabbing his magistrate wife Yvonne (right) to death in a frenzied attack at their home .

Neighbours said a man concerned for their welfare smashed open the front door of their semi-detached home in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, with a hammer and made the discovery. The body of Mrs Davies, who had sat as a magistrate since 1999, was uncovered in the kitchen and a post-mortem found that she died from multiple stab wounds with the likely weapon a kitchen knife.

Everyone is totally in shock.' Mr and Mrs Davies married in January 2010 and their daughter, orphaned by the double tragedy, is being cared for by relatives.

He was an incredibly loving father who took five years out of work to spend time caring for his daughter. He was devoted to Emma.

"An 86-year-old man who suffered a bad fall was left laying on the pavement for more than an hour during a long wait for a delayed ambulance. In the latest incident to highlight the strain on ambulance and A&E services, the pensioner faced agonising delays after the accident outside a Tesco store in Chester. The trust in charge of ambulances in the area has now apologised to the man, insisting the wait was due to the 'unprecedented amount of 999 calls' it is currently receiving. Scroll down for video . A pensioner was forced to wait more than an hour in the cold after an ambulance was delayed in Chester . Witnesses say an ambulance was called at 1.46pm last Thursday after the man fell over, but a lone paramedic only arrived around 50 minutes later. The man and those helping him had to wait a further 15 minutes before an ambulance and two further paramedics eventually arrived. The injured man, who has not been named, was left with a suspected broken thigh bone after the fall, and there was further concern due him suffering from an irregular heartbeat. It was one hour and 19 minutes before he was finally put into an ambulance. It later transpired he had injured his hip, but not suffered the bone break first feared. James Westhorpe, who owns a cafe nearby, stayed at the man's side as he lay on the floor. He said: 'He was conscious but in a lot of pain and so cold being on the floor and we couldn't move him because we thought he had broken his leg.' Shopkeepers and bystanders had to wrap the man up to keep him warm as he waited for help following a fall . Mr Westhorpe's wife Sarah said the pensioner went down with 'a thud', adding that his 'teeth were chattering after a few minutes' because of the cold. The couple took the injured man's wife inside and gave her a coffee to help warm her up. Mrs Westhorpe added: 'It's not the paramedics' fault. They're working with the limited resources they've got.' Jan Stocker, manager of the Quaker Meeting House, which was hosting Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper at the time, went to assist and said she was 'shocked' at the delay. A North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust has now apologised to the man for his ordeal. A spokesman said: 'We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing and we are sorry for any upset caused to the patient.' The incident comes as A&E departments around the country are struggling to cope with the number of patients. Pictured: Ambulances queue outside the University Hospital Wales in Cardiff . The spokesman added: 'We received a call at 13.46 to attend to a patient outside Tesco in Chester. A paramedic-manned rapid response vehicle arrived on scene at 14.38. 'The service is currently experiencing an unprecedented amount of 999 calls. Between 15 December 2014 and 15 January 2015, we answered 111,577 emergency calls, an increase of 13.2 per cent compared to the same time period last year. 'Regretfully, there was a delay with the ambulance attending to the patient due to this demand and the Trust apologises for the wait. We would encourage the patient or their family to contact us further to discuss any concerns with the service they received.' The incident comes after weeks of long delays in A&E departments around Britain, with ambulances forced to queue outside hospitals while beds are freed up and trusts declaring 'major incidents' as they desperately try to clear long backlogs. Long queues of ambulances waiting to drop off patients at under-strain A&E departments have been seen around the UK.

"Researchers studied fossilised remains of a group of Philydrosauras (artist's impression). The semi-aquatic dinosaurs lived 160 million years ago . Many reptiles, such as lizards and turtles abandon their eggs after laying. In fact, only five per cent of mammals feed and protect their young after giving birth. But, in a new study, paleontologists have found evidence that dinosaurs may have bucked this lizard trend. Fossils reveal that a particular group known as Philydrosauras were caring parents - and it could be the oldest record of such care ever found. The researchers from the University of Lincoln, along with colleagues from China and Japan, studied fossilised remains of the small semi-aquatic dinosaurs that live around 160 million years ago during the Jurassic Period. The fossils, which were found by a farmer in Yixian, in western Liaoning Province of China, four years ago, included an adult surrounded by six smaller juveniles. This suggests the dinosaurs were living as a family at the time of their death. By comparison, most modern reptiles leave the youngsters to fend for themselves once they hatch. Dr Charles Deeming, who led the work at the University of Lincoln, said that the young dinosaurs all appeared to be from the same clutch and were living with a parent. Philydrosauras were part of a group of dinosaurs known as choristodera. He said: 'The fact that six young surround what appears to be an adult suggests the animals were in natural close proximity at the time of death. 'Although it is possible that the individuals were all swept together during or soon after the event that killed them it is feel that this specimen more likely represents an instance of post-natal parental care. The fossils included an adult surrounded by six smaller juveniles (illustrated). This suggests the dinosaurs were living as a family at the time of their death. Previous examples of post-natal care in dinosaurs are extremely rare and it has only been reported in two types of dinosaurs, and a small lizard called a pelycosaur . The fossils (pictured) were found in Yixian, western Liaoning Province of China, four years ago. They are said to represent the oldest record of post-natal parental care in diapsids - a group that include all reptiles . 'That Philydrosauras shows parental care of the young after hatching suggests protection by the adult, presumably against predators. 'Their relatively small size would have meant that choristoderes were probably exposed to high predation pressure. In August, amateur paleontologists found fossils said to be about 120 million years old in the Lujiatun beds of the Yixian Formation, northeastern China. The positioning and nature of the fossils shows they all died together, possibly as a result of a landslide caused by a volcanic eruption which would not have given any time for escape. But the area was clearly not a nest either, said researchers. Though the entire specimen is only about 2ft (0.6m) across, it contains fossils from 25 creatures, all of the species Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis - from the Greek for parrot lizard. Psittacosaurs were gazelle-like plant eaters and are among the most abundant dinosaurs yet discovered. This suggests this was a nursery where babies were left in the care of an adult, dubbed 'dinosaur babysitters', said University of Pennsylvania researchers Brandon Hedrick and researcher Professor Peter Dodson. 'This specimen represents the oldest record of post-natal parental care in diapsids - a group of animals that include all reptiles - to our knowledge and is the latest in an increasingly detailed collection of choristoderes exhibiting different levels of reproduction and parental care.'

Experts believe the area was a 'nursery' where babies were left in the care of an adult, dubbed 'dinosaur babysitters' The new study, which is published in the Geosciences Journal, was conducted by Dr Deeming along with researchers from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing and the Hokkaido University, in Japan. They said that although the group appear to be a family, the sex of the adult is not know. In some modern species of birds, males play a key role in rearing their young, while in other animals this care is left to the females. However, the researchers also believe that the small Philydrosaurus dinosaurs may have also given birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Dr Deeming said: 'Strategies, such as live birth, and post-natal parental care may have improved survival of the offspring.'

"An apple a day may reduce the risk of heart attack . We may not have taken mum's homespun advice seriously when we were younger, however increasing evidence now suggests that some of her nuggets of so-called wisdom may contain more than a grain of truth, especially when it comes to our health. Earlier this month researchers at Yale University found that avoiding a cold could be as simple as wrapping up when you venture out in winter, just as your mother always told you. A cold virus typically enters through the nose. In a study of mice, the researchers found that the immune response was greater if the nose temperature was 37c (body temperature) compared with 33c, and concluded that a scarf over the nose could help ward off illness. Here are some other health mantras you might have dismissed as silly, but which contain important advice for our wellbeing. AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY . An apple a day may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by 12 per cent, and could be as effective as a statin, according to researchers from Oxford University. This may be because apples are high in soluble fibre which prevents cholesterol build-up in the arteries, says Helen Bond of the British Dietetic Association. The fruit also contain antioxidants including flavanoids which help the immune system. Research by the University of Ulster also suggests high levels of substances in apples called phenols may also have a beneficial effect on colon cancer cells. And a U.S. study shows that quercetin, abundant in apples, may help to prevent prostate cancer by preventing the growth of early cancer cells. Chilling of the body surface, especially the feet, can cause cold symptoms . THE RAIN CAN TRIGGER A COLD . Being wet and cold can raise your risk of a cold, suggests research from Cardiff University. Volunteers were asked to plunge their feet into bowls of icy water for 20 minutes, while a control group put their feet into an empty bowl. During the next four or five days, almost one-third of the chilled volunteers developed cold symptoms compared with just 9 per cent in the control group. Professor Ron Eccles, of the university's Common Cold Centre, says: 'Chilling of the body surface, especially the feet, can cause cold symptoms to appear in someone who is already harbouring the virus.' Why this happens is unclear, but one theory is that getting cold causes the body to restrict blood supply to the extremities - including the nose - to preserve core body temperature. This results in a cold nose, which leaves us more prone to infection. MORNING SICKNESS BAD? IT'S A GIRL . A study by the University of Washington found that pregnant women who were hospitalised for nausea and vomiting for three days or more were 80 per cent more likely to have a girl than the control group. Scientists suspect this may be because the mothers' bodies produced increased amounts of a pregnancy-related hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, which is thought to in some way trigger nausea. Higher levels are associated with a female foetus. AND... BANANAS MAKE BOYS . eat bananas if you want a son - that was the suggestion from research by Oxford University, which linked a high potassium intake around breakfast time to the greater chance of having a boy. From a sample of 740 mothers, the researchers found those who ate a banana every day had a 56 per cent chance of having a boy, compared with 45 per cent on a separate diet. One banana contains about 422 mg of potassium - around 13 per cent of the body's daily requirement. The mineral is needed to control the balance of fluids in the body, though scientists are still unsure how this could affect the sex of a foetus. COUNT SHEEP TO HELP YOU SLEEP . The trick is not to count sheep up to 100 as that makes the mind work too hard . Doing something dull and boring will give you the so-called 'quiet mind' - one not disturbed by thoughts or worries - needed to help you drop off, says independent sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley. 'The trick is not to count them up to 100 as that makes the mind work too hard,' he says. 'Instead count the same two or three sheep going in and out of a gate. That should stop you thinking about things that keep you awake, such as paying bills.' CLOVES STOP TOOTHACHE . Cloves and clove oil contain eugenol, which has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant and anaesthetic properties. However, London-based dentist Dr Charlie Ferber advises using this treatment sparingly. He says: 'It may give temporary relief, but applying clove oil to the gums can burn and lead to ulcers. So dab it on, and make sure you see your dentist as soon as possible.' Carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A . EAT CARROTS TO SEE IN THE DARK . Carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. 'Vitamin A is needed for good night vision,' explains Andrew Lotery, professor of ophthalmic surgery at the University of Southampton. 'What we don't know is how many carrots you would have to eat to make that improvement.' Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam also found that eating high levels of beta-carotene - the compound that gives carrots their colouring - as well as vitamins C, E and zinc, lowers the chance of age-related macular degeneration (the leading cause of blindness in the UK) by up to 35 per cent. Other sources of beta-carotene include pumpkins, sweet potatoes, pink grapefruit and spinach. DON'T EAT FOOD OFF THE FLOOR . Food that's been on the floor picks up bacteria - but if you pick it up just a few seconds after being dropped, it's less likely to contain bacteria than if left for longer periods of time, according to the findings of research carried out at Aston University last year. The study monitored the transfer of E. coli and staphylococcus aureus from a variety of indoor floor types (carpet, laminate and tiled surfaces) to toast, pasta, biscuit and a sticky sweet. The food was left on the floor for different lengths of time, from three to 30 seconds. The results showed time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food. The type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces. CHICKEN SOUP EASES A COLD . It's a traditional home remedy – and one that works. Research in the American Journal of Therapeutics found that one compound found in chicken - carnosine -helped the body's immune system to fight the early stages of flu. Furthermore, Dr Stephen Rennard, of the University of Nebraska, discovered the soup may reduce inflammation during a cold, easing the symptoms of coughing and sneezing. And according to Professor Ron Eccles, the combination of the heat of the soup with the salt and spices will promote production of saliva, which will help loosen and thin mucus to relieve a blocked nose. He added that garlic will also help as it has anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties. If you don't have chicken soup, simply having a hot drink can help, according to previous research led by Professor Eccles. The study compared the effects of an apple and blackcurrant cordial when drunk either hot or at room temperature by 30 volunteers with cold symptoms. Within 15 minutes symptoms such as a sore throat, sneezing, cough and runny nose were reduced in those who had the hot drink. CHEWING GUM CAN BLOCK YOUR GUT . Swallowing the occasional piece of chewing gum is unlikely to cause problems. But if you are a regular user who swallows their gum every time you have it, the pieces could stick together and cause a painful blockage known as a bezoar, explains Vishal Saxena, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in London. Bezoars normally pass out through the gut. If not, surgery or medication is required.","Yale researchers found avoiding a cold could be as simple as wrapping up .

"She's famous for her broad smile and sparkling white teeth but an animated Duchess of Cambridge proved that she's not one to stand around and grin when there's talking to be done. During this morning's tour of Kensington, the Duchess showed off a full range of expressions, from big smiles to bashful glances. Some of the more pained looks could have been the result of a particularly large kick from the fourth in line to the throne, who, said Kate, is now moving around constantly. Scroll down for video .

'It's moving all the time,' said the Duchess, who was chatting to 17-year-old Martina McDonagh at the time. 'I can feel it kicking now.' The Duchess, who is six months pregnant, is due to give birth to her second child at the end of April but admitted that she and Prince William still don't know the sex of their unborn child. Today's animated pictures of the Duchess are in stark contrast to those taken last Monday, which showed a tired-looking Kate shopping in London. In those, the 33-year-old looked worn out by the rigours of pregnancy although that was partly the result, said insiders, of her reining in her beauty regime in order to keep her baby healthy.

"A New Jersey school bus driver who left two special needs children alone on a bus for nearly an hour in 90-degree weather has been sentenced to three years of probation. Kimberly Moumblow, 47, of Highland Lakes reportedly left two special needs boys, age seven and nine, on a school bus for 45 minutes in July 2013 with the door shut and the windows rolled up, authorities say. The bus was reportedly not running. Sentenced: Kimberly Moumblow, 47 (photographed), allegedly left two special needs children alone on a bus for nearly an hour in 90-degree weather and has now been sentenced to three years of probation . Judge Thomas J. Critchley also ordered Moumblow to pay various fines and undergo a mental health evaluation, The New Jersey Herald reports. In November 2014, Moumblow pleaded guilty to cruelty and fourth-degree neglect of a child in the incident. Moumblow reportedly skipped two of her three planned stops that July 23 day and, after driving the school bus to the Hamburg-based private bus company Macnova parking area, she left the vehicle without realizing the two boys were still inside, according to the Herald. According to NJ, Moumblow backed the bus into the company owner's home before leaving the children unattended in the vehicle in the 90-degree weather. Authorities have said the children were overheated and distressed, but were not seriously injured. Found: Police reportedly found the bus parked in front of the Macnova bus company owner's home (photographed here) The boys were found after their parents contacted the school, asking where the boys were, the Herald reports. The school board called the bus company, contracted to transport summer program students, and, when they couldn't reach the company, they contacted the police, CBS reports. Officers found the bus outside of the company owner's home, and CBS reports, that the company told school district officials that the children were on an air-conditioned bus and being attended to by an adult. Authorities soon learned that was not the case. Unacceptable: Charles Maranzano (photographed) described the situation as 'complete neglect,' saying Moumblow's actions were 'unacceptable and incomprehensible' 'I just want to say that I am sorry to the families, Moumblow said before her sentencing. 'Anything I say will sound like an excuse, but what happened was inexcusable.' Charles Maranzano, superintendent of Vernon Township schools, described the situation to CBS as 'complete neglect,' saying Moumblow's actions were 'unacceptable and incomprehensible.' Though Moumblow said what happened was 'inexcusable,' the woman, who had a special license to drive a bus for nearly a decade, said she could offer no explanation other than personal issues involving her own children and a prior marriage, according to the Herald. Moumblow will face the probation, evaluation, and fines although the fourth-degree crime of neglect of a child carries a potential weight of up to 18 months in jail, NJ reports. The school district has since fired the Macnova bus company, according to the Herald, and Moumblow is no longer allowed to work with children.","Kimberly Moumblow, 47, is accused of leaving two special needs children alone on a hot bus for 45 minutes .

Four of the six women are horrified and Dawn even asks for her steak to be taken back to the kitchen and cooked properly, after claiming that it is mooing on her plate. Ampika is disgusted with her guests and tells her chef Eddie that the women are all peasants. Tanya tries her hand at boxing in the programme . Tanya is unphased by the comments and laughs – she proves herself to be the most down-to-earth of the group in the episode, admitting that she doesn’t send her children to private school because she attended state school as a child. She also openly reveals to two of the women that she can no longer jump up and down when they are at a boxing lesson together earlier in the day because the motion makes her pass urine. In the scene, she is dragged by Leanne and Ampika down to a boxing lesson at a gym in Hale and warns the instructor that she won’t be doing much sparring. She tells him: ‘I don't do jumping because I'll wee myself. ‘Every time I skip - after (having) three kids, I wee myself a bit.’ Real Housewives of Cheshire airs tonight on ITVBe at 10pm.","Ampika Pickston reveals she's a mistress on Real Housewives of Cheshire .

The even more showy old Coco club sold cocktails for £5,000 in huge ice sculptures the shape of a ski chalet, full to the brim with Krug Grand Cuvee champagne, Hennessy Paradis brandy and other 'secret ingredients'. Its wallpaper was hand-painted, its curtains were fur and the walls were covered in £30,000 worth of gold leaf. Hotspot: The Farm nightclub is a Verbier institution that stays open until 4am and which Fergie used to visit during her holidays . Princess Mary of Denmark and  Prince Frederik of Denmark pose on their annual visit to Verbier in Switzerland with two of their children . Several up-market restaurants have recently opened  including Etoile Rouge Restaurant (where you can slip onto the dance floor after dinner) and Le Mouton Noir (which has cabaret and live music every afternoon). A sign of the clientele in Verbier, a sushi restaurant has  opened this year on the High Street. Nomad Sushi Lounge uses Binchotan charcoal for flavour and serve grade 11 Kobe beef imported directly from Japan, and there's a takeaway menu for those who'd rather not brave the cold. If you visit for the skiing there are nearly 100 lifts and more than 400 km of ski runs for all levels of expertise spread across the 4 Valley region. From the top of the ski area – Mont Fort, at 3330m – the views reach as far as the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. At least for now, they haven't divided the slopes into VIP areas, although that day may not be far off.","Prince Andrew and ex wife Fergie have just bought a chalet in Verbier thought to have cost £13 million .

"Middle-aged people who have a drink a day cut their chances of developing heart failure in later life by a fifth, claim researchers. A US study of nearly 15,000 people found drinking up to seven drinks a week is linked with a 20 per cent lower risk of men developing heart failure in the future when compared to people who did not drink at all. There was a 16 per cent cut in risk for women drinkers, says a report in the European Heart Journal. Scroll down for video . Middle-aged people who have a drink a day cut their chances of developing heart failure in later life by a fifth . Previous research has found drinking modest amounts of alcohol protects heart health, but this is the first study to look in depth at heart failure. More than 700,000 Britons over the age of 45 live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it. Heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles, and it can lead to serious complications. A team led by Dr Scott Solomon, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, analysed data from 14,629 people aged between 45-64 years between 1987 and 1989. The volunteers were questioned about alcohol consumption at regular intervals. During the 25-year follow-up period 1,271 men and 1,237 women developed heart failure. The lowest rate of heart failures occurred in those drinking up to 7 drinks per week and the highest rate was among former drinkers. A drink was defined as containing 14g of alcohol, equivalent to approximately one small (125ml) glass of wine, just over half a pint or a third of a litre of beer, and less than one shot of liquor such as whisky or vodka. Former drinkers had the highest risk of developing heart failure – up to 19 per cent increased risk compared to abstainers. There was an increased risk of death of 47 per cent for men and 89 per cent of women who reported consuming 21 or more drinks a week at the start of the study. Previous research has found drinking modest amounts of alcohol protects heart health, but this is the first study to look in depth at heart failure . Professor Solomon said: 'These findings suggest that drinking alcohol in moderation does not contribute to an increased risk of heart failure and may even be protective. 'However, heavy alcohol use is certainly a risk factor for deaths from any cause. 'The people who were classified as former drinkers at the start of the study had a higher risk of developing heart failure and of death from any cause when compared with abstainers. 'This could be related to the reasons why they had stopped drinking in the first place, for instance because they had already developed health problems that might have made them more likely to go on to develop heart failure.' Government guidelines recommend men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day. Women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day. Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said 'Some studies have shown drinking small amounts of alcohol may have some benefits for your heart, but it's not just your heart health you have to think about. 'Drinking alcohol can increase your risk of liver disease and some cancers, and excess amounts can also lead to cardiovascular disease. 'There are much safer and healthier ways to protect your heart like exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet, so there's no reason to start drinking if you don't already. Anyone who is concerned about their alcohol intake should contact their GP.'","US Study found having seven drinks a week lowers risk of heart failure .

"Daniel Devlin lives in the same house as his children and sees them every day – yet he is unable to recognise them at all. Mr Devlin, 46, from Nunhead, London, is living with a bizarre condition called prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness, meaning he struggles to recognise faces - even those of his own family. Mr Devlin, a painter, has been forced to memorise his family's voices and body language in order to know who they are. But reading voices and body language doesn't always work, and has even mistaken another boy for his son when picking his children up from school before. Scroll down for video . Daniel Devlin, 46, suffers from rare condition prosopagnosia, also known as face-blindness. He was born with the part of his brain responsible for facial recognition damaged. Despite living with his wife Katarina, daughter Klara, eight and son Emil, five,  he struggles to recognise them . Mr Devlin once mistook another boy for his son Emil, five, (pictured) when he was picking his children up from school . Mr Devlin said: 'Humans have a special ability to recognise people by seeing their faces, I really don't have this ability. 'Maybe a good way to imagine what it's like to have prosopagnosia is to try and recognise people by what their hands look like. 'Every person has a different hand but if someone showed you a photo of someone's hands, you might struggle to recognise who the person is, even if that person turns out to be someone you know very well. 'I just thought that everyone was the same or maybe I just wasn't putting in as much effort as others to remember people. 'If I saw my wife Katarina somewhere unexpected and she pretended not to know me, then I'm not sure I would know it was her. 'It often leaves me in some awkward situations, especially when I don't recognise people that I should or think I know people that I don't. 'I have learnt to recognise people based on their body language and voices instead.' Mr Devlin struggles to recognise the faces of his wife Katarina, as well as his children Klara, eight, and Emil, five. Mrs Devlin said: 'When the children are in school uniform, they all look very similar to Daniel. 'He once mistook someone else for our son, which got a very disapproving look from the boy's mother. Prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise people's faces. Also known as 'face-blindness', the severity of the condition depends on the degree of impairment a person suffers. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, while others will be unable to discriminate between unknown faces, and in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. The condition is not related to memory loss, impaired vision or learning disabilities. It is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus - a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. Prosopagnosia can result from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. In some cases the condition is congenital, and present at birth. It appears to run in families, which makes it likely to be the result of a genetic mutation or deletion. Some degree of prosopagnosia is often found in children with autism and Asperger's Syndrome. Treatment of the condition focuses on helping sufferers develop compensatory strategies, including relying on voice recognition, clothing, or unique physical attributes. Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . 'If we've met someone before I will try and tell him who it is before we speak to them. 'It does cause some awkward situations but usually we just find it funny.' Experts said propagnosia is not linked to problems with vision, memory or intelligence. Instead, it is thought to be the result of impairment in the right 'fusiform gyrus' of the brain - a fold that appears to coordinate facial perception and memory. This could be as a result of a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or some neurodegenerative diseases. Or, in cases such as Mr Devlin's - the condition is present at birth, and the pathways in the brain responsible for recognition never developed properly. Though he now knows he has had the had the condition all his life, Mr Devlin was only diagnosed in the last few years, through sheer chance. He said: 'I heard a programme about it on the radio and realised that's what I had. Test confirmed he was suffering from face-blindness. He said: 'I had to do tests where I was shown a number of faces, then I would be shown another set of faces, some that were shown before and some new ones. 'I would have to say which ones I had seen before. My score was well below that of people without the condition. 'We also had the same kind of test but instead of faces, we would have images of horses or houses and my scores would be in line with people without the condition.' It is thought the condition affects up to one in 50 people, the equivalent of about 1.5 million people in the UK. Some people with prosopagnosia may only struggle to recognise a familiar face, but in more severe cases sufferers cannot distinguish a face as being different from an object. Some sufferers are unable to recognise their own faces. Mr Devlin's face-blindness is not so severe, but he has failed to recognise celebrities in the past. He said: 'Growing up I loved films, but my favourite stars were always those that had distinctive voices or characters like James Cagney or Woody Allen. 'Katarina is Croatian and once we saw a very famous rock band there. I met the drummer and was convinced he was Katarina's neighbour. 'I don't think he was used to not being recognised and he was a bit annoyed.' Although there is no treatment for the condition, Mr Devlin has learnt coping strategies . He said: 'Most people know that I have it so it's not a problem. 'There are ways to cope. If I see someone who seems to know me then I ask them vague questions, like how are things, is work okay, until I can figure out who they are. 'I also always say ""nice to see you"" rather than ""nice to meet you"", just in case I have met them before.' Mr Devlin says if his wife Katarina pretended not to know him, he probably wouldn't recognise her. If someone they know approaches them, Mrs Devlin whispers their name into her husband's ear so he can greet them, even if he doesn't recognise them . There is a prosopagnosia research group at Birkbeck University, London, where Mr Devlin found out he suffered from the condition. Researcher Joanna Parketny, who has been working with Mr Devlin, said: 'Individuals affected by this condition have trouble in recognising not only famous but also personally known faces such as friends or even family. They also struggle to learn new faces, while having normal vision, intellect and memory, she added. She continued: 'The ability to successfully recognise faces is an incredibly important skill which allows us to navigate in the complex social environment.' Not being able to recognise faces can negatively affect people's well-being and lead to anxiety in social situations, she said. 'In extreme but rare cases it can lead to a person's withdrawal and alienation,' she said. 'The impact of prosopagnosia on an individual depends on the severity of the condition, their individual predisposition and personality. 'It's also dependent on the presence or absence of other conditions and lastly but very importantly the attitude and awareness of the people who make up our social environment.'","Daniel Devlin, 46, suffers from prosopagnosia, also called face-blindness .

"Johnny Depp and the cocaine dealer who inspired the film Blow have been reunited following the drug smuggler's release from prison. The actor met George Jung, 72, the man credited with setting up the American cocaine market, after his 20-year stint in FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey ended in June. According to TMZ, Depp reached out to the ex-drugs boss and invited him to his loft in downtown Los Angeles. They were said to have relaxed for hours with the Hollywood star's fiance Amber Heard - discussing poetry, books and the movie's late director Ted Demme. Scroll down for video .

They discussed books and poetry in the company of the star's fiance Amber Heard (right) First encounter: It is the first time the pair have met since the actor visited Jung in prison in 2001 before they started shooting Blow . It is the first time the pair have seen each other since Depp visited the self-proclaimed 'coke star' in prison in 2001 - the year the film was released. 'It’s very rare in life that any person opens up their heart and soul to you with unlimited access to their most profound thoughts, dreams, fears, regrets, intimacies,' Depp wrote in a letter regarding that visit. 'Even more rare when you’ve just met that person and, because of the obvious predicament, it’s highly unlikely that you will be spending too much time with them in the near future. So for this and more, I owe a great debt of gratitude to George.' Jung was released in June. TMZ reported that he will be living in a halfway house on the West Coast as he adjusts to life outside. The ex-drugs boss was set to be released in November this year after being found responsible for more than 85 per cent of the cocaine smuggled into America in the 1970s and 1980s. He has been behind bars since 1994 when he was caught with 1,754 pounds of cocaine in Kansas.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy, and received a 60-year sentence. His sentence, however, was reduced after he testified in the trial of his long-term business partner, Carlos Ledher. 'I was a guy who had a lot of money and unlimited access to cocaine and even if I looked like Bela Lugosi I still had the most beautiful women on the planet because everybody at that time, especially women, were in love with cocaine and of course in love with the money – the access to the automobiles, the clothes, the dinners, the lifestyle,' he told PBS in 2000.

"Amazon is getting into the movie business. The online shopping giant is to significantly expand into movie production by acquiring films for theatrical release and slash the time before they are available online.

Scroll down for video . House of Cards with Kevin Spacey as Francis Underwood and Robin Wright as Clair Underwood: Amazon now hopes to repeat its success in TV with movie releases . Amazon's entry into movies also comes on the heels of Sony Pictures' unprecedented digital distribution of the Seth Rogen comedy 'The Interview,' the first major studio film to be released simultaneously in theatrrs, online and on video-on-demand platforms. Top North American theatre chains have vigorously protested such moves. On Friday, Patrick Corcoran, vice president of the National Association of Theater Owners, fired back at those who saw Sony Pictures' digital release of 'The Interview' as a sign of things to come. Corcoran said the movie's release 'doesn't change anything,' and noted that its two-week $31.5 million digital gross was far less the film would have made at multiplexes. Roy Price, vice president of Amazon Studios, said the company's goal is to produce 12 movies a year, with production beginning later this year. 'Not only will we bring Prime Instant Video customers exciting, unique and exclusive films soon after a movie's theatrical run, but we hope this program will also benefit filmmakers, who too often struggle to mount fresh and daring stories that deserve an audience,' said Price. The announcement marks a new foray into the movie business for the online retail giant, which has in recent years developed a slate of TV series since Amazon Studios launched in 2010.

"A jogger in Oregon thought he was struck in the head by lightning when he felt sharp pain in his scalp and his hat flew off his head. Then, it struck again - and this time he saw a large pair of wings soar away from his bleeding head.

Ron Jaecks run every day so he can fit into his spandex Green Bay Packers costume. He was attacked last Tuesday by an owl while on his morning jog . 'It was like a huge electric shock ran through my body, but also like I got hit in the head with a two-by-four all at the same time. Or maybe a strike of lightning.' Dr Jaecks, a surgeon, told the Salem Statesman Journal. David Craig, a biology professor  at Willamette University, said Dr Jaecks as likely attacked by either a barred owl or a great horned owl - which can grow to have a wingspan of more than five feet. Their talons can grow up to eight inches long. Dr Jaecks said the unexpected attack - combined with initially having no idea what hit him - caused him to run around in circles screaming.

"Steve Jobs famously once said that if a company makes a stylus for a tablet, then 'they blew it'.

The claims were made by Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities to Apple Insider . The claims were made by Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities to Apple Insider. 'A stylus can be more convenient to use than the combination of keyboard and mouse in some cases,' said Mr Kuo. 'Therefore, we believe Apple's stylus will improve the user experience of 12.9-inch iPad.' Apple’s Newton platform originally came with a stylus when it launched in the 1990s. And the trend took off with the launch of the PalmPilot. But, at the 2008 Macworld event, Steve Jobs slated the stylus. He said: 'Who wants a stylus? You have to get ‘em, put ‘em away, you lose ‘em, yuck. Nobody wants a stylus.' He added: 'So let's not use a stylus. 'We're going to use the best pointing device in the world. 'We're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with - born with ten of them. We're going to use our fingers. We're going to touch [the iPhone] with our fingers.' He later said that any company that uses a stylus for a tablet had 'blown it.' Recent patents include 'Input Device Having Extendable Nib', awarded in March 2014, and 'Stylus Adapted For Low Resolution Touch Sensor Panels' in January 2010. In fact, Apple has filed more than 22 separate patents for a smart pen, dubbed iPen. Last February, one patent in particular featured detachable modules including a camera, audio recorder, laser pointer, power source and more. Other functions detailed in the patent include a communication circuit, gyroscope and accelerometer. However, Mr Kuo said he doesn't expect Apple's debut stylus to have these features. Instead, the company will add them gradually over the coming years, or users could choose which features they wanted. And he expects 3D handwriting to be featured on later models, too. These could be called 'expansion models', and were hinted at in the February iPen patent. Early iPen patents, dating back to May 2012, featured just a speaker and haptic feedback. Although basic stylus patents first appeared in 2010. This haptic feature would make the iPen vibrate as it moves around the screen, to tell a user they’ve performed a certain action. Apple has filed more than 22 separate patents for the so-called smart iPen, since 2012. Although basic stylus patents first appeared in 2010. In February last year, one such patent included images of a 'modular stylus'. Each module is shown having a different function including a camera, recorder, laser pointer, and more . Early iPen patents featured just a speaker and haptic feedback. A separate patent (pictured) added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at. This means users could change the thickness or style of a line, or make writing more closely resemble their own .

For example, if the stylus was used with a drawing program or app, the feedback would be designed to mimic a brush or pencil. A separate patent added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at.

The tip of this stylus is designed to mimic the touch of a finger touch, yet it will also work even when its hovered above the screen . Name: Popular suggestions for the name of the tablet include  iPad Air Plus - taking its lead from Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, and the iPad Pro. Size: The tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2- inch screen, although other dimensions up to 12.9 inches have also been suggested. Rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick. Design: The leaked 'sketch' suggests that the iPad Air Plus will be similar in design to the iPad Air 2, with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges. USP: The image differs from the smaller tablet however, because of grilles on the top of the shell, which suggest the device will include stereo speakers, as rumoured. Launch: Sources have suggested different launch times, but there is some consensus the tablet may make its debut before the summer. Double-tapping the pen on the screen opens a post-it-style note, while pressing the tip activates the S Pen menu. Rumours about an upcoming Apple 'super' tablet have been gaining traction recently after at least two images were leaked that appeared to show the device. One photo of a mould was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide. It follows a leaked sketch from earlier in the month that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad, iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus. The latest image was posted on Chinese social network Weibo. If the rumours are true, the iPad Pro would be significantly larger than the current iPad Air 2. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). Mr Kuo said he doesn't expect Apple's debut stylus to have a range of smart features. Instead, Apple will add them gradually, or users could choose which ones they wanted. Another patent for an Apple stylus is shown . In particular, the stylus could be used with Apple's rumoured 'super' tablet, dubbed iPad Pro (leaked mould pictured). Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm) Apple's iPad Pro is expected to have either a 12.2-inch or 12.9-inch display. A stylus (patent image pictured) could help productivity on the giant tablet . By comparison, the iPad Air 2 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm). The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen. This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's 12.2-inch Galaxy Note Pro, which launched in February. The leaked sketch, also reportedly taken by an employee who works at Foxconn seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound. The image was released by French website Nowhere Else, which has previously leaked details  from unannounced smartphones and Apple gadgets which proved to be true, citing a Foxconn source. The source said that initial testing for the iPad Air Plus was stopped in the summer and Apple’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet.","Apple was awarded its first smart stylus patents back in 2012 .

"An oil pipeline breach spilled up to 50,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana. But the spill, which occurred at 10 a.m. on Saturday, does not pose a threat to public safety or health, according to Montana officials. And while some of the oil did get into the water, the area where it spilled was frozen over and that could help reduce the impact, said Dave Parker, a spokesman for Governor Steve Bullock. An oil pipeline breach spilled up to 50,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana . Parker said: 'We think it was caught pretty quick, and it was shut down. The governor is committed to making sure the river is cleaned up.' Bridger Pipeline Company said in the statement that it shut down the 12-inch-wide pipeline shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday. Tad True, vice president of Bridger said: 'Our primary concern is to minimize the environmental impact of the release and keep our responders safe as we clean up from this unfortunate incident.' Governor Steve Bullock, pictured, said he is committed to making sure 'the river is cleaned up' The EPA and state Department of Environmental Quality have responded to the area about nine miles up river from Glendive, Parker said. An Exxon Mobil Corp. pipeline broke near Laurel during flooding in July 2011, releasing 63,000 gallons of oil that washed up along an 85-mile stretch of riverbank. Montana officials are trying to determine if oil could have been trapped by sediment and debris and settled into the riverbed. Exxon Mobil is facing state and federal fines of up to $3.4 million from the spill. The company has said it spent $135 million on the cleanup and other work. Montana and federal officials notified Exxon that they intend to seek damages for injuries to birds, fish and other natural resources from the 2011 spill. The company also is being asked to pay for long-term environmental studies and for lost opportunities for fishing and recreation during and since the cleanup.","The spill, occurred at 10 a.m. on Saturday according to Montana officials .

"Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell used a 'King Day' speech at a breakfast hosted by Al Sharpton to promote Obamacare. Burwell, who was one of two Obama administration officials to speak, asked attendees of the National Action Network breakfast to 'tell your neighbors and tell your friends' to sign up for health care insurance. 'In the spirit of Dr. King, we're asking you to help us again, in big ways and small,' Obama's health czar told the activist organization, calling on them to help HHS sign up as many African Americans as possible before the Feb. 15 close of the current open enrollment period. Scroll down for video . Sylvia Burwell, Health and Human Services Secretary, is pictured here on Meet the Press in the November.  At a breakfast today in Washington, D.C. hosted by Al Sharpton, she called on the mostly black audience to encourage their friends to sign up for Obamacare 'inn the spirit of Dr. King' NAN was a vehicle for Obamacare sign ups in 2013, utilizing its 75 chapters to host enrollment events all across the country, and worked directly with the White House and HHS on its advocacy efforts. Blasting the GOP as the ' ""Party of No"" without any concrete alternatives for resolving many of our major dilemmas today' the National Action Network said in a memo earlier this month that the Republican Party, now in control of Congress, was attempting to 'reverse much of what we have gained.' 'Their first order of business: repealing health care reform. Our first order of business: ensuring that they do not succeed,' it said, referring to Republican leaders' promises that one of their first votes in the new legislative session would be to repeal Obamacare. 'If the Republican-led Congress has its way...all of President Obama’s efforts would have been in vain. And all of our futures, and our children’s futures will be held in the balance. Once our collective health deteriorates, so does the nucleus of our country,' the memo said. In her remarks Burwell explained that blacks still have the lowest life expediencies of all Americans, and black women are 40 percent more likely to die of breast cancer. African Americans are also more likely to be uninsured than white Americans, she said. 'Our lingering disparities are clear,' she contended. But 'thanks to the Affordable Care Act,' she said, '7.8 million African Americans with private insurance now have access to expanded preventative services with no cost sharing.' From October of 2013 to June 2014, Burwell said, 1.7 million African Americans ages 18-64 gained health insurance coverage -  a 6.8 percent drop in the uninsured over that time. 'These changes are helping people all over the country get the care that they need,' she added. 'This progress was made possible because people like you all helped us make this a reality. You stood with us when no one thought a bill was going to happen,' she told the roughly 225 breakfast-goers. Continuing, she said, 'You stood with us through the first health care employment....And I thank you for standing with us now. 'You are ambassadors to our communities, and you are the voices that people trust.' Encouraging the attendees to spread the word about Obamacare, Burwell said it's 'easier than ever' to sign up now online, in person or over the phone. 'Financial help is available. This can be affordable,' she said, revealing that 87 percent of enrollees in Obamacare this year are receiving financial aid from the government. Surrounded by members of Eric Garner's family, Reverend Al Sharpton is pictured here at a press conference in late December at National Action Network headquarters to denounce the violence done in Mr. Garner's name. Sharpton said today that his organization would pay tribute to two New York police officers who were murdered in retaliation for the black man's death at the hands of police . Sharpton also lauded Obamacare during his introductory remarks, and Burwell's efforts to keep it from going off the skids, telling the mostly-black audience that 'she has not just shown a real commitment to making sure that one of the most historic, progressive moves of this president [will] bear the fruit that it was designed to bear.' 'Against great odds and against every effort to undermine,' he said, Burwell 'delivered for the millions of people around this country that depended on this president to keep this commitment.' Burwell's 'not on the front page unless somethin' messes up, but she does the work,,' he said, 'and makes sure that the vision of this president, around providing health care, is a reality in the lives of millions of lives of millions of people who wouldn't have it.' Sharpton said, 'Martin Luther King Day, if it means anything, is serving the unserved, and giving security to those that live every day in anxiety. And on King on day, no one had done that more than our Secretary of Health and Human Services.' Burwell and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro were featured speakers at the Washington, D.C. event honoring the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Castro said the country was at a moment of 'momentum in our economy,' citing the decreasing unemployment rate. He credited President Barack Obama with America's 'economic comeback.' Speaking of his own department's work, he reminded the audience of Obama's newly announced reduction in FHA loan premiums, which the administration hopes will allow a 'person of low means' to come up with the funding to buy his or her first home. 'We still know there is tremendous work to be done out there,' however, he said. Sharpton said that the activists in the room must keep the issues plaguing the black community 'out front' until they are resolved. 'And if you don't do that, people are not going to deal with those issues in the dark,' he added. 'Our job is to put the lights on where they don't want to go,' Sharpton said. 'We're hitting situations that most people don't want hit.' At a lunch time event today at NAN's New York City headquarters, Sharpton will be joined by New York Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, as well as NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. Afterward Sharpton, along with the family of chokehold victim Eric Garner, and 'hundreds' of others, according to National Action Network, will be bused to the spot where New York City police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were murdered in retaliation for Garner's death. There they will hold a wreath laying ceremony for the slain officers. 'Dr. King was about fighting for justice, but he was also about standing against senseless violence,' Sharpton said this morning. 'It's important on King Day that we send a message. That yes, we want to see justice in specific cases. But that we're not anti-police. Most police are good, and risk their lives every day,' he said. This evening Sharpton and Garner's family will also hold a vigil at the site where Garner was confronted by police just before he died. 'In the spirit of Dr. King, we start with those who have influence, we go to New York with the mayors and others, and then we go to show that we denounce the violence against police, but we have the right to question specific cases. 'That's what Dr. King did,' Sharpton said, and that's how the National Action Network will honor his legacy.","HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell asked Sharpton's network of activists to 'tell your neighbors and tell your friends' to sign up for health care insurance .

"Couples who decide to get healthy together are more likely to be successful, suggests a new study. Researchers found people are more successful in taking up healthy habits if their partner makes positive changes too. Scientists at University College London (UCL) looked at how likely people were to quit smoking, start being active, or lose weight in relation to what their partner did. Scroll down for video . Scientists at University College London (UCL) looked at how likely people were to quit smoking, start being active, or lose weight in relation to what their partner did . The findings, published in the journal Internal Medicine, show that people were more successful in swapping bad habits for good ones if their partner made a change as well. Among women who smoked, 50 per cent managed to quit if their partner gave up smoking too at the same time, compared with 17 per cent of women whose partners were already non-smokers, and eight per cent of those whose partners were regular smokers. The study found that men were equally affected by their partners and were more likely to quit smoking, get active, or lose weight if their partner made the same behaviour change. The research looked at 3,722 couples, either married or living together and over the age of 50. Researchers found people are more successful in taking up healthy habits if their partner makes positive changes too . Study co-author Professor Jane Wardle, director of Cancer Research UK's Health Behaviour Research Centre at UCL, said: 'Unhealthy lifestyles are a leading cause of death from chronic disease worldwide. 'The key lifestyle risks are smoking, excess weight, physical inactivity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. 'Swapping bad habits for good ones can reduce the risk of disease, including cancer.' Dr Sarah Jackson, lead author of the study at UCL, said: 'Now is the time to make New Year's resolutions to quit smoking, take exercise, or lose weight. 'And doing it with your partner increases your chances of success.' Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: 'Making lifestyle changes can make a big difference to our health and cancer risk. 'And this study shows that when couples make those changes together they are more likely to succeed. 'Getting some support can help people take up good habits. For example if you want to lose weight and have a friend or colleague who's trying to do the same thing you could encourage each other by joining up for a run or a swim at lunchtime or after work. 'And local support such as stop smoking services are very effective at helping people to quit. 'Keeping healthy by not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight and being active can all lower the risk of cancer, and the more people can help and encourage each other the better.'","Scientists at University College London tested couples giving up habits .

"Improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near '100 per cent efficiency' in trials using mice, a leading scientist has warned. Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children. The warning follows a breakthrough in April in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living, adult mice using the Crispr-Cas9 gene editing technique. Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist from the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children . The Crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies. 'We used a pair of molecular scissors and a molecular sat nav that tells the scissors where to cut,' Dr Perry told James Gallagher at the BBC. 'It's a case of 'you shoot you score'...On the human side, one has to be very cautious.' Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. Crispr technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could be used to create designer babies . The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure.

For decades, designer babies - modified for health, beauty and intelligence - have been the reserve of science fiction. But Crispr technology could change all that. Dr Perry told the BBC that it may soon find its way into fertility treatments. 'There are heritable diseases coded by mutations in DNA and some people could say, ""I don't want my children to have these mutations.""' He says it is up to society, and not just scientists, to look at the implications and decide whether the technology is worth the risk. Beyond simply addressing health concerns, many are worried that the technology can be used to give babies desirable traits, such as changing the colour of their eyes. Nuffield Council on Bioethics director, Hugh Whittall, said the issue raises questions of social justice, with the technique only available to the rich. Beyond simply addressing health concerns, many are worried that the technology can be used to give babies desirable traits, such as changing the colour of their eyes, by permanently turning off genes at the DNA level . The trend towards services such as this has already begun. For instance, Genepeeks last year announced a system that can create 'virtual babies' by digitally combining the DNA of two people is set to launch. These virtual babies can then be screened for genetic diseases, before ruling out sperm donors or partners who could pose a risk to a potential baby's health. In theory, the technology could be used to screen potential babies for traits other than diseases. It would also fall outside rules used to regulate embryo testing and screening. The technology's patent includes a list of traits that aren't necessarily related to health – such as eye and skin pigmentation, according to a report by Catherine de Lange in New Scientist. 'Where it is more ethically challenging is when you expand beyond couples in desperate need for a donor, to couples that are just interested in more trivial things,' Dagan Wells at the University of Oxford told the magazine. Professor Lovell-Badge from the UK Research Medical Council told the BBC News website that despite concerns, the issue is something that needs to start being debated. 'There has been a blanket ban on germ-line therapy, so there needs to be a debate about that and some rational thought rather than knee-jerk reactions that, ""No you can't possibly do that.""'","Warning issued by Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath .

"An 18-year-old who allegedly blazed a trail of crime across the South with his 13-year-old girlfriend has appeared in court for the first time since fleeing Kentucky. Dalton Hayes, who along with Cheyenne Phillips, 13, drew comparisons with Bonnie and Clyde after they went on the run together, appeared via video-link from a jail in Panama City, Florida. Appearing today on-screen at the Bay County Courthouse, Hayes, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, confirmed his identity and agreed to go back to Kentucky to face charges there. Scroll down for video . Extradition: Dalton Hayes, 18, appeared at a courthouse in Bay County, Florida, Monday morning. He confirmed his identity, then signed papers consenting to be extradited . Hearing: Hayes, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, scratched himself in front of the judge during the brief hearing . Taken home: The sheriff in Grayson County, Kentucky, said he would take Hayes back in a separate car to his girlfriend, Cheyenne Phillips, 13 . During the brief appearance Hayes, wearing handcuffs on-screen, scratched himself several times while being addressed, before agreeing to sign the paperwork. The couple were tracked down Sunday evening to an IHOP parking lot in the city, where cops found them sleeping in a stolen pick-up truck. The vehicle was allegedly the third they had stolen. The pair are also accused of stealing two guns inside one car . Their two-week spree is believed to have taken them from Kentucky, into Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia and finally Florida. They were spotted begging at an undisclosed location in Florida on Friday, and were arrested Sunday night in an IHOP parking lot. They did not put up a fight. Hayes waived the right to an extradition hearing, which means he will be taken back to Grayson County, Kentucky, from which he first fled with his girlfriend Phillips, whom he initially thought was 19. Caught: Hayes, pictured above in an IHOP parking lot in Panama City Beach, Florida, agreed to be extradited home to Kentucky . Together: Hayes, pictured above with girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, 13, had been on the run for two weeks. He is said to have initially been convinced Phillips was 19 . Spree: Shown above are the known sightings of the pair, from their disappearance until their arrest . During the brief hearing, he told the judge: 'I'll sign the papers so I can go back to Kentucky.' Charges: Hayes, who acknowledged charges against him, is facing counts of burglary, theft and trespass . The Grayson County sheriff, Norman Chaffins, said Sunday night that he had spoken to Hayes, who is 'very scared' about facing the consequences of his actions. He said: 'I spoke to Dalton and he was very scared, and he wanted to come home. He wanted me to come bring him home.' Chaffins told NBC News that the pair would be taken back in separate cars. Hayes and Phillips are expected to be back in Kentucky by the end of the week. Phillips has been taken to an undisclosed 'safe location', but is not in the state's custody, according to officials. A spokesman for the Florida Department of Children & Families said: 'The juvenile has been taken to a safe location until arrangements with the family are made'. Authorities said the U.S. Marshal's Service and Panama City Beach Police discovered Hayes and Phillips asleep in a car stolen from Georgia. In Kentucky, the two teens will face charges including burglary, theft, criminal trespassing and criminal mischief, Chaffins said. Phillips will face charges in juvenile court because she is a minor. Chaffins said he was relieved the crime spree ended peacefully. If the couple had not been found asleep and surrounded, he said, they may have run again. Busted: Hayes, pictured center in shorts, was taken in alongside Phillips, who will be processed through the juvenile courts system . Spotted: Hayes and Phillips were pictured above at a Walmart in South Carolina, where they allegedly forged checks to get money to finance their spree . Hayes and Phillips began their run from the law and their families earlier this month when they vanished from their small hometown in western Kentucky. Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin, had urged her son and his companion to surrender and 'face the consequences.' She spoke today of her relief at their safe return. She told NBC: 'The first thing I'm going to do when I see him is hug him and tell him I love him - and then I might smack him.' Martin said the couple had been dating for about three months. She said the girl portrayed herself as being 19, and the family, including Hayes, believed her. She said Cheyenne 'would go in and write checks, and she would come out with cigarettes and stuff, so I didn't have any reason not to believe she wasn't 19.' It has since emerged that the pair announced on Facebook that they were 'engaged' just before they fled. She even said Phillips told Hayes she was pregnant, and gave him a supposed ultrasound scan - though Martins appeared not to think the claims stood up to scrutiny. One of three: The pair stand accused of stealing three pickup trucks over the two-week period.

Moms: Phillips's mother Sherry Peters, left, and Dalton's mother Tammy Martin, right, both begged their children to give themselves up and come home. Martin added today that she wanted to give her son a hug - then 'smack him' When he hit the road, Hayes was running away from trouble back home. He faces burglary and theft charges in his home county, stemming from an arrest late last year, according to Grayson County court records. He was planning to be at the local judicial center on January 5 to find out whether a grand jury had indicted him on the charges. His case did not come up, but by that time the teens were gone. Chaffins said the couple's behavior had become 'increasingly brazen and dangerous.' Twice, the teens were able to evade law officers in Kentucky. They allegedly crashed the first truck they stole, then hid in the woods. Then they later stole another truck nearby, Chaffins said. At one point, the two were spotted at a Wal-Mart in South Carolina, where the teens are thought to have passed two stolen checks. Authorities said they believe they then headed to Georgia and stole a pickup truck southeast of Atlanta.","Dalton Hayes, 18, appeared video link in Bay County, Florida, on Monday .

"Unable to travel: Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings broke his leg in a Utah ski accident in December rendering him unable to attend this year's CES Las Vegas global technology event . Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was in a ski accident over the holidays that was bad enough to put the newly minted billionaire in the hospital and prevent him from traveling. Hastings, who co-founded the streaming entertainment leader in 1997, was vacationing in Utah last month when the accident occurred. The broken leg the executive suffered prevented him from attending 2015's CES Las Vegas global technology event. He prominently represented the company at the previous year's event. At the 2014 CES, Hastings helped support the launch of an LG smart TV. On January 5, Netflix Chief Streaming and Partnerships Officer Greg Peters appeared on stage to tout the company where schedules had previously indicated Hastings would be. Early this month, Netflix spokesperson Marlee Moseley told Svenska Dagbladet: 'He is doing well and is recovering nicely, but he can not travel at the moment.' Reached for comment by the Daily Mail on Monday, Moseley revealed Hastings had broken his leg. Moseley said Hastings planned to do the company's earnings call via video on Tuesday. Now 54, the Massachusetts native earned a bachelors degree from Bowdoin College in 1983 followed by an MSCS in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University in 1988, according to his corporate bio page. Between his degrees, Hastings served in Swaziland with the Peace Corps. He founded Pure Software in 1991. After that successful venture was acquired by Rational Software in 1997, Hastings would go on to co-found Netflix. Despite some leadership stumbles--most notably when the company made the leap to become predominantly a streaming service in 2011--Hastings has helped lead his company to the head of digital streaming pack. Hastings became a billionaire in 2014. Netflix Chief Streaming and Partnerships Officer Greg Peters (left) appeared at CES 2015, apparently in Hastings' stead.

"A six-day-old baby boy said to have 'spontaneously combusted' is being tested by doctors in India. The child was admitted to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH) in Chennai after allegedly bursting into flames and is being given round-the-clock care. The boy's mother, who gave her name as K Rajeswari, said her baby caught fire on Thursday, six days after he was born, with his feet bursting into flames. Scroll down for video . A six-day-old baby boy said to have 'spontaneously combusted' is being tested by doctors in Chennai (pictured), India . A team of five doctors at KMCH, including paediatricians, psychiatrists and plastic surgeons are running tests on the boy. Dr N Gunasekaran, dean of the hospital, said: 'We have sent wound swabs for tests. The results will be out in two days. 'We will decide on further tests and treatment on Monday.' This is not the first time that Ms Rajeswari, 22, has claimed that one of her children has spontaneously caught fire. Ms Rajeswari (right), 22, claimed in 2013 that her other son Rahul had also spontaneously combusted . She brought her three-month-old son Rahul to the hospital in August 2013 and claimed he had caught fire - for the fourth time. Doctors ran a series of tests on the boy and found that he had not spontaneously combusted, raising concerns that he may have been abused by relatives or burnt in an accidental fire. ‘People thought I set him on fire deliberately,’ his mother, Rajeswari said at the time. Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) has been implied as a cause of death in a number of documented cases where burned corpses have been found without an apparent external source of ignition. An estimated 200 cases have been found throughout history and victims are often elderly, sick, or under the influence of alcohol, which would explain why they have not been able to escape the flames. Puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘wick theory’ to explain such events. The theory is that the human body can become an ‘inside out’ candle . The person’s clothes are the wick, while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance, that keeps the blaze going. Limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient, with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top. Some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark.","Baby rushed to hospital after parents claim he 'spontaneously combusted'

"One day after Julie Bishop set social media alight about her missing earring, Prime Minister Tony Abbott this morning opened up about his own fashion choices. In his first interview since returning from annual leave on with Sydney's WSFM, Mr Abbott said he had not been able to help his Foreign Minister with her desperate search for her lost pearl earring. 'I don't actually have any earrings myself. I haven't been able to help,' he said, before adding: 'I've got several pairs of budgie smugglers'. But it seems Mr Abbott - who has not been spotted in public with his famous togs for some time - has received some advice about wearing them out in public. 'They should be neither seen nor heard, I'm told'. Scroll down for video . Fashion choice: Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had been told his togs should be 'neither seen nor heard' Julie Bishop appeared live in the Sky News studio in Sydney's Martin Place with one pearl earring missing . The Foreign Minister set Twitter alight on Monday when she appeared in the Sky News studio in Sydney's Martin Place with one pearl earring noticeably missing. Later on Monday morning she tweeted: 'Hi Twitter I lost earring in Martin Place today - if found grateful contact me 02 62777500.' Ms Bishop appeared on Sky to talk about the Bali Nine members on death row in Indonesia and an asylum seeker hunger strike on Manus Island. Ms Bishop may be one of the most powerful women in Australia but she often uses her Twitter account to show a more personal side. The Foreign Minister took to Twitter on Christmas morning to wish everyone a happy holiday with the help of a few emojis. Her message included Christmas trees, presents, Santa Claus, family and music. Many humorously opted to relate Ms Bishop's tweet to same-sex marriage equality after she included emojis of two women and two men holding hands. The earrings are a favourite pair of the foreign minister's - she has been seen wearing them numerous times .

The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security last year. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin  at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine. The Foreign Minister was further regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies. Ms Bishop was also listed as one of the 50 most powerful women in Australia of 2014 by the Australian Women's Weekly. She told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'living then dream and loving the job'. 'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said. 'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.' The 58-year-old politician is a fan of ‘investment pieces’ such as Armani suits . Ms Bishop accessorises with brooches in a look inspired by US politician Hilary Clinton . She's a big fan of Louis Vuitton and Christian Louboutin heels - particularly the red stiletto kind . Ms Bishop revealed due to high demanding job, she only gets four hours sleep a night but still manages to fit in a workout each day. While she famously wears Giorgio Armani suits and has a love for pearl necklaces, a departmental document reveals many of the other requests that follow Ms Bishop all over the world in her role as Foreign Minister. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document contains insider information on her non-stop professional life and personal preferences when travelling. The note shows that Ms Bishop leads a healthy lifestyle, saying that she is a 'non-smoker', and 'prefers to eat healthily but not a fussy eater and open to try local foods. The document also makes note of her love of running, saying under 'Personal Time' that she requests '1 hour (early morning) for exercise.'

She prefers 'English Breakfast tea with skim milk or peppermint tea', but isn't demanding, noting that there is 'no need to provide in hotel room.' Ms Bishop 'Prefers sparkling water, however will drink wine or Champagne at appropriate functions,' the document states. The Foreign Minister also likes to be prepared for small talk as well as large issues, with the document revealing that she likes to be given a 'snippet' of local information 'to start conversation with interlocuters', and gives the example of meeting New York Mayor as 'Yankees scraped into the finals this week'.

"Convicted rapist William Danga was allowed to stay in the country . MPs last night accused the Home Office of 'complete failure' as it emerged killers, rapists and sex attackers are among 760 foreign criminals allowed to go on the run. The 'dysfunctional' department had still not managed to get a grip on the shambolic system for deporting overseas convicts, Westminster's public accounts committee said. In addition to the criminals who have simply vanished, 151 inmates were freed without even being considered for removal. Meanwhile, £6.2million in compensation was paid to 229 foreign national offenders because of Home Office delays in dealing with their cases – an average of £27,000 each. MPs were scathing about the lack of progress since 2006 when then Home Secretary Charles Clarke was forced to resign over the failure to boot out 1,000 foreign criminals. Since then, the number of officials working on deportations has increased by 800, from 100 to 900. But, incredibly, the number of overseas convicts clogging Britain's packed jails remains stuck at 10,000. The annual cost of managing and removing foreign criminals is estimated at £850million. In a joint statement, committee chairman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, and Tory Richard Bacon made a blistering attack on the Home Office. They said: 'There has been a complete failure to improve the management and removal of foreign national offenders. Despite firm commitments to improve and a massive ten-fold increase in resources, the system still appears dysfunctional.' The MPs add: 'Processing foreign national offender cases for removal starts too late, takes too long and costs too much. At the most basic, it takes on average 32 days to send out the 50-question paper form to start the process and almost half of these forms are ignored or not returned. 'The approach to case working is grossly inefficient, often featuring avoidable processing delays and administrative errors.' Of the many failures highlighted in the report, arguably the most serious is the loss of contact with 760 ex-inmates. They were released pending deportation, with strict instructions to stay in contact with the Home Office. Westminster's public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP, made a blistering attack on the Home Office . The Conservatives are to use a new Bill of Rights to stop criminals using Human Rights as a 'get out of jail free card'. Tory lawyers have prepared a draft bill which would stop violent criminals, suspected terrorists and illegal immigrants from claiming the right to a 'family life' to avoid being deported. British judges would be given the power to ignore rulings from the the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. It could include rulings against the ban on prisoners voting and the police joining trade unions, The Times reported. But Lord Pannick, QC, a leading human rights lawyer and cross-bench peer, told the newspaper that the bill's architects were using human rights as 'a political tool to be manipulated for narrow and partisan advantage'. Former Tory Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said: 'If the purpose of this proposal is to take the UK back to where it was before the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, I am pretty relaxed about it — as long as we do not remove the convention itself and retain its authority, which is so vital in dealing with dictatorships and despots.' However, they have since vanished and cannot be traced. They include as many as 12 killers, 11 rapists, 152 drug dealers, at least 23 other sex offenders – including five paedophiles – 33 robbers and 46 violent thugs. Overall, there are 4,200 foreign criminals walking Britain's streets who are subject to deportation proceedings. All serious foreign criminals should at least be considered for removal but, in 151 cases since 2009, this did not happen. This group includes three burglars, 19 robbers and eight sex offenders. Officials have since traced 141 of them, but ten remain at large. The public accounts committee, Westminster's spending watchdog, highlighted a string of delays and other failings. For example, only 30 per cent of foreign nationals arrested were checked against a key overseas database for a criminal record last year. MPs say at least £70million a year could be saved if police forces made better use of the information available on this and other databases. If officials identify a person has a criminal conviction overseas, they can kick them out at an early stage. Currently, there are over 5,600 foreign national offenders still in prison, immigration removal centres or living in the community after the end of their sentence while the Home Office continues to try to deport them. To MPs' fury, the Home Office has not been deciding whether to deport foreign national offenders until 18 months before their earliest removal date. Inmates then submit countless appeals to further delay the process. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'This is a damning report of failure and incompetence in Theresa May's Home Office. Previous home secretaries have resigned over this kind of thing. These findings come hot on the heels of reports showing growing backlogs in asylum claims, thousands of failed asylum seekers going missing, and major failures in background checks on people claiming British citizenship, which meant a killer was able to become a British citizen.' Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said the failings showed a 'desperate need to tear up the system and start again'. Immigration minister James Brokenshire said 22,000 foreign criminals had been removed since 2010 despite an almost 30 per cent surge in appeals. He said last year's Immigration Act, which cuts appeal routes for foreign criminals from 17 to four, and other measures 'will help us identify, remove and ban more foreign criminals than ever before'. Rapist: Sex attacker William Danga . A convicted sex attacker who raped two children fought deportation on human rights grounds. William Danga, 42, was also jailed for a separate rape of a teenager. One of the children was just four years old when she was abused by the Congolese national. A judge said in 2011 that it was 'remarkable' Danga had not been thrown out of Britain after he raped the 16-year-old. Yet the rapist was freed on immigration bail while he challenged the move on the grounds that he had a right to a family life. It was deemed that Danga had a right to remain with his family because he has a girlfriend and a young child. Danga also stalled the deportation process following claims that he had 'mislaid' his passport. It is believed that Danga is still in Britain.","Department that deports overseas convicts is labelled as 'dysfunctional'

"Australia was settled by a wave of immigrants from India little more than 4,000 years ago, a genetic study shows. The finding overturns the view that the continent was isolated from the time it was first colonised about 45,000-50,000 years ago until Europeans discovered Australia in the eighteenth century. DNA evidence suggests that rather than complete most of the journey over several generations by foot, the Indian migrants came over by boat. By the time the Indian settlers reached Australia the ancient land bridge was under water so they sailed. Australia’s first human colonisation was the culmination of the long walk out of Africa by the human species. Humans are believed to have left Africa, via the Arabian coast and through India before reaching Indonesia and New Guinea and finally over an ancient land bridge to Australia. Following their arrival there was, according to ‘the prevailing view’, little if any contact between Australia’s Aboriginal inhabitants and the rest of the world. But DNA evidence has now revealed a second wave of human settlement took place about 4,230 years ago, long before the first European settled there. Australia was first seen by a European in 1606 when it was sighted from a ship and a further 53 vessels arrived before Captain James Cook arrived in 1770 to claim it for Britain. Analysis of DNA samples from Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territories of Australia today shows that they have up to 11 per cent of their genetic heritage is Indian . The new settlers came from India and the . lack of their DNA in other parts of Asia suggests they sailed directly . across the Indian Ocean rather than work their way towards Australia by . foot. Scientists found strong evidence of a wave of settlers from India reaching Australia 141 generations ago. Aborignals who took part in the study were found to have up to 11 per cent of their DNA from Indian descent. Intriguingly, their arrival corresponds to evidence in the archaeological record that shows dingos reached Australia about the same time, suggesting they may have been transported by boat by the human settlers. Dr Irina Pugach, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said the international research team calculated that the Indian DNA reached the Aboriginal population 141 generations ago. Assuming that each generation is . separated on average by 30 years the geneticists were able to conclude . that the Indian population arrived on in Australia 4230 years ago. James Cook was born in Marton, in Yorkshire, in 1728. He worked for a shopkeeper before joining the Navy. In 1768 he set off in HM bark Endeavour, a former collier, on a secret mission to find land for King George III. In 1770 Cook located the east coast of Australia named it New South Wales and claimed it for Britain. He was killed in 1779 by islanders on Hawaii. ‘Interestingly this date also coincides with many changes in the archaeological record of Australia, which include a sudden change in plant processing and stone tool technologies, with microliths appearing for the first time, and the first appearance of the dingo in the fossil record,’ she said. ‘Since we detect inflow of genes from India into Australia at around the same time, it is likely that these changes were related to this migration.’ Mark Stoneking, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute, led the study and told Nature magazine: ‘Australia is thought to represent one of the earliest migrations for humans after they left Africa, but it seemed pretty isolated after that.’ DNA from 344 people was analysed for the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Samples were taken from people in Papua New Guinea, South East Asia, China, the US and Australia’s Northern Territory. The dingo is thought to have reached Australia with humans about 4,230 years ago.","Genes reveal that a wave of Indian migrants arrived 4,230 years ago .

"With her bulging forehead, double chin and thin pursed lips, Jane Seymour was no oil painting…if Tudor oil paintings are to be believed. Twenty-first century actresses, meanwhile, tend to have a natural beauty. Which has left the makers of the BBC's big budget adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall with something of a dilemma. Scroll down for video . Historian Lucy Worsley has reportedly said that Kate Phillips, pictured left, who plays Henry VIII's wife Jane Seymour, portrait pictured right, in BBC drama Wolf Hall is too pretty . While they have gone to great lengths to nail down historical details for the drama, they have been accused by a TV historian of casting a woman who is 'too pretty' to play Henry VIII's third wife. The public largely gets its image of Seymour from the portrait of her by Tudor artist Hans Holbein, depicting her with a noticeably large forehead. However, she is played in the series by Kate Phillips, 25, who cannot be faulted when it comes to her looks. According to Lucy Worsley, 41, chief curator at Historic Royal Palaces, Miss Phillips – in her first professional role – has features which are too dainty. Miss Worsley said: 'She's too pretty. I did challenge Peter Kosminsky [the director] about that. He laughed and said, 'I picked her because of her acting, not because of her forehead'.' Homeland star Damian Lewis plays Henry VIII in the six-part series on the rapid rise to power of Sir Thomas Cromwell in King Henry's court. But, speaking yesterday, the historian said it was not a remark she would extend to the whole cast, which includes Homeland star Damien Lewis, 43, and Claire Foy, 30. She said: 'They are not all fantastically good looking, are they? 'Mark Rylance [who plays Thomas Cromwell] has a wonderful craggy, creased face and, on the whole, as a cast I would say they are human rather than beautiful. It's not like it's been turned into a pageant show.' Reverend Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at the University of Oxford, said he didn't see Miss Phillips' beauty as a problem: 'Ideas of beauty change from century to century and you might as well make them beautiful on our terms, because it's quite possible that the portraits of Jane Seymour that we've got were meant to flatter and give the impression that she was a beautiful woman.' Historians also pointed out that Montacute House in Somerset, which was used to portray Greenwich Palace, is Elizabethan . Author Dame Hilary has  said courtiers would have had white teeth, as sugar was not yet widely available. She also said members of the court would not have been covered in filth . He continued that while the show is not an 'exact fit on the history', it is an impressive 'evocation of the period'. Wolf Hall, which starts tomorrow night on BBC Two, is a six-part adaptation of Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies novels. Miss Worsley questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme, claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day. She said: 'What Hilary Mantel has done is made these characters people for our times, which is interesting for a historian to watch. They are immensely modern, they won't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top. 'I think it will make people think the Tudors were just like us in many ways. That's a massive historical question, in some ways they were and in some ways they weren't.' The programme-makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy – including an unexpected insistence on straight, white teeth and pristine linen. Mantel said a Tudor drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers – as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available.","Historians have spotted a series of faux pas in BBC drama Wolf Hall .

Cuts: In a move that has shocked many pundits, a number of banks on Wall Street including Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan have cut thousands of jobs, as well as bonuses and expenses money (file image) Although some analysts were left stunned by the financial and job cuts, others believe there were a number of warning signs in advance, the New York Post reported. These include lower trading and commodities revenues, currency risks and the lower trending of long-term interest rates, In the fourth quarter, thousands of bank employees were fired. During 2014, a total of 20,000 workers lost their jobs at Brian Moynihan’s Bank of America, while a further 10,000 were cut at Michael Corbat's Citigroup, formed from two companies in 1998. Meanwhile, 10,000 jobs were lost at Jaime Dimon’s JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley reported last week. And even Goldman Sachs did not escape the cuts - suffering a double-digit decline in revenues. 'Look, I think head count in the banking industry is likely to decline,” said CLSA bank analyst Mike Mayo. 'And if this environment remains, headcount would get significantly reduced.'

Mr Mayo went so far as to say bank revenues appear to be the weakest in eight decades - and are only likely to worsen given the current economic climate. 'I think there have been heavy potential and paper losses at this point,' agreed Tim Quast, president of market analytics company, ModernIR, blaming the losses on plunging oil prices. He added: 'Clearly, nobody bet properly on oil. Nobody thought it was going to be below 50 a barrel.'

"This is the dramatic moment two sledgehammer-wielding raiders stormed into an upmarket jewellers and stole £200,000 in watches - including a rare £50,000 Rolex. The men, both wearing crash helmets, were filmed on CCTV bursting into the store in Manchester city centre just before 4.30pm on Thursday. The thieves used a long-handled sledgehammer to smash their way into the shop, with the tool then being employed to shatter the display case. Scroll down for video . Break-in: Two men were caught on CCTV smashing their way into a boutique jewellery store in Manchester city centre on Thursday - escaping with £200,000 worth of luxury watches . Once inside the boutique, The Cheshire Watch Company, the men let off a smoke bomb, which sent clouds billowing from the shop and caused staff to become disorientated. While one smashed the counter displays, grabbing eight men's watches including three Rolexes and five Cartiers  - the other held the doors open. After breaking into the The Cheshire Watch Company, thieves escaped with eight watches worth a staggering £200,000. Here are their models: . 1. Cartier Ballon Bleu: £15,900 . 2. Cartier Santos: £3,250 . 3. Cartier Tank: £11,100, . 4. Cartier Tank Ang: £23,800 . 5. Cartier Tortue: £10,500 . 6. Rolex 116505: £25,100, . 7.

No customers were inside at the time and the pair ran back into the street after the raid and escaped on a Honda NSS 300 moped. The bike was later found abandoned in the car park of the Grosvenor Casino on Ramsgate Street. Having trawled through CCTV images provided by the casino, police have now issued the picture of a man they wish to question in connection with the robbery. He is described as white, around 5ft 10in tall, slim build and dark brown hair. He was wearing a blue puffer jacket with a hood and red logo, grey jeans and white trainers. A police spokesman said: 'The main opportunity for officers now is going to be tracking the offenders when they try to sell the watches on. 'They will inevitably look to off-load them and we are talking about rare timepieces that are both very expensive and quite recognisable. 'I would urge the public to be vigilant and to contact police if they believe someone has tried to sell them one of these watches.' Smash-and-grab: One of the thieves uses a sledgehammer to break the display glass while his companion holds both doors open to prevent them from automatically locking . Police originally said 25 watches were snatched from the boutique on King Street West, but bosses have now confirmed the figure to be eight, together worth a whopping £200,000. The most expensive is the Rolex GMT Master II and is worth £47,900, with diamonds and sapphires embedded in its face and rim. All but one of the watches are solid gold. Haul: The two men escaped on a moped with eight expensive watches worth a staggering £200,000 . Smoke bomb: The device was let off during the raid to disorientate staff and sent clouds of smoke billowing out of the shop door . Police would like to speak to this man in connection with the robbery. He was filmed on CCTV at the Grosvenor Casino, near to where the getaway moped was dumped . Bosses have now released the serial numbers, descriptions and photographs of all the stolen timepieces as part of a fresh appeal - and a 'large reward' remains on offer. The same boutique was targeted by robbers in September 2013 but they left empty-handed after smashing through the main window. The store was due to open again today. A company spokesman said: 'We are appealing for anyone with any information about the watches to contact police as soon as possible.' Clouds of smoke: As the men flee the store, clouds of smoke obscure the view of the CCTV camera . Scene: The raid took place at upmarket jewellers The Cheshire Watch Company in Manchester .

"A far-right 'anti-Islamisation' rally in Germany has been cancelled after a 'concrete threat' to kill one of the protest group's leaders was made. Pegida - or 'patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the west' - have held weekly rallies, with more than 25,000 people at last week's demonstration. But police have banned today's gathering in Dresden because of the murder threat against a founder of the group, which the protesters say came from 'ISIS terrorists'. Scroll down for video . A far-right 'anti-Islamisation' rally - known as Pegida - in Dresden, Germany, has been cancelled after a 'concrete threat' to kill one of the group's leaders . More than 25,000 people took part in the last rally but police have banned the weekly demonstration because of the threat . Organiser Kathrin Oertel (right) said the protest group would not be silenced as she gave a news conference alongside Lutz Bachmann, a founder of the group believed to be the target of the threat . The target of the threat is believed to be Lutz Bachmann, the 41-year-old butcher's son who founded Pegida in November, the Guardian reported. Bachmann has overseen the protests as the group's numbers have grown from a few hundred to tens of thousands in just months. According to a post on Pegida's Facebook page, a 'concrete murder threat' was received. '[The] execution was ordered by the IS terrorists,' it said. Police have not made it clear who made the threat but said it came from a tweet, in Arabic, which described the far-right group as an 'enemy of Islam'. Dresden police chief Dieter Kroll said plotters planned to mingle among protesters before unleashing their attack, with no information on how it would be carried out, leading officials to cancel the demonstration. Pegida instead called on its supporters to hang German flags out of their windows. German police said the threat is believed to have come from an Arabic tweet, while a separate report suggested intelligence officials were investigating a terror attack plot at train stations in Dresden and Berlin . The target of the threat is believed to be Lutz Bachmann, the 41-year-old butcher's son who founded Pegida in November . Pegida rallies have been taking place across Germany, as well as in Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Spain . Co-organiser Kathrin Oertel said the protesters wouldn't be silenced and the cancellation 'doesn't mean that we'll let ourselves be gagged.' Bachmann says another demonstration is planned for next week. A report in German newspaper Der Spiegel also suggested the cancellation came as intelligence sources investigated threats of terrorist attacks at train stations in Berlin an Dresden, as well as a threat to the Pegida rally. Security has been tightened in Europe over the past few weeks in the wake of the attacks in France which killed 17 and a thwarted plot in Belgium. EU foreign ministers are meeting today to discuss terror developments. Pegida rallies have been taking place across Germany, as well as in Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Spain. The anti-Islamisation group want restrictions on foreigners entering Germany and a tightening of asylum laws. German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week joined a Muslim rally against Pegida at the Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin. 'Hatred, racism and extremism have no place in this country,' she said before the march. 'We are a country based on democracy, tolerance and openness to the world.' Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to increase trade with the Far East following a 'wave of Islamisation' in western Europe. The Israeli Prime Minister said rising hostility in Europe had forced his hand into expanding trade with countries like Japan, China and India. 'We definitely want to reduce our dependence on certain markets in western Europe,' Mr Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting yesterday. 'Western Europe is undergoing a wave of Islamisation, of anti-Semitism, and of anti-Zionism. It is awash in such waves, and we want to ensure that for years to come the state of Israel will have diverse markets all over the world.' His remarks came as Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, arrived in Israel with a trade delegation. According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, Europe accounted for 45.8 percent of imports and 35.8 percent of exports in the first 11 months of 2014. Asia accounted for 22.5 percent of Israeli imports and 25.4 percent of exports. Viewers of Israel's parliamentary TV channel were asked: 'Can Israel do without exports to Europe and pursue policy that is liable to bring about an economic embargo?' 62 two percent of Israelis said no and 32 percent said yes.","Far-right Pegida rally in Germany cancelled after threat to kill leader .

"Estate agents, car salesmen and traffic wardens will soon be replaced by robots. This is according to Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a research fellow in UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies, who has predicted that care for the elderly and even children are among the jobs to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings within the next 50 years. Her research suggests human workers across a plethora of service sectors and caring professions could be replaced by droids within our lifetimes. Trustworthy? Dr Aderin-Pocock believes jobs roles such as an estate agent could be replaced with an artificially intelligent robot (artist's impression pictured) in around half a century . She believes that as the rapid advances in technology achieved this century are projected to continue at an astonishing rate, this will allow robots to break free of science fiction and establish themselves in our everyday life. According to her research - which polled 2,000 people about which jobs they thought were most unpopular and could be among the first to be given to robots - traffic wardens (65 per cent), estate agents (40 per cent) and car salesman (33 per cent) could soon be lost to history. 21st century traffic warden: Research showed that images produced droids could give out parking tickets . Dr Alderin-Pocock, who carried out her research with television channel Syfy,  said: 'All this may seem the stuff of science fiction, but actually when you look more closely, science fiction has often led the way for technology development. Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence . The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. 'Look at Captain Kirk's communicator and tell me that it's not a mobile phone - and his system probably did less than the latest smartphones we have today.' Unemployment? Traditional jobs that humans take could become all but extinct . Dr Aderin-Pocock added: 'Which would you prefer to be in the hands of? An overworked, underpaid, disenfranchised worker doing long hours for minimum pay, or a therapeutic robot designed to respond to your every need and engage with you intelligently no matter how many times you have asked the same question? 'Imagine then, that this unit has access to relevant information about an individual's past, so it can respond to and converse with the person; finding ways to simulate their thinking as well as monitoring vital signs in order to flag changes early.' The scientist also believes that this technology could filter down to more care-based jobs: 'Imagine parents or schools being supported by a dedicated childcare unit - your child's personal friend and teacher; a unit that delivers the right levels of work and play, stimulating our kids to achieve more,' she added. Results of the study even hinted that that further advances  could also lead to humans investing in android companions. Nearly half of respondents revealed that advances in technology make them fear for their job in future, with 23 per cent admitting that they think a robot could do their job better or more efficiently than they can. Robo-puss: The poll suggested that we may even turn to technology when seeking companionship . But Dr Aderin-Pocock has a more optimistic perspective, she said: 'History has shown that the advance of technology often leaves us free to explore new avenues and we have adapted accordingly.' She predicts that in the next 50 years many of us will be turning to tourism and some of it will be in space, she anticipates a boom in human space travel where space becomes accessible to all of us. Dr Aderin-Pocock said: 'It is a revolution we have seen before, when the Wright Brothers made their first flight, no one was anticipating Easyjet a mere 100 years later - space tourism could go the same way with no-frills rockets lifting off to space hotels. 'Prices come down due to commercial demand in the same way we have seen with computers, mobile phones and airline flights, all of which were once prohibitively expensive.'","Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock has predicted that care for the elderly and even children could soon to be replaced by artificially intelligent beings .

"Britain’s tourism industry appears to be taking a slight hit as Russian visitors are less willing to travel and spend money on hotels and shops thanks to the sliding rouble. Tourists from the beleaguered European nation spent 28 per cent less in the UK in 2014 than they did in 2013, according to a study by Global Blue, a tax-free shopping firm based in Switzerland. London is a popular destination for Russians but foreign spending is now twice as expensive for them with the rouble losing almost 50 per cent of its value. Spending by Russian visitors in the UK dropped by 28 per cent in 2014, according to a Global Blue study . With its economy nearing a possible recession Russia’s currency has plummeted amid the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, sanctions imposed by Europe and the US, and slumping oil prices. Global Blue said Russians were previously among the five biggest-spending non-EU tourists in the UK but they have fallen out of the top ten. The European Travel Commission is predicting that Russian outbound tourism will continue to decline in 2015. Meanwhile, Middle Eastern nations continued to see growth with Qatari shoppers spending 16 per cent more and Kuwaiti spending increasing by seven per cent. The European Travel Commission is predicting that Russian outbound tourism will continue to decline . Visitors from Qatar spent an average of £1,406 per transaction thanks to their taste for luxury brands, said the study. Spending by tourists from Hong Kong increased by nine per cent, while Chinese travellers spent six per cent more than they did in 2013. Visitors from China were the biggest spenders in the UK last year, accounting for 25 per cent of the total international spend. Qatari shoppers spent an average of £1,406 per transaction in the UK thanks to their taste for luxury brands . However, overall spending was down three per cent from 2013 to 2014 despite record spending in December. Visitors spent 11 per cent more over the festive period in 2014 compared with the same month a year earlier, said Global Blue. Gordon Clark, Global Blue’s UK country manager, said: ‘2014 was a turning point for how Christmas is a key period for international spend, a trend which we expect to continue. Overall tax-free spending at hotels and shops was down three per cent from 2013 to 2014, said Global Blue . ‘Unlike domestic, globe shoppers are not simply drawn by the heavy discounts but also by the added benefit of shopping these discounted goods tax free in the UK, at a time when the streets are festively decorated to look their best. ‘In what has been a slower year for international spend, it is encouraging for retailers to see strength over this period.’ Looking ahead, VisitBritain is predicting that 2014’s decline will be offset in 2015 as holidaymakers spend more in the UK. Tourism bosses are expecting a total spend of £22.2bn, a year-over-year increase of 4.5 per cent.","Global Blue study says Russians are spending less at UK shops, hotels .

"The skies above Switzerland are crammed full of private jets as billionaires and world leaders attend the annual World Economic Forum in Davos - to discuss climate change among other things. There is set to be twice as many jets as normal in the airspace as those attending the meeting insist on travelling in style. Around 1,700 private flights are predicted over the course of the week, a five per cent rise on last year for the 2014 forum - a figure that will surprise many given that global warming is on the agenda and a private jet burns as much fuel in one hour as a car does in a year.

This year they are meeting in the midst of upheaval, with security forces on heightened alert after attacks in Paris, the European Central Bank considering a radical government bond-buying programme and the safe-haven Swiss franc rocketing. Bennett added: 'Despite the valiant efforts of Oxfam and others to highlight inequality and other social and environmental issues, the pressing issues of economic threat of our still fraud-ridden, out-of-control financial sector, the need to transform our society so that it works for the common good not just the few while operating within the limits of our one planet, are not on the agenda.

"Senior female directors – dubbed 'golden skirts' – are damaging feminism by only campaigning for the elite, it has been claimed. A top academic claimed female boardroom executives had hijacked women's rights and campaigned for 'incredibly limited' causes to further their own careers. Professor Alison Wolf, a crossbench peer and economist at King's College London, said the rich, highly-educated women had a 'modern obsession' with the number of women in boardrooms or in Parliament. Professor Alison Wolf (pictured) said the rich, highly-educated women had a 'modern obsession' with the number of women in boardrooms or in Parliament . Meanwhile, issues such as domestic violence, forced marriage and poorly-paid shift work was ignored, in what she branded a 'betrayal of feminism'. In a damning critique, she accused the richest 15 per cent of women of 'pulling away' from the rest of the sisterhood. Baroness Wolf of Dulwich told The Times: 'It is a betrayal of what early feminism was all about. 'Modern feminism should be far more concerned about the lives of people who did not go to university, who are working long hours in low-paid jobs, doing shift work or struggling to hold down a job, in forced marriages or living in domestic environments which are hostile. 'Sisterhood is dead. There is a complete preoccupation in feminism with the economic self-interest of the top people, whether it's boards or parliament.' She said 'golden skirts' – a Norwegian term for women who hold multiple positions on company boards – were failing to have a positive effect on the pay or prospects of ordinary working women. Lady Wolf said: 'We know this because Norway has actually been running a real life experiment and proves the point.' She claimed that Norway's requirement for publicly listed companies to have 40 per cent women on their boards had had little impact on wider women's rights. In a book called The XX factor, published two years ago, Lady Wolf claimed that, while the female elite may have conquered sex discrimination, poorer women had been left behind . In a book called The XX factor, published two years ago, Lady Wolf claimed that, while the female elite may have conquered sex discrimination, poorer women had been left behind. She added: 'There has been an obsession with what is going on at Oxford or Berkeley because it involves 'people like us'. 'But those on the receiving end are not the top 15 per cent and university campuses are not the most dangerous places on earth to be a woman, really they are not.' Leading feminists attacked Lady Wolf's views, claiming there were many grassroots campaigns for women's rights. Caroline Criado-Perez, whose campaign for a woman to appear on a bank note led to Jane Austen being selected for a £10 note, said: 'There is an explosion of feminism at all levels of society and all over the world. 'Also, it is naive to think it doesn't matter who is in the boardroom or in parliament. We are a democracy and who holds power affects us all.' Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman also objected to Lady Wolf's criticism of so-called 'golden skirts', telling The Times: 'The women's movement has always been a coalition with women from every walk of life, from the blue stocking Vera Brittain types to the Dagenham campaigners for equal pay. But they all want to tackle inequality.'","Professor Alison Wolf says rich, educated women had obsession with number of women in boardrooms or in Parliament .

"They say that opposites attract. And for Jimmy and Claire Dean, friends certainly believe that is the case - based on looks. With his receding hairline, pot belly and one eye, Jimmy, 54, himself would admit he's no Brad Pitt. But the greying divorcee doesn't care that he is the target of jibes, having fallen for - and married - his daughter's stunning school friend, who is 25 years his junior. Claire and Jimmy and now married and a year ago welcomed their first child, son Jimmy Junior . Jimmy, 54, and Claire, 29, pictured on their wedding day in March 2009 . The size-8 blonde  was just 17 when she fell for her classmate's father, despite him being quarter of a century older than her. Jimmy and Claire, from March, Cambridgeshire,  have even been nicknamed Beauty And The Beast by friends as many think Claire,  29, could do better. But the unlikely couple have proved doubters wrong by marrying and having a son, Jimmy Junior, now aged one. ‘I love Jimmy no matter what,’ Claire said. ‘He makes me so happy. That’s all I care about.’ The couple are often referred to as 'Beauty And The Beast' due to their appearance . The couple first met when Claire and Jimmy’s daughter, Gemma, became friends after meeting at a nearby fair. Claire said: ‘Gemma’s family ran the local fairground and Jimmy gave me a job working there for a few months when I was 15. I loved it but afterwards we lost touch for a couple of years. ‘Then Gemma and I met by chance one day when we were both out shopping. Looking back now, I think it must have been fate. ‘Gemma told me her mum and dad were going through a divorce. She was staying at her dad’s house with her younger brothers. We got chatting and she invited me round for a cuppa and a proper catch up.’ Claire says the pair share the same sense of humour and that age and appearance don't matter to her . But when she arrived, Claire got more than a mug of tea. She fell in love. ‘Jimmy made my tummy flip. I couldn’t ignore the butterflies,’ the stay-at-home mother said. ‘I saw past the fact he was older, balding and paunchy. 'To me, he was gorgeous. I’d always liked him as a person, but now I was seeing him in a different light.’ As a single parent, Jimmy was struggling with juggling his fairground business and sons, Charlie, then 11, and James, then 12. Many people did not approve of the couples relationship, but that didn't stop them from marrying . So Claire offered to help. ‘I moved in and acted a bit like an au pair. I helped him with the children and lived in his spare room rent-free,’ she said. ‘I got on with them so well, they became like an extended family. Best of all, I got to be around Jimmy all the time. I made sure I always looked my best, hoping and praying that Jimmy might notice and see me in a different light.’ But love struck Claire feared her crush was unrequited. ‘I told myself to get over it, that a guy like Jimmy would never be interested in a silly young girl like me. So I pushed my feelings aside, and listened while Jimmy told me about his divorce and work problems. ‘Lot’s of boys my own age asked me out on dates, but I rejected every single one. I only had eyes for a man almost three times my age, though I didn’t tell them that. I just said I was happy being single. I didn’t confide in my friends either, I knew they wouldn’t understand. ‘Sometimes I was sure Jimmy was flirting with me, but I was never brave enough to take it further.’ A month later, the couple were at a Queen tribute concert. ‘We were singing along to Crazy Little Thing Called Love when Jimmy leant in and kissed me,’ Claire said. ‘My whole body tingled. It was the magical moment I’d be waiting for. Jimmy’s son Charlie saw it all and yelled “Get in there, Dad.” I went bright red, but deep down I was ecstatic. ‘We became inseparable. Jimmy would treat me to meals out, but I was just as happy lounging on his sofa watch telly. We were so comfortable in each other’s company, that’s how I knew it was the real deal,’ she said. After dating for two months, Claire told her family about her relationship. ‘Mum said that as long as we were happy that was all that mattered and she was right. Dad said, “Better Jimmy than someone your own age who’ll mess you about"". Best of all, Jimmy’s children were overjoyed. ‘I was worried about Gemma in particular, after all we were friends and I was dating her dad, but she said she was over the moon.’ Yet some people weren’t as accepting, and not everyone believed that their relationship was the real deal. ‘My mates thought I was mad,’ Claire said. ‘They asked what I saw in him and some called us Beauty And The Beast. I thought it was really upsetting but Jimmy saw the funny side. Claire  fell for Jimmy at 17, moving in to work as an au pair  to be close to him (pictured early in  relationship) ‘Others said he must be really well endowed to woo a woman like me. It is true we have an amazing love life, but that’s not why I’m with him. ‘Strangers in the street even commented. One woman called me a gold digger when she saw Jimmy and me having a smooch out shopping. He has done well for himself, but I work hard looking after the house and Jimmy Junior. Another told me that she thought it was gross. ‘We just rise above it. They’re clearly unhappy or jealous. What Jimmy and I have together is true love, and if people have a problem with that then that’s their issue, not mine.’ Such pressure might have driven some couples apart, but not Jimmy and Claire. ‘If anything it’s brought us closer together,’ she said. ‘When we first started dating Jimmy lied about his age, saying he was 40, not 42. ‘When he finally admitted it, I told him I’d love him the same, even if he was 82. Claire says she puts a great deal of effort into her appearance and figure to look good for Jimmy . ‘It’s not all about looks, even though I think Jimmy is incredibly sexy, it’s about what’s on the inside that counts. ‘When Jimmy was in his 20s he was attacked, causing his left eye to droop due to muscle damage. My friends always mentioned it, but I never noticed.’ The snide remarks became more common when Jimmy had to have his left eye removed in 2009, after the couple had been together seven years. ‘As he was wheeled down to theatre he asked how I could stay with him with only one eye. I said, two eyes or one eye, you’ll always be The One. ‘Luckily we share the same wicked sense of humour and we’re always giggling. Shortly after his op we went car shopping, and I eventually settled on a gorgeous white Mercedes. ‘As the salesman handed me the keys he said to Jimmy, “Your daughter will be very happy with her choice.” We both exploded into hysterical laughter. The dealer looked mortified.’ Jimmy proposed to Claire in 2006, when they’d been together five years and they married in March 2009 at March registry office. ‘It was just three days before my 24th birthday and I felt like a princess in my tight, white dress,’ Claire said. ‘Jimmy was my Prince Charming. Jimmy and Claire recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary (pictured on their wedding day) ‘We’d always discussed having kids, and I knew I wanted to be a mum. When we found out I was expecting Jimmy was overjoyed.’ Jimmy Junior arrived in January 2014. ‘Jimmy is such a good dad, he was always up first in the night if Jimmy Junior cried. He knows how important my beauty sleep is,' Claire said. ‘I loved being mummy to a newborn, but I hated what had happened to my body. ‘I had to work so hard to get back into my size 8 jeans. I booked regular trips to have my hair and nails done just to feel like me again. Jimmy appreciated it too. I like to look good for him as he shows me off to his mates. He calls me his ‘little cracker.’ ‘Jimmy is more laid back and eats whatever he likes. The only veg he’s interested in is vegging out on the sofa. ‘I’ve offered him the chance to join me for a salad or on one of my runs but he hasn’t taken me up on it,’ she said. Jimmy and Claire recently celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary, and they’re both adamant there’ll be many more to come. Claire said: ‘I know it may get tough when Jimmy’s an old man, but I’m not stupid, I’m prepared to care for him. ‘I love him as much now as the day I met him. People say Jimmy’s the lucky one, but I know that it’s the other way round. He’s my soul mate.’ Jimmy said: ‘I really thought one day she would wake up and see she could do so much better. I really am the beast and she’s the beauty. I feel so proud to know she’s mine. She could be with someone her own age in her own league. My friends don’t know how I did it, and I have to agree with them.’","Claire fell for Jimmy- her friend's father- when she was 17 .

"Koalas are generally seen as some of the cuddliest critters Australia has to offer, but a recent video from a Brisbane sanctuary shows they have a tougher side, too. The clip, uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, shows two Koala's embroiled in a vicious fight inside Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, tussling each other across the enclosure while a zoo keeper tries using a rake to keep them apart. But Lone Pine koala keeper Karen Nilsson said the said the behaviour is commonplace during mating season, when the animals argue over breeding, reports Nine News. The clip, uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, shows two Koala's embroiled in a viscous fight . The male koala, Mr Peabody, is the only male koala in the sanctuary permitted to mate. He is believed to have made an unwanted advance on his female neighbour. 'She didn't appreciate him being there because she's not ready to mate. She was just trying to send him on his way,' Ms Nilsson said. 'He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was actually a very polite little tiff. Both are 100 percent fine – no injuries whatsoever. Whatever the issue was, they've sorted it out and moved on.' Ms Nilsson said the rake is used by keepers in order to keep the animals apart without risking harm. But the animals rarely hurt each other during the tiffs. The male, Mr Peabody, is believed to have made an unwanted advance on his female neighbour . The keeper uses a rake  in order to keep the animals apart without risking harm . 'Sometimes they get little bite marks on the ears but it's pretty minor. Once the hierarchy is established, they get on really well,' she said. Fighting among koalas is common for males, who use the fights as a means of climbing the hierarchy. Females will generally only fight during mating season if males make an unwanted advance.","The clip shows two Koala's embroiled in a viscous fight .

"Pop star James Blunt today accused a Labour shadow minister of being a 'classist gimp' after he attacked the number of posh actors and musicians. Labour MP Chris Bryant claimed British culture was 'dominated by Eddie Redmayne and James Blunt and their ilk' who went to expensive boarding schools. The remarks, which come in the wake of Redmayne's best actor Oscar nomination last week, sparked a furious response from the 'You're Beautiful' chart star – who accused Mr Bryant of being a 'prejudiced wazzock' who uses the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes. Scroll down for video . Pop star James Blunt has attacked Labour shadow minister Chris Bryant after he criticised the number of posh actors and musicians . Dear Chris Bryant MP, . You classist gimp. I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business. I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend. No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use. In the army, again, people thought it was a mad idea. None of them knew anyone in the business either. And when I left the army, going against everyone's advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian). Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business. And when I have managed to break through, I was STILL scoffed at for being too posh for the industry. And then you come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don't deserve it, and that we must redress the balance. But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my shit songs, and my plummy accent. I got signed in America, where they don't give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and 'my ilk', you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my arse off. What you teach is the politics of jealousy. Rather than celebrating success and figuring out how we can all exploit it further as the Americans do, you instead talk about how we can hobble that success and 'level the playing field'. Perhaps what you've failed to realise is that the only head-start my school gave me in the music business, where the VAST majority of people are NOT from boarding school, is to tell me that I should aim high. Perhaps it protected me from your kind of narrow-minded, self-defeating, lead-us-to-a-dead-end, remove-the-'G'-from-'GB' thinking, which is to look at others' success and say, 'it's not fair.' Up yours, . James . In a letter to Mr Bryant, Labour's  shadow culture minister, Blunt says the boarding school he attended in Harrow, in West London, did nothing to help him break into the music industry. The 40-year-old Brit award-winner also claims that people in the music industry tried to get him to change his accent so he sounded less posh. Blunt opens his letter to Mr Bryant by accusing him of being a 'classist gimp', despite the fact that the Labour MP himself was privately educated at £20,000 a year Cheltenham College before attending Oxford. In Blunt's letter, he writes: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business.' He adds: 'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!). I was taught the only four chords I know by a friend. 'No one at school had ANY knowledge or contacts in the music business, and I was expected to become a soldier or a lawyer or perhaps a stockbroker. So alien was it, that people laughed at the idea of me going into the music business, and certainly no one was of any use.' Labour MP Chris Bryant  (left)- privately educated himself - claimed British culture was 'dominated by Eddie Redmayne (right) and James Blunt and their ilk' who went to expensive boarding schools . Dear James . Stop being so blooming precious. I'm not knocking your success. I even contributed to it by buying one of your albums. I'm not knocking Eddie Redmayne, either. He was the best Richard II I have ever seen. If you'd read the whole of my interview, you'd have seen that I make the point that the people who subsidise the arts the most are artists themselves. Of course that includes you. But it is a statement of the blindingly obvious that that is far tougher if you come from a poor family where you have to hand over your holiday earnings to help pay the family bills. I'm delighted you've done well for yourself. But it is really tough forging a career in the arts if you can't afford the enormous fees for drama school, if you don't know anybody who can give you a leg up, if your parents can't subsidise you for a few years whilst you make your name and if you can't afford to take on an unpaid internship. You see the thing is I want everyone to take part in the arts. I don't want any no-go areas for young people from less privileged backgrounds. And I'm convinced that we won't be Great Britain if we waste great British talent in the arts. You seem to think talent will always out. My fear is that someone like Stanley Baker, the son of a disabled miner in the Rhondda, who rose to be one of Britain's greatest film actors (Zulu), would have found it even harder to make it today. That's why we need more diversity at every level in the arts – in education, in training, on-screen, on stage and backstage – and we need to break down all the barriers to taking part so that every talent gets a chance. Yours bluntly . Chris . Blunt said even in the army, which he joined after university, he was told that trying to become a pop star was a 'mad idea'. He writes: 'And when I left the army, going against everyone's advice, EVERYONE I met in the British music industry told me there was no way it would work for me because I was too posh. One record company even asked if I could speak in a different accent. (I told them I could try Russian). 'Every step of the way, my background has been AGAINST me succeeding in the music business.

He writes: 'You come along, looking for votes, telling working class people that posh people like me don't deserve it, and that we must redress the balance. 'But it is your populist, envy-based, vote-hunting ideas which make our country crap, far more than me and my s*** songs, and my plummy accent. 'I got signed in America, where they don't give a stuff about, or even understand what you mean by me and 'my ilk', you prejudiced wazzock, and I worked my a*** off.

"Range-R: At least 50 U.S. law enforcement agencies now have access to radar devices that enable them to effectively see into people’s homes and determine if anyone is inside . At least 50 U.S. law enforcement agencies now have access to radar devices that enable them to effectively see into people’s homes and determine if anyone is inside. Although the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and others have had the technology for more than two years, it only come to light during a federal appeals court hearing in Denver last month. During the case it emerged that officers had used the Range-R device before they entered a house to arrest a man wanted for violating his parole. The judges in the case expressed alarm that agents had used the technology without a search warrant in line with the U.S. Supreme Court's advice. ‘The government's warrantless use of such a powerful tool to search inside homes poses grave Fourth Amendment questions,’ said the judges. The use of the technology adds to growing concerns about government surveillance and also raises legal and privacy issues. Federal officials claim the tool is critical for keeping officers safe if they need to storm buildings or rescue hostages, but civil liberties groups aren’t convinced. ‘The idea that the government can send signals through the wall of your house to figure out what's inside is problematic,’ Christopher Soghoian, the American Civil Liberties Union's principal technologist, told USA Today. ‘Technologies that allow the police to look inside of a home are among the intrusive tools that police have.’ The device the Marshals Service and others are using, known as the Range-R, shows whether it has detected movement on the other side of a wall and, if so, how far away it is . Federal contract records show the Marshals Service began buying the radars in 2012, and has spent $180,000 on them. The device the Marshals Service and others are using - known as the Range-R - detects movement on the other side of a wall and also how far away it is. L-3 Communications, which makes the device, estimates it has sold about 200 Range-Rs to 50 law enforcement agencies at a cost of approximately $6,000 each. The radar was first designed for use in Iraq and Afghanistan and is the latest example of battlefield technology finding its way home to civilian policing.

"Eccentric online security expert John McAfee is claiming that 'civil libertarian hackers' are behind the cyber attack on Sony - not North Korea. The founder of cyber security firm McAfee says he knows who is part of the worldwide network of hackers who pulled off the attack - which crippled Sony's internal network, released troves of embarrassing and damaging information and threatened a September 11-style terrorist attack on theaters that aired the film 'The Interview.' In an interview with The International Business Times, McAfee declined to name the people he says are behind the attack - saying he didn't want to 'nark' on them. Scroll down for video . John McAfee, the founder of McAfee anti-virus software, says 'libertarian' hackers attacked Sony Pictures and released millions of secret documents.  McAfee is pictured here in December 2012 after leaving Belize . The FBI has blamed North Korea on the cyber attack on Sony Pictures. Government experts say that the hermit nation was furious about the Seth Rogen comedy for its depiction of the assassination of leader Kim Jong-un. The 69-year-old McAfee told the IBT that the break-in was actually the work of hackers who 'hate the confinement, the restrictions the music industry and the movie industry has placed on art and so they are behind it.' The hackers, McAfee said, saw Sony Pictures as a symbol of those restrictions for 'controlling the content of art.' McAfee, who made his name and his fortune by building a cyber security firm to stop hackers, says he now finds himself sympathetic to their aims and an ally to their cause. McAfee, who resigned from his namesake company in 1994 and sold his shares, was named in 2012 by Belize authorities as a 'person of interest' in the murder of his neighbor in the Caribbean nation. Government officials say North Korea hacked Sony over 'The Interview,' a film about a CIA assassination plot against leader Kim Jong-un . He escaped the country and is now living in America. According to reports his fortune, which was totaled more than $100million, has dwindled down to a few million dollars - possibly less. McAfee says he doesn't mind that the US is blaming the North Koreans for the attack and targeting them as a result. 'Maybe they have been wrongly accused in this case, but they have not been accused in cases where they should have been accused,' he said. McAfee isn't the first to cast doubt on the FBI's claims. Cyber intelligence firm Norse has released a report pointing at a disgruntled insider working with a group of outside hackers who released the information.","McAfee, 69, says he knows who attacked Sony Pictures, but declined to 'nark' and name names .

"A U.S. congressional delegation will meet for talks with Cuban officials on Monday in the highest-level contact between the two nations since plans for trade reforms were announced. The symbolic meeting between the U.S. delegation and its old cold war foe will be led by Senator Patrick Leahy and could be attended by President Raul Castro. U.S. delegates are set to tell Cuban officials that their actions in the coming months will influence Congressional openness to President Barack Obama's plans. Scroll down for video . Cuba's President Raul Castro, right, speaks with U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, left, a Democrat from Vermont in 2012 the pair could meet again for talks on Monday over trade reforms . U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy from Vermont takes pictures from a car as he tours the city during a three-day visit to Havana, Cuba, Sunday, Jan. 18, 2015 . This is the first congressional delegation to visit Cuba since Obama proposed to effectively ease the embargo on the country which has been in place for decades. Leahy and five other Democratic senators and representatives are trying to ease the reestablishment of full relations with Cuba as the two countries hold talks aimed at normalizing trade relations. They also want to gauge how Castro's government will respond to the U.S. push to expand diplomatic relations and trade ties. However, it is not the first time that Leahy, who played a key role in the release of American contractor Alan Gross as part of a prisoner exchange, has dealt with the secretive regime. He met Castro on past trips to Cuba and was expected to do so again on Monday, two days before Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson arrives in Havana to negotiate the reopening of the U.S. Embassy. Cuba has so far offered a guardedly positive reception to Obama's loosening of the trade embargo on Cuba, saying it welcomes the full package of new economic ties on offer. U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy is heading the first congressional delegation visit to Cuba since President Barack Obama announced in December plans for renewed economic ties with Cuba . The sweeping reforms could affect sales of telecommunications equipment and exports to the private business sector. But it comes after Obama defied hardline critics in Congress to begin loosening some U.S. economic sanctions against the communist-ruled island. To date, Cuba has released 53 prisoners on a list of dissidents the U.S. wanted freed. But it has said nothing about whether it will allow U.S. products to flow to Cuba without the staggering taxes and regulations that keep many other foreign products from ordinary Cubans. It also insists it will maintain its one-party political system and centrally planned economy. Leahy said: 'We are seeing a remarkable change in relations between our countries and we want to talk to some of the Cubans to see what they think about it, to see what's going to happen next.' 'Obviously we hope to have a lot more freedom of expression among Cubans, but also the ability for our own two countries to talk with each other, something long overdue.' With formal diplomatic relations highly restricted, some of the most significant U.S.-Cuban contacts in recent years have been carried out by Congressional delegations. Obama's actions fall under executive authority and don't require Congressional approval. But legislators could still hinder key measures including the removal of Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terror. On Saturday, the delegation met with officials from Cuba's Culture Ministry about possible Cuban participation in the Smithsonian Institution's Folklife Festival on Washington's National Mall. The senators met Sunday with more than a dozen dissidents including critics of the 18-month-old secret negotiations that led to last month's announcement. Antonio Rodiles who has criticized the Obama administration for failing to win enough guarantees of reform from Castro said: 'It was a friendly meeting.' Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, a Cuban non-governmental organization tracking political detentions said that meeting participants had delivered a list of 24 long-term prisoners whom they wanted to see released in addition to the 53 on the Obama administration's list. On Monday, along with the possible meeting with Castro, the delegation will hold talks with lower-ranking Cuban officials in fields like agriculture, the environment and telecommunications.","Cuban officials will be told their actions will influence proposed reforms .

"Almost a year ago in May 2013 the world’s first gun made with a 3D printer was unveiled. At the time it sparked major controversy – some derided it as nothing more than a toy, others warned it was a serious security risk that was undetectable by metal detectors. Now, one year on, the chilling reality of 3D-printed guns has been revealed as enthusiasts across the world show off their ‘toys’. In May 2013 Cody Wilson showed off the world's first fully 3D-printed gun, known as the Liberator (pictured). Now, one year one, users of the online community Fosscad reveal to MailOnline how far the technology has progressed, and how dangerous it could become in the future . A multitude of videos on YouTube show just how 3D-printed guns have come in 12 months. The first was unveiled by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas. The Mail On Sunday exposed the international security risk posed by a gun that can be easily . made with new 3D printers last year. They built a weapon, which is capable of firing a live round, from . blueprints available on the internet – then smuggled it on to a packed . Eurostar train. Two . reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport-style . security to carry the gun on to a London to Paris service in the weekend . rush-hour, alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers. The pistol, capable of firing a deadly . 0.38-calibre bullet, was produced in under 36 hours using a . revolutionary £1,700 machine to ‘print’ its components. And because all . the parts are plastic, they did not trigger the metal detectors all . Euro-star passengers must pass through. His primitive design was the Liberator – but that proof of concept has been vastly improved since May 2013. 3D-printing gun enthusiasts now gather at a website called Fosscad (Free Open Source Software & Computer Aided Designs). Here, users share their designs for 3D-printed guns, which can be downloaded by anyone. With a 3D printer, technically anyone can then download one of the designs and print their own gun. MailOnline spoke to some of the users on Fosscad about how it has changed over the last year. Some were keen to stress that these guns are not always that easy to make. They require a decent knowledge of 3D printing and assembly. And, it was pointed out that while most of the gun can be printed there are some things that cannot, such as ammo - although not for lack of trying. But they did agree that these guns would be use to seriously harm and even kill people, just like regular guns - with the difference being the designs for 3D-printed guns can be downloaded from the internet. For countries like the UK, where firearms are much harder to come by than in the US, the availability of these designs does prove a considerable danger. In one Youtube video a Japanese 'Zig Zag' revolver, named by its maker, can be seen in action. Yoshitomo Imura, the man behind the video, was recently arrested in Japan for owning 3D-printed firearm components. This image shows how close the community is to making a machine gun with a barrel, as shown here, with a 3D-printer. 'Everything in blue can be 3D-printed,' says user Duce, although he does not know if the whole gun will ever be able to be printed . While guns can be 3D printed, the users say that getting ammo for them would be a lot more difficult. Efforts have been made to 3D print ammo, with limited success, but the guns themselves are developing at an astounding rate from simple contraptions to rifles and revolvers (pictured) ‘A big misconception is that 3D printing and making guns using 3D printers are easy to make,’ said one user, Duce, who goes as 'ma deuce' on Youtube. ‘We have been doing this for years and I can say it’s not easy.’ Duce points out that the group has been working on making 3D components for guns for about two years – it’s only in the past year almost entirely printed guns have been conceived. ‘In the UK you can’t buy gun parts easily,’ Duce says, ‘So you would be limited to the liberator type guns.’ For a complete novice who had no knowledge of 3D printers or guns it would take ‘probably a few months to do it well, to print it’ and then assemble the design into a weapon. In the last year stronger designs have been devised for guns like the Liberator, while they also have higher capacity. The first gun could hold just one bullet, but now some have revolving barrels that can hold six or more. ‘Let me be clear, in a few years our design will be excellent, we hope,’ says Duce. ‘That is the goal.’ At the moment however, according to another user called Shadowfall, ‘Someone could cause more harm with a hammer than with a Liberator.’ There are a number of 3D-printed gun designs now freely available on the web. The first fully 3D-printed gun (save for the ammo), the Liberator, is capable of killing someone. Before the Liberator initial efforts to make guns from plastic usually exploded when attempts were made to fire bullets. This proof of concept gun, however, showed that making a lethal weapon out of plastic is entirely possible. Since then a number of other guns have sprung up on the web. In . late 2013 a gun enthusiast in Wisconsin showed off a working firearm . called the Lulz Liberator, made from less than £15 ($25) worth of . plastic, that could fire .38 calibre bullets without being damaged. In July, meanwhile, a Youtube user showed off ‘The Grizzly, a 3D-printed rifle capable of firing .22-calibre bullets. These . guns were one-shot only – the barrel had to be removed after each shot – . but in August another gun enthusiast unveiled the Reprringer, capable . of holding and firing five bullets. The . alarming speed at which the technology has progressed shows how close . these guns are to accurately mimicking real-life weapons. Even as users of Fosscod play down the danger of them, the sight of guns made from plastic being created is unnerving. And the fact they are made of plastic and not metal means they can be taken through metal detectors without being picked up. For the moment, though, ammo and firing pins must still be metal. But there is a possibility that in future entire guns could be 3D-printed - including the ammo. Designs for 3D-printed guns, like the Reprringer seen here, can quite easily be downloaded by anybody from popular sites like Fosscad. However, the users of the site maintain that actually making the guns and using a 3D-printer is not as easy as it looks, although it is possible for someone to become an expert in a few months . Over the past year the various designs have increased in their complexity and performance. The next 12 months could see them get even better until they are on a par with real guns, according to users on the site . 3D printed guns jumped to the top of agendas worldwide when governments realised they could be taken through metal detectors without setting them off. The users point out that the guns need a metal firing pin and ammo, however, which would set a metal detector off. But they seem almost nonchalant about the potential dangers of these weapons, with a genuine enthusiasm for making them. ‘I’m not in it for the fame, I just love guns and the art of designing them,’ says Duce. And on the availability of the designs for someone to print a gun, Duce says: ‘If I put a gun on the table in front of you would you pick it up and shoot me?’ Since a year ago the community has a lot more parts and working types of guns, and the users see this continuing for the next year. For now, though, the guns are still in their relative infancy and the designs have yet to be perfected. But will a 3D printed gun ever be as powerful as a real gun? 'Definitely,' says Duce.","It is one year since the first 3D-printed gun was unveiled to the world .
Over the last 12 months the designs have become better and better .
Many enthusiasts across the globe have been showing off their designs .
MailOnline spoke to several users of 3D-printing gun site Fosscad .

"At least four Muslim villagers were killed, three of them burned to death, when their thatched huts were set on fire during a clash between Hindu and Muslim groups in eastern India, a government official has said. Police had arrested 14 people on Monday on charges of arson and murder, said Ranjit K Mishra, a local police superintendent. Security has been tightened in and around Sarayian village in Bihar state with some 500 police officers assigned to the area. Scroll down for video . The remains of burnt and ransacked huts still smoulder in a village following a clash between Hindus and Muslims nearly 105 kilometers (65 miles) north of Patna. At least four Muslims were killed in the violence . Atul Prasad, a Bihar state administrator, said the violence erupted on Sunday after the body of a young Hindu boy was found in Sarayian more than a week after he went missing. Prasad said Hindu fishermen blamed Muslims for killing the boy who was friendly with a Muslim girl from the village, which is situated 105 kilometers (65 miles) north of Patna, the capital of Bihar. The charred bodies of three Muslims were found in the burned huts while the bullet-riddled body of a fourth man was found in a village field, the officials said. Prasad said the situation remains tense but under control in the village. Hindus make up more than 80 per cent and Muslims nearly 13 per cent of India's 1.2 billion people. They largely live peacefully in various parts of the country, but there is occasional violence. Last year, around 50 people died in clashes between Hindus and Muslim in Muzaffarnagar town in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state. Police said the situation remains tense but under control in the village .","Thatched huts in Bihar state were set on fire during Hindu-Muslim clashes .

"The horrifying ordeal suffered by a grandmother at a crisis-hit care home was laid bare last night. Harrowing video footage shows frail 89-year-old Edna Slann reduced to begging for food. Her face twisted in distress, she pleads: ‘I’m starving – they keep you starving in here. I just want a cup of tea. Have you got anything to eat?’ The Mail reported yesterday that a ten-week stay at Grantley Court left her bruised, malnourished and with an infection that doctors say will kill her in weeks. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: In footage taken by her granddaughter, an injured Edna Slann tells of being left thirsty and starving by staff at Grantley Court nursing home . Detectives are probing mysterious injuries suffered by other dementia patients at the nursing home in Sutton, south-west London. It has now been closed down along with a second home nearby. Both are owned by multimillionaires Soondressen and Maleenee Cooppen. Asked by the Mail to apologise to relatives last night, Mrs Cooppen, 42, said: ‘We are not interested.’ Families reacted to this furiously, threatening legal action. ‘It is disgusting,’ said Mrs Slann’s daughter Linda Cackett. ‘Clearly they don’t care at all. 'You can see how desperate my mum was. If I was them I would not be able to sleep at night.’ The footage was taken by Mrs Slann’s granddaughter in September. Mrs Slann was left needing stitches to the head and with severe bruising across her face while living at the home which was evacuated last year . Grantley Court and Merok Park in Banstead, Surrey were allegedly run ‘on a shoestring’ by the Cooppens while they are said to have picked up £650,000 a year from each. Inspectors found an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine and said patients were forced to wash in cold water. One neighbour told yesterday of years of hearing screaming from one of the homes, as residents pleaded for help. An 85-year-old man died 48 hours after an emergency evacuation from Merok Park in December but officials have refused to name him. Have you, or any of your relatives, been affected by the scandals at Merok Park and Grantley Court care homes? If so, please email news@dailymail.co.uk. There are also urgent questions as to why officials did not act sooner. A damning report by watchdogs was not published for eight months, meaning families had no idea their loved ones were suffering. The Cooppens, who live in a £2.5million home on a gated estate in Cheam, south-west London, have repeatedly refused to answer questions. Parked outside their home yesterday was a fleet of luxury cars worth more than £200,000. Among them were a £70,000 Mercedes S350 saloon, a £50,000 Mercedes CLS350 sports car, a £50,000 BMW X5 4x4 and a £30,000 BMW convertible. They also own a £500,000 home in Sutton, which they let out. Their eldest child, Davina, a 20-year-old Cambridge University student, had an extravagant 18th birthday party in a luxury resort in their home country of Mauritius two years ago. Footage from the party shows her arriving in a limousine and drinking champagne with her parents and hundreds of guests. Transformation: Mrs Slann, pictured left before entering the care home, and right. Her family said they felt guilty for allowing her to stay in the home . They also have a daughter Melissa, 15, and son Arvin, 16, who uses social media to show off his expensive jewellery. The teenage boy also posts pictures of the family’s two racehorses – Destiny’s Tale and Prince Paseo – which compete in Mauritius. In December, shortly after the two care homes were shut down, he wrote of celebrating the ‘Perfect Xmas Eve’ – sharing a photograph of costly bottles of whisky, vodka, brandy as well as Dom Perignon champagne. He also posted a picture of his Tag Heuer Carrera and gold Burberry watches. Mrs Cackett, 54, said: ‘I always hoped there was a part of them that cared. Clearly they do not care at all. It is disgusting. ‘I don’t have a problem with people making money but I do when they do it at the expense of other people.’ Les Shields, 53, from Epsom, whose 78-year-old father was at Merok Park, said of Mr and Mrs Cooppen: ‘The governing bodies, the powers that be, let them get away with it. ‘If she had criminal proceedings heading to her door I think she would be a lot more bothered by it.’ He said Mr Cooppen, 51, should be held to account for the state of the homes, adding: ‘We had a period of time he was just taking money and not providing care – the care that he had been paid to give. In my eyes he should be criminally liable for the condition of the people in there. This was criminal negligence for a long period.’ Less than a year ago, Merok Park and Grantley Court both passed watchdog inspections. At Grantley Court, inspectors raised concerns over training and vetting of staff but this was not published for eight months, in a supposed administrative error. Merok Park was inspected again in September after concerns were raised by staff. It was closed suddenly on December 9, with residents left in the freezing cold in their pyjamas. The 85-year-old man died 48 hours later. Winifred Lake, 91, died a fortnight after being evacuated from Grantley Court. The Home Office is probing whether Merok Park staff were working illegally in the UK. A Surrey Council spokesman said Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court at a time when it had passed its most recent inspection. A spokesman for the Met Police said that investigations are continuing. A resident is stretchered out of the care home after being evacuated in the bitter cold last year . Merok Park (above) was evacuated last year after Surrey County Council urged an investigation into standards there. It is owned by the same couple in charge of Grantley Court in Sutton, south London . 'They keep you starving in here... just get me out of this place': Grandmother's heartbreaking plea to be fed . Pleading for help, Edna Slann reaches out to her appalled family in desperation. ‘I’m starving,’ she says. ‘I’m bloody starving. Have you got anything to eat here now?’ While dementia has left the 89-year-old muddled in many ways, she is certain about one thing. ‘Oh god. I want something to eat,’ she begs, in harrowing video footage that shames Britain’s care system. The 89-year-old was evacuated from Grantley Court in Sutton, south London last year. Her family began filming her on visits over concerns she was being neglected . ‘They keep you starving in here. This is not me at all. This is not normal, these b******* here are not normal. I just want to get out of this place.’ Mrs Slann, a widow who has dementia and arthritis and needs a wheelchair, was moved in July from a residential home to Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London. Her family claims she was neglected from the outset and her health rapidly deteriorated. They said she lost more than half a stone in two months and is now little over five stone and reliant on morphine to control her pain. She suffered severe facial bruising and a gash to her head which needed 12 stitches and now has just weeks to live. Mrs Slann was filmed on September 21 by her granddaughter Becky, after she and her mother Linda Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, became fearful she was being neglected. In a horrifying video, Mrs Slann can be seen pleading for help, while touching a large cut on her head. Shaking with desperation and rage, she tells her granddaughter: ‘I’m hungry. Have you got anything to eat here now? I’m bloody starving. They keep you bleeding starving in here.’ She can be seen shutting her eyes in despair, while saying: ‘Oh god. I want something to eat. I’m angry. Give me something to eat.’ After the food does not come, she is seen lowering her expectations. Outraged: Mrs Slann's daughter Linda Cackett says she would not have arranged for her mother to stay in Grantley Court had she been aware of concerns . ‘I just want a cup of tea, that’s all I want. Get us a cup of tea.’ She is reassured by staff that her food will come in ‘just 15 minutes’. Later, she says: ‘Whatever’s happened to me? They’re making me bloody mad. ‘This effing place. It drives me round the bloody bend here. They are all bloody nutcases. I just want to get out of this place.’ After staff discovered a bedsore on her foot, she was taken to hospital. When hospital staff called Grantley Court for an explanation, they were apparently told it was ‘not that bad’. Doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg, involving serious surgery which would probably kill her. Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of-one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. She was a ‘lively and happy grandmother’, according to her family. Her daughter said it was ‘terrible’ to see how she has suffered. She added: ‘It is horrendous to think that she has suffered. ‘We filmed her because she kept saying she was hungry. We feel guilty we let her go to Grantley Court. It is hard to talk about but I am speaking out because no one should go through this.’ Mrs Slann’s stay at Grantley Court cost £595 a week, which was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she was relocated as soon as concerns were raised. A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection.","Edna Slann was a resident at crisis-hit care home Grantley Court in Sutton .

"Gary Glitter, pictured leaving Southwark Crown Court today, allegedly crept into the bed of an eight-year-old girl and tried to rape her in 1975 . Gary Glitter crept into the bed of an eight-year-old girl and tried to rape her at the height of his fame, a court heard today. The youngster only avoided being raped because she fell into a protective 'cocoon' of sheets and blankets, before fleeing when the drunken pop star fell asleep, jurors were told. The alleged incident took place while the girl was at a sleepover with a friend. Separately, the former glam rock singer allegedly plied another 12-year-old schoolgirl with champagne before assaulting her and also allegedly abused a young fan in his dressing room. Now 70, the popstar - real name Paul Gadd - listened to the claims from the dock this afternoon on the first day of his trial at Southwark Crown Court. He is accused of a string of alleged sex crimes on three young girls in the 1970s and 1980s. Opening the case, prosecutor John Price QC said Glitter had tried to force himself on the first girl in 1975, when she was aged eight. He said: ‘She remembers waking up from her sleep to find him in the bed. He was drunk. ‘She remembers what she describes as a “horrible” smell of alcohol and tobacco. She remembers also that she felt very uncomfortable at his being there.’ He added: ‘She felt his hands lift her nightdress. In short it is alleged by the prosecution that Mr Gadd tried to rape her. ‘She only managed to prevent him from succeeding by moving away from him in the bed and until she had moved so far that she remembers she fell into the “envelope” or “cocoon” formed at its edge by the sheets.' The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claims that Glitter fell asleep after the attack. She then ran into a bathroom to try and clean herself, the court heard. It is alleged that the day after the attack, Glitter acted as if nothing had happened and gave the girl chocolate. Mr Price said: ‘The next day, as she recalls, he behaved entirely as normal. Nothing was said about what he had done to her the previous night whether by him to her or her to him.' He added: ‘We submit that what she says he did to her involved a clear and unmistakable attempt to rape her.' Around four years later, the former chart-topper is said to have pounced on the youngster again, pushing her onto a bed after and asking for a 'cuddle'. Mr Price said: 'She summoned the courage to say ""No"", she got up from the bed and she left the room. Scroll down for video . Allegations: The former glam rock singer also allegedly plied another schoolgirl with champagne before assaulting her and abused a young fan in his dressing room, jurors were told. Pictured is Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, in the dock . 'She tried to do so quickly and awkwardly but he took hold of her and he rolled her on to her back on the bed. She remembers that when he did that she felt frightened.' About a month after that alleged second incident, the youngster told her mother what had happened. She is also said to have told other friends of her ordeal, something which the prosecution submits is of 'great importance'. But jurors were told that she only went to police with her claims 20 years later, after seeing Glitter had admitted child pornography charges. Jurors were told that Glitter was arrested in November 1997 when he went to pick up a Toshiba laptop he had taken to be serviced at a Bristol PC World. The arrest came after the engineer who examined the machine discovered images relating to child pornography. Glitter subsequently admitted responsibility for a 'large number' of images on his computer, depicting sexual activity taking place between men and very young children. Fame: The former pop star arrived at Southwark Crown Court today for the first day of his trial . Mr Price said: 'It encouraged her (the alleged victim) to report to the police, for the first time, what she says he had done to her. 'It seemed to her that recent events in Bristol - as she understood them to be from the publicity - offered a better chance that she might be believed when accusing so famous and popular a man of so dreadful a crime.' Glitter is also accused of molesting two 'young fans' whom he met while touring the country. In each case, the girls are said to have first met the singer in his dressing room after a concert that their mothers took them to. Jurors were told that each girl was initially introduced to Glitter in the presence of their mother, before their mother was persuaded to leave their daughter alone with the singer. One of the alleged victims claims she was just 12 when Glitter plied her with champagne and then set upon her after a 1977 concert in a Leicester club called Baileys. Glitter allegedly kissed the girl and 'touched her between the legs' after asking the schoolgirl's mother to leave them alone. Over time, the youngster attended a number of the former star's performances, the court was told. On the second occasion she is said to have gone with her mother to Glitter's dressing room, before both of them were invited to his Holiday Inn hotel suite. Mr Price told jurors: 'It was there, in his hotel bedroom, her mother having been taken elsewhere by someone else, that she says he subjected her to a prolonged episode of sexual abuse involving a full range of sexual activity culminating in intercourse, prior to which he plied her with alcohol - champagne.' He added that consent was not an issue because the girl, now a 50-year-old woman, was a child at the time. Jurors also heard that the teenager was subjected to a similar ordeal in a Birmingham hotel room when she was 13, an age that she remembers because it coincided with her first period. Mr Price continued: 'There is no doubt that (she) did attend concerts performed by this defendant. 'There can be no doubt that she was allowed the privilege - if that is what it was - of joining him backstage, as they sometimes say. She has produced a number of old photographs which prove it.' Jurors were then shown a number of photos of the young girl with her mother and with Glitter. Some of the photos showed bottles of champagne in ice buckets. Glitter found fame in the 1970s as part of the glam rock scene and had number one hits with I'm The Leader Of The Gang (I Am), I Love You Love Me Love and Always Yours. The former popstar also featured in a scene with Nineties stars the Spice Girls in their hit movie Spice World. He has suffered from hearing loss and followed proceedings with the help of lip-speaking interpreters. Glitter is accused of one count of attempted rape and another of indecent assault on the eight-year-old girl, while she was under the age of 13. In relation to a second complainant, he is charged with four counts of indecent assault between 31 January 1977 and 31 December 1977, while she was under the age of 13. He is also accused of plying the girl with alcohol with the intention to 'stupefy or overpower' her to have sex with him between January and May 1977. He faces one charge of unlawful intercourse with the girl, while she was aged under 13. Glitter  faces two further charges of indecent assault relating to a third complainant, who was under the age of 16, between October 1979 and December 1980. Glitter, from Marylebone, central London, denies seven counts of indecent assault, one count of attempted rape, and two other sexual offences. The trial, expected to last for two weeks, continues.

"Jessa Duggar proudly shared her pro-life views as she joined her family for an anti-abortion march in Arkansas on Sunday. The 19 Kids and Counting star and her husband, Ben Seewald, headed to Little Rock to participate in March for Life on Sunday afternoon. They were also joined by her parents Michelle and Jim Bob, as well as at least 11 of her siblings, who all posed for snaps outside the Capitol. 'Headed to Little Rock right now,' she wrote on Instagram early in the morning. 'Join us at our state Capitol at 2 pm, and together let us take a stand for the life of the unborn.' Scroll down for video . Protest: Jessa Duggar and husband Ben Seewald pose outside the Arkansas Capitol during a pro-life rally . Family day out: Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar were at the rally with at least 12 of their children on Sunday . She later shared another image of a banner that read: 'God Loves Every Life from Beginning to End.' They were also snapped with fans, while Jessa's parents and 10 of her siblings. The rally was the 36th March for Life, which is held every year to protest the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court to legalize abortion. Noticeably absent from the pro-life parade was her pregnant sister Jill, who had instead opted for night out at Chinese restaurant P.F. Changs with her husband, Derick Dillard. '#datenight with my amazing hubby,' she wrote on Instagram. Jill is 30 weeks along and is expecting a boy, E! reported. Jessa has previously been outspoken about her anti-abortion stance. In September, she compared abortion to the Holocaust after sharing her thoughts following a visit to the Holocaust Museum. Gathering: Hundreds of people met in front of the Capitol on Sunday afternoon for the March for Life rally . Outspoken: Jessa also shared this image of a pro-life banner to her Instagram on Sunday afternoon . Out in numbers: Michelle and Jim Bob posed with a fan for photos at the event on Sunday . 'May we never sit idly by and allow such an atrocity to happen again,' she wrote. 'Not this generation. We must be a voice for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Because EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS.' But the post sparked outrage, with some calling her 'naive'. 'Do not use the Holocaust as an excuse to preach about your religion,' one wrote. 'Abortion has nothing to do with the slaughter of millions of people. You should be ashamed of yourself.' In the weeks before her post, her then-fiance wrote a Facebook post about the responsibility of young people to 'end the abortion holocaust'. And in January, Jessa's father Jim Bob told Life Site News that he, too, was reminded of abortion when he visited the Holocaust Museum - so much so that he feels there should be a 'Life Museum' dedicated to 'how abortion started in America, how it became legal, and all the tragic stories that have happened.' Jill Duggar missed out on the family trip and opted for dinner at P.F. Chang's with her husband Derick instead .

"End of fear? Curcumin is found in the root of the Indian spice turmeric (pictured) A spice commonly used in curry could help erase bad memories, according to a study. Curcumin, a bright-yellow compound found in the root of the Indian spice turmeric, prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain, and also removed pre-existing fear memories, researchers found. It is hoped that the findings will help develop treatments for people suffering with psychological disorders. Psychologists from The City University of New York trained rats to become scared when they heard a particular sound. Scientists assumed the creatures were frightened when they froze. Hours later, when the same sound was played to the rats, those who had been given ordinary food froze. Yet the rats fed the curcumin-rich diet didn’t freeze, suggesting their fearful memories had been erased. Professor Glenn Schafe, who led the study, said: ‘This suggests that people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological disorders that are characterised by fearful memories may benefit substantially from a curcumin-enriched diet.’ Memories are formed in the brain as new connections between neurons. They are initially fragile, but gradually stabilise in the brain as they are put into long-term storage - a process known as consolidation. When established memories are recalled they also temporarily destabilise in the brain, becoming like new memories for a while. ‘If nothing happens, those destabilised fear memories get put back into long-term storage. In other words, they restabilise, or reconsolidate,’ explained Professor Schafe. ‘But we’ve learned that we can go into the brain during that destabilisation window and prevent those fear memories from reconsolidating. Memories are formed in the brain as new connections between brain cells of neurons (pictured). They are initially fragile, but gradually stabilise in the brain as they are put into long-term storage . ‘Effectively, we can erase them. And that appears to be what we’ve done with a curcumin-enriched diet.’ Curcumin is known to have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body, and this may be how it works on fearful memories, said Professor Schafe. ‘Inflammatory processes have been implicated in a wide range of diseases ranging from allergies to cardiovascular disease to Alzheimer’s,’ he said. ‘Inflammation has also been implicated in psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. ‘Some of these same inflammatory pathways have also been implicated in memory formation, so it all fits. Another recent study found that a compound in  turmeric may also hold the key to repairing the brains of people suffering with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Saving cells: Studies are increasingly discovering the benefits of turmeric on the brain . In laboratory tests, the aromatic turmerone promoted the proliferation of brain stem cells and their development into neurons. It is hoped that the findings will help scientists develop treatments for conditions in which brain cells are lost, including Alzheimer's and stroke. The scientists examined the effect of aromatic turmerone on endogenous neutral stem cells (NSCs) found within adult brains. NSCs go on to develop into neurons, and play an important role in recovery from neurodegenerative diseases. Lead researcher Dr Adele Rueger, from the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine in Julich, Germany, said: 'While several substances have been described to promote stem cell proliferation in the brain, fewer drugs additionally promote the differentiation of stem cells into neurons, which constitutes a major goal in regenerative medicine. 'Our findings on aromatic turmerone take us one step closer to achieving this goal.' ‘But we need more studies to examine this further.’ It is not yet fully understood how curcumin impairs fear memories while sparing other types of memories, Professor Schafe said, but it is known that different types of memory systems encode different types of memories. So, the memory of the event could still be there, but without the memory of the fear, removing the frightening aspect of it. Previous studies have found that the spice may also be useful in the treatment of cancer, heart disease and arthritis, as well as having an anti-depressant effect.","Scientists found that curcumin, a compound found in the root of the Indian spice, prevented new fear memories being stored in the brain .
It also removed pre-existing fear memories, researchers found .
Scientists hope findings will contribute to the development of treatments for psychological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder ."
"Samantha Beaven's family say they will sell all their possessions to raise the £70,000 needed to fund pioneering treatment in Mexico . The six-year-old daughter of a woman fighting cancer has vowed to sell all her toys to help raise the £70,000 to fly her mother to Mexico for pioneering treatment. Samantha Beaven was diagnosed with cervical cancer when she went into labour 14 weeks early. Doctors had failed to spot the disease, mistaking her symptoms for those of pregnancy. The cancer has since spread to her brain and specialists have told the 28-year-old the disease is terminal. But refusing to give in, her family today said they are prepared to sell everything they own, their car, jewellery and toys, to try and raise enough money to fund treatment in Central America. Six-year-old Bracken said she will sell all her and her little sister Daisy's toys to help. The family said they have no choice other than to make themselves homeless by moving out of their rented property, saying it won't be a home without Mrs Beaven. The classroom assistant has so far responded well to treatment. But she suffered a fit this morning at home, and scans revealed her cancer has spread. Revolutionary hyperthermia treatment is not yet available in the UK but appealing for funding on the NHS would take weeks - time Mrs Beaven does not have. It involves using heat to target cancer cells specifically, liquefying tumours and studies have found it has prolonged life in some cases. Family friend Wendy Campling is helping to organize the sale. She said: ‘ They will sell everything they have to keep their mummy for longer. ‘They can live without their car and other stuff but not without their mummy. ‘Sam knows her cancer cannot be cured but with the right treatment she could live to be around for her babies for many years. ‘Both her children need her but Daisy being so very premature and poorly means she needs her mummy more than ever and we will do everything we can to make sure Sam is around to take care of her for as long as possible. ‘She could have years with the right treatment, but it is not available in the UK.’ Mrs Beaven from Brighton had visited hospital 10 times with bleeding and cramping only to be told they were signs of her pregnancy. It was only when she went into labour at 26 weeks in October 2013 that doctors discovered she had cervical cancer. She barely had time to come to terms with the news before Daisy was born 14 weeks early weighing just 2lb and 2oz. The 29-year-old was diagnosed with cervical cancer when she went into labour with her second daughter, Daisy 14 weeks early. She had been to doctors 10 times previously complaining of symptoms but they had been mistaken as common symptoms of pregnancy . Mrs Beaven, has so far responded well to life-prolonging treatment but recently suffered a fit and scans revealed the cancer has spread to her brain. She is desperate for revolutionary hypothermia treatment, not currently available on the NHS . Mrs Beaven hopes the treatment might give her years left with her two daughters, Bracken, six, and Daisy, pictured shortly after she was born a year ago . Both mother and daughter were treated at the same hospital but while Daisy thrived after surgery to remove part of her bowel when she contacted  life-threatening necrotizing enterocolitis, her mother’s cancer spread. She married her daughters’ father Alex Beaven in May last year and was delighted when she responded well to treatment to help prolong her life. Hyperthermia treatment uses heat to kill off cancer cells. Used locally, on the tumour itself, the treatment can liquify the disease. Meanwhile, if used as a whole body treatment, hyperthermia can improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Localised hyperthermia treatment, or ablatherm or ablation, has been used to treat prostate cancer. It applies high intensity focussed ultrasound to targeted tumours, liquifying the cells but leaving the surrounding tissues unscathed. The principle of hyperthermia rests on the fact cancer cells are much more sensitive to and intolerant of the effects of excessive heat than normal cells. Where it is used as a whole body treatment, patients' bodies are heated to extremely high temperatures, between 42°C and 45°C. It can be unpleasant so patients are often sedated to allow them to tolerate the heat. Chemotherapy meant she lost her hair and Mrs Beaven began wearing a bright purple wig to make her children smile. Scans in October last year showed the tumours in her lungs were shrinking and she felt confident she would live long enough to see Daisy, now one, start school. Earlier this year the brave mother shared her story with the MailOnline to help raise awareness of cervical cancer and save other lives. She said at the time: ‘Daisy fought so hard to live that I owe it to her and her sister Bracken to do the same. ‘All little ones need their mothers but Daisy being so very premature makes her particularly vulnerable and I just want to be here to help her father protect her as long as I can.’ She had felt in good health until she was found fitting in bed by husband Alex and was rushed by ambulance to Brighton’s Royal Sussex County Hospital. A scan revealed the cervical cancer had spread to her brain. Friend Ms Campling said: ‘We need to get Sam to Mexico for treatment immediately; we don’t have time to wait for the NHS to consider funding her. Time is running out. ‘We need to keep this mummy with her children. They can get another home and another car in the future but they need to save Sam now.' To donate please visit her website here.

"Isabella Janew, 16 months, died at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children after suffering two cardiac arrests following heart surgery . A toddler died after a blood pressure monitor was turned away by a nurse who told her mother that looking at it would 'drive her mad', an inquest heard today. Isabella Janew, 16 months, had been admitted to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for surgery to widen her aortic valve after she was born with a soft heart murmur and later diagnosed with aortic stenosis. She had been diagnosed in May 2013, when she was a year old, and had been put on a waiting list for surgery. But Isabella, from Gloucester, suffered a cardiac arrest and a pulmonary haemorrhage during the operation in September 2013. Doctors battled to save Isabella's life and after some time were finally able to bring her round abandoning the half-finished procedure and returning her to intensive care. However, her parents, Daniel and Debbie Janew, claim nurses in charge of her care ignored warnings to keep her blood pressure high and ignored their pleas for help when it dropped low. Mr and Mrs Janew said they had raised concerns about their daughter's blood pressure, only for the machine to be turned away from them by a nurse so they could not see it. The parents said their daughter had responded well when her neurological function was checked, but doctors quickly placed her back into an induced state. Within hours Isabella suffered another cardiac arrest, and despite 40 minutes of CPR, doctors were unable to bring her round, and she died. Reading her husband's statement at the inquest at Flax Burton Coroner's Court, Mrs Janew said: 'I held Isabella's hand and told her to squeeze mine. Isabella Janew, 16 months, had been admitted to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for surgery to widen her aortic valve after she was born with a soft heart murmur and later diagnosed with aortic stenosis . 'She gently squeezed my hand and opened her eyes and looked at me. Then she turned and looked at her mum. 'She became frustrated with the instruments and the machinery attached to her. 'She was lively and we were told at that point a doctor hit the muscle relaxant drug button again as he thought her to be too lively.' Mr Janew added: 'We were told by doctors her blood pressure couldn't be allowed to drop below 50, and should preferably be kept above it. 'Her blood pressure often dropped below that but when we told nurses they said ‘don’t worry, it’s fine’. 'Her blood pressure often dropped below that but when we told nurses they said 'don't worry, it's fine'. 'At this point her blood pressure was around 40, Debbie saw it drop to 38 on a number of occasions. 'When Debbie voiced concerns again the machine was turned away from her by the nurse who said it would drive her mad.' The inquest heard that Isabella's illness had been detected by doctors in Gloucester when she was just over a year old, in May 2013. The toddler was referred to Dr Robin Martin at the hospital, who added her to his list to perform surgery, and she was given a date of September 9 for the operation. The night before the operation, the inquest heard, Isabella, despite suffering from sweating and panting was her usual talkative self. 'The evening she was extremely playful, wanting to play with her toys and talk and walk everywhere,' said Mrs Janew. 'Although Isabella was initially placed in a room with three beds she was moved to a room on her own as she was talking, singing and wanting to play, keeping the other children awake,"" Daniel added. 'During this time she never had her blood pressure read, or re-taken. 'On the day of the surgery Isabella was sat on my knee singing to me, then we watched a children's TV programme.' Earlier this month an inquest into the death of four-month-old Lacey-Marie Poton (pictured with her mother Emma Norley), who died at the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in 2013, was told that paramedics had not treated her condition as an emergency . Isabella was taken into theatre at around 9am, but despite showing good vital signs, crashed within minutes of surgeons adding a dye into her heart to assess its output. Dr Martin told the inquest: 'As I was looking at the screen there was a very abrupt change in her ECG. 'This usually indicates there is not enough blood getting into her coronary arteries. 'Almost simultaneously upon seeing that I noticed the pressure in her left ventricle dropped to a very low level. It was clearly not a very good situation.' He added that he had never seen so much blood appear during any similar case. It later emerged Isabella had been given an overdose of two drugs designed to constrict the blood vessels, adrenaline and vasopressin, during her fight on the operating table. But, the inquest heard, it was unlikely this caused her second cardiac arrest. The inquest was also told that doctors are still unsure as to what caused Isabella’s catastrophic arrest. 'To be frank we were never able to assert the reason she went into cardiac arrest,' Dr Martin said. The Janews are among up to ten families who have called for a public inquiry into care at Bristol Children's Hospital, with the independent review headed by lawyer and healthcare specialist Sir Ian Kennedy set to be completed this year. Isabella's is the eighth inquest into the death of a child following cardiac surgery at the hospital. Earlier this month an inquest into the death of four-month-old Lacey-Marie Poton, who died at the hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest at her home in 2013, was told that paramedics had not treated her condition as an emergency. The inquest continues.","Isabella Janew died after surgery at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children .

"A New York court ordered the maker of Monster Energy drink to pay $1.7 million to the Beastie Boys for copyright infringement although the company claimed they owe no more than $125,000. Attorneys for Adam 'Ad-Rock' Horovitz and Michael 'Mike D' Diamond of the Beastie Boys asked the court to order the company to pay nearly $2.5 million in legal fees to cover their costs in the copyright violation case that began in August 2012. In June 2014, a Manhattan federal court jury awarded the rappers $1.7 million in damages. Beastie Boys: A New York court ordered the maker of Monster Energy drink to pay $1.7 million to the Beastie Boys for copyright infringement although the company claimed they owe no more than $125,000 . $2.5 Million: Attorneys for Adam 'Ad-Rock' Horovitz (left) and Michael 'Mike D' Diamond (right) of the Beastie Boys asked the court to order the company to pay nearly $2.5 million in legal fees to cover their costs in the copyright violation case that began in August 2012 . The group first sought the $2.5 million in 2012 for false endorsement and copyright infringement after California-based Monster Energy Co. allegedly used part of several of the group's songs in a promotional video on Monster's website, Rolling Stone reports. The group also posted a 23-minute medley of the group's songs on the site and made it available for download. The company admitted wrongly using the group's songs in the video that was online for five weeks, but holds that an employee thought the company had permission to use the songs, according to Rolling Stone. MCA: The suit was filed just months after Adam 'MCA' Yauch, one of the group's members, died from cancer in May of 2012 . The songs were reportedly taken from a live set done by DJ Z-Trip, an American disk jockey and producer, at a Monster-sponsored festival in Canada. When the Monster employee sent a draft of a video using the footage to the DJ asking if he approved, the DJ replied 'Dope!' This allegedly led the employee to believe the DJ was approving Monster's use of the footage. However, in the June 2014 ruling of the judge in the Beastie Boys' favor, it was said that the word 'dope' was not the same as consent to use the footage. Also, the judge held that the DJ had no authority to grant such permission, Rolling Stone reports. The beverage maker said initially at the trial that it should owe no more than $125,000 and planned to file an appeal, but a judge decided that the $1.7 million would remain intact, Reuters reports. The judge ruled that the company's use of the group's songs could lead people to believe they endorsed the energy drinks. An attorney for Monster told Rolling Stone that though the company respects the jury's decision 'we strongly disagree with it.' The suit claimed that Monster included parts of 'Sabotage,' 'So What'cha Want,' Make Some Noise' and 'Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun' in the promotional video. The suit was filed just months after Adam 'MCA' Yauch, one of the group's members, died from cancer in May of 2012. Yauch's will prohibits any company from using the group's music for advertisements, Rolling Stone reports. The Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. They have produced four No. 1 albums.

"A cosmetic surgeon who put patients in danger by teaching nurses how to administer Botox illegally has been banned from the medical profession for a year. Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses £400 a day for training courses on injecting the toxic drug at his Harley Street clinic. Showing a ‘cavalier’ attitude to safety, he told them to give Botox to patients without a prescription. Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses £400 a day for training courses on illegally injecting Botox. Pictured: Dr Harrison advertises his training in a video . He admitted the practice was ‘naughty’ but said regulation was so lax they would get away with it. It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a £4million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than £1million from the scam. But Harrison, managing director of Harley Aesthetics, was exposed by an undercover BBC investigation in which a journalist posed as a trainee nurse to film him secretly. Yesterday he was condemned for his ‘flippant, cavalier and deplorable’ attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing. The Fitness To Practise panel found him guilty of misconduct by encouraging the nurses to break the law and suspended him for 12 months. Botox is normally administered by a doctor to a patient with a valid prescription after a face-to-face consultation. But Harrison found a loophole in the law at the time that allowed remote prescribing in exceptional circumstances, and he authorised nurses to perform the procedure by speaking to them on his mobile. He charged £30 for each ‘consultation’ and offered one-day training courses at his practice for nurses who wanted to administer Botox. It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a £4million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than £1million from the scam . The 2012 BBC investigation alleged Harrison told nurses to use Botox prescribed for one patient on another and actively encouraged them to not pay adequate regard to a patient’s medical history before administering the jabs. The millionaire – who also owns a six-bedroom Gloucestershire mansion with a nearby private stable for his seven polo ponies and properties in the French Alps including a £1million chalet and a hotel – boasted in his company newsletter that he carried out 50,000 remote prescriptions, suggesting he made £1.5million from the phone calls alone. His company, one of the UK’s largest purchasers of Botox, charged patients from £200 for a treatment. He was filmed telling nurses: ‘Strictly speaking, a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient. We use it on a number of people. Is it ever an issue? No. It is not legal but it’s what everybody does, doctors, professors, me. Just order a vial in your name – it’s not policed at all.’ Harrison also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before giving Botox they should go ahead and he would authorise it afterwards. He was condemned for his ‘flippant, cavalier and deplorable’ attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing for carrying out the training courses at his Harley Street clinic (pictured) Suspending him following a hearing in Manchester, the panel said: ‘The findings against Dr Harrison are wide-ranging, some are repeated and involve the potential to place patients at risk of harm. His conduct... could properly be described as deplorable.’ In a letter to the panel, Dr Harrison said: ‘I can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients, to use vials between patients would be dangerous. It would be unacceptable. 'However, in the context of Botox where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time, I would contend that that is not dangerous, but I have not been accused of doing it. I do not encourage nurses to do that.’ In the wake of the investigation into Harrison, the GMC has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as Botox, meaning they must hold a face-to-face consultation.","Dr Mark Harrison charged nurses £400 a day for courses on injecting Botox .

"Rising Labour star Chuka Umunna stormed off a live TV interview today after becoming embroiled in an angry on-air spat over a letter he had not read. The shadow business secretary was repeatedly pressed by Sky News anchorman Dermot Murnaghan about letters sent by the Government to English mosques urging them to root out extremism. After a series of angry exchanges Mr Umunna - who said he had been invited on to talk about David Cameron's earlier speech on the economy - walked off while the cameras were still rolling, waving his hand at the screen in exasperation. Chuka Umunna walked off of a live interview on Sky News after being questioned by Dermot Murnaghan this afternoon . Mr Murnaghan was questioning the Shadow Business Secretary about a letter sent to mosques in England which is urging them to root out extremists . The bulk of Mr Umunna's interview revolved around the economy and employment. But as it drew to a close, Mr Murnaghan asked him whether he thought Communities Secretary Eric Pickles was 'patronising' the Islamic community by urging imams to 'lay out more clearly than ever before' that British Muslims can be proud both of their faith and their country. When Mr Umunna replied: 'I have to confess, I haven't read the letter myself', Murnaghan responded: 'Well, what are you doing in politics? Come on, everyone's talking about it. It's the middle of the afternoon and you still haven't read this?' The shadow business secretary replied: 'With the greatest of respect, Dermot, I wasn't told you were going to ask me about this, but since you've asked me the question, let me answer it.' He said that that extremism was 'something for the Muslim community to tackle, but also for all of us it's something we have to tackle more widely'. Murnaghan read out an excerpt from the letter, and asked whether it was 'patronising', to which the shadow business secretary responded: 'I'm not sure I would use the word 'patronising' for the simple reason that I haven't read the letter. You and I can have this debate if you want, but the wider and bigger issue for us is how we ensure that young Muslim people...' Mr Umunna didn't want to answer questions about the Eric Pickles row as he hadn't read his letter and said he was on to talk about David Cameron's speech on the economy . An exasperated Mr Umunna walked off screen after TV anchor Dermot Murnaghan said: 'So you're not going to speak until you get the party line right' Mr Umunna said: 'I'm not just going to speak off-piste without having actually read a letter. I don't think you're being terribly fair' The interviewer interjected: 'Do you want to come on in half an hour's time? It doesn't take long to read the letter and then we can have this discussion.' Mr Umunna replied: 'Dermot, I think you are being a bit ridiculous right now and your viewers can form their own views. I was asked to come on and speak about David Cameron's speech on the economy and what was happening around the labour market. Nobody told me I was going to come onto this programme and be asked to agree whether I thought the Government was patronising Muslim people and Muslim leaders. 'I'm not just going to speak off-piste without having actually read a letter. I don't think you're being terribly fair. Your viewers can make your own decision.' Murnaghan responded: 'So you're not going to speak until you get the party line right? OK, well we'll have to end it there,' prompting Mr Umunna to get up from his seat and leave while the camera was still rolling.","The Labour MP was involved in an angry bust up with Dermot Murnaghan .

"Hermino Padilla's lifeless body was pulled from the tank in Florida on Saturday, 18 hours after he was first reported missing at 2 a.m. A West Palm Beach water treatment facility employee died in a tragic accident after falling through a grate into a sewage tank. Hermino Padilla Jr's., 48, lifeless body was pulled from the tank in Florida on Saturday, 18 hours after he was first reported missing at 2 a.m. Divers found his body in a pipe  after he plummeted into an open tank of sewage. His son, Steven Padilla told WESH-Orlando his father often worked long hours at the West Palm Beach water treatment facility, but had no clue where he was after he'd gone missing. He waited outside locked gates while police and rescue workers searched the 100-acre property off of Roebuck Road and Florida's Turnpike. He said: '(Investigators) saw the grate was missing, they could only conclude the grate sort of became unlatched and went with him in the water and dumped him in there.' 'Of course I'm upset. Something could have been and should have been done about it. 'You hope he'd just wake up the next day and everything was fine but it's not,' Padilla added. His son described his father as a kind-hearted, giving, person. West Palm Beach police spokeswoman Lori Colombino said: 'This is still an open investigation and we will not be providing an additional statement at this time.' City spokesman Elliot Cohen said: 'The collective prayers of an entire city are going out to his (Hermino Padillo Jr.'s) family.

"Her remarkably smooth skin and taut complexion has already attracted plenty of attention. But yesterday it was Amanda Holden’s eyebrows that were, well, raising eyebrows. Gone were the wispy blonde strands that once framed her eyes – and in their place were darker, well-defined arches that helped make the 43-year-old look more youthful than ever as she arrived to begin auditions for this year’s series of Britain’s Got Talent. Her secret? It appears Miss Holden is now a devotee of HD Brows, the £40 once-a-month treatment also beloved of celebrities including fellow Britain’s Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon, singer Tulisa Contostavlos and Strictly star Frankie Bridge. Scroll down for video . Amanda Holden stepped out showcasing thick eyebrows (right), far fuller than previous well-plucked look . Amanda raises a full eyebrow while signing autographs for fans on the Britain's Got Talent red carpet . The HD – ‘high definition’ – process has seven steps designed to sculpt the eyebrows and combat the sparse look that plagues many women after years of over-plucking. Launched by beauty specialist Nilam Patel, it includes treatment to stimulate hair growth, followed by colouring, shaping and applying make-up to give a dramatic finish. The number of treatments needed to achieve the desired look varies, but upkeep sessions are recommended every four to six weeks. Last night a source close to Miss Holden said: ‘Amanda has let her eyebrows grow and has a brow shaping treatment called HD Brows by Nilam [Patel] at Eyebrow Queen.’ Amanda has a sleek new look with hair worn long and straight, strong brows and red lipstick . Alison Eiffe, an HD Brow specialist who works at Reveal Salons in Farringdon, London, said: ‘The look that HD Brows gives you is very symmetrical and measured so it looks great on camera. ‘It’s the combination of all seven steps that gives you a really crisp and sharp outline.’ The seven-step process starts with a consultation, at which clients may be given a daily cream to stimulate hair growth. The second step is the application of an eyebrow tint and the third is to design the desired shape of the brows. Amanda's brows are considerably thicker than they were before, they also appear to be darker thanks to the £40-a-month treatment . In the fourth step, the desired shape is created by waxing; in the fifth, the eyebrows are threaded to remove any fine hairs that escaped the wax; and in the sixth, tweezers are used to pluck any remaining hairs and give a sharp, precise finish. The final step is to add liner and powder to make the brows bolder and fill in any gaps. Mother of two Miss Holden has previously admitted to using Botox to smooth her skin, but has since said she has stopped.","Amanda Holden showed off darker brows on the red carpet .

"Pleading for help, Edna Slann reaches out to her appalled family in desperation. ‘I’m starving,’ she says. ‘I’m bloody starving. Have you got anything to eat here now?’ While dementia has left the 89-year-old muddled in many ways, she is certain about one thing. ‘Oh god. I want something to eat,’ she begs, in harrowing video footage that shames Britain’s care system. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: In footage taken by her granddaughter, an injured Edna Slann tells of being left thirsty and starving by staff at Grantley Court nursing home . The 89-year-old was evacuated from Grantley Court in Sutton, south London last year. Her family began filming her on visits over concerns she was being neglected . ‘They keep you starving in here. This is not me at all. This is not normal, these b******* here are not normal. I just want to get out of this place.’ Mrs Slann, a widow who has dementia and arthritis and needs a wheelchair, was moved in July from a residential home to Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London. Her family claims she was neglected from the outset and her health rapidly deteriorated. They said she lost more than half a stone in two months and is now little over five stone and reliant on morphine to control her pain. She suffered severe facial bruising and a gash to her head which needed 12 stitches and now has just weeks to live. Mrs Slann was filmed on September 21 by her granddaughter Becky, after she and her mother Linda Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, became fearful she was being neglected. In a horrifying video, Mrs Slann can be seen pleading for help, while touching a large cut on her head. Shaking with desperation and rage, she tells her granddaughter: ‘I’m hungry. Have you got anything to eat here now? I’m bloody starving. They keep you bleeding starving in here.’ She can be seen shutting her eyes in despair, while saying: ‘Oh god. I want something to eat. I’m angry. Give me something to eat.’ Mrs Slann was left needing stitches to the head and with severe bruising across her face while living at the home which was evacuated last year . Transformation: Mrs Slann, pictured left before entering the care home, and right. Her family said they felt guilty for allowing her to stay in the home . After the food does not come, she is seen lowering her expectations. ‘I just want a cup of tea, that’s all I want. Get us a cup of tea.’ She is reassured by staff that her food will come in ‘just 15 minutes’. Later, she says: ‘Whatever’s happened to me? They’re making me bloody mad. ‘This effing place. It drives me round the bloody bend here. They are all bloody nutcases. I just want to get out of this place.’ After staff discovered a bedsore on her foot, she was taken to hospital. When hospital staff called Grantley Court for an explanation, they were apparently told it was ‘not that bad’. Doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg, involving serious surgery which would probably kill her. Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of- one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. She was a ‘lively and happy grandmother’, according to her family. Her daughter said it was ‘terrible’ to see how she has suffered. She added: ‘It is horrendous to think that she has suffered. ‘We filmed her because she kept saying she was hungry. We feel guilty we let her go to Grantley Court. It is hard to talk about but I am speaking out because no one should go through this.’ Mrs Slann’s stay at Grantley Court cost £595 a week, which was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she was relocated as soon as concerns were raised. A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection. p.bentley@dailymail.co.uk .","Edna Slann was filmed by her family amid fears she was being neglected .

"A new online test which assesses the chance of developing Alzheimer's should be taken by everyone over the age of 50, according to experts. The 20-minute cognitive function test, launched online today, asks simple questions about lifestyle and diet and can calculate a person's risk of being diagnosed with the  brain condition. Featuring a total of 37 questions, as well as additional interactive memory tests, experts believe the online assessment will help encourage people to change risk factors in their lifestyle and provide vital information about the disease. Scroll down for video . The 20-minute cognitive function test asks simple questions about lifestyle, diet - including coffee consumption - and memory and can calculate a person's risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's . Designed for those aged 50 to 70, it has been developed by Professor David Smith from Oxford University, who is one of the leading figures in Alzheimer's research in Britain, and charity Food For The Brain. Professor Smith, who has years of experience in cognitive function, said that as well as acting as a screening programme, the test also provides advice and a personalised health plan. He told the Daily Express: 'Not only does the test give people positive prevention steps to reduce risk in the long-term but also there's an annual check-up so people can track how diet and lifestyle changes impact on their cognitive function.' He hopes the results of hundreds of thousands of people doing the test will provide vital information to help develop a national prevention strategy. The test, available on Food For The Brain's website, has been launched after a successful pilot in which 200,000 people took part. It has also been trialled by experts at Cornell University's Medical Centre in New York. One in four people aged over 50 are predicted to develop Alzheimer's at some stage in their life, and approximately 850,000 people in Britain are currently affected by the disease, which is the most common form of dementia. There are currently no cures for the disease and risk factors are said to include a lack of intellectual stimulating activity, a lack of exercise and a low intake of vegetables and essential vitamins. High sugar and fatty diets are said to increase the risk of developing the disease. A selection of questions asked in the 20-minute cognitive function test. Those taking the test should score 0-3 points for answers A-C respectively and add up their scores at the end. The lower the score the better . One in four people aged over 50 are predicted to develop Alzheimer's at some stage in their life. Pictured: Brain scans showing healthy cognitive function (top) and one demonstrating signs of Alzheimer's (bottom) Patrick Holford, director of Food For The Brain, said that of the 200,000 people who took the test as part of its pilot period, 85 per cent scored in the 'green' zone – deemed healthy – while the others were advised to visit their GP. Older people with memory problems can boost their brainpower with fish oil supplements, say researchers. Healthy people with mild memory deficits of events in their past life, so-called episodic memory, had improved recall after six months of treatment. A new overview says the omega-3 fatty acid DHA has most benefit for people with existing memory problems, particularly when they are coping with physical or mental stress. Experts believe supplements rich in DHA from fish oils or other marine sources might slow or prevent mental decline as it is found in reduced amounts in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Carrie Ruxton, independent public health nutritionist who reviewed the latest evidence for supplements manufacturer Equazen, said oily fish consumption was falling. He said: 'By encouraging people to take positive prevention steps, and tracking their memory function over time, we hope to be able to map the extent to which specific diet and lifestyle improvements stop or delay cognitive decline in hundreds of thousands of people. 'We want to encourage everyone over 50 to start taking positive prevention steps now rather than wait until it is too late. 'If people aged 50 start to do a very sensitive memory test every year then they are going to maximise their chances of taking actions that will reduce that risk. 'The brain starts shrinking from at least the age of 50 so in other words it is not that people suddenly develop Alzheimer's in their 80s. 'What happens is that our brains start shrinking much earlier – it is about a 30 to 40 year process leading up to developing Alzheimer's disease dementia. 'Two in five people over 60 already have accelerated brain shrinkage that puts them at very high risk of developing it. 'We hope the cognitive function test will become part of a national health policy to tackle this preventable disease.' The test can be done on any computer or laptop, but not on a mobile or smartphone, and is a screening tool, not a diagnostic test.

"Ross Buggins, 30, who suffered from encephalitis, with his partner Emma Baston, 27 . Looking back on last autumn, Ross Buggins can scarcely believe what happened. Four weeks after developing insomnia, he was suffering from panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. He was then sectioned and sent to a mental health ward for two months. But he wasn't mentally ill. Ross, 30, had a form of encephalitis - brain inflammation - caused when his own immune system started attacking a protein in the brain, affecting its function. It's thought that a simple virus might have kicked his immune system into overdrive. Yet his condition was only correctly diagnosed last November, three months after he'd been sectioned - despite him showing classic signs of encephalitis, such as memory loss. Worryingly, many experts believe encephalitis, as well as other common neurological disorders such as dementia and even migraines, are often misdiagnosed as mental health problems because their symptoms include depression and anxiety. 'Dozens of neurological conditions can be missed as purely mental health illnesses,' says Duncan Banks, a lecturer in biomedical science at the Open University and director of the British Neuroscience Association. 'These include mini strokes [transient ischaemic attacks], which can change behaviour, for example by making people more impulsive or emotional, depending on the affected part of the brain.' Last week a study published in the journal Neurology reported that depression, anxiety and irritability can be early signs of Alzheimer's before the more typical memory loss and confusion appear. Meanwhile, Parkinson's can result in depression, anxiety and psychosis. And many patients suffering headaches are diagnosed with anxiety, panic attacks, depression or fatigue, yet it's actually migraine that's likely to be causing these symptoms, says Dr Nick Silver, of the NHS Walton Centre for Neuroscience and Neurosurgery in Liverpool. 'Migraine can cause a huge variety of symptoms, including low mood, poor sleep and fatigue. Those patients can be given antidepressants, which may not be the appropriate treatment,' says Dr Silver. If patients have no mental health symptoms when they are 'crystal-clear and headache-free', it may suggest migraine is to blame - whereas depression would cause these symptoms consistently. Around 40 per cent of migraine sufferers find eliminating all painkillers and caffeine and eating and drinking regularly will banish all or most of those associated symptoms. After trying to hang himself Ross was sectioned and taken to a mental health hospital in Nottingham . Meanwhile, antidepressants can actually reduce the quality of sleep, and may worsen migraine. Certain types of epilepsy can lead to confusion and odd behaviour because seizures can damage different parts of the brain, while brain tumours and parasitic diseases such as Lyme disease - a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks - can also cause mental health symptoms, such as low mood and erratic behaviour. And problems with the parathyroid glands (which control calcium levels) can cause irrational behaviour, because excessively high calcium levels affect the function of the brain and central nervous system. 'GPs aren't always aware of different symptoms associated with these conditions, and the easy option is to give patients antidepressants. So they aren't getting the right treatments,' says Dr Banks. This means patients may not be referred to a neurologist, who could make the correct diagnosis, and are instead under the care of a mental health team. Ross's problems started last April, when he caught a virus that caused mouth ulcers, sickness, diarrhoea and led to poor sleep. A month later he developed insomnia, rashes on his arms, legs and waist, and his hands and feet started to blister. He saw a GP in June. 'I thought my body was just struggling to fight off an infection,' says Ross, an IT consultant who lives with his partner, Emma, 27, in Norwich. His GP took blood, stool and urine samples but the results came back clear. The GP handed him a leaflet on anxiety management. Ross, who'd otherwise been a fit and healthy young man, then started having panicked thoughts. 'I'd convince myself I'd die from a heart attack after a run, or a plane would fall out of the sky on to me. I'd never been a worrier before, but I was fixated on irrational fears.' Ross was finally diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis . After having a panic attack and experiencing suicidal thoughts, he was prescribed antidepressants and a sedative, diazepam - his GP also recommended a private therapist as there was a long waiting list on the NHS. Initially, the therapist helped, but shortly after this Ross had a massive panic attack. 'My head felt as if it was burning and my muscles locked up. I couldn't breathe properly but was screaming,' he says. His parents, who he was visiting at the time, called an ambulance. He had blood tests, a chest X-ray and CT scan in hospital before doctors declared the problem was 'truly psychological' and discharged him. 'I thought I was having a mental breakdown, which felt awful as it was so unlike me,' says Ross. He then started having memory problems, forgetting who his relatives were, for example. After another panic attack, he was taken back to hospital. This time mental health services were called and he was given stronger antidepressants. But they had no effect - and weeks later Ross tried to hang himself. 'I felt life was not worth living. I'm so lucky the belt snapped.' He was then sectioned and taken to a mental health hospital in Nottingham, roughly 120 miles from his home, because there were no closer beds available. 'I can't remember much after this point,' says Ross. 'Apparently, I tried escaping, and told people I didn't need to be there.' A week later he was transferred to the mental health ward at Hellesdon Hospital in Norwich, where he stayed for seven weeks. 'In my notes, which months later I asked for, doctors kept noting my lack of memory, but never considered a neurological explanation.' He was referred to a sleep clinic at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for his poor sleep, but then he started falling asleep all the time - even while eating. The sleep expert recognised something else was wrong with him, and urged his doctors at Hellesdon to revisit his case. A week later his sodium levels plummeted - because the brain regulates sodium, anything affecting the brain can alter levels - and he went into a coma-like state. The number of prescriptions written for antidepressants in the UK every year . He was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where he was seen by a neurologist for the first time. Three-and-a-half weeks later in November, after a series of tests, Ross was finally diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. This is a rare form of the disease, caused by antibodies produced by the immune system targeting the NMDA protein in the brain. Symptoms include seizures, confusion and problems with cognitive function. Dr Sarosh Irani, a consultant neurologist and senior research fellow at Oxford University Hospitals, says: 'Typical forms of psychosis and depression occur over months, while in these auto-immune forms of encephalitis the symptoms can appear over days or weeks.' Ross was given steroids and intravenous immune globulin (infusions of antibodies from donors). Two days later he became fully conscious for the first time since August. 'I couldn't believe it was November. Doctors said inflammation in my brain had affected parts of it controlling memory and emotions, causing my symptoms. It was incredible how normal I felt.' Five days later he was discharged. The big issue is the split between psychiatry and other areas of medicine, says Paul Goldsmith, a consultant neurologist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. 'It would help if psychiatrists and neurologists had closer working practices, but largely that doesn't happen.' Increasingly, patients are being seen not by psychiatrists, but by mental health nurses, psychologists and cognitive behavioural therapists, who may not always be able to recognise these disorders, adds Dr Silver. Ross has a one in ten chance of relapse, but now knows the signs so he can get treatment quickly. 'It's scary that there are probably other people in the mental health system who are not really psychotic and have a physical cause for their symptoms that they aren't being treated for,' he says. 'I'm amazed Emma stood by me through all this - she's my rock.' February 22 is World Encephalitis Day .

"A DJ left with devastating head injuries in an alleyway attack has spoken of his fury that the thug who 'nearly killed him' has had ten months slashed off his sentence. Father-of-two Wayne Urwin suffered severe bleeding to his brain after he was felled by a single punch from Aaron Robson following a dispute outside a bar in Morpeth, Northumberland last March. The 37-year-old’s injuries were so severe he was put into an induced coma due to emergency surgery to remove part of his skull, while his devastated parents were told he would probably not make it through the night. Scroll down for video . DJ Wayne Urwin, who was left with devastating head injuries in an alleyway attack, has spoken of his fury that the thug who 'nearly killed him' has had ten months slashed off his sentence . Mr Urwin defied medics to survive the attack, but says he has now been left 'really disappointed' that 20-year-old Robson has had his prison sentence cut while he will never fully recover from his injuries. Robson, 20, of  Cramlington, was sentenced to three years and two months in prison after he admitted grievous bodily harm  at Newcastle Crown Court in August. But at a hearing at the Appeal Court in London, the term was cut to two years and four months after Mr Justice Simon deemed the original sentence failed to sufficiently reflect Robson’s guilty plea. This means if Robson could be out of prison in October, after serving half of his sentence. Father-of-two Mr Urwin (left) suffered severe bleeding to his brain after he was felled by a single punch from Aaron Robson (right) following a dispute outside a bar in Morpeth, Northumberland last March . Mr Urwin’s injuries were so severe he was put into an induced coma due to emergency surgery to remove part of his skull, while his devastated parents were told he would probably not make it through the night . Mr Urwin, a former Radio Northumberland DJ, hit out at the decision, saying: 'In my mind, they’re letting someone out early who was drunk and aggressive and, even after I lay unconscious, kneeled in my blood and carried on hitting me. 'Do we really want people like that back out on the streets early? He very nearly killed me and I don’t think two years and four months, which he will only serve half of, reflects that.' Mr Urwin needed repeated surgery to treat a swelling in his brain, with bone being removed from his skull to relieve the pressure. Mr Urwin needed repeated surgery to treat a swelling in his brain, with bone being removed from his skull to relieve the pressure . He has previously revealed how the attack had transformed his life, leaving him in need of further surgery to fit a metal plate in his head and suffering from seizures. He is still unable to drive to see his children Marley, seven, and Georgina, four, who live with an ex partner, or to work. Robson’s legal team had argued at the Appeal Court on Friday, that the sentence was too harsh in light of his youth. Mr Justice Simon, sitting with Lord Justice Davis and Mr Justice Holgate, noted the 'life-changing and serious injuries' sustained by Wayne. He said: 'The punch knocked Mr Urwin unconscious to the ground. 'He was unable to break his fall and his head struck the ground causing him serious injuries. 'Robson also punched the victim twice while he was lying on the ground unable to defend himself in what was a sustained attack.' However, he concluded that the original sentence failed to sufficiently reflect Robson’s guilty plea, and the term to two years and four months. Mr Urwin, also of Cramlington, said he felt let down and was disappointed with the justice system. 'I knew the hearing was coming up and the liaison officer was going to let me know the outcome,' he said. 'But I didn’t hear anything from them, so I rang the Probation Service, who rang London, and told me he’d had his sentence cut. 'I just feel really disappointed. I think it’s completely unfair judging by the sentence I’m having to serve myself as I try to recover. Mr Urwin with his children Marley, seven, and Georgina, four, before the attack (left). He has been unable to drive to visit his young son and daughter following the attack and can not work . 'I’m never going to finish my sentence – I’m never going to be completely back to normal. I’ve not even had the operation to put a plate in my head yet and I hear Robson could be out in a couple of months. 'His guilty plea was taken into account at the original hearing. The judge was going to give him four years but reduced it to three years and two months because of his guilty plea – he’s already had a 10 month reduction, now he’s getting a 20-month reduction, how is that fair? 'I just don’t understand the judge’s logic behind his decision.

"When the simple act of walking up and down the stairs made Caroline Kupfers feel as if she was going to have a heart attack, she knew it was time to do something about her weight. The secretary from Scunthorpe feared that at 19st 13lb she wouldn't live to see her daughter grow up and even considered gastric bypass surgery. But after going on a meal replacement diet, in which she swapped food for shakes, the 33-year-old lost 10st, boosted her confidence and says her marriage is now even stronger. Caroline Kupfers shows off her 10st weight loss after swapping out meals for calorie-controlled shakes . After years of yo-yo dieting, Caroline feared she wouldn't be around to see her daughter Nikita, 10, grow up . The secretary had always considered herself a 'big girl', even from a young age. She said: 'I remember being bigger as far back as I remember and was always trying to lose the weight some way or another. I tried Weight Watchers, Rosemary Conley, Slimming World, the Cambridge Diet Plan but none of them seemed to work. 'I managed to lose 6st before I had my daughter but as soon as I became pregnant the weight crept back on. 'The turning point for me was when I couldn't even walk back and forth up the stairs without feeling I was going to collapse and die. Worried her 19st 13lb frame meant she wouldn't live to see her daughter grow up, Caroline considered having gastric bypass surgery. Scared of going under the knife she decided to give dieting one last shot, opting for a drastic meal replacement programme alongside attending support groups. Caroline went on a series of diets and even considered a gastric band before she finally slimmed down . Caroline ditched junk food and unhealthy snacks during her low-calorie diet and dropped nine dress sizes . 'It was LighterLife or a gastric bypass and LighterLife seemed a lot less scary in comparison,' she explained. Caroline undertook the Total Programme in which  conventional food is replaced by a nutritionally complete called the Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) provided in four 'foodpacks'  a day. She also attended LighterLife's behaviour change programme which involved attending weekly counselling groups to help her understand the real reasons for her overeating. Previously Caroline's diet consisted mainly of junk food, with constant snacking on fatty and salty foods like  chocolate and crisps. She said: 'At lunch I would never have a packed lunch. I would always go to Greggs or buy a sandwich, with crisps, a sausage roll and sometimes a cake. 'There would be sweets and biscuits in the office and I would have crisps and chocolate bars while I was at my daughter's dancing class. At her peak weight of 19st 13lb Caroline was terrified of going on fairground rides, fearing she'd get stuck . 'After that it would be late, and I'd often order a pizza. When you're tired it is easy to just have a takeaway or chippy. 'It can also be about what you drink, and I used to go out every weekend and drink blue WKD.' After 10 months on the programme, cutting out food entirely, Caroline had lost an incredible 10st, dropping from a size 28 to a size 10. She then gradually began to reintroduced healthy conventional food. Caroline explained the effect her size had on her family. She said: 'My mum, especially, was always worried about my health due to my size. She is so proud of me that I have lost the weight and am healthier and happier. 'My husband and daughter, Nikita, also couldn't be prouder. Nikita loves that Mummy can now jump up and down on the trampoline with her and run around with the dog.' Now a shadow of her former self Caroline says she has more energy to play with her daughter . 'One of the best and most significant factors in losing the weight has got to be my increase in confidence. Everyday activities and fun days out were so difficult. 'Whenever we would go to a theme park I wouldn't dare even try and get on any of the rides through fear that I would get stuck or I would break it. 'If anything my weight loss has made my marriage even stronger as my husband has been just so supportive. 'He was so good not to rub my face in it while I was on the programme and never cooked meals in front of me. I would never cook before as I was so tired and seemed to live on pizza but now we cook the meals together as a family.' Breakfast: A yoghurt, fruit and a cereal bar .

Caroline's counsellor Natalie says of her phenomenal weight loss: 'Caroline is just a completely different person to when I first met her. Her confidence has risen tenfold and it is so lovely to see her so happy and healthy. 'I think part of the reason she has been so successful is the determination she had throughout her ten months on the programme.

"An estranged Florida couple's fight over whether to circumcise their son has become a rallying cry for those who denounce the procedure as barbaric. The dispute between the one-time Palm Beach County couple, who never married, has sparked a prolonged court battle, protests and the rapt attention of a movement of self-proclaimed 'intactivists'. The mother initially agreed to the circumcision, but later decided she opposed it. The father favors the procedure. Florida mom Heather Hironimus, pictured with son Chase, opposes his circumcision - but judges ruled in favor of the father last month, meaning surgery is likely . Judges have ruled in favor of the father, meaning the surgery is likely. Anti-circumcision advocates have made the case their cause celebre and organized a series of protests. Circumcision rates have fallen in the U.S., but a majority of boys still undergo the removal of their foreskin. The couple and their son were named by the Sun-Sentinel as Heather Hironimus, Dennis Nebus and four-year-old  Chase. Neither the boy's mother nor father are Jewish, the paper reported last month. The dad has previously said he believes circumcision is 'just the normal thing to do', according to reports. In December, the boy's mother argued that the process was not medically necessary and risks posing physical and mental damage to her son. The 4th District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach denied her request. Heather Hironimus gave birth to her son Chase with Dennis Nebus in October 2010. In December 2011, she signed a parenting agreement, agreeing to circumcision but over time changed her mind, arguing that her son is now older and more aware of what is happening to him. According to a campaign website, Saving Chase, a pediatric urologist Dr. Charles Flack also testified in court that circumcision was not medically necessary for the child. A statement read: 'Genital autonomy advocates believe Chase's physical and mental health are at risk. He is aware of his body and does not want to have surgery on his genitals. 'Amputating a healthy, functional body part is a violation of basic human rights and medical ethics.' Jennifer Blanchard, 34, of Miami, protests earlier this month in Boynton Beach, Florida, against the circumcision of a four-year-old boy .","The dispute between the Palm Beach County couple has sparked a prolonged court battle .

"The Commons culture, media and sport select committee, chaired by Conservative MP John Whittingdale (above), is to publish its report on the future of the BBC . A parliamentary inquiry is to call for the BBC Trust to be scrapped, calling into question the future of the corporation’s governing body. The Commons culture, media and sport select committee is expected to throw its weight behind calls for the organisation to be abolished. The committee, chaired by Conservative MP John Whittingdale, is to publish its report on the future of the BBC, reportedly to be released within the next few weeks. Its members are thought to be concerned over governance failures at the organisation and are largely in favour of replacing it with a board of directors, headed by a single chairman. It has previously been attacked for its handling of the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal, the pay offs by the BBC to its senior managers and the £100million of the corporation’s digital archive project. In 2009, former BBC director-general Greg Dyke called for it to be scrapped. He branded it: ‘Unduly slow and bureaucratic, expensive to run and created inbuilt conflict.’ The move towards a board of directors, which was the system prior to the Trust, has also been previously floated. Former BBC governor for Wales Sir Roger Jones, said in 2012 that the Trust’s existence was ‘crazy’, and added: ‘The BBC Trust should be scrapped as soon as possible and replaced by the former governance arrangements, in other words, go back to having governors.’ Ahead of publishing its investigation, the committee spent months last year hearing evidence on all aspects of the BBC and its governance, including from its director-general Tony Hall and representatives of the Trust itself. This delegation included Rona Fairhead, who took over as chair in October last year after Lord Patton of Barnes resigned following a heart attack. The results of the inquiry are thought to opt for the board of directors model rather than alternatives, which have included transferring the Trust’s powers to Ofcom, which regulates other broadcasters. In 2009, former BBC director-general Greg Dyke also called for the BBC Trust to be scrapped . It has also been reported that the politicians will back the continuation of the licence fee, although various other models, such as subscriptions have also been discussed in its sessions. The Trust was set up in 2007 as a replacement for the previous board of governors, which was accused of not being tough enough in its approach to BBC regulation . The Trust has also had the same claim levelled against it and has faced harsh criticism from some of those giving evidence to the committee. Speaking in October, culture secretary Sajid Javid said the organisation had questions to answer over its governance and raised concerns over its effectiveness. A BBC Trust spokeswoman said: ‘We aren’t going to speculate about the contents of a future committee report. Governance will be debated at the time of charter review, along with a whole range of other issues and we will want to participate in that discussion. ‘We have been clear both that the BBC’s independence needs to be protected and that there must be strong oversight and regulation of the corporation in the interests of licence fee payers.’ Whittingdale declined to comment about the report and what its conclusions will be.","Committee will publish report on future of BBC in the next few weeks .

"Cameroon's army has freed 24 of the 80 hostages kidnapped during a cross-border attack by bloodthirsty terrorists Boko Haram. The kidnapping took place in the north of Cameroon on . Sunday near the village of Mabass, with scores of children among those abducted. Boko Haram has killed thousands of people and kidnapped hundreds in its bid to carve out an Islamic state in northern Nigeria, with this attack among the worst committed on Cameroonian soil. Scroll down for video . Cameroon's army has freed 24 of the 80 hostages kidnapped by Boko Haram. Pictured: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau claimed responsibility for the high-profile kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls last year . Threat: Earlier this month the militant threatened Cameroon in a YouTube post, warning that the same fate would befall the country as neighbouring Nigeria . 'The Cameroon army was able to free about 24 hostages taken . yesterday by Boko Haram in the far north. They were freed as . defence forces pursued the attackers who were heading back to . Nigeria,' ministry spokesman Colonel Didier Badjeck said. The attack came as neighbouring nation Chad deployed troops to help . Cameroon in its efforts to tackle the Islamist insurgency in the area. Yesterday government spokesman Issa Tchiroma condemned the attack, which killed three people. 'There was a Boko Haram attack on several localities in the Far North region,' he said. 'The assailants burnt down about 80 homes and kidnapped several inhabitants including women and very young children.' In an attack that gained worldwide attention last year, Boko Haram fighters kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, in north-east Nigeria. Destruction: Last week, it was estimated that 2,500 people were killed and more than 3,000 buildings were razed to the ground when Boko Haram attacked the towns of Baga and Doron Baga, northern Nigeria . The fanatics have stepped up attacks in the region as Nigeria prepares for a presidential election in less than a month. In a video posted online earlier this month, a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau threatened increase violence in neighbouring Cameroon unless it scraps its constitution and embraces Islam. Faced with increased violence along the border, Yaounde has deployed thousands of additional troops, including elite soldiers, to the area. Boko Haram outraged the world last week when they indiscriminately murdered innocent men, women and children as they attacked the towns of Baga and Doron Baga. The terrorist group slaughtered an estimated 2,500 people including a woman while she was in labour. Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International, said this was the 'largest and most destructive' Boko Haram assault his organisation has ever analysed. He added: 'These detailed images show devastation of catastrophic proportions in two towns, one of which was almost wiped off the map in the space of four days.' February 2014: The jihadist group raided the Nigerian village of Izghe in the north of the country and murdered dozens - before going door-to-door and killing anyone they came across. April 2014: More than 200 schoolgirls are abducted from the town of Chibok, which Boko Haram burned to the ground. August 2014: The terror group kidnapped at least 97 people during raids on villages in Borno State. They killed 28 boys and men.

"US aviation officials have launched an investigation after a JetBlue passenger jet was forced to abort its take-off when another plane filled with holidaymakers suddenly crossed the runway. After being given clearance to depart, JetBlue flight 1295 was rolling down the tarmac at full speed at New York’s John F Kennedy International Airport when a Caribbean Airlines plane crossed into its path without authorisation, said officials. The JetBlue captain hit the brakes to avoid a collision with the Caribbean Airlines Boeing 737 which had just landed from Cheddi Jagan International Airport in Guyana on Saturday night. JetBlue flight 1295 was rolling down the tarmac at full speed when the pilot was forced to hit the brakes . Jet Blue passenger Brandon Card told WABC-TV: ‘We were headed full steam down the runway and the plane came to a screeching stop.’ Passenger Krista Hollis added: ‘When they said a collision was inevitable if the pilot hadn’t braked, I said “What?”’ JetBlue spokesman Rick Clark said no one was injured. The Caribbean Airlines flight crew were on the wrong frequency when they landed, WABC-TV reported . An FAA spokeswoman said 'the closest proximity of the two aircraft was more than 2,800 feet' The Caribbean Airlines flight crew did not answer air traffic controllers because they were on the wrong frequency and never heard tower instructions to stop, WABC-TV reported. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen toldNewsday that air traffic controllers immediately ordered the JetBlue crew to cancel its take-off and stop.

"The north-south divide between Britain's cities has widened 'dramatically', a new report warns today. For every 12 people who found work since 2004 in cities in southern England, only one was hired in cities in the rest of the country, research by the Centre for Cities found. Employment in London increased by more than 17 per cent between 2004 and 2013 while Blackpool, Rochdale and Gloucester saw falls of 10 per cent, said the report. The number of employees in Milton Keynes, London and Cambridge rose by more than 15% over a decade, but fell in cities like Gloucester, Rochdale and Blackpool . National economic growth in the last decade has been fuelled by a boom in just a handful of cities, most of them in the south of England. Numbers in work in London rose by more than 17 per cent between 2004 and 2013 while Blackpool, Rochdale and Gloucester saw falls of 10 per cent, said the report. There was also a huge difference in populations, growing by 16.5 per cent in Milton Keynes and falling by 1.4 per cent in Sunderland. The number of new businesses varied - up by almost a third in Swindon but down by 5.5 per cent in Grimsby. Andrew Carter, acting chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: 'Five months out from the election, this report makes the strongest economic case yet for the next Government to step up to the challenge of investing in the long-term success of our cities, and build a brighter future in which more people and places can contribute to, and share in, prosperity and growth. 'The stark picture the report paints of the enormous gap in the fortunes of UK cities over 10 years underlines why a 'steady as she goes' approach must be scrapped. 'We must move from thinking that bundling up new funding streams with bureaucratic delays, or simply tinkering around the edges with well-intentioned announcements, will be enough to reverse trends that are becoming increasingly entrenched.' Ed Cox, director of IPPR North, said more powers needed to be devolved to regions to help them create prosperity and ensure smaller places do not fall behind as core cities grow. The number of businesses rose sharply in southern cities like London, Swindon and Bristol between 2004 and 2013, but fell in Blackpool and Grimsby, the report found . Cities Minister Greg Clark, said: 'This Government's long-term economic plan is working right across the country. 'Since 2010 over 60 per cent of the rise in employment has taken place outside London and the South East - that's over a million more people in work. We know there is more to do and that's why we have given greater powers to 27 of the UK's largest cities through City Deals, and why we have committed a further £7 billion to the north of England, alongside the ground-breaking devolution deals and £6 billion of Growth Deals in every part of England.' Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: 'Centre for Cities' 2015 Cities Outlook highlights the huge potential for more balanced growth across Britain by devolving powers and budgets. 'The Tory-led Government came to office promising to rebalance the economy but instead we've seen too many parts of Britain held back and the benefits of growth being concentrated in the hands of the few. 'Under this Government, cities with the greatest needs have been hit hardest. 'The next Labour government will push power away from Whitehall and give city and county regions and local areas the powers they need to boost local growth. 'Under our plans £30bn of budgets would be devolved down and combined authorities would be able to keep more of their revenue from business rates so they can benefit from additional growth.'","12 people found work in the south since 2004 for every one in the north .

"Drivers often feel they need eyes in the back of their heads to see the growing number of bikes weaving their way through the traffic. And cyclists often wonder whether the motorist in the car next to them has even spotted them. Now Jaguar is attempting to address this problem – and the growing toll of deaths and injuries caused by collisions between cars and bikes. Scroll down for video . The company is fitting a groundbreaking Bike Sense safety system into new Jaguars, Land Rovers and Range Rovers within two years. The system produces a range of alerts to tell drivers if a cyclist is getting too close. Using the traditional ‘ring ring’ of the bicycle bell, a warning will sound inside the car from the direction in which the bike is approaching. It will also ‘tap’ the driver on the right or left shoulder using a device that makes the seat cushion inflate and contract. Even the door handles of the car will ‘buzz’ to prevent doors being opened into the path of bikes which are alongside. The accelerator pedal will vibrate if moving the car would cause an accident. The new ‘Bike Sense’ safety system is to be fitted into new Jaguar, Land Rover and Range Rover cars within two years and aims to help reduce the toll of 19,000 cyclists killed or injured on British roads each year . Instant warning: Jaguar Land Rover’s new system uses warning colours (pictured), sounds and even touch to trigger an instinctive response from the driver in a bid to prevent such accidents . The aim of the system, says Jaguar, is to ‘engage drivers’ natural instincts’ to help motorists be more alert to cyclists who may be pedalling too close to danger. It will also help spot motor- cyclists – with a separate motorbike- horn warning. Around 19,000 cyclists are killed or injured on UK roads each year. Motorists can easily risk hitting a cyclist undercutting on the left. Even minor accidents can lead to disputes, confrontation, personal injury claims and counter-claims. Many cyclists now wear helmet-mounted cameras and film their journeys to use as evidence in the event of a collision – and some motorists are fitting cameras to their windscreens. Regardless of who is at fault, it is usually the cyclist who comes off worst in any encounter with a car. And no driver wants a seriously or fatally injured cyclist on their conscience. A Jaguar Land Rover spokesman said: ‘Sensors on the car will detect when another road user is approaching and identify it as bicycle or motorbike. 'It will then make the driver aware of the potential hazard before the driver sees it.’ Intuitive: Even the accelerator pedal will vibrate if moving the car would cause an accident . The system will make the driver aware of the potential hazard before the driver sees it. But instead of using a generic warning symbol or sound, which takes time for the driver’s brain to process, the system uses lights and sounds that the driver instinctively associates with bicycles . The Jaguar spokesman said: ‘To help the driver understand where the bike is in relation to their car, the audio system will make it sound as if a bicycle bell or motorbike horn is coming through the speaker nearest the bike, so the driver immediately understands from which the direction the cyclist is coming’ But instead of using a generic warning symbol or sound, which takes time for the driver’s brain to process, the system uses lights and sounds that the driver instinctively associates with bicycles. The spokesman explained the expanding and contracting seat: ‘If a bicycle or motorbike is coming up the road behind the car, Bike Sense will detect if it is overtaking or coming past the vehicle on the inside. ‘The top of the car seat will then extend to “tap” the driver on the left or right shoulder. The idea is that the driver will then instinctively look over that shoulder to identify the potential hazard.’ British Cycling’s campaign manager Martin Key said: ‘We would support any move by manufacturers to improve cyclists’ safety.’ Official statistics show that in the 12 months to June, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured rose 10 per cent. Silly or sensible? The new hat comes with a plate . Cycling helmets are becoming increasingly sophisticated, but one conceptual design, which is packed with technology, includes a  controversial extra – a licence plate. The ‘Smart Hat’ is designed for ‘responsible cyclists’ and could include a visor showing safety information and a map, if it ever enters production. It also features a licence plate on the rear of the futuristic design, in a bid to make identifying cyclists easier. The concept, by Sydney-based designer Tony King, has aggravated some cyclists who think that Smart Hat is a silly idea. This is because the website claims: ‘Apart from safety considerations, an ID system would allow cyclists to share responsibility when interacting with vehicles and pedestrians.’ While it may not be popular with all cyclists, the idea has apparently got the green light from a local city council, which is keen on licensing cyclists, Daily Telegraph Australia reported.","The new ‘Bike Sense’ safety system is to be fitted into new Jaguar, Land Rover and Range Rover cars within two years and aims to help reduce the toll of 19,000 cyclists killed or injured on British roads each year .

"Looking after a six-year-old can be exhausting, even for those in the prime of their life. So spare a thought 76-year-old for Omkari Singh - the world's oldest mother - and her schoolboy son Akashvani. In 2008, Mrs Singh, from Uttar Pradesh, northern India, made headlines around the world after giving birth to twins Akashvani and Barsaat at the age of 70. Scroll down for video . The world's oldest mother Omkari Singh, 76, says she finds it hard to keep up with her six-year-old son at times, but that she could not be more happy . Mrs Singh and her husband Charan, 89, made headlines in 2008 after their twins Akashvani and Barsaat - who has sadly died - were born . Elderly Mrs Singh says she is often mistaken for being her son's grandmother because of the 70-year age gap . The female twin Barsaat tragically died at the age of four, but her son is perfectly healthy. Despite receiving a barrage of criticism both online and from her local community for having children so late in life, Mrs Singh, who is married to Charan, 89, says she could not be more happy. She said: 'Many people ask me, ""Is he your grandson?"" I tell them ""No. He is my son"". 'I am very happy that I am a mother of a six-year-old son. It is an unexplainable feeling.' Like any six-year-old, Akashvani is playful and full of life, with his elderly mother occasionally struggling to keep up - especially when it comes to getting her son ready for school. She said: 'I am not able to bath him properly. I have problems getting him dressed. It is hard to run around and feed him. Old age is like this.' Six-year-old Akashvani is a handful like any other young, energetic boy, with Mrs Singh struggling to keep up at times . Mrs Singh came under fire for having a child at such a late age but says she wanted to make sure she had a son to take over her house after she dies . The mother (centre) hopes to be alive when her son gets married, but says she is not worried about death as her daughter Kamla, 50, will care for Akashvani if she dies . Veermati, another mother who lives in her village, said: 'It is good Omkari gave birth to a child at this age. 'According to me they took a correct decision. They have love among each other so it is good.' Already parents to two daughters and grandparents to five, the couple were desperate to have a boy - eventually succeeding when their eldest daughter Kamla was 50 years old. To pay for the IVF treatment vital to producing a male heir to the family's smallholdings, the Panwars sold their buffalos, mortgaged their land, spent their life savings and took out a credit card loan. Mrs Singh said: 'I thought if I will give birth to a boy, I will become like other mothers. Without a son, there was no life for me. Because, who would own this house if I had no sons?' While she adores her son, the 76-year-old knows that age is not on her side - but hopes to live long enough to see Amritwani getting married. She said: 'I am not worried. After my death my daughter will take care of my son. 'I wish my son gets married very quickly and we both can be present at his wedding.' Until that time comes, the Singhs plan to make the most of their time with their son.","Omkari Singh gave birth to her son Akashvani at the grand age of 70 .

"Millions of British Gas customers will receive a 5 per cent price cut, worth £37 a year, as energy giants finally start to pass on falling wholesale costs. The news will come as a fresh blow to Ed Miliband, who until recently advocated a 20-month price freeze. Last night industry experts warned that the Labour policy had made firms delay price reductions for fear of being locked into bad deals. New deal: British Gas announced today it will reduce household gas prices by five per cent, cutting annual energy bills on average by £37 . The gas price cut for some 6.8million homes on the Fix & Fall variable rate tariff will start on February 28. It follows E.on’s 4 per cent reduction last week. However, British Gas electricity prices will not change, and the saving is still tiny in the context of dramatic falls in wholesale energy prices over the past year. The cost of gas has dropped 28 per cent, and that of electricity 15 per cent. Analysts say if firms passed on the full benefit to consumers, the average bill would be £140 a year cheaper. As recently as 2007, providers reduced bills by 17 per cent, dwarfing the current cuts. The fall in wholesale costs has forced Labour to re-brand its price freeze as a ‘cap’, with Mr Miliband now saying he would give industry regulator Ofgem the power to force a reduction in tariffs if he won a General Election. But British Gas yesterday warned that a Labour government bent on price controls would pose a ‘risk’ to the firm. Asked if the prospect was a factor in its price-setting, British Gas finance director Michael Uzielli said: ‘We’re conscious of it as well as all of the other risks that we face in the market.’ Martin Lewis, of consumer finance website MoneySavingExpert.com, said the threat of a price freeze had led energy firms to limit cuts. Falling: Wholesale gas prices have tumbled since the end of 2013 - but the costs have not been passed on. Units are measure in pence per therm - equal to about 96.7 cubic feet of natural gas . Soaring: Fuel prices have been rising sharply in recent years, as this House of Commons graph shows . He said: ‘We are seeing smaller cuts than we would have done otherwise. ‘Nice idea, but by pre-announcing it, they have ruined it. By going for electoral gain, by saying “We are doing this aren’t we wonderful, we’re going to freeze your prices”, what they have done is self-defeated their own policy.’ David Cameron seized on the British Gas announcement, telling ITV News: ‘We should be absolutely clear that this price cut would not be happening if we’d listened to Labour and put in place their 20-month price freeze.’ But experts said a 5 per cent cut was too little, too late. Ofgem is so concerned about the failure to pass savings on to customers that it has referred the energy industry to a full inquiry by the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA), which could take a year to complete. Gillian Guy, of Citizens Advice, said: ‘The savings being offered remain disappointingly low, but if E.on and British Gas can cut prices other firms must now do the same. Energy bills have risen by a third since 2010, yet wholesale costs are at a four-year low.’ Mr Miliband defended Labour’s revamped ‘price cap’, saying: ‘A 5 per cent fall . . . is not nearly good enough. If the Conservatives want a competition about who can properly stand up to energy companies, I say bring it on.’ Iain Conn, the head of British Gas’s parent company Centrica, claimed it made cuts as early as possible in a ‘volatile’ market. British Gas said the cut was worth £37 a year on average. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk .","Britain's biggest energy supplier says change will come in on February 27 .

Among the first lady's guests are Alan Gross, the American aid worker recently released from a Cuban prison after a five-year detention, and his wife, Judy; Nicole Hernandez Hammer, a Guatemalan immigrant who raises awareness within the Latino community about climate change, and astronaut Scott Kelly, the brother-in-law of former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords, the victim of a 2011 shooting, is married to Kelly's twin brother, Mark. She resigned three years ago in January, a day after being recognized at Obama's 2012 State of the Union. Anthony Mendez, a freshman in college and beneficiary of FLOTUS' Reach Higher Initiative who spent part of his formative years in a homeless shelter after his family was evicted from their home, and 13-year-old Malik Bryant, the Chicago teen who wrote Santa a letter asking for 'safety' and received a response from the president, will also join Mrs. Obama on Tuesday night, the White House revealed on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . First Lady Michelle Obama, center, is pictured with her guests at the U.S. Capitol before President Barack Obama's State of the Union address last year before a joint session of Congress. The first lady typically uses her invites to highlight beneficiaries of her husband's policies, and this year will be no exception . U.S. contractor Alan Gross takes a selfie with his wife, Judy Gross, on board a government plane headed back to the U.S. on December 17 after being released in a prisoner exchange. Alan Gross was held in Cuba for five years as a political prisoner until Barack Obama negotiated his release last month as part of a deal to normalize relations with Cuba. The Grosses will sit in FLOTUS' box tomorrow night at the SOTU . This 2013 photo shows retired astronaut Mark Kelly, left, former Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, astronaut Scott Kelly and Amiko Kauderer, right, at an event in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Kelly twins, both astronauts, are the subject of scientific research related to space exploration. Scott Kelly will be a guest of Michelle Obama tomorrow night, as well . The first lady's guest list offers an early look at themes President Barack Obama will hit on in tomorrow evening's speech before a joint session of Congress. Obama is expected to defend his decision to normalize relations with Cuba, a move that's been met with criticism by a of a bipartisan group of lawmakers that include Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants whose state, Florida, boasts the highest number of Cuban Americans. Embargoes on the Communist country haven't worked, Obama contends, and should be rescinded. He'll also brag about the economic recovery in the United States, highlighting the receding unemployment rate and resurgence of the manufacturing industry as proof positive that his administration's policies have been a success, and promote a multinational agreement with China to reduce CO2 emissions by a target rate of 28 percent by 2025. The tone of Obama's sixth State of the Union is anticipated to be more upbeat than his past addresses and serve as an inspiration to Americans to live up to their fullest potential while reminding them how far the nation has come since he took office. The president will use Kelly's presence at the speech to promote scientific research that will help 'support the next generation of space exploration and President Obama’s goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s,' the White House told Politico. Kelly will soon participate in a yearlong mission aboard International Space Station. He and his twin brother, a retired astronaut, are the subject of a research initiative that will compare data from the two men's bodies while in space. Malik Bryant, Letter Writer .

White House letter writer Carolyn Reed, a Colorado native, will serve as a visual reminder of what small business owners have been able to achieve during Obama's administration with help of the government. 'Thanks to a loan from the Small Business Administration,' Obama said in his weekly address, Reed and her husband were able to expand their businesses and raise wages for their employees. Victor Fugate, another letter writer, whom Obama recognized in a Kansas City, Missouri, speech last year, represents the success of Obamacare. 'Because of the Affordable Care Act, [Victor and his wife] now have the security and peace of mind of affordable health insurance,' Obama claimed in his Saturday morning address. The president will also give immigration reform a shout out, as well as his executive actions to protect illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, also known as DREAMers, from being deported, as well as their parents. Letter writer Ana Zamora, a senior at Northwood University in Texas, will sit in the first lady's box and serve as Obama's token Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program success story. Obama has revealed in sneak peaks of his address that he will also needle Congress to pass laws his administration believes will further lift up the middle class. Obama will formally ask the Republican-controlled legislative body to require businesses to give all their workers a week of paid sick days and at least six weeks of paid leave for new parents. In a nod to paid sick leave, Maryland Senate Majority Leader Catherine Pugh, author of a bill in her state to provide employees with seven days of paid absence, will also sit with Mrs. Obama. Also sitting in FLOTUS' box tomorrow night are Nicole Hernandez Hammer, a Guatemalan immigrant who raises awareness within the Latino community about climate change, and Ana Zamora, a senior at Northwood University in Texas. Zamora will serve as Obama's token Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program success story . Anthony Mendez, a freshman in college, is the beneficiary of FLOTUS' Reach Higher Initiative. Mendez, center right, spent part of his formative years in a homeless shelter after his family was evicted from their home. He is the first person in his family to graduate from high school . He'll also ask for billions of dollars from Congress to make community college free to most graduating high school seniors. The White House announced over the weekend that Obama is again seeking to levy an eight percent capitol gains tax increase on the wealthy couples. He also wants to close a loophole on capital gains that stops inherited funds from being taxed. Republicans have already shot down every initiative the president has revealed so far. A top House member called Obama's tax plan a 'non-starter' on Sunday. 'We’re not just one good tax increase away from prosperity in this nation,' House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz said on CNN’s State of the Union. The president has already set to work on some new measures from his State of the Union address that he's previewed this month that he's able to enforce without the compliance of Congress. He announced the first week in January that his administration would reduce mortgage premiums for first-time home buyers who obtain loans through the Federal Housing Administration to make ownership more feasible for average Americans. And in a memorandum last week, Obama directed the federal government to immediately put a six-week paid family leave policy into effect for its employees. Members of Congress often use their guests to make political statements, as well, and today Rubio announced that he would bring Rosa María Payá, the daughter of a late Cuban activist, as his guest tomorrow night. 'All Oswaldo Payá wanted was a better future for Cuba and the Cuban people, and the Castro regime assassinated him for it,' Rubio said in a statement today. 'Since her father’s murder, Rosa María has honored his legacy by continuing to advocate for a free and democratic Cuba and also fighting to bring his murderers to justice. The Florida Republican and possible 2016 presidential candidate said Obama's Cuba policy that gives the Castro regime' legitimacy and greater access to American dollars' will only be used to fund the foreign government's 'machine of repression – the very machine that harassed Oswaldo Payá for years, eventually murdered him and pays hush money to potential key witnesses.'","The First Lady will fill nearly two dozen of the seats in her box with individuals representing key initiatives being promoted by her husband .

"Taxpayer deal: The company behind new stealth cameras being installed on Britain's busiest roads is being paid £2.1million by the Government . The business behind new 'stealth' speed cameras being installed across Britain is being paid £2.1million by the taxpayer to help catch more drivers, it was revealed today. The controversial devices have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months and unlike traditional yellow speed cameras, they  are painted grey, making them harder to spot. The technology has been introduced to catch drivers breaking the 70mph speed limit on the M25 in Kent. And the same technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6. Today it emerged that Redflex Travel  Systems Ltd agreed a £2.1million deal with the Government  to set up the system. The Highways Agency confirmed to MailOnline they pay £150,000 per site to install the equipment and· £25,000 per site per year to maintain the equipment. The company's UK boss Ronald Moore last night refused to comment on whether the cameras are unfair on motorists. But he did tell The Sun: 'I work for the company who do the technology for the cameras. I have no comment'. The cameras, called the Hadecs3, enforce variable speed limits on motorways when they are congested. But when the speed limit at 70mph they are not switched off, instead they then catch people breaking the limit. Front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle’s speed. And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four. Motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit. Uproar: The cameras, pictured on the M25, were believed to be just enforcing variable speed limits but they are actually doing the 70mph limit too . The grey cameras are being installed across Britain's busiest motorways can  track dozens cars across four lanes in the heaviest of traffic. Conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey. Attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle's speed. The same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database. They enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed. The Association of Chief Police Officers recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone. Hugh Bladon, one of the founder members of the Alliance of British Drivers, said they did not believe targeting drivers on the motorways was the best way to improve safety and that punishing drivers for exceeding the 70mph limit was often unnecessary. 'The 70mph limit is not a speed that a lot of people bother to observe any more,' he said. 'It was originally brought in as an experiment and was made permanent without any real testing. It was brought in at a time when the stopping power of cars was a bit like stopping an oil tanker, and the maximum speed of most cars was 74mph. We've moved on now, some 50 years later we have cars that stop much more quickly. 'The amount of traffic that exceeds the 70mph limit is enormous. Most people are driving at 80mph on motorways, and these are our safest roads in the country.' Mr Bladon said he did not think using speed cameras on the M25 was appropriate because there are many times, particularly late at night or when there is little traffic, when it is safe to driver faster than 70mph. He also said these should be made more visible, rather than disguised to try and catch drivers out. In 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009. Ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were  in operation for 24 hours a day. In total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £100 that year. It was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £2,500 to £10,000. In 2012-13 the Government collected £284million in speeding fines. Where the new cameras will be placed: Several stretches of road are being upgraded to become 'smart motorways', with new speed cameras a part of improvements. Above, a map detailing which will be affected . Rupert Lipton, managing director of the National Motorists Action Group, said he was 'shocked' officials had decided to use this type of speeding enforcement. He said: 'This is a another missed opportunity. The Highways Agency is introducing so called ""smart motorways"" but relying on dumb enforcement. It is policing by numbers, by remote control'. Studies have shown that nine out of ten drivers admit to breaking the motorway speed limit. The Government had planned to raise the limit to 80mph before the proposals were shelved by transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin two years ago. Brake, the road safety group, has previously said that raising the speed limit would cause more accidents and deaths on motorways. The first cameras were installed between junctions five and six of the M25. Kent police figures showed that 668 speeding offences were logged in just over two months. Until now, cameras have mainly been used to keep drivers below 50mph in sections of the network undergoing roadworks. In the two months since they have been installed on the M25, pictured, almost 700 drivers have been caught breaking the 70mph limit . The Highways Agency said signs warning about speed cameras should be displayed on every gantry of the motorway where they are used. A spokesman said: 'Variable speed limits on smart motorways are primarily there to smooth traffic flow, reduce congestion and make journeys more reliable. 'Hundreds of thousands of motorists use this stretch of the M25 every day. The vast majority are sticking to the speed limits and are experiencing better journeys as a result of smart motorways. 'There are clear signs where cameras are in place and the new cameras are more visible than the previous versions.'","A new generation of speed cameras being introduced on the M25 in Kent .

"Is it a car? Is it a plane? No it's a 'future cycle'. Michigan-based design team Rachael and Cameron Van Dyke have created futuristic bikes that don't require a scrap of Lycra. That's because in the Zeppelin, riders can relax and let the electric motor do some of the work. While comfortably sat on mahogany and leather seats, protected from the elements,  the Cyclone appears to be closer to a car than a bicycle. But you won't find any horse power under its bonnet  which is pedal power only. From the outside they appear to be mini cars, but underneath reveals there is no big engine, just a small electric motor and two sets of pedals . Design team The Future People - married couple Rachael and Cameron Van Dyke - also created the beetle-like Zeppelin (pictured) Both are part of The Future Cycle project- blurring the lines between bicycles and cars. 'We wanted to see just how far we could push the legal definition of bicycle to provide a car-like experience with very low energy input,' says designer Cameron Van Dyke of The Future People. Their project 'Future Cycles', unveiled at this month's Detroit Auto Show, consists of human-powered vehicles that blur the lines between bicycles and cars - creating a hybrid alternative. The first was the three-wheeled Zeppelin-  is a hybrid powered by two riders in combination with a 750w electric rear motor. Made from polycarbonate and aluminium it weighs just 270lbs and is able to achieve a cruising speed of 25mph on flat ground, but is still considered a 'bicycle'. The Cyclone . (pictured), created by a design team in Ann Arbor, Michigan, blurs the line between cars and bicyles . Both vehicles are part of the 'Future Cycles' project which is being unveiled at this month's Detroit Auto Show . The second has been created as a luxury vehicle. The Cyclone is four-seated human-powered vehicle, able to carry cargo. Like the Zeppelin it combines boat building techniques with the latest bike technology, but it also aims to create a luxury feel with an interior of fine leather, mahogany and brushed aluminium. The team, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, are hoping the concept vehicles will begin a discussion about American car culture. The Zepplin is powered by two riders in combination with a 750w electric rear motor and achieves a cruising speed of 25 mph on flat ground, yet is still completely, legally considered a 'bicycle'.

"Olive oil is the key to a new 'fertility diet' being tested in a study involving more than 100 couples undergoing IVF. The test diet is based on using olive oil for cooking, an olive oil-based spread and a daily supplement drink enriched with Vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids for six weeks as an addition to their normal diet. The effects on fertility will be compared to couples on a control diet of sunflower seed oil for cooking, a sunflower oil-based spread and a sham supplement drink. Previous research suggests omega-3 polyunsaturated fats in olive oil may help faster embryo development . The team carrying out the trial at the University of Southampton say the diet could increase pregnancy rates by up to 40 per cent, based on previous research that found increased intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fats contained in olive oil led to faster embryo development after IVF. Nicotine watch calls time on smoking . A trial found it did reduce cravings . A watch that releases nicotine when smokers' cravings are worst could help them quit. Existing aids, such as patches, release nicotine at a constant rate. However, smoker's cravings can be more powerful in the morning because of the long gap of abstinence imposed by sleep, and after meals - possibly because eating prompts, in the brain, the desire to be rewarded. The SmartStop is worn either as a watch, armband or patch, and contains a small cartridge of nicotine. It can be programmed to your schedule and releases more nicotine for when it calculates cravings will be strongest. A trial with 36 people at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, found it did reduce cravings and more research is planned. Mistletoe to stop epilepsy seizures . Mistletoe should be tested as a treatment for epilepsy, say Swiss doctors. Researchers at Fribourg Hospital, Switzerland, have reported the case of a four‑year-old girl who became seizure-free after being given mistletoe extract. She had previously been treated with different anti-epileptic drugs, diet changes and herbal and homeopathic supplements, but still suffered seizures. These stopped when her dose of a mistletoe supplement was increased, and she remained free of them 12 months later. The researchers, in the Journal of Child Neurology, suggested this may be due to mistletoe's stimulating effect on the immune system - one theory is that epilepsy seizures are caused by a malfunctioning immune response - and called for further studies.","More than 100 couples undergoing IVF will try an olive oil diet .

"Model and businesswoman Miranda Kerr is kicking off 2015 as she means to go on: by building her brand even bigger. The supermodel, who last year clocked in deals with Reebok, H&M and Swarovski, is already busy planning her latest range for Royal Albert, which will include silverware, glassware and gifts. FEMAIL caught up with the Australian star to discover the inspiration behind her range, how she balances her hectic work schedule and all of her beauty and wellbeing secrets. Scroll down for video . Miranda Kerr has launched her debut tea collection for Royal Albert, and is busy planning her upcoming range of silverware, glassware and gifts . Sharing the inspiration behind her new range, which costs £25 for a cup and saucer, and £50 for a cake stand, the star said: 'I spent a lot of time with my grandma growing up and she had a Royal Albert tea collection that I was mesmerised by... it was really treasured by all our family. 'So, when Royal Albert approached me to design a collection I thought it was a wonderful opportunity.' Miranda, who has penned two 'positive thinking' books, explains that she wanted to create a timeless collection that was inspired by her 'love of peonies and the gracefulness of butterflies'. 'Butterflies are very symbolic for me as they embody the changes that we all need to go through in life, and are also a symbol of faith and joy,' she said. 'I like the fact the range is delicate and feminine, this is something I definitely wanted to capture across the range.' Miranda explains that she wanted to create a timeless collection that was inspired by her 'love of peonies and the gracefulness of butterflies' and she's delighted with the outcome of the feminine collection . Miranda follows a balanced diet, but treats herself to chia seed muffins when she wants to indulge and complements her diet with a serious fitness regime . The 31-year-old, who has a son, Flynn, with ex-husband Orlando Bloom, explains that tea is extremely important to her because it's her 'me time'. 'It’s an opportunity to take some time out, talk about how your day’s been, it’s time to regroup and re-energise. It’s a feel good time - that’s what I like,' she said. Aside from tea, the virtuous star, who cites her New Year's resolution as 'continuing to work on balance in all areas of her life', has long promoted a healthy diet and superfoods. Miranda, who is a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she leads, shared one of her favourite healthy recipes. 'I enjoy so many superfoods such as noni juice, which is one of the key ingredients in my skincare line Kora Organics,' she said. 'I also make my own superfood smoothie with maca powder, acai powder, spirulina, cacao powder, coconut oil and chia seeds, which is alkalizing and nutrient dense. 'Avocado is also great for skin health and I probably have half an avocado a day.' Despite following a healthy diet, the svelte star and former Victoria's Secret model admits that she allows herself to 'indulge' and 'doesn't deprive herself'. 'I live by the philosophy of 80/20…meaning I eat healthily 80 per cent of the time and indulge 20 per cent of the time. For an everyday treat, I cook gluten-free muffins with blueberries and chia seeds.' She complements her balanced diet with a serious fitness regime, saying she likes to  keep active and do some form of exercise every day. 'It’s a combination of either yoga, pilates, resistance training or something with my son such as hiking or riding our bikes. I also like jumping on the little mini trampolines too; it’s a really good way to stimulate the lymphatic system and it lifts your mood,' she said. The virtuous star cites her New Year's resolution as 'continuing to work on balance in all areas of her life' When she isn't modelling, designing tea cups or spending time with her son, Miranda works on the project she's most passionate about: her organic skincare line. The flawless star set up KORA Organics  after failing to find products that she wanted to use on her skin anywhere in the world. The products, which use all organic ingredients, including superfoods, represent her healthy and balanced lifestyle, she said. 'We’re working on some new exciting products and also some formulation enhancements. I can tell you more in the coming months as soon as release dates are finalised,' she revealed. Obviously, Miranda swears by her range and her cosmetics bag is packed with her own lip balm, hand cream and mist. Mascara, eyelash curlers, RMS concealer, RMS Lip2Cheek in red, tweezers, a nail file, and a little magnifying mirror also make up her beauty essentials. Miranda's tea cup range, inspired by her grandmother, features ornate flower and butterfly illustrations . 'If I’m travelling I like to have my Kora Organics Luxurious Rosehip Oil packed too. I remove my make-up and apply the rosehip oil, it really revitalises, hydrates, brightens and protects the skin it because it’s packed with antioxidants,' she said of her must-have. Miranda, who covered the February issue of Harper's Bazaar, ensures she finds time to relax in between her hectic schedule and has previously explained that she books chunks of time off to unwind. So how does the world's busiest woman relax? 'Having a laugh with friends and family is really important,' she said. 'Other simple things like reading a book to my son really help me relax. Or enjoying the sunset, being in nature, taking my shoes off and putting my feet in the grass, having a fresh bouquet of flowers, having a cup of tea, lighting a candle, having a bath, these things make me feel really happy.'

"Vivienne Westwood has paid tribute to Prince Charles and 'the great job he is doing' by featuring him in her latest menswear collection. The world-renowned fashion designer has given a nod to the royal in her AW15 collection by printing the Prince of Wales' face on several pieces of clothing. Guests at the designer's show in Milan yesterday, which came as part of the Italian city's Menswear Fashion Week, were first to witness the unveiling of several items paying homage to the royal. Scroll down for video . Vivienne Westwood has paid tribute to Prince Charles and ‘the great job he is doing’ by featuring him in her AW15 menswear collection. Pictured: Westwood walking down the catwalk with husband Andreas Kronthaler . The outspoken fashion designer, 73, (left) is said to count the Prince of Wales (right) among her close friends . An image of Prince Charles, wearing an Army beret, featured heavily in the show – and British-born Westwood told guests she had 'adopted Prince Charles as patron of the collection'. Describing the royal as an 'eco warrior', the 73-year-old said: 'I want to pay tribute to Prince Charles and the great job he's doing. 'If Prince Charles had ruled the world according to his priorities during the last 30 years, we would be all right and we would be tackling climate change.' She also described how the Prince of Wales has helped raise awareness of organic farming and climate change over the years. The ardent environmental campaigner even wore an oversized T-shirt bearing an image of the prince's face as she walked down the catwalk with her husband Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior. As well as featuring the prince's image in her collection, Westwood also gave a nod to his sense of style by featuring tailored suits, tweed and belted houndstooth checked coats in her collection. It wasn't just Prince Charles who got a mention though, the Queen also featured, with sterling notes featuring the monarch's face printed on handbags and accessories. Westwood's relationship with the royals goes back decades, and she famously wore silver horns and no underwear to Buckingham Palace when she collected her OBE in 1996. The designer told guests at the winter show that she 'had 'adopted Prince Charles as patron of the collection'. The 73-year-old received a bunch of flowers following the unveiling of her latest menswear collection (above) The collection gave a nod to Prince Charles by featuring an image of his face on several items of clothing (right). Other references to the royal were less subtle but the designer took inspiration from his tailored suits . Tweed and houndstooth prints featured heavily in the new collection, which was unveiled in Milan, Italy . The outspoken designer, who was born Vivienne Swire in rural Derbyshire in 1941, has carved out a remarkable career after building up her clothing emporium and brand name. Her zest for life and for ideas has moved her more and more into political activism, and she is now on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a Greenpeace spokesperson. She donates nearly all her money to saving the rainforests and the Arctic circle, living simply with husband Andreas, whom she met when she was teaching fashion. Her eclectic group of friends, activists and confrères range from Pamela Anderson to Prince Charles, Shami Chakrabati, Naomi Campbell, Jerry Hall, Bob Geldof and Julian Assange.

"He already has plans to bring the internet to remote parts of the world, and now SpaceX founder Elon Musk has set his sights on bringing it to space too. The entrepreneur says he wants to build a second internet in space, which could one day be used to enable any people living in colonies on Mars to get online. There is currently no name for the ambitious space venture, but it could speed up internet services on Earth too. Elon Musk, (pictured) says he wants to build a second internet in space, which could one day be used to enable people living on Mars to get online . Mr Musk told Bloomberg Businessweek’s Ashlee Vance, that his aim is to create ‘a global communications system that would be larger than anything that has been talked about to date.’ Earlier this month, he said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on Mars, later this year. He said: ‘It will be important for Mars to have a global communications network as well. I think this needs to be done, and I don’t see anyone else doing it.’ Mr Musk's project would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles (1,207km) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles (35,406 km). A stock image is shown . Google: The internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. Google is tipped to spend $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. Facebook: Mark Zuckerburg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. Small satellite manufacturers: Sierra Nevada and Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record. The project could cost $10 billion (£7 billion) and $15 billion (£10 billion), Mr Musk revealed in a Tweet, adding that any revenues would be used to fund a colony on the red planet. It would involve hundreds of satellites orbiting about 750 miles (1,207km) above the planet – far closer than communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit at 22,000 miles (35,406 km). At the moment, internet data packets travelling from London to New York, for example, have to pass through numerous routers and different networks, whereas Mr Musk plans to route packs via space satellites instead. This would make services faster and potentially cheaper too. The project will be run from SpaceX’s Seattle office, whose employees will also work on the firm’s Falcon rockets, for example. The ultimate goal is provide high-speed internet to the three billion people who have poor or no access to the web. It’s thought it will take at least five years to produce and launch the first generation of satellites and the project could take over 15 years to work how Mr Musk envisions, The Huffington Post reported. The race is on to connect remote parts of the world, with both Google and Facebook also investing in technologies such as balloons and drones. Earlier this month, Mr Musk said that he aims to share plans to build a colony on Mars, later this year. An image of MarsOne's proposed colony on the red planet is pictured.

"MPS faced a backlash over the so-called zombie Parliament last night – after knocking off from work five hours early. In a stark illustration of the lack of Parliamentary business during the Coalition’s dying days, they packed up after barely three hours of debate. It meant that the MPs – who only started work at 2.30pm yesterday – were finished for the day at 5.40pm, hours ahead of the scheduled finish time of 10.30pm. Scroll down for video . In a stark illustration of the lack of Parliamentary business during the Coalition’s dying days, they packed up after barely three hours of debate . Commons doorkeepers, who are paid to guard the chamber, were heard to mutter sarcastically: ‘Well, that was a long day’ as the small band of MPs who had turned up trooped out early. The incident has been branded an insult to voters, who are billed the same for MPs’ pay and lavish expenses regardless of how little work they do. And even fewer MPs are expected to turn up for the rest of the week because there is no Government business scheduled. Instead, they are expected to focus on electioneering to save their jobs. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg spent much of yesterday promoting campaign issues. Andy Silvester, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said the situation ‘makes a mockery’ of rules introduced by the Coalition that mean an election cannot be held until May, if MPs spend months ‘kicking their heels around Westminster’. Prime Minister David Cameron was in Ipswich, Suffolk, today campaigning ahead of the general election . Labour leader Ed Miliband was at a question and answer session in Mill Hill, North West London instead of the Commons . He added: ‘Too often we’ve seen new laws railroaded through Parliament – not least the HS2 Bill – without proper scrutiny because of an alleged lack of Parliamentary time, and these short days rub salt in the wound. This increasingly feels like a zombie Parliament seeing out its obligations, and taxpayers deserve better.’ Last week the Prime Minister rejected allegations that he was presiding over a zombie Parliament, saying that legislation being worked on includes new anti-terror laws. But the only Government business tabled for this week was last night’s piece of legislation to allow women bishops to be fast-tracked into the House of Lords. Debate on the uncontroversial measure finished hours early, allowing MPs to go home. The rest of the week is dominated by Opposition debates led by the SNP and Labour, and a backbench debate on the governance of the Commons. Last night shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Ashworth said: ‘I’m afraid what happened today just illustrates what we have been saying for some time – we have a zombie Government that has run out of steam.’ Ukip MP Mark Reckless said the main parties appeared to have cut a deal that would allow their MPs to head back to their constituencies to campaign while still on the public payroll. He added: ‘Today we sat for three hours, and there were not many of us in for that. The focus is on saving their seats rather than serving the country.’","Prayers began in the chamber at 2.30pm but the debate ended at 5.39pm .

"A mother-of-two suffering constant pain from her huge KK bust has finally had reduction surgery, after being denied the procedure on the NHS five times. Kim Mills, from Chelmsford in Essex, has dropped 11 bra sizes following the procedure, carried out free of charge at a private hospital. The 32-year-old's large breasts caused her to suffer spinal arthritis, such was the pressure being exerted on her back. But on five occasions the NHS refused to give Ms Mills the surgery she so desperately longed for. A surgeon who heard of her plight offered to do the operation free of charge at a private clinic. 'I've got my life back,' she said. 'Finally without my huge boobs in the way, I can be the mum I always wanted to be. Kim Mills, 32, from Chelmsford, Essex has finally had her KK bust (left) reduced to a DD cup (right) after she was denied reduction surgery on the NHS five times . The mother-of-two was offered the procedure free of charge by a private clinic after they became aware of Ms Mills' case. She said the operation, which took place in September, has changed her life . 'I can't wait to do all the things I haven't been able to - I'll be able to pick my daughter up properly and run around without being worried about what my boobs might do.' Since the age of 14, when Ms Mills developed a large chest, she suffered painful back ache. After having her children, she struggled to reach over her chest to tie her daughters' shoe laces or brush their hair. And plagued by embarrassment at having such a big bust, she hadn't been in a relationship for three years. After years in pain the breaking point came just over a year ago, when a friend asked Ms Mills to be her bridesmaid. Despite being a size 14 on her bottom half, she had to search for a size 20 dress to ensure there was enough material to cover her top half. Unable to find an off-the-rail gown to fit Ms Mills' chest, the bride had to change the style ideas for her big day, and buy a mis-matching outfit. Ms Mills approached doctors to find out if she was eligible for breast reduction surgery. They told her she would need to lose weight before she could be considered. The mother-of-two promptly embarked on a strict diet, losing five stone. But her breast size didn't change, prompting the NHS to tell her there was nothing they could do. Ms Mills eventually made five unsuccessful applications to her local clinical commissioning group, for funded surgery. Ms Mills' huge chest caused her to suffer spinal arthritis, and pain for many years. She reached breaking point when a friend asked her to be bridesmaid. But when dress shopping they couldn't find a gown to fit Ms Mills' size 14 bottom half and size 20 top . She approached doctors to ask whether she was eligible for a breast reduction and was told she would have to lose weight first. She shed five stone but her breast size didn't change . In May 2014 she was diagnosed with arthritis of the spine, and told if she did nothing to stop the onset of the condition she would develop a hunch and eventually be crippled. Ms Mills found herself caught in a catch 22 - the only way to halt her arthritis was to exercise, something her doctor had declared her medically unfit to do. Then in September her prayers were answered. Cosmetic surgery firm Aurora stepped in and offered to complete the £7,000 surgery free of charge as part of their charitable giving commitment. A month later Ms Mills was admitted to the private Baddow Hospital in Chelmsford, where surgeon Garrick Georgeu removed 8lbs of gland tissue. The procedure saw Ms Mills' breasts drop from a size KK to a comfortable DD cup. 'My boobs have been big since I was in my early teens,' she said. 'Nothing I could do would change them - being pregnant, breastfeeding, losing or putting on weight - they just stayed at their whopping KK measurement. Ms Mills said her previously huge chest prevented her being the mother she wanted to be . 'I would have starved myself if it meant slimming my boobs down to but even after I lost loads of weight they didn't change. 'People never looked my face first - all they saw was my boobs. 'And I gradually started suffering from horrific back pain. Some days it would be so bad I felt like I couldn't move. 'I've always worked and never wanted to let it stop me but it has been tough. 'Everyone at my job has always been supportive - I've had special orthopedic chairs to try and prevent the back pain getting any worse. 'But more importantly, I felt like I couldn't be the mum that I wanted because my boobs were always in the way. 'They stopped me from playing with me daughter and I couldn't even tie her shoelaces they were so big. 'Now I can do everything I want and I am so thankful to everyone at Aurora Clinics. 'I can live a normal life without the horrendous pain and embarrassment of having such huge breasts and I will forever be grateful to Baddow Hospital and Aurora Clinics for giving me my life back. 'Without their help I couldn't see a way forward, I honestly thought I was going to be facing a life of excruciating pain and endless embarrassment.' Ms Mills' surgeon Garrick Georgeu revealed the Aurora Community Scheme was launched earlier this year, in conjunction with Baddow Hospital, to give back to the local community and Ms Mills was the first beneficiary. He said: 'After meeting and hearing about Kim's struggle over the last few years to get NHS funded treatment, we all felt compelled to help her. 'The size of her bust was extreme and significantly affecting every aspect of her life, to the point that in her early 30s has already developed changes within her spine caused by this excessive weight. 'We hope that this breast reduction surgery gives Kim, a new lease on life, bringing about a positive change for her and her young family.'","Kim Mills had large breasts since she was a teenager, reaching size KK .

"A lavish waterfront mansion in Maryland belonging to a tech tycoon has been destroyed by an enormous fire which has left the building a smoking ruin and growing concerns about the safety of six people. Emergency crews in Annapolis were scrambled early on Monday morning to the blaze at the waterfront home of Don Pyle, a former CEO. Eight-five firefighters were on scene later in the morning fighting the fire at the 16,000sq ft home, which caught alight around 3:30am. Pyle, 56, lived in the home with his wife Sandra and their two adult sons. There are unconfirmed reports that Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren. Authorities are reportedly looking for six people, none of whom have been located. Scroll down for video . Mansion fire: The $9million home in Annapolis, Maryland, caught fire around 3:30am, and is now little more than a smoking ruin . Owner: There are unconfirmed reports that Don and Sandra Pyle were home the night of the blaze along with their four grandchildren. Authorities are reportedly looking for six people, none of whom have been located . Intense: Eighty-five firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the early-morning blaze - which still needed attention at midday on Monday . Waterfront home: The blaze, pictured from across the water, was reportedly still being fought at midday on Monday . Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle revealed  that the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house . According to local station WJLA, none of the home's residents have been accounted for. Neighbors have told the media that they hope the Pyles were out of town when the fire started. 'We are hoping and praying there is no loss of life,' County Executive Steve Schuh told Capital Gazette. Another neighbor, Anne Tiffany, described the Pyles as 'lovely people.' 'They've always been kind to me,' she said. Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people.' Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies. In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia. He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house. His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from Chesapeake Bay and it has an estimated $9million value. Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty. Before: The 16,000sq ft property boasts two swimming pools and its own courtyard, as well as two outbuildings, one of which is connected to the main house by a covered portion. The image above was taken in 2012 . Inferno: The blaze, pictured from the air, tore through the home. Bottom right, firefighters can be seen standing near the pools as they spray water at the ruins . Aftermath: Firefighters were still spraying water on the smoking ruins after the sun rose. Homicide detectives were at the scene - thought it isn't certain whether the owners were home . Gutted: The house, which still needed water poured on it, was ravaged by the flames. Only some of the stone core remained, along with some twisted metal frames . Wreckage: The home had often been the site of charity gatherings and parties, according to neighbors and local reports . Huge loss: The home, built in 2005 to be a cross between a castle and a beach house, was worth an estimated $9million . Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement. Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture. Though most of the fire appeared to have been extinguished by late Monday morning, some firefighters were still reportedly pouring water on the ruins at midday - almost nine hours after the fire started. Fire chiefs said they were not able to search the house during the blaze, and that it is unlikely they will be able to confirm whether there are any victims until Tuesday. ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic. 'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.' Emergency crews: Because the house was nowhere near a fire hydrant, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department deployed a boat to a nearby jetty .","Picturesque property near Chesapeake Bay engulfed by flames in the early hours of Monday morning .

Death: Police found Mrs Ahmed's body with injuries to the head and neck and her husband was found nearby sweating profusely and with blood on his clothes . His lawyer Mark Kelly QC told the court that the issue at the previous hearing had been determining Ahmed's state of mind at the time of the killing. At the time the couple's neighbours spoke of a 'lovely couple' who 'always looked very happy together'. But around the time of the murder a row was apparently heard at the house and Mr Ahmed was seen taking his children away from the property and returning alone. One neighbour said: 'He was standing outside trying to get back into the house. 'They have an electronic code system to get in and I thought she may have changed it because he was outside for a while.

The discovery is important because osteoarthritis is often not caught until it has reached such a late stage that the joints so badly damaged that surgery is the only option. The Leeds University researchers said that Britain is facing an epidemic of osteoarthritis as the population ages – and early diagnosis is key if the disease is to be held at bay. The study of nearly 5,000 people found that knee pain when climbing the stairs is the first sign of arthritis. The discovery is important because osteoarthritis is often not caught until joints are badly damaged . Detected early enough, even something as simple as losing weight could slow the progression of the condition. The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis is caused by wear and tear of cartilage that helps our joints take the strain of bending, lifting, gripping and kneeling, and affects more than eight million Britons. Knee problems are particularly common and reduced mobility triggers a downward spiral, in which loss of independence fuels other problems from depression to weight gain and sleep disruption. The researchers analysed data on 4,673 men and women who filled in an annual questionnaire on whether their knees hurt during various activities. Most of those taking part were deemed to be at high risk of developing osteoarthritis. The volunteers answered the questions every year for up to seven years, allowing the progress of the disease to be tracked. The results revealed that using the stairs to be the first activity in which knees started to hurt. This was followed by pain when walking. As time went on standing started to hurt and then sitting. Finally, even lying in bed failed to provide relief from knee pain. The sequence suggests that initially the knee has to be bent and bearing weight for the damage to the joint to be painful. As the disease progresses, the bar at which pain is felt becomes lower and lower. The study was carried out by researchers from Leeds University (pictured) who said that Britain is facing an epidemic of osteoarthritis as the population ages. They analysed data on 4,673 men and women for the study . Lead researcher Philip Conaghan said: 'At present we have little concept of ""early"" osteoarthritis and often only see people when they have significant longstanding pain and loss of function. 'This research is vital to understanding the early symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. 'Knowing this will help us intervene earlier, perhaps leading to more effective ways of treating this very painful condition.' While there are no drugs that rebuild the lost cartilage, exercise can help hold the disease at bay. Professor Conaghan advises those who notice knee pain to try some gentle exercise on a cross-trainer or bike. This will help them lose weight and strengthen the powerful thigh muscles – both of which will take some of the strain off the knees. If the pain doesn't ease after a few weeks or gets worse, they should ask their GP about getting referred for physiotherapy. Dr Natalie Carter, of charity Arthritis Research UK, which helped fund the study, said: 'Detecting knee osteoarthritis early can be difficult as there are currently no simple and reliable methods available to make an early diagnosis or predict how it will develop or respond to therapy. 'Usually by the time a definite diagnosis has been made using x-rays, the disease is in its advanced stages. 'If we could find ways of identifying knee osteoarthritis early people with the condition could be encouraged to lose weight, exercise, and generally change their lifestyle to reduce the chances of osteoarthritis getting worse. 'A wide range of exercises have been recommended and shown to be beneficial in reducing overall risk of pain and disability, including swimming, walking, cycling and running. 'These can help reduce the risk of developing the disease in the first place, relieve existing symptoms and help to prevent further deterioration.' The study is published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research.","Study of up to 5,000 people found knee pain on stairs is a sign of arthritis .

"A teacher was almost paralysed after he was battered by pupils in two separate attacks at a school where staff are spat at and abused 'on a daily basis'. Mark Freestone, 51, suffered horrific injuries and was left unable to walk after he was assaulted by a 13-year-old boy with a metal scooter at Denewood Learning Centre in Nottingham. The father-of-two was off work for five weeks with a slipped disc after the attack, but just days after returning he suffered an identical injury while restraining a 13-year-old pupil who tried to bite him. Mr Freestone, who has 26 years teaching experience, revealed  that his colleagues had suffered years of physical abuse including one who had their hair set on fire. Mark Freestone, 51, suffered a slipped disk (left) and  was left unable to walk after he was assaulted by a 13-year-old pupil with a metal scooter . He said: 'There have been a lot of staff that have been assaulted over the years. Someone had their neck twisted. 'A 13-year-old child came into school with a metal scooter and was swinging it above his head, smashing furniture and attacking the head teacher with it. 'Myself and the site manager intervened to get hold of the scooter and we had to take hold of him and take him away down the corridor. 'I stood in front of him when it appeared he had calmed down and he then went straight for me and pushed me down and at that moment I felt my back go, the pain was excruciating and I have never felt anything like it. Just days after returning to school following the attack in May 2013, he suffered similar injuries after restraining a pupil who had tried to bite him . 'I went to hospital and they diagnosed a prolapsed disc in the base of my spine.' The attack was among dozens at the Pupil Referral Unit which caters for 64 pupils aged 7-14 who have been excluded from other schools around Nottinghamshire. It has been placed in special measures following a damning Ofsted report which found staff were abused, attacked and spat at on a daily basis. Nottinghamshire Police confirmed they were called to the school 56 times last year. When Mr Freestone returned to work after the attack a new student was brought into his class who punched him in the face after just two hours. 'He was the worst student I have ever seen. He was completely violent,' said Mr Freestone. 'On the first day he was in my class I asked him to take his hat and sunglasses off and he punched me in the face. 'We called his parents into the school and we sent him home and agreed to start again the next day but he came for me and tried to bite me. 'As I restrained him on the floor I felt my back go again. I was helpless because he kept on biting me and scratching me. Denewood Learning Centre in Nottingham caters for 64 pupils aged 7-14 who have been excluded from other schools . 'I had to go back to the doctor but this time I had an X-ray and it showed that a disc in my back had popped out and it was one of the worst cases of the injury they had seen. 'It was so bad I couldn't walk.' He made more than 10 complaints to schools watchdog Ofsted about violence at the school before handing in his notice in December. 'It was common for the staff to just break down and cry because of everything that was going on,' he said. 'When I complained about the problems I got told that there wasn't a magic wand to fix things. No one listened to my concerns. Staff are going through hell in that place.' Both boys are still being taught at the school and no charges have been brought. A police spokesman  said: 'Nottinghamshire Police has a duty of care to protect all children living and studying in the county. 'Nottinghamshire Police can confirm that a referral to the education authority in relation to this was made in October.' Sarah Fielding, director of education at the city council, said: 'Teaching at a Pupil Referral Unit is one of the most challenging jobs in the teaching profession. 'But no teacher or student should ever be put into an unsafe environment. 'We know this situation is clearly unacceptable and urgent improvement is needed. 'We have applied to the Secretary of State to give the council the powers we need to intervene at the school. 'This will enable us to put a new governing body in place to make rapid improvements.'","Mark Freestone, 51, was attacked by a 13-year-old boy with a metal scooter .

"It is the world's most southerly post office and the most popular tourist destination in Antarctica. Each year, around 70,000 cards are posted at the remote  hub, destined for more than 100 different countries. But the staff at Port Lockroy, who spend the Antarctic summer manning their remote outpost, are joined each year by 3,000 gentoo penguins. Located on Goudier Island, 700 miles south of the Chile and Argentina coastlines, the unusual post office sends out cards and letter which will take between two and six weeks to reach their destinations. Run by the United Kingdom Antarctic Heritage Trust on behalf of the Government, the remote base receives an income from the Post Office and a small gift shop which goes towards the renovation of historic sites in Antarctica. The unusual spot has become a favourite stop-off with tourists arriving on cruise ships from around the world to explore the stark continent and learn about its wildlife. Port Lockroy is home to 3,000 gentoo penguins who return each year to find a mate and raise their young . Tourists visiting the remote outpost can see the baby penguins as they hatch . Port Lockroy was first discovered in 1873 by German Edward Dorman and became known as a safe place to anchor and shelter form storms, as well as an area where whalers processed their catch. In the early 20th century, as nations battled to lay claim to parts of Antarctica, Britain sent men and two huts, known as Base A and Base B, to construct a permanent presence at Port Lockroy. It is those bases that still exist today, and the post office is a throwback to the small one constructed by the men to send letters back to loved ones. The site is preserved as a historic attraction, showing the spot where Britain laid claim to a part of Antarctica with a permanent base in the early 20th century . The post office also has a small guft shop and museum, explaining the history of Britain's presence . After being closed in 1962, the huts fell into disrepair, but were restored in the 1990s with the idea of protecting the area as a historic monument. Now a small museum shows how the men lived in the 1950s at the remote outpost. Each year, in time for the Antarctic summer, a small staff crosses the notorious Drake Passage from South America to staff the post office for five months. Each year the post office processes around 70,000 cards sent to 100 different countries . The base shows how workers lived in the 1950s while protecting British interests in the area . The base was restored to esactly how it was to show how difficult conditions could be . There is no running water, no electricty and even in summer, the temperatures are freezing. As staff man the post office, around 3,000 gentoo penguins flock to the area to find a mate and raise their young. Since the historic outpost was renovated in 1996, the penguins have also been monitored, to better understand how they live and help protect them. And the famous post office has also become the subject of numerous documentaries, such as a partnership between the BBC and American channel PBS.","Penguin Post Office is located at Port Lockroy in Antarctica .

"Irish tourist Barry Lyttle will be allowed to live with his girlfriend  who has rushed from Ireland to Australia to be by his side after a magistrate agreed to change his bail conditions this morning. Mr Lyttle, charged with reckless grievous bodily harm after allegedly striking his brother Patrick in Sydney’s Kings Cross nightclub district, appeared at Downing Centre Local Court with his blonde partner Patricia and father and Oliver. The 33-year-old learned he may face harsher penalties if he is convicted with the assault as the Director of Public Prosecutions will prosecute his case in the District Court. Scroll down for video . Irish tourist Barry Lyttle arrives at the Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney with his girlfriend Patricia Greene . Mr Lyttle (second left) arrives at court with his father Oliver (left) and girlfriend Patricia Greene . Family and friends were out in force to support Mr Lyttle for his court appearance on Tuesday . His brother woke up late last month and his father, Oliver Lyttle, today told reporters he is speaking and improving. ‘He’s coming along very well,’ Mr Lyttle said. A magistrate today amended Mr Lyttle’s bail conditions, allowing him to move from Blacktown, in Sydney’s west, where he has been living with his aunt, to a location closer to St Vincent’s Hospital with his partner. The decision came after family lawyer Chris Watson told the court: ‘It would be convenient if he could move closer to St Vincent’s Hospital.’ Mr Lyttle and his partner have not yet decided on where they are going to stay and they will have to notify police 24 hours before they move. Police did not oppose the decision. Barry Lyttle appeared composed in court, accompanied by his father and holding his partner’s hand. He is unable to return to his native Ireland to be with his partner because of his bail conditions. A court earlier ruled he must not approach a point of departure from Australia and he had to hand his passport over to authorities. Mr Lyttle arrived in Australia on December 29 with his father. The pair were visiting Patrick, who had been travelling around the country for months previously. The case continues on February 17. Patrick Lyttle, 31, (right) woke up from his coma six days after brother Barry, 33, (left) allegedly struck him . Barry uploaded this photo with Patrick, right, and their father Oliver, centre, hours after his brother woke up . Since the incident Barry and his father Oliver have been keeping a vigil at Patrick's bedside. Patrick, 31, has since regained consciousness and is now ‘stable’ at St Vincent's Hospital in Darlinghurst. Patrick was rushed to hospital on January 3 and spent almost a week in an induced coma in a critical but stable condition. The 31-year-old woke up on January 9 after his brother, Barry, appeared in court charged over the one-punch attack. Patrick had bleeding at the back of his skull and swelling of the brain, a source close to the incident told The Sunday Telegraph. The Irishman had to have surgery to relieve the pressure on his brain. Doctors at St Vincent's Hospital - in Sydney's inner-city suburb of Darlinghurst - have told the family it was too early to tell if he would make a full recovery from his serious injuries. 'The only way they will know that he’s not going to recover fully is if his progression stops,' the source told News Corp. Along with the long anxious wait ahead for family, police will also have to do the same to find out what happened on the night of the alleged attack. Right now, Patrick  is on strong medication and remains in a state of grogginess. The source said he was only able to exert his energy for a short period of time and spends most of his time sleeping. Barry Lyttle, 33, was charged with reckless grievous bodily harm and was granted bail on January 5 . The brothers' father, Oliver, arrived at court to support his older son while Patrick lay in a coma. Oliver and Barry have maintained a near constant presence at Patrick's bedside . His brother and his father, Oliver, have maintained a near constant presence by Patrick's bedside. Previously, Barry spoke to Daily Mail Australia exclusively, saying: ‘The way things are, we are just taking each day as it comes. ‘He seems to be improving, (we’re all) taking each day as it comes.' Hours after his brother woke up in hospital on January 9, Barry Lyttle posted a photo to his Facebook page with his brother Patrick, and their father Oliver standing in front of the Sydney Opera House. Within minutes messages of support were flowing in from friends and family. 'Barry. great picture... great family!!! everything is gonna [sic] workout mate!' wrote one friend. Another wrote, 'stay strong cuz [sic]! You will all get through this!! Here's to good times ahead, as before!' The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross - in Sydney's inner-city . Following the January 3 incident, Barry spent a weekend in police custody and was granted bail. After Barry's initial court hearing on January 5, a tearful Oliver Lyttle told reporters his sons had loved each other since they were children. 'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went [in court today] and their sympathy.' Patrick Lyttle was treated by paramedics at the scene in Sydney's inner city, where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit . Two Irish brothers were involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city which has left the younger brother fighting for his life . As part of his bail conditions, Barry had to hand over his Irish passport to authorities. He is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol. He is required to live with his Australian aunt at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day. Barry and Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June. Police say Barry punched his younger brother in the head during an argument on January 3, causing him to fall backwards and hit the footpath.

"A newborn baby became Britain's youngest organ donor after her kidneys and liver were used to save the lives of two patients. The kidneys, just three or four centimetres long, were transplanted into an victim of renal failure. The liver cells, known medically as 'hepatocytes', were given to another seriously ill person. Kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb and it is now hoped the delicate procedure will set a 'milestone' in organ donation. The baby girl, who has not been identified, was born at Hammersmith Hospital, west London (pictured). She died a few days later, her brain having been starved of oxygen at some point in the pregnancy . A significant proportion of newborns who die in neonatal units could be potential organ donors, so they could save the lives of other sick patients. The unidentified donor was a girl born at term after an emergency Caesarean section at Hammersmith Hospital, west London. She weighed almost 7lbs (3.1kg) but was very sick, and it became clear her brain had been starved of oxygen for a period during the pregnancy. Treatment made no difference, and repeated examinations showed she was unable to make any spontaneous movement, did not respond to any stimuli, and had fixed and dilated pupils. The parents and medical staff involved in her care discussed the possibility of organ donation when it became clear she would not survive. Supported by the organ donation team, the nursing staff, and the hospital's psychologist, the parents gave their consent for their daughter's kidneys and liver cells to be used for the benefit of other sick patients. Dr Gaurav Atreja, of the neonatal unit at Hammersmith Hospital in west London, said the kidneys measured just three to four centimetres long and two centimetres wide. An adult's are about three times that size. The kidneys, just three to four cms long, were transplanted into an victim of renal failure. White liver cells, known medically as 'hepatocytes', were given to another seriously ill person. Kidneys fully function at around 37 weeks in the womb and it is now hoped the delicate procedure will set a 'milestone' in organ donation. Dr Gaurav Atreja, of the neonatal unit at Hammersmith Hospital in west London, said the kidneys measured just three to four cms long and two cms wide. An adult's are about three times that size. He said: 'You can transplant a baby's kidneys into children or adults. I don't know exactly what size they will grow to but it is enough for them to function. 'And the liver cells can be transfused into the blood of patients with end stage liver failure to buy them time while they wait for a suitable donor. 'They are taken from a fresh liver and function as a substitute liver for a few weeks during that vital window. ' He said: 'You can transplant a baby's kidneys into children or adults. I don't know exactly what size they will grow to, but it is enough for them to function. 'And her liver cells can be transfused into the blood of patients with end stage liver failure to buy them time while they wait for a suitable donor. 'They are taken from a fresh liver and function as a substitute liver for a few weeks during that vital window.' The baby, who was born midway through last year, died from a lack of oxygen to her brain. Dr Atreja said there are plenty of causes of oxygen starvation in the womb and he could not go into individual cases for 'confidential reasons' but it was a tragedy 'beyond our control.' 'The lack of oxygen means other organs could also have been damaged so we had to check which ones - if any - were suitable for transplantation and the kidneys and liver cells were. He added that the parents of the baby were keen to go through with the procedure. 'When we explained to the parents of the baby girl it could be possible to save some lives with their help they were only too keen. 'They came back wanting to speak to me again within a couple of hours. 'They didn't need any persuading - not that that is something we would ever try to do. It's a decision that has to come from the parents without any pressure. 'It's a very sensitive and difficult issue which is why we have a very experienced clinical psychologist to help them through the process.' The case was reported in the Foetal & Neonatal Edition of Archives of Disease in Childhood. Dr Atreja wrote: 'A very careful and realistic plan was prepared in association with the organ donation team and presented to the parents.' After a specialist nurse from the National Health Service Blood and Transplant team did a full assessment of the infant's organs, it was agreed the kidneys and liver cells were retrievable and suitable recipients were located in the country. The baby's liver cells (file picture of the cells above), known medically as 'hepatocytes', were given to a seriously ill person awaiting a transplant . Six days after she was born, and with death confirmed, these tissues were obtained with the help of an experienced surgeon from the National Organ Retrieval Service. The team said: 'It is due to the extreme generosity of the parents and wonderful professional collaboration between the neonatal team and the organ donation team that this process was successful. 'This case has set a milestone in the care of newborns in the UK. 'Cases such as this are rare but I hope other neonatal units will look at what we've done and consider doing similar things in the future.' They pointed out current advice makes it very difficult for donors to be identified. New guidelines from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health are expected shortly, and these should help to standardise an approach to organ donation among newborns. The child's kidneys, just three or four cm long, were transplanted into a victim of renal failure - and were big enough to function in an adult's body . Experts hope this will also kick start a new way of thinking about neonatal organ donation. The family of the baby were praised by NHS Blood and Transplant, the organisation that organised the retrieval of her kidneys and liver cells. Professor James Neuberger, associate medical director for Organ Donation and Transplantation, said: 'We are pleased the first transplant of organs from a newborn was a success and we also praise the brave decision of the family to donate their baby's organs. 'Agreeing to donate happens at a heartbreaking time and in a family's life and our thoughts go out to all families that find themselves in this position. 'The sad reality is for everybody to get the lifesaving transplant they are desperately in need of, more families who are facing the tragic loss of their young child will need to agree to donation.' There are currently 194 young people under the age of 18 waiting for a transplant - of whom 15 are babies under two. Professor Neuberger said: 'We welcome any  good to come out of their own personal tragedy.' In October, healthcare assistant Samira Kauser, 22, hit the headlines when the kidneys of a five week old baby were transplanted into her at St James's University Hospital in Leeds. After the seven hour operation she said: 'Words cannot express the gratitude I feel to the parents of this baby. 'My life was standing still - now I can live it.'","Unidentified donor was born at term at Hammersmith Hospital, London .

"By AUSTIN UGWUMADU, CONSULTANT GYNAECOLOGIST . Many women worry about feminine hygiene. But, in recent years, I've noticed that more and more of my female patients are coming in and asking if they should be using a special spray or wash to help. Such products have been around for a long time, but a recent survey by British market research firm Mintel found that a quarter of women aged 16 or over had used feminine wipes and/or a feminine wash in the past six months. Take a look on the shelves of any High Street pharmacy and you'll see products such as Canesfresh Gentle Refreshing Mousse, Balance Activ Fresh pH Balanced Intimate Wipes and Vagisil Odour Shield Intimate Spray. The vagina is a perfectly-balanced ecosystem, and the bacteria there play a crucial role, says Dr Ugwumadu . These should not be confused with medical products that treat conditions such as thrush and bacterial vaginosis. Instead, they promise to keep you 'fresh'. However, fragrant though they sound, I'm afraid these products are completely unnecessary and, in my opinion, are exploiting women's anxieties about their bodies. The advertising and packaging of feminine hygiene products play on the impression that women need to be squeaky-clean - otherwise they'll be more at risk of infection. In fact, the opposite is true. The vagina is a perfectly-balanced ecosystem, and the bacteria there play a crucial role in gynaecological health. The skin cells of the vagina contain high levels of sugar molecules called glycogen, which bacteria break down to produce lactic acid. This helps to keep the vagina at the specific, acidic pH range it needs to keep itself clean and healthy, which is about 3.5 to 4.5 - about the same as a tomato (the rest of your skin has a pH of about 5 to 6, similar to rainwater). The best thing you can do is to not interfere with this process. Often, any odour is imagined but, of course, that's not always the case. Up to one in six women will be affected by bacterial vaginosis at some point, where the balance of the bacteria in the vagina become disrupted. It's usually symptomless and clears on its own, but if it does cause symptoms - such as odour - the condition can be treated with a straightforward course of antibiotics. You can see why women might want to mask the odour - but, actually, that's the worst thing you can do. In his view, 'these new feminine hygiene products just worsen women's anxiety about their bodies' Studies show women who use scented soaps, bubble baths, or special deodorants, or who douche, are in fact more prone to bacterial vaginosis than others, as these practices can remove naturally protective bacteria. The new wave of feminine hygiene products are not designed to be used internally, so I wouldn't be concerned they could cause bacterial vaginosis. However, they do claim to be formulated to 'maintain' or 'support' a healthy vaginal pH - and this is misleading. As they don't get anywhere near the inside, I don't see how they could have any effect on the pH. There will be no difference in the pH of a woman using such products and a woman who washes with a normal shower gel - except that one will be lighter of pocket. In my view, these new feminine hygiene products just worsen women's anxiety about their bodies, and are probably a waste of money. If a patient of mine is healthy, yet feels paranoid about a smell, I don't have a problem with her using one - and the act of buying and using it may have a placebo effect, making her feel better about herself. But I would not recommend such a product and I always tell women to be a bit careful, as they could have a sensitivity to the ingredients, or even an allergic reaction. Many feminine hygiene products are marketed as being 'free of preservatives', but it's not possible to guarantee against allergy, as we cannot predict what people may be sensitive to. Over millions of years, this part of the body has adapted its own highly-effective cleaning process. As long as you're showering every day and wearing clean, preferably non-synthetic underwear, this should be enough. Dr Ugwumadu is a consultant gynaecologist at St George's Hospital, in South-West London. Interview by CHLOE LAMBERT .","Dr Ugwumadu says more women are asking about feminine hygiene .

"A photographer has taken his art form to a new level by documenting the high jinks of performers dangling from some of the tallest rooftops in the world. Giulio Calisse enjoys the thrill of looking over the edge, but prefers to stay back and capture the professional parkour runners doing what they do best. The 29-year-old took this set of amazing photographs from various rooftops in downtown Toronto, some as tall as 200m (670ft). Scroll down for video . Living on the edge: Giulio Calisse, 29, has spent two years photographing rooftoppers in Toronto as they scale the city's highest buildings . On top of the skyline: The Italian snapper said that the perspectives of his photographs sometimes makes viewers feel vertigo themselves . A cut above: The parkour runners photographed by Mr Calisse are in peak physical condition and train before performing their rooftop stunts . Parkour, or freerunning as it is often known, sees performers move freely and quickly around and over obstacles in any location, often performing death-defying stunts. It is usually practised in cities, and can include acrobatics, leaping from and over walls, flips and precision jumping. While the performers are the stars of Mr Calisse's pictures, the photographer also appreciates their beautiful backdrop. 'I like to shoot at night because there is something inherently more spectacular about the way the city looks at night, with hundreds of these tiny dots of light sprinkled across the landscape,' he said. 'You really get a sense of the scale of these huge skyscrapers, and the sheer amount of people bustling about.' Calling his work 'urban exploration,'  Mr Calisse has also shot video of his subjects' daring exploits on the city's 'sexiest rooftopping spots'. He has been venturing to the summits of Toronto's highest buildings for about two years, and said that it is relatively easy to make it on top of the roofs. 'There's no real training needed to reach rooftops and shoot a few photos, since most of these spots are made to be easily accessible to window cleaners and maintenance personnel. A different view: Mr Calisse said that going to the rooftops helps him capture a look to the city that people walking on the street can't see . With the greatest of ease: Mr Callise said that the training process behind the parkour runners' effortless acrobatics was similar to what trapeze artists learn, including upper body strength conditioning . 'When it comes to the hanging stunts, you could say it's a similar learning process to what trapeze artists go through. 'Overall it's important to have good upper body strength, and to practise bar work and climbing.' Mr Calisse, originally from Rome, has been photographing the athletic parkour runners and performers for the past decade. He said: 'I've personally had an interest in parkour and acrobatics for about 10 years, and ever since day one I've always found myself capturing images of people that were much more talented than myself. 'When we look at acrobats in their professional environment like a circus, or doing stunt work, we know to expect superhuman abilities. 'But when you replace that familiar context with a raw everyday environment like a city rooftop, the viewer can suddenly relate and almost feel the vertigo themselves.' Full of admiration for the daredevil athletes he documents, Mr Calisse said he doesn't partake in their riskiest behaviour. He said, 'Although I enjoy the thrill of taking a peek from the edge, I personally avoid the more dangerous stunts and stick to walking around and taking photos. 'The people I've photographed on the edge of buildings and cranes happen to be professional parkour performers who regularly train on high ledges, swinging from bars and overall control and strength training.' The Italian photographer was also impressed by his subjects' 'nerves of steel'. 'There wasn't really any psyching up involved in the dangles, it was a very natural process for the guys,' Mr Calisse said. He said that the climbers have a lot of experience with urban acrobatics and added: 'The element of fear is very calculated for them.' Above it all: Though Mr Calisse gets a thrill from peeking out over the edge of the buildings, he lets the professional parkour runners do the most dangerous stunts .","Italian Giulio Calisse, 29, scales Toronto buildings as high as 670ft for stunning shots .

A human cannonball died when a faulty catch released the safety net as he flew into the air in front of hundreds of spectators, an inquest heard yesterday. Matthew Cranch, 24, was a ‘thrill-seeker’ who had become a stuntman only a week before the tragedy. His final moments were captured on video and played at the inquest yesterday – with the safety net suddenly falling to the ground as he left the mouth of the cannon. The short but dramatic video started with a ‘3-2-1-Fire!’ countdown and, accompanied by the flash of a firework to simulate gunfire, Mr Cranch shot out of the end of the cannon. As he left the barrel, the large rope net below immediately fell flat to the ground. Mr Cranch continued on a brief upwards arc, hunching into a near ball as he prepared for a headlong dive to the ground. The video was stopped before the moment of impact. Mr Cranch’s parents and sister left the room before the video was played. Two health and safety experts told the hearing that a fault in the machinery holding the netting in place meant that it could be loose despite clicking into position. The recoil from the firing set off enough vibrations to shake the safety net loose – meaning Mr Cranch was doomed to fall 40ft to the ground. Paramedics and an air ambulance crew could do nothing to save him. Mechanical engineer Alex Grimes said he staged experiments with the cannon and found that the quick-release safety catch for the netting was liable to appear locked while in fact being dangerously loose. He added that it seemed to have been left dirty for years, adding to the risk. Mr Cranch is seen climbing into the cannon before carrying out the daredevil stunt . He gives a 'thumbs up' sign as he climbs into the cannon at the stunt show in Kent . Mr Grimes said: ‘The safety net release latch could be “falsely closed”. This made the latch susceptible to opening by movement or vibration. If the latch was set up in the “false-closed” position, the firing of the cannon could cause the release of the safety catch, causing the net to collapse.’ Present at the inquest in Maidstone, Kent, yesterday was stunt motorcyclist Scott May, 38, who employed Mr Cranch for the show at Kent County Showground in Detling in April 2011. He was represented by barrister Tania Robinson, who tried to stop the video of the accident being shown to the jury, claiming it was ‘unnecessary, emotive and distressing’. Mr Cranch suffered multiple injuries when he plunged to the ground after being fired from this cannon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show, jurors at the inquest into his death were told .

Two staff who worked on the human cannonball device – Tommy Austin and Tony Nicholls – were also at the inquest. Mr Cranch’s parents – Michael, 69, a company director, and Pauline, 65, a teacher – and sister Eleanor asked the coroner that their son be described as a ‘mechanic’. They sat alongside representatives from Maidstone Borough Council who took over a health and safety inquiry into the death started by police. Coroner Patricia Harding began the hearing by leading the jury through an explanation of how the ‘cannon’, mounted on the back of a lorry, worked. As Mr Cranch was fired out of the cannon, the net collapsed, causing him to land on the ground . At the time of Mr Cranch's death, his friends described him as a ‘thrill-seeker’ who opted out of his promising academic career and his conventional middle-class upbringing . The stunt man flies through the air as part of Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show . It contained a large bucket attached to the mouth of the barrel by eight thick elasticated ropes. Mr Cranch – described by a school friend as a ‘thrill-seeker’ – climbed into the mouth of the cannon and stood in the bucket, and a mechanised winch pulled it backwards, stretching the ropes taut. After a dramatic countdown, the bucket was suddenly released – and flew up to the mouth of the cannon, some 25ft in the air. A restraint stopped the bucket abruptly at the cannon mouth, and the momentum meant ‘cannonball’ Mr Cranch carried on travelling upwards, and flew 10ft or higher into the air. Mr Cranch had been fired from the cannon mounted on this lorry in front of a crowd of spectators at the showground in Detling, Kent, on April 25, 2011 . The cannon was attached to this lorry, and Mr Cranch had been supposed to land on the safety net, the inquest heard . Motorcycle stuntman Mr May (pictured), representatives from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Maidstone Borough Council, were also present at today's inquest . Miss Robinson told the hearing the stunt had been staged 900 times without the quick-release safety catch failing. Mr Austin, responsible for attaching the safety net to the lorry with two colleagues, said: ‘I checked it was secure by pulling on the metal wire and putting body weight on the net itself.’ He was unaware there was a danger of the latch having a ‘false-closed’ position. Kent Police announced in 2012 that there would be no prosecutions over the incident. The hearing continues. The tragedy happened in front of the assembled crowds who had paid £12 to see the stunt show . Mr Cranch had suffered serious injuries to his heart, head and chest and died in the ambulance after suffering a cardiac arrest two minutes before arriving at hospital, the inquest was told . Kent Police announced in December 2012 that no criminal prosecution would be brought over the incident .

"After more than 30 years behind the lens, award-winning wildlife photographer Paul Souders decided to let someone - or rather something - else do most of the hard work for him. The 53-year-old American snapper has traveled to every conceivable corner of the world in his quest to capture animals in their natural habitat, but for his latest shoot Paul put decided to put his feet up and put his trust in a drone. Paul traveled 10,000 miles from his home in Seattle to  Chobe National Park in Botswana for the shoot, which he took using his DJI Phantom Vision 2+drone operated via a hand-held remote control. Scroll down for video . A magnificent bull elephant in Chobe National Park in Botswana looks straight into the lens as the drone hovers overhead . The drone shows the reactions of different species to the alien presence. This herd of elephants beat a hasty retreat one they notice the drone .

A heard of wildebeest can be seen fleeing the scene as the drone hovers overhead, while in another shot, a lone giraffe appears fascinated by the device. In 2013, Paul was the Grand Prize and Nature winner of the National Geographic Photography Contest with a stunning photograph of a polar bear peering up from beneath the melting sea ice on Hudson Bay. Speaking to the magazine, Paul explained that he fell into wildlife photography almost by accident: 'I never set out to be a nature photographer, I wanted to be a news shooter, and I started my first job at a small daily paper in Rockville with dreams of journalistic glory. 'I covered a lot of high school sports, portrait assignments and weather features. It felt like telling the story of my community, one day at a time. At some point, I decided a change of scene was in order. 'Never one for half measures, I packed up everything I owned and drove 4300 miles to Anchorage, Alaska, to take a job at the state’s biggest newspaper. It was 27 below zero the day I arrived, but it was entirely new and magical. There was a moose in my backyard and I could see bald eagles on my morning commute.'

"A mystery shopper has boasted on social media about putting stickers on halal products in his local Woolworths that claim they are 'possibly funding terrorism'. The man posted two pictures of the sticker underneath bottles of tomato sauce and chocolate eggs inside a Woolworths in Beerwah, in Queensland's Glasshouse Mountains region. With the photos, he wrote on the Boycott Halal in Australia page on Facebook: 'Doing our bit to help boycott halal certification. Scroll down for video . A mystery shopper boasted about the labels, which read 'This product is halal certified (possibly funding terrorism',  on an anti-halal Facebook page . 'Just spent about an hour placing these notes at our local Woolworths. Marked about 100 products. Funny how most of them were on special.' The stickers read: 'This product is halal certified (possibly funding terrorism).' It was brought to the attention of the supermarket giant by Boycott Halal in Australia? No Way, according to the Sunshine Coast Daily . According to the pro-halal Facebook group's page, the stickers have been removed and the store manager now has the name of the person who placed them on the shelf. The labels were put on shelves inside Beerwah Woolworths (not pictured) in Queensland's Glasshouse Mountains region . This comes after claims from Kiralee Smith started up a campaign aiming to uncover the truth about Islam and major food companies . The post on Boycott Halal in Australia has since been removed. Beerwah Police said they had not been contacted about the incident. This comes after claims from an Australian housewife who believes she discovered 'deception and corruption' within the food industry and started up a campaign aiming to uncover the truth about the relationship between Islam and some of Australia's major food companies. Kirralie Smith was concerned Australians were unknowingly funding Islamic bodies every time they do the grocery shopping. She wants full disclosure from food companies so Aussie shoppers can make informed decisions about whether to buy from companies who are allegedly giving funds to Islamic organisations. Ms Smith, who is the director and founder of ‘Halal Choices', has made a shopping guide to inform shoppers about which companies are 'Halal Certified', which means their foods are appropriate for Muslims to consume. She also called for an investigation of these Australian organisations, alleging that the international counterparts of the Islamic bodies were found using the proceeds to fund terrorism. Woolworths has been contacted by Daily Mail Australia in relation to this matter. But a spokesman for the supermarket told APN Woolworths wanted to give customers value for money as well as a extensive range of products to choose from when shopping. 'No Woolworths own brand product, be it Homebrand, Select, Gold or Macro is Halal certified and we pay no Halal certification fees as a result,' the spokesman said.","A man posted two pictures of the stickers on halal products on Facebook .

Women are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic of Iran . But female fans have flocked to see the Iranian team's games in Australia where no such rule appplies . Head of Iranian Football Federation's moral committee, Ali Akbar Mohamedzade, issued the warning last week as photos of players with female fans circulated on social media. 'National team players should be aware that they won't be used as a political tool so that those who take pictures with them don't use these photos against the players,' Iran's Shahrvand newspaper quoted him as saying. 'So according to this they should not take photos with everyone. If the players don't respect this, we will be obliged to take action.' However, there has not been any details on what punishment the players might face. Enthusiastic male and female fans of Iran, many wearing the team shirt, have been a prominent feature throughout the Asian Cup.

The scenes are a stark contrast with the situation in Iran, where women are banned from men's sports events on moral grounds.

While another photo shows a woman holding an Iranian flag inscribed with a marriage proposal to Haghighi: 'Will Alireza marry me?' emblazoned across it. The three-time champions are already through to the quarter-finals and their games have been vocally supported by thousands of fans with some banging drugs and blowing trumpets.

"An 89-year-old war veteran was forced to wait on a hospital trolley in A&E for 34 hours, before a bed could be found for him, it has emerged. David Walters had become delirious after developing a temperature. His concerned family called for an ambulance, and five hours later Mr Walters was taken into A&E at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales. But he stayed on a trolley waiting for a bed at the scandal-hit hospital for another 34 hours. Second World War veteran David Walters was forced to wait for 34 hours on a trolley in A&E before he could be admitted on to a ward when a bed became free at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend . Mr Walters' plight is just one example of the experience of thousands of patients across the UK who are subjected to long waits at A&E departments. His story comes as it emerged just 90.2 per cent of patients in England were seen within four hours between October and December last year - short of the 95 per cent target. It marks the worst performance in A&E since the target was set in 2004. Meanwhile in Wales, where the Labour party runs the NHS, 81 per cent of patients spent less than four hours in A&E between arrival until admission, transfer or discharge, in November last year. And the ex-Royal Navy seaman's ordeal came just weeks after he was honoured by Russia, and awarded the Ushakov medal, for his bravery on the deadly Arctic convoys during the Second World War. His granddaughter Jodie Rowlands said: 'He wasn't able to recognise his family or friends. 'It was only after an old friend, who is a retired doctor, saw him and said he needed to go to hospital that anything happened. 'He had to wait for 34 hours in A&E. 'He was taken inside the first two hours to be assessed, but he was then taken back out to the ambulance. 'He was 34 hours on a trolley, and he received no tests or treatment, other than being given some paracetamol.' Mr Walters's family called an ambulance after the 89-year-old became delirious after developing a temperature . The Princess of Wales Hospital is at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect. A spokesman for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: 'We offer our apologies as this is not the standard of care we would wish to provide by keeping patients in the emergency department for this length of time. 'However the hospital was under extreme pressure and there were delays in patients being transferred to appropriate wards in a timely way. 'This situation was not unique to this hospital - many others across the UK have been under similar pressure.' Louise Platt, the Welsh Ambulance Service's head of operations for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area, added: 'Demand on our ambulance service was higher than anticipated on Wednesday evening and this, coupled with delays at hospitals across the region meant we were unable to respond to some calls in the time we would have liked. 'Unfortunately, the call to Mr Walters was one of those calls, but we maintained contact with staff to ensure he remained stable. 'If a relative of Mr Walters would like to discuss this further, we would invite them to contact the trust. In the meantime, our thoughts and well wishes are with him and his family.'","David Walters, 89, became delirious after developing a temperature .

"Cutting the number of bobbies on the beat will leave Britain more at risk of al-Qaeda-inspired attacks, the UK's most experience counter-terror detective has warned. Peter Clarke, the former terror investigations chief, said police officers on the street were crucial for gathering intelligence on extremists. The warning comes amid claims up to 34,000 police jobs could be axed after the election as a result of continuing spending cuts proposed by all three major parties. Peter Clarke, a former Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, has warned that police officers on the street are crucial for gathering intelligence on extremists. Mr Clarke said neighbourhood patrols were crucial for gathering information on terror suspects and cutting them will weaken Britain's fight against fanatics. He said ending such patrols would 'increase the risk the public face from terrorism'. The former counter terror chief, writing in the Times, said: 'Neighbourhood police hold one end of the 'golden thread' that can take us from the streets of Britain to wherever in the world terrorists are trained, equipped and radicalised. 'Chief constables and police and crime commissioners have tough choices ahead of them in deciding what to cut. Cutting the counter-terrorist policing thread could be fraught with danger.' The police are in negotiations with the Home Office over increasing the number of counter-terrorism officers while discussions are also being held about how to raise the number of firearms officers. Policing has had 20 per cent budget cuts since 2010 with a loss of some 34,000 officers and staff and the Home Office grant is being cut by a further £299 million for 2015-16. Mr Clarke said bobbies on the beat (pictured) were crucial for gathering information on terror suspects and cutting them will weaken Britain's fight against fanatics . Mr Clarke's warning comes amid claims that police have been told to remove their names from the electoral register. Intelligence chiefs are worried that Islamist fanatics could try to copy the atrocities in France earlier this month that cost 17 lives. Four Jewish people and three police officers were among the dead. Fears of similar carnage in the UK intensified on Thursday after commandos in Belgium killed Islamic State fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or a judge. The plot held chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013. The guidance to Met officers was reported by The Sunday Times, which also claimed that an additional 800 counter-terrorism police could be deployed on Britain's streets. In addition, the newspaper said Scotland Yard was in talks with the Home Office about extra funding to fight the increased threat to Britain. The warning comes amid heightened terror fears following the attacks in Paris by Cherif Kouachi, left, and Said Kouachi (right) Hundreds of armed French police were scrambled to deal with the Kouachi brothers' attacks. The Government fears copycat attacks are being planned in the UK . The Met would not comment on whether police had been told to remove their names from the electoral register when contacted by MailOnline tonight. However, a spokesman said earlier today: 'We do not discuss the details of our security response. 'But actions taken already include security advice to officers and staff; measures around police buildings; changing risk assessments that affect how we deploy to certain incidents; (and) bolstering levels of specialist support, including firearms officers. 'The MPS has not decided to implement a blanket response regarding levels of crewing and patrolling in response to concerns about the risk of an attack on officers.'","Peter Clarke said neighbourhood police  crucial for gathering intelligence .

"Two mothers became embroiled in a bitter Facebook battle over an invoice handed to one of their sons for missing the other's birthday party. Tanya Walsh and her partner Derek Nash were appalled when their son Alex, five, arrived home from school with a £15.95 bill for missing his classmate Charlie Lawrence’s big day at a local ski centre. After refusing to pay, Alex's parents were threatened that they would be taken to court. Since then Miss Walsh and Charlie's mother Julie Lawrence have become entangled in a war of words. Scroll down for video . Baffled: Derek Nash took his son Alex to see his grandparents instead of turning up to a friend's birthday party - and was handed an invoice for £15.95. The bill was given to the five-year-old via a teacher . No show: The parents received this invoice from the mother of the birthday boy - and the ski slope involved said it was nothing to do with them. 'We don't have any such things as no-show fees', said the manager . 'I messaged Julie on Facebook to say sorry and let's resolve this amicably. And she said: ""The amicable way I believe is for you to pay me the money. And let that be a lesson learnt,'  Miss Walsh, 30, said. 'The next thing I heard she was taking us to small claims court. My partner went to see her and it ended in an argument. She shouted down the street: ""Don't mess with me"". 'Every time I spoke to her previously she was always very polite,' Miss Walsh added. 'All of this is very shocking.' ‘Julie could have tried to contact us before issuing the bill. If she had spoken to us we would have considered paying it. Defence: The host's mother Julie Lawrence (left with her family) said 'all details were on the party invite' ‘I could totally understand her point. It is not about the money for us and we did not mean to let them down. It is the way she has gone about it.’ But Mrs Lawrence said in a statement: 'All details were on the party invite. They had every detail needed to contact me.' Alex's father however said he had no means of contacting the woman, resorting to trying to find her at the children's school gates to apologise. 'My partner looked out for [Mrs Lawrence] to apologise for Alex not showing up to the party, but didn’t see her. ‘But on January 15 she looked in Alex’s school bag and found a brown envelope. It was an invoice for £15.95 for a child’s party no-show fee.’ Mr Nash said he visited Mrs Lawrence’s home and told her he was ‘not happy’. He added: ‘I thought it was a joke to begin with. I am lost for words.’ He had confirmed Alex would attend the 'slide and ride' party before Christmas at the Plymouth Ski Slope and Snowboard Centre. Costing £15.95 a head, it would have included half an hour on a snow tubing run, three toboggan rides, a hot meal, ice cream, jelly and balloons. But he then realised he had already arranged for their daughter to go on a day trip with her grandparents. The host's mother could have little luck getting back the £15.95 in court - where the administration fee to make a claim is £25. The ski centre's manager Louisa Duggan said: 'It seems to be a dispute between two parents and the parent who wrote the invoice has put us on it, which is crazy because we have nothing to do with it. 'We ask for a small deposit on booking and 48 hours before the party we ask hosts to confirm numbers and pay us the full amount. It's £15.95 a head for a slide and ride party. 'But there's no such thing as a no-show fee. We don't invoice private individuals, we just ask for payment 48 hours before. 'If the child doesn't show, to be honest we're pretty flexible. We might give the hosts some extra toboggan rides or some credit at the bar. 'I understand people being upset because people outlay a lot of money for these parties, so I understand their frustration. 'Whether invoicing another parent is a good idea or not is not for me to say, but it's certainly not something I'd do.' From Tanya Walsh: Hi Julie. This is Alex’s mum. I was very shocked to see the invoice in Alex’s school bag. The only reason Alex did not attend the party was because his nan and grandad were going away for Christmas and the only day the kids could go see them was on the same day as the party. I apologise for not letting you know, but I did not have a phone number or an email for you. If I had known that I would have to pay if Alex did not go, then I would have paid you the money, no problem. I do not like fighting with people, and would prefer to settle this amicably. From Julie Lawrence: Hi Tanya, I confirmed with all parents on the Thursday before the party that they were going as I had to pay that day, and Derek told me Alex was looking forward to it and would see us there, to me that is confirmation. My phone number was on the invitation that was sent out to Alex. I don’t like fighting with people either, and was not best impressed when Derek turned up on my doorstep, and said you won’t get any money out of me, rather rudely. The amicable way round this I believe would be to pay me the money and let a lesson be learnt. I hope this is agreeable. Julie . TW: The only reason Derek was angry was because of the fact that the envelope was put into Alex’s school bag, when it has nothing to do with the school. Like I said before, no money was mentioned when we spoke, and I feel it would be inappropriate to pay you the money, when I don’t know what it’s actually paying for. Like I said before I didn’t have your number to let you know. And exactly what lesson would I be learning. I am not a child, so please do not speak to me like I am one. So, to answer your question, unfortunately no. This is not agreeable. JL: You are paying for 1 x child’s party at the ski slope including snow tubing and tobogganing and lunch. TW: Just so you know, small claims court cost £60 just to start a claim. Also I’m not paying for something we didn’t use. JL: It doesn’t cost that much . TW: It does. I don’t know why you are out for our blood. If you had come up to us the first day back and explained about the money, then I could have explained about Alex, then maybe we could have sorted something out. Instead you send an invoice.

"The jihadist brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Cherif and Said Kouachi, experienced the trauma of finding their mother’s body after she’d committed suicide when they were 10 and 12 years old, according to a children’s worker. In the 1990s volunteer Evelyne worked with deprived children in the area of Paris that the brothers lived in and often involved them in activities. She said she adored both boys. On one occasion she took them to Eurodisney and described how Cherif, the younger of the two, was spell-bound by Mickey Mouse. Scroll down for video . The jihadist brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Cherif and Said Kouachi (left and right), experienced the trauma of finding their mother’s body after she’d committed suicide when they were 10 and 12 . She revealed that Said was more reserved and prone to crying. Cherif was naughtier and occasionally ‘turbulent’, she told eco website Reporterre, according to The Independent. And Said tended to take his lead, despite being older. Despite Cherif’s troublesome side, Evelyne grew enormously fond of him. She said: ‘I adored that child. You only had to sweet talk him and take him in your arms and he would calm down. I found him quite touching – under the spell of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, like all children.’ The brothers, who were inseparable, found their mother, who was pregnant at the time with a sixth child, dead in their flat when they came home from school for lunch one day. Evelyne added: ‘A few months after the trip to Eurodisney Cherif came back from school, accompanied, as ever, by his older brother. They found their mother lying dead in the centre of the flat. Dead from what cause? She had taken too many pills. Most people assumed it was suicide.’ The two brothers were filmed by eyewitnesses in a Paris street after they'd slaughtered several members of the Charlie Hebdo editorial team in cold blood . Both brothers behind the Charlie Hebdo massacre have been buried in unmarked graves. Cherif Kouachi was interred just before midnight in a cemetery in Gennevilliers, a suburb in north west Paris, a day after his older brother Said was buried in the northeastern city of Reims. Cherif's family, including his widow, kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a 'pilgrimage site' for Islamists. The mayor of Gennevilliers, where the younger Kouachi brother lived had not wanted the funeral to go ahead, but said he had no legal means to block it. Chérif Kouachi’s widow had asked for both brothers to be buried in the cemetery at Gennevilliers, but the local mayor Patrice Leclerc blocked the request since Saïd, the older brother, was not a resident of the area. He added: 'I don't want a grave that serves to attract fanatics. I don't want a place that promotes hate. 'He was buried last night, in the most discrete, anonymous way possible.' But speaking on BFMTV, Mr Robinet said he was forced to allow the burial by the government, which enforced a French law that grants a right to be buried in the town of last residence. There are no current plans to bury Amedy Coulibaly, who killed five people - including four hostages at a kosher market in Paris - before he was killed by police on January 9. Two years later, in 1994, the brothers were sent to an orphanage in Correze with a their younger brother and older sister. While there Cherif developed into a promising footballer and Said was remembered as being ‘civilised and respectful’, according to a former classmate, ‘Cedric’. He told website Modiapart and Swiss newspaper Le Matin: ‘The Kouachi brothers were ""respected"", because they could ""handle themselves"".Cherif was very good with his fists but, above all, he was a bit of a lad. He was a fan of [the comedian and actor] Djamel Debbouze and football... He was funny and regarded himself as a good looker. He was a fantastic dancer at 15 and played football as easily as he breathed. He could have made a career of it.’ But he added that the school was very violent, with some teachers plainly scared of the children. He remains convinced that the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which saw several members of the magazine murdered, along with two policeman – and the brothers die in a shootout with police at the ages of 32 and 34 - would never have happened if they’d be supported more. ‘They must have been brainwashed,’ he said. The brothers are thought to have been trained by Al Qaeda in Yemen - and carried out the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine to 'avenge the Prophet'. The magazine was famous for poking fun at Islam, along with other religions. Cherif Kouachi was buried in an unmarked grave in Gennevilliers, a suburb in north-west Paris, on Saturday night, a day after his older brother, Said, was buried in the northeastern city of Reims. Cherif's family, including his widow, kept away from the funeral and the grave was left anonymous to avoid it becoming a 'pilgrimage site' for Islamists.

"Dr Christian Jessen, presenter of Channel 4's Weighing Up The Enemy explores whether more obese people should be offered weight loss surgery . More obese people should be given gastric bands on the NHS to save the health service millions in the future, a doctor has said. One in four adults and one in five children in the UK are obese. Countless studies have found carrying extra weight puts a person at significantly greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, suffering heart problems, cancer and stroke. Experts estimate treating obesity and the associated health problems costs the NHS around £6 billion every year. Last year 8,000 overweight patients were given weight loss surgery on the NHS. But that is less than one per cent of those people who could benefit, experts say. Dr Christian Jessen, presenter of Channel 4's Weighing Up The Enemy, will tomorrow explore the question of whether it makes economic sense to offer gastric bands, and bypass operations to more obese people. He argues that rather than lumbering the taxpayer with a hefty bill, the surgery could in fact save the NHS millions in the future. The NHS Choices website reveals gastric band operations cost between £5,000 and £8,000 at private clinics. And gastric bypass surgery costs the NHS between £9,500 to £15,000. The Channel 4 show follows patient Paula's journey as she is admitted to Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital for a gastric band operation. The 62-year-old weighs more than 21 stone and relies on carers to help her go about her day-to-day life. Speaking to the experts caring for Paula, Dr Jessen questions whether the operation makes financial sense for the NHS. Scroll down for video . Dietitian Sally Abbot said: 'The savings in medications alone would surely outweigh the cost of bariatric surgery. 'And it's not even that, if you think of the social care side as well, Paula has carers, but if she's able to be more independent in everyday life, that's a saving in itself.' But bariatric surgery is not without risks. Complications include internal bleeding, respiratory problems and post-operative infections. Weight loss surgeon Paul Super, who works at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital, said despite those risks, the financial benefits of bariatric surgery would be seen to the NHS within a year for many patients. 'Bariatric surgery is high risk because of the nature of the surgery, in and around the top of the stomach, its a a very tricky area to operate,' he said. 'This operation will cost the taxpayer around £5,000 all in. With gastric band and bypass operations costing the taxpayer around £5,000 some experts have argued it would save the NHS money in the long term, with obesity related illnesses, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer costing around £6 billion each year in the UK (file picture) Weight loss surgery, also known as bariatric surgery, is currently used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese. It is only permitted on the NHS in cases where an obese patient has made lifestyle changes but failed. Being dangerously obese, means a person's life is at risk. It is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above. Having a BMI of 35 or above and having another serious health condition, which could be improved by losing weight, such as type 2 diabetes, is also considered a dangerous level of obesity. The National Institue for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is currently considering whether to lower the threshold for weight loss surgery to a BMI of more than 30 for those recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The two most widely used types of weight loss surgery are gastric band operations and gastric bypass procedures. Gastric bands work to reduce the size of the stomach, meaning a smaller amount of food is needed to make a person feel full. Gastric bypasses are where the digestive system is re-routed past the majority of a person's stomach. It means a person digests less food, and it takes much less food to satisfy hunger pangs. Weight loss surgery can achieve impressive results but is not a magic cure for obesity. Patients have to stick to a rigorous, life-long plan, including a carefully controlled diet and regular exercise, to avoid gaining weight. 'If her costs are £15,000 it will pay for itself before the year is up. 'We wouldn't be wasting taxpayers money doing this operation if it wasn't worth it and didn't work out cost effective in the end.' Another gastric band patient Lorna, who weighed 25 stone at her heaviest, told Dr Jessen the surgery has changed her life. 'Outside of having children it is definitely the best thing I have ever done,' she said. 'It has been life-changing. 'Basically I couldn't walk very far, I was diabetic, had IBS and mild sleep apnoea, but they have all cleared up now. I am very happy.' Dr Jessen said: 'Bariatric surgery is certainly not an easy option but where it is simple is in the economics. 'It is very clear to me we need to invest more now in this type of procedure in order to save considerable amounts in the future.' Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, agreed that more obese people should be offered weight loss surgery. 'Bariatric surgery, for a long time seen by the populus at large as a very expensive, wasteful NHS treatment, actually should be seen as a good investment for the future,' he told MailOnline. 'The reason being simply cutting the stomach of obese people in half, reducing it to normal size, means an individual is much less likely to acquire diabetes, cardiovascular problems. 'They require far more expensive treatment for longer. 'The literature says within two to three years, bariatric surgery pays for itself.' But he said, the problem lies with the way NHS budgets are worked out, accusing accountants for not seeing the potential of the bigger picture. Dr Jessen, said: 'Bariatric surgery is certainly not an easy option but where it is simple is in the economics. It is very clear to me we need to invest more now in this type of procedure in order to save considerable amounts in the future' 'The real problem is that as far as the NHS is concerned the people who pay for these operations are not necessarily the same people who reap the financial rewards,' he said. 'There should be a budget for bariatric surgery, the benefits of which would spread to other budgets later in life. 'The big picture is that this surgery is well worth it for the NHS, there are no two ways about it.' But weight loss expert, Steve Miller, presenter of Sky's Fat Families, disagreed. He said the money could be 'better spent on cancer care and terminal illness'. Mr Miller told MailOnline that people who need to lose weight can do something of their own accord. 'If we go down this path we will be paying for cosmetic surgery for people claiming their face is too saggy and it's causing depression,' he said. 'We need to motivate our nation to own their body. 'Motivation is not just about carrot, it is about stick. We require stronger warning measures, penalties for not managing weight, and as a society we need to discuss other options to help reduce weight loss, such as hypnosis. 'We don't have the money in the bank to pay for such surgery. The NHS is struggling and we cannot be promoting the message ""don't worry if you get too fat, we will give you free surgery"".'

"David Cameron today warned Muslim leaders they had 'a problem' if they objected to being asked to do more to tackle Islamist extremism. The Prime Minister said letters sent to mosques were 'reasonable, sensible and moderate' and ministers were 'absolutely right' to insist everybody had a responsibility to fight radicalisation. It came after the Muslim Council of Britain accused the Government of 'ratcheting-up tensions' and adopting the language of the far-right. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, speaking  in Ipswich, Suffolk, this morning, insisted Muslim leaders they had 'a problem' if they objected to the Government's demand for them to do more to tackle Islamist extremism . More than 1,100 imams and Islamic leaders have been sent a Government letter urging them to show 'men of hate' that they have 'no place' in Britain's mosques 'or any place of worship'. In the letter, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and minister Lord Ahmad write: 'We must show our young people, who may be targeted, that extremists have nothing to offer them. 'We must show them that there are other ways to express disagreement – that their right to do so is dependent on the very freedoms that extremists seek to destroy.' The letter ends: 'We welcome your thoughts, ideas and initiatives on how to ensure that Islam's true message of peace triumphs over those who seek to divide our communities.' But some Muslims have expressed anger at the ministers' challenge to  show how Islam can be part of British identity. After the letter emerged this morning, the Muslim Council of Britain said it wanted Mr Pickles to clarify his request and asked if, like 'members of the far right', he was suggesting that Islam is inherently apart from British society. Deputy secretary-general Harun Khan said: 'We will be writing to Mr Eric Pickles to ask that he clarifies his request to Muslims to 'explain and demonstrate how faith in Islam can be part of British identity'. 'Is Mr Pickles seriously suggesting, as do members of the far right, that Muslims and Islam are inherently apart from British society?' The letter was sent by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles and minister Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon . Muslim commentator Mohammed Ansar went further, tweeting: 'Ridiculous and unhelpful intervention from the Communities Secretary, Eric Pickles this morning, by asking all Muslims to prove themselves. 'Government ministers, rather than ratcheting-up tensions and fuelling the fifth column narrative, should be looking to unite communities.' But asked about the criticism this morning, Mr Cameron insisted the letter was ‘reasonable, sensible and moderate’ and suggested that anyone opposing it ‘really has a problem’. Answering questions after a speech in Ipswich, the Prime Minister said: ‘I think it is absolutely right to write this letter, to say that we all have a responsibility to fight extremism. ‘Anyone who reads this letter - and I've read the letter - will see that what he is saying is that British Muslims make a great contribution to our country, that what is happening in terms of extremist terror has nothing to do with the true religion of Islam. ‘It's being perverted by a minority who have been radicalised. But everyone needs to help with dealing with this problem of radicalisation. ‘Anyone, frankly, reading this letter, who has a problem with it, I think really has a problem. I think it is the most reasonable, sensible, moderate letter that Eric could possibly have written. ‘Frankly, all of us have a responsibility to try to confront this radicalisation and make sure that we stop young people being drawn into this poisonous fanatical death cult that a very small minority of people have created.’ Finsbury Park Mosque in north London has attempted to tackle the extremists which once worshipped there . The letter was published after Mr Pickles and Home Secretary Theresa May held up signs reading 'I am Jewish' during a Board of Deputies of British Jews meeting yesterday . Mr Cameron's intervention came after Lord Ahmad had earlier rejected the criticism and insisted the letter was clear. He told Radio 4's Today programme: 'Within the letter there is an explicit paragraph that says British values are Muslim values. You can't be more explicit than that.' He added: 'Perhaps he wasn't clear in what the letter said but if you have seen a copy of the letter ... it has been pretty explicit that we want to work together with the Muslim community. 'This was about reassurance, it was about recognising, as Theresa May said only yesterday, that a Britain without Muslims, a Britain without Jews, Hindus, would not be the Britain we want to see.' The letter slams far-right groups like the English Defence League (pictured), but some Muslims say ministers appear to use the same language as such groups by suggesting British and Muslim identity is distinct . Mr Pickles has previously written to Muslim leaders to offer support after arson attacks on mosques by far-right groups, but the latest letter is the first time he has challenged them to tackle extremism. The letter emerged the day after the Metropolitan Police announced it is reviewing how to keep its officers safe amid fears of a terror plot to kidnap or kill a policeman or woman. Home Secretary Theresa May also promised to increase the Government's efforts to tackle the terrorist threat and a 'chilling' rise in anti-Semitism. Assalamu Alaikum, . We have recently seen terrible atrocities committed in Paris. Finding the right response to these events is a challenge for everyone. The hijacking of a great faith to justify such heinous crimes sickens us all. As Muslims around the world have made clear, such actions are an affront to Islam. And yet, amid the carnage, came a sign of hope – over three million people of all backgrounds, marching to defeat the gunmen and to protect our values: free speech, the rule of law, and democracy. We are proud of the reaction of British communities to this attack. Muslims from across the country have spoken out to say: not in our name. But there is more work to do. We must show our young people, who may be targeted, that extremists have nothing to offer them. We must show them that there are other ways to express disagreement: that their right to do so is dependent on the very freedoms that extremists seek to destroy. We must show them the multitude of statements of condemnation from British Muslims; show them these men of hate have no place in our mosques or any place of worship, and that they do not speak for Muslims in Britain or anywhere in the world. Let us assure you that the Government will do all we can to defeat the voices of division, but ultimately the challenges of integration and radicalisation cannot be solved from Whitehall alone. Strong community-based leadership at a local level is needed. You, as faith leaders, are in a unique position in our society. You have a precious opportunity, and an important responsibility: in explaining and demonstrating how faith in Islam can be part of British identity. We believe together we have an opportunity to demonstrate the true nature of British Islam today. There is a need to lay out more clearly than ever before what being a British Muslim means today: proud of your faith and proud of your country. We know that acts of extremism are not representative of Islam; but we need to show what is. British values are Muslim values. Like all faiths, Islam and its message of peace and unity makes our country a better and stronger place, and Britain would be diminished without its strong Muslim communities. Every day, mosques and other faith institutions across the country are providing help for those in need, and acting as a centre for our communities. It is these positive contributions that are the true messages of faith and it is these contributions that need to be promoted. We would also like to reassure you that in recent days we have met with police chiefs to make sure they are providing the support that mosques need, a concern that some of you have expressed in our recent discussions. We have also met with the Anti-Muslim Hatred Working Group to hear their concerns about responses to the recent attacks and what more can be done. Anyone experiencing violence should report it to the police online on the True Vision website or to TELL MAMA, a service to provide support specifically to Muslim victims of hatred. The vitriol espoused by the thugs of the English Defence League and Britain First is just as much an affront to British values as the teachings of preachers of hate. For organisations experiencing problems with such preachers, information about free legal advice is available from LawWorks at www.lawworks.org.uk/community-groups or the Bar Pro Bono Unit at www.barprobono.org.uk, and the Charity Commission has published a toolkit for charity leaders to help protect their organisations from abuse by extremists. We welcome your thoughts, ideas and initiatives on how to ensure that Islam's true message of peace triumphs over those who seek to divide our communities. Thank you for all the positive work you are doing, and we look forward to working with you further. We continue to appreciate all your insights. THE RT HON ERIC PICKLES MP .

"Young Tory activists are being encouraged to campaign ahead of the election with the promise of an Ibiza clubbing holiday with David and Samantha Cameron. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps is using the prospect of a week on the party island to persuade hundreds of volunteers to knock on more doors and deliver more leaflets. He has even told the Prime Minister about his plan designed to bolster numbers for the Team 2015 campaign drive, admitting that he is only 'slightly joking'. Scroll down for video . Tory volunteers are being promised the prospect of a holiday with David and Samantha Cameron in Ibiza, where the couple holidayed in 2011 . The Conservatives have invested heavily in the Team 2015, luring in young activists with the promise of curry, booze and like minded singletons. It has been a huge success, signing up hundreds of activists who pile into buses at weekends to descend on key target seats. After a busy day of campaigning, the party lays on dinner before they enjoy a night in the pubs and clubs of whichever town they find themselves in. Seeking to tap into the enthusiasm for clubbing, Mr Shapps has been dangling the prospect of a week with the Prime Minister and his wife for the hardest campaigner. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said he was only 'slightly joking' about offering the best campaigner a break with the PM . The Road Trips are his invention, and is part of a plan to make campaigning 'fun' and draw in a younger generation of Conservative supporters with the scheme modelled the group on the Olympics' games makers. He told The Times: 'We have team captains, T-shirts, road trips, conference calls with ministers. 'I always tell the prime minister the top prize for our No 1 worker is going on holiday with Sam and Dave to Ibiza next summer. He thinks I'm joking.' The Camerons spent a week in Ibiza in 2011 in a villa, where guests can enjoy in-house massages, a butler service, yoga and pilates. Last month Mr Cameron organised an Ibiza-style rave at his Chequers rural retreat as a belated 40th birthday for his wife. The Road Trip campaign drive has attracted hundreds of young people, and sparked romances. Mr Shapps predicts there will soon be a wedding . The star attraction was DJ Sarah HB, with (short for 'Hard Bitch'), who played to 200 guests including comedian Harry Enfield, actress Helena Bonham Carter and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. Mr Cameron was said to have been 'throwing shapes' in an open-necked collar and jeans, and dancing went on until 3am. Mr Shapps insisted that he has told the PM of his plan. 'I am actually slightly joking but I do tell the prime minister with a straight face.' The road trips have also become an unofficial dating agency for like-minded young Tories, Mr Shapps revealed. 'If you send people out with a clipboard on a rainy Tuesday night they will come back depressed and never come again, but if you make it fun, go out together, have a good time and go out for a drink afterwards people will come back.

"It is one of the most popular - albeit, controversial - reality television shows of all time. But now, former contestants have revealed the shocking 'truth' about NBC's 'The Biggest Loser'. Their revelations include claims that participants are kept prisoner in their rooms to stop them leaking storylines, have their laptops 'bugged' and are banned from calling home for six weeks. They also include  allegations that trainers take pleasure in seeing contestants in pain, constantly call them 'fat' and tell them if they don't lose weight, 'you're going to die before your children grow up.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Former 'The Biggest Loser' contestant Kai Hibbard (pictured at the start of the third series) said she is sad and angry that she bought into the hype of the show after being convinced by a friend to sign up . Transformation 'The whole f***ing show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in,' said Ms Hibbard, who dropped 121 pounds from 265 (left) to 144 (right) during the program, aired in 2006 . 'Not worth it': Ms Hibbard (pictured during Season Three's live finale) said the show's plot - to take morbidly obese people 'and work them out to the point where they vomit' - provoked moral and ethical questions . And one male contestant was even barred from visiting his critically-ill son if he wished to remain on the program, it is alleged. Instead, the man was only able to hear of his child's condition via phone. 'The Biggest Loser', which launched in 2004, pits obese competitors against each other in a televised race to lose the most weight. Around 200,000 people audition for it every season. Netting around $100million annually in advertisement sales, the program boasts an average weekly viewership of seven million people in a country where two-thirds of the population is overweight. But speaking to the New York Post, former contestant Kai Hibbard said she is sad and angry that she bought into the hype of the show after being convinced by a friend to sign up to its third series. 'The whole f***ing show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in,' said Ms Hibbard, whose 5ft 6ins frame was carrying 265 pounds when she joined the program in 2006. She added: 'There’s a moral and ethical question here when you take people who are morbidly obese and work them out to the point where they vomit, all because it makes for good TV.'

Above, Season 16 contestants . Intense: Scott Mitchell is pictured running (left) and cycling alongside other contestants (right) on the show . After she was selected for the show, Ms Hibbard said she was flown to Los Angeles, where a production assistant showed her to her room, took away her key card and told her not to leave. If she dared to exit the room, the hotel would immediately tell the show's producers, she claimed. Ms Hibbard and her fellow contestants were also apparently made to sign contracts giving away rights to their own story lines and banning them from speaking negatively about the show. Another participant, who wished to remain anonymous, said a production assistant took away her cellphone and laptop for 24 hours when she arrived at the hotel. She suspects they were then bugged. 'The camera light on my MacBook would sometimes come on when I hadn’t checked in,' she told The Post. 'It was like Big Brother was always watching you.' In following days, 14 of 50 finalists were taken to a place called 'the ranch', where they were forced to work out in seclusion, while the others were sent home until later in the program. During their time at 'the ranch', contestants were reportedly made to work out for dangerous lengths of time - up to eight hours straight - leaving their feet bleeding and causing some to collapse. Once, they were even driven to a racetrack and housed in individual horse stalls, before a bell sounded and they were forced to run neck-to-neck, picking up heavy sacks along the track. And despite their suffering, they were prevented from calling home for six weeks - and even then, they were only allowed to make a five-minute call that was monitored by producers, it is alleged. Shocking weight loss: Last year, 5ft 4ins winner Rachel Frederickson sparked nationwide concern after losing 155 pounds in just months on the show. Above, Ms Frederickson before (left) and after (right) her weight loss . Progress: Ms Frederickson, pictured being weighed on the show, later admitted working out four times a day . 'One of the contestants’ children became very ill and was in the ICU,' Ms Hibbard said.  'He was allowed to talk to his family, but he didn’t want to leave - the show would have been done with him.' The other former competitor said the trainers took a 'sick' satisfaction in seeing them collapse - a result of a mixture of intense exercise sessions and severe restrictions on their diets. Ms Hibbard added: 'They would say things to contestants like, ""You’re going die before your children grow up."" ""You’re going to die, just like your mother"" [and] ""We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin"".' She said the one production assistant had even encouraged a contestant to take up smoking - because it would apparently help her to lose weight, impressing the show's audience. Meanwhile, one trainer even told her not to drink electroylyte-balancing liquids prescribed by an on-site doctor because it would 'ruin her one last chance to save her life', she said. Exercise: At the start of the show, contestants are apparently made to sign contracts giving away rights to their own story lines and banning them from speaking negatively about the show. Above, Season Three . Struggle: Jen Widerstrom (l-r), Lori Harrigan-Mack and Scott Mitchell are pictured in show's latest series . Participants' extreme, daily workouts resulted in rapid weight losses - up to 30 pounds in just one week, compared to the 'safe' limit of two pounds per week, which is considered 'hard' to lose. Indeed, the first-ever 'The Biggest Loser' winner Ryan Benson, who dropped 122 pounds during the show (from 330 to 208), lost so much weight he reportedly started urinating blood when ended. In an interview with Time magazine, he also said he regained 32 pounds within five days of the program finishing - simply by drinking tap water. His weight now hovers at around 299 pounds. And last year, 5ft 4ins winner Rachel Frederickson sparked nationwide concern after losing 155 pounds in just months on the program. She later admitted to working out four times a day. Concern: Also last year, one of 'The Biggest Loser's' trainers, Jillian Michaels (pictured), quit for the show for the third time, telling People magazine she was 'deeply concerned' about the 'poor care of the contestants' Ms Hibbard revealed her own health was affected dramatically by the show; she reportedly suffered hair loss, irregular periods and lack of sleep both during and after her participation in the program. In total, Ms Hibbard dropped 121 pounds - taking her to just 144 pounds - throughout the program. Also last year, one of 'The Biggest Loser's' trainers, Jillian Michaels, quit for the show for the third time, telling People magazine she was 'deeply concerned' about the 'poor care of the contestants.' In a statement to the Post, NBC said its contestants are 'closely monitored and medically supervised', and cited the successful health transformations of more than 300 contestants.

"A fifth of mothers who gave birth in 2013 were older than their child's father, a new study revealed today. The Office for National Statistics examined the age gap of parents in the most recent year available. It shows how the gap is wider among unmarried couples, lesbian couples and those where at least one partner was born outside the UK. In 2013, one in five mothers was older than the father of their child, the Office for National Statistics found . Almost 12 per cent of couples who had a baby were the same age, but in 7 per cent of births the father was more than 10 years older . There were almost 700,00 births in 2013. In 19.9 per cent of births the mother was older than the father. In 7 per cent of cases, the man was was more than 10 years older. By contrast, 0.48 per cent, around 3,100 births, the mother was more 10 years older than the father. Amongs married couples the gap was four years on average, compared to 4.2 years among parents who had not tied the knot. However, the average gap of 4.2 years was the same among parents who lived together and those who lived apart. For babies whose parents were both born in the UK, the gap was just 3.7 years, rising to 4.6 years where one parent was born abroad. The average age gap of lesvian couples was 4.8 years, higher than 4.1 years for other parents. It is the first time the ONS has examined the age gaps of the nation's parents. Oliver Dormon, senior research officer at the ONS, said: 'We can see that men are older than women and the gap tens to be fairly small. 'But there is a huge chunk, of 7 per cent, where the father is more than 10 years older.' He said wider age gaps, especially among non-UK born parents, could be the result of cultural differences. 'There are definitely some cultures in which a younger bride is desirable and where a bride the same age or even older is not what you want at all.'","19.9% of mothers were older than the father in 2013, new study shows .

"Kenyan police today tear-gassed schoolchildren protesting against a politician's alleged move to seize their playground and turn it into a car park. Pupils from Langata Road Primary School in Nairobi were at the front line of protesters pulling down a wall thrown up around their playground after it was acquired by a private developer. At least 10 children were taken to hospital with injuries, including tear gas exposure to their eyes, Bloomberg reported citing local MP Kenneth Okoth. Tonight Nairobi's police chief said he had suspended the officer in charge of the protest. Scroll down for videos . Playground politics: Schoolchildren push the fence to enter a playground during a protest against alleged land grabbing at Langata Road Primary School in Nairobi. Activists, joined by pupils, brought down the perimeter walls claiming that the playground belongs to the school . Smash it down: The impassioned young pupils beat the metal fence blocking access to their playground with rocks . Dislikes authority: The pupils and activists pulled down a wall thrown up around their playground by the private developer . Fight the power: The view from above shows how riot police fortified the gates to the playground with heavy blocks . Another brick in the wall: Students and activists push down the wall that was put up around the playground over the Christmas holidays . Under attack: A tear gas canister spews noxious, burning fumes in the midst of the children as police move in . Save the children: A man picks up a tear gas canister in an effort to move it away from the crowd of schoolchildren it was lobbed at . Bullyboy tactics: The children flee alongside activists and journalists after police lobbed tear gas at them to clear the area . In such an incident tear gas should not have been used because the protests were not violent, acting police chief Samuel Arachi said. He said five people have been arrested; three for vandalism and two for incitement. 'We will never allow officers to use force not only on any citizen more so on children whether in a demonstration or otherwise,' he said. Kenyan human rights activist Boniface Mwangi told the Associated Press that the developer on whose orders the playground was snatched was a powerful politician. 'The governor, the senator and other government officials are all scared of the politician, they cannot do anything to stop the playground from the being taken,' Mr Mwangi said. Dozens of pupils aged from six to 13 joined in the protest, carrying placards proclaiming 'Land grabbing is terror against children', 'Kenya at 51 it's about our future', and 'Kenya: the land of the shameless grabbers'. Together with adults who were present, the boys and girls pulled open tall metal gates which had blocked access to their school playground before running into the space. Once inside they pushed down at least one other wall put up to cordon off the site. About 40 police officers in riot gear then faced off with the children before hurling tear gas canisters into their midst. Works democratically with peers: Delighted schoolchildren  run into the playground after breaking the wall illegally erected around it . Works well with friends: The youngsters, who were aged from six to 13 years old, had stormed their former playground holding placards aloft after smashing down walls and forcing open a tall metal gate with the help of adult activists .

Doesn't listen to instructions: Children stand on the half-demolished wall with their placards as a riot policeman stands before them . Uses vivid language when writing: Schoolboys face off against a dog handler after riot police moved in to clear them away . Children screamed as police officers in riot gear and waving truncheons pushed them back, some panicking as they sought water to wash their burning eyes. Television footage showed children, some being carried away, writhing in pain, sobbing and gasping for breath because of the tear-gas. Dozens of children were caught in the choking clouds of tear gas before being forced to shelter on a pedestrian bridge over the main road to escape the noxious fumes. Police officers later brought dogs to the playground. One policeman was pictured holding a tear-gas launcher in one hand and a truncheon in the other, as blood streamed down his face after he was hit in the face with a rock. Excitement: Children rush past riot police as they seize control of the playground which had been snatched by developers . Rush: The children had returned to school for the first day back since Christmas and found their playground walled off . Future freedom fighters: With the help of activists they snatched back control of the site until police moved in with tear gas . Police spokesman Masoud Mwinyi was not available for comment. A senior police officer at the demonstration, Mwangi Kuria, told Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper that officers had been deployed to 'safeguard the property', adding that rocks had been thrown at his men. 'This is disputed land, but they should not use the children,' the policeman was quoted as saying. Two activists were detained by police, Kenyan media said. Macharia Njeru, chairman of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, said the incident would be investigated. 'Teargassing children is inexcusable,' he said. The incident has sparked outrage in Kenya and on social media where critics have been commenting on it under the hashtags 'OccupyPlayGround' and 'LangataPrimary'. Opposition leader Raila Odinga accused the police of 'brutality beyond words' and the developer of 'greed beyond description'. 'It is difficult to believe that police can actually deploy against primary school children and lob tear gas at them to defend a land grabber,' Mr Odinga said. 'This image of a nation determined to steal forcefully from its own children cannot be what we aspire to. It cannot be the legacy we want to bequeath the children.' Confident when faced with challenges: Schoolchildren face off against a riot police officer carrying a long stick . But accepts help graciously: Activist Boniface Mwangi joins the schoolchildren and the policeman is forced to retreat . And stay away! The children wave sticks at the policeman in military fatigues, as Mr Mwangi continues pointing him away from the site . Hmm, surely not called for? A police officer fires tear gas towards the crowd of children inside the playground during the protest .

Comeuppance: What looks like the same police officer is seen with blood streaming down his face after he is hit with a rock . And for the cows, life goes on as normal: Cattle walk amidst teargas fired by riot police during the protest . The demonstration came as reports emerged in local media that Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko had filed a court action to try to reclaim the playground. Mr Sonko told The Star that he had instructed lawyers to seek a court order to compel the developer to return the land to the school. Opposition politician Eliud Owalo said last week that the playground had been grabbed to construct a parking lot for the politician's hotel adjacent to the school. According to the organisers of today's demonstration the playground, which had been owned by the school since 1972, was fenced off over the Christmas holidays by a 'group of professional land grabbers' linked to a senior politician. 'Langata Road Primary School playground has been grabbed by a group of known professional land grabbers acting on behalf of a very senior politician in the (ruling coalition) Jubilee government', said activists in a statement .","Pupils from Langata Road Primary School were among crowd protesting playground wall .

"She was cast as the 14-year-old daughter of Sarah Platt in Coronation Street after producers were tricked into believing she was 19-years-old. But it has emerged that actress Katie Redford is 25 – making her 11 years older than her character and just two years younger than her on-screen mother, played by Tina O'Brien. The actress has now been fired and ITV is re-casting the role of 'tearaway teenager' Bethany who will be arriving unannounced in Weatherfield from her home in Milan in the spring. Scroll down for video . Katie Redford, 25, (left) was cast in Coronation Street as the 14-year-old daughter of Sarah Platt, played by Tina O'Brien, who left the show in 2007 (pictured) and will be returning in spring . Soap fans unearthed a variety of evidence which reveals the actress's real age after ITV announced that  'Nottingham-born Katie, 19' would be playing the young character. A former online CV for the actress listed her date of birth as 2 March 1989 and her Twitter username has changed from 'katieredford89' to 'Katieredfordtlc'. Public records also show that Ms Redford's date of birth is 2 March 1989 - meaning she would be 12 years older than the character in two months time. Fan Dave Harrison said: 'On her Twitter account there were pictures of the actress at her 25th birthday last year.' A former online CV for the actress listed her date of birth as 2 March 1989 and her Twitter username has changed from 'katieredford89' to 'Katieredfordtlc' Cal tweeted: 'Why are all the press releases for the new Bethany casting saying Katie Redford is 19? She's 25 as she was born in 1989. #Corrie' Megan said: 'It's hilarious how ITV are desperately trying to remove all traces of Katie Redford's real age from the internet.' The actress's agent Jo McLintock revealed that ITV was not aware of her age and said Ms Redford was 'understandably' upset today. She said: 'Katie went in there acting as a young actress with a playing age of 16-20. ITV did not know her age. We were at fault as we let her go in there without the producers knowing her age. 'She is being re-cast and casting was adamant that they would not be using us again unfortunately. Ms Redford (pictured) starred in short film Turn Your Bloody Phone Off: American Blood as Janet . The young actress has appeared in comedy YouTube series 2 Girls 1 Flat (left) with Sarah Dyas . 'She is a brilliant young actress and very talented. We ill-advised her, but she just went in there and acted much younger than her age. 'Understandably she is very upset today.' Ms Redford trained with The National Youth Theatre and was nominated for Best Actress in award winning film, Pitfall at The Underwire Film Festival. The character Bethany was last seen in 2007 when she moved to Italy with her mother who had landed a job working for Gail Platt's half brother Stephen Reid in Milan. She was previously played by three child actors - Mia Cookson and twins Amy and Emily Walton. Producer Stuart Blackburn said: 'Full of mischief and with a real lust for life Bethany is an unpredictable force of nature who will bring joy and chaos in equal measure, turning their household upside down. 'Life has just got a lot more interesting for The Platts and anyone who crosses Bethany's path.' A spokesman for ITV said: 'Coronation Street have taken the decision to recast the part of Bethany Platt.' It is thought that the programme already has someone in mind for the role.

"Kim Kardashian's famous curves may adorn glossy magazine covers today but that would not have always been the case. Rewind 100 years and the perfect female figure was an altogether different story. Inspired by Greatist, FEMAIL has taken a look back over the past few generations to examine exactly how the female ideals have changed. Scroll down for video . FEMAIL has taken a look back over the past few generations to examine exactly how the female ideals have changed, beginning with the 1910s Gibson Girl ideal inspired by the illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson . From the Gibson Girl of the early 1900s to the Bootylicious Beyonce of today - via Heroin chic Kate Moss - just how much the most desired shape of the day has changed over the years may surprise you. In 1910, it was all about the Gibson Girl look: the pouty, curvy woman who personified beauty portrayed by the  illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson. Her physique was tall and slender but with a buxom bosom and large hips; essentially an 'S' shaped body achieved by wearing a super-cinched corset. By 1920, the flapper girl was well in fashion and a trim figure was all the rage . The housewife did not need a personal trainer to keep the surplus pounds at bay. In a world before vacuum cleaners and washing machines, housework kept her - and her legs - trim for her short-hemmed dresses . By 1920, the flapper girl was well in fashion. Times were hard for the Twenties flapper girl. A quarter of a century before the creation of the egalitarian Welfare State, poverty meant many British adults and children never had enough to eat. The housewife did not need a personal trainer to keep the surplus pounds at bay. In a world before vacuum cleaners and washing machines, housework kept her trim. But while the majority of women had no problem keeping slim, it was the Twenties which saw the invention of dieting. Upper-class women who ate a richer diet and exercised less bought the new women's magazines which featured weight-loss diets designed to give you that fashionable, streamlined figure that worked so well with the iconic flapper dress. Hemlines fell in 1930 and curves seeped their way back into fashion . With her curvier figure, Jean Harlow was the sex symbol of the 1930s . Hemlines fell in 1930, when morale was low following the stock market crash. Curves seeped their way back into fashion and women dared to bare their shoulders. This slightly more voluptuous look was embraced by the media, which lead nicely into the screen queen era of the 1940s. The Forties woman was one inch larger all round than the Flapper simply because she was better nourished. The Forties laid the foundation for women becoming taller as the Government decreed that every child was entitled to one-third of a pint of milk a day, so promoting the growth of strong bones. This continued in schools until Margaret Thatcher scrapped it in the 1970s. With their men off fighting, fashion changed in the Forties and the curvy feminine look to cheer returning heroes became the order of the day . Again, it was their highly energetic lifestyle that kept Forties women slim. There was no petrol for cars, and people cycled or walked for miles every day. Girls thought little of walking ten miles home after a Saturday night dance. With their men off fighting, fashion changed. The curvy feminine look to cheer returning heroes became the order of the day, with fitted suits and belted flowery dresses to show off the waist, and the Flapper's flattening bodice giving way to the circle-stitched bra. Those ideals heightened in the Fifties, when weight gain tablets were promoted in magazines to help women fill out their curves. In the Fifties, weight-gain tablets were promoted in magazines to help women fill out their curves . This was a stark contrast to the 1960s, which ushered in a more much gaunt figure popularised by supermodels such as Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton. Dresses shrunk to suit the favoured petite frame and women craved smaller busts and tinier hips. Many women embarked on diets to fulfill their goals and Weight Watchers was  founded - and welcomed - in 1963. Back came the curves in 1970 - the era of the long, lean dancing queen. Farrah Fawcett was the poster girl of this decade and waspish frames were on their way out. In the 1960s, dresses shrunk to suit the favoured petite frame as sported by Twiggy .

The typical 70s look was embraced by (L-R) Kate Jackons, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith . By the time the Eighties came along, the British woman was well on the way to an irretrievable pear-shape, with her hips measuring two inches more than her bust. Women idolised the 'supermodels' of the era - including leggy Elle MacPherson, Naomi Campbell, and Linda Evangelist. It was, of course, in the Eighties that exercise classes became fashionable, with women looking to Jane Fonda in a bid to achieve lithe, muscular bodies. Alas, despite huge numbers of videos sold and classes attended, the inches continued to increase. By the Eighties, the British woman was  on the way to a healthy figure with Elle MacPherson being the ideal . Women idolised the 'supermodels' of the era in the Eightees - including leggy Elle MacPherson, who became widely known as 'The Body' Then came the 1990s - and Kate Moss. The supermodel and pin-up of her time, became known as 'the waif' and she and fellow catwalk queens such as Jodie Kidd popularised the 'heroin chic' look, which was gaunt with hollow eyes. The look, thankfully, came to an end thanks to Gisele Bundchen, who promoted a healthy lifestyle and washboard abs. Britney Spears also jumped on the bandwagon and shocked the world when she revealed she completes 600 sit-ups a day to achieve her toned tummy.

"Dubbed by experts as Blue Monday, today is officially the most depressing day of the year. Post-Christmas debt, bad weather and failing New Year's resolutions are all factors in making this innocent Monday in January, the worst in the calendar. But if you don't want to be sucked into the sadness, here are some instant happiness tricks that psychologists and scientists say will lift your spirits. Breathing, laughing, eating and exercising can all boost happiness levels . Plug in your headphones . Scientists at the University of Missouri recently found that people can boost their mood by simply listening to upbeat music. In the study, participants improved their mood after being told to try to do so, but they only succeeded when they listened to the upbeat music of Copland, as opposed to the sadder tunes of Stravinsky. If Stravinsky isn't your thing, an online survey my metrolyrics.com found Wham!'s Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' was considered the happiest song of all time. And, with lyrics including, 'You take the grey skies out of my way. You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day' we have to agree. Get sweaty for 20 minutes . People often use the terms 'endorphin rush' or 'runner's high' to explain the mood lift elicited by exercise. But rather than a sudden burst of euphoria, research has found  a mere 20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise can produce more subtle mood benefits that last as long as 12 hours. That's according to John Ratey, MD, author of Spark: The Revolutionary New Science Of Exercise And The Brain, who puts this happiness effect down to a substances called BDNF. BDNF rises during exercise, prompting neural growth and repairing damage caused by ongoing stress and depression. 'BDNF is like Miracle-Gro for your brain,' explains Dr Ratey. Stress out the body and help de-stresses  the mind. You can boost your mood simply by listening to upbeat music . Eat something fishy . Eating oily, fatty fish (salmon, tuna, sardines, rainbow trout) and mussels will give you omega-3s - a key mood-boosting nutrient and one our bodies don't produce naturally. Omega-3s alter brain chemicals linked with mood - specifically dopamine and serotonin. Low levels of serotonin are linked with depression and aggression, while dopamine is a happy chemical that the brain releases in response to pleasurable experiences. You may not find eating oily fish pleasurable, but your brain will. Breathe, like this... Breathe in through the nose, hold until it feels slightly uncomfortable and then slowly breathe out. 'Five of those breaths will even out your neurochemistry and make you feel good,' explains Linda Blair, clinical psychologist and author of mindfulness bible 'Key to Calm'. 'When you breathe through the nose rather than the mouth you automatically take in the right amount of oxygen, because it restricts the amount of air you inhale. Breathe in through the nose, hold until it feels slightly uncomfortable and then slowly breathe out for an instant 'feel good' boost . 'When you take in too much air, you increase oxygen too much and become hyper alert, which isn't ""feel good"",' she says. 'Holding the breath gives us the message to ourselves that we're in control and breathing out through the mouth gets rid of excess gases in the body. 'Ideally we want a balance of gases so we feel an equilibrium.' We should in fact be breathing like this at all times, says Linda, but five concentrated breaths is enough to give us an instant boost. Have a (fake) laugh . When we laugh, our body relaxes and feel-good endorphins are released into the blood stream. Nothing to chuckle about on Blue Monday? Luckily the body can't distinguish between real and fake laughter. So faking it has the same beneficial effect. It was Dr William F Fry, a psychiatrist at Stanford University who first began to examine the physiological effects of laughter in the late 1960s and is considered the father of 'gelotology' (the science of laughter). He found that laughter, real or fake, provides good physical exercise and increases the body's production of endorphins. Dr Madan Kataria set up the first laughter club in Mumbai in 1995 and there are now more than 5,000 laughter clubs worldwide. But there's no need for any expert tuition. Fake a laugh and the endorphins will come rushing. Sex with a partner you care about tops the list of oxytocin releasing activities . Now find someone to smile at . Faking a smile or laughter gives you a small boost but smiling warmly at a stranger and eliciting a smile back makes you feel connected and safe. 'The best way to for us to feel good is to feels safe - and the only way we feel safe is to feel connected,' says Linda Blair. 'We have boosts of cortisol when we're feeling down,' says Linda Blair. 'When you feel safe again the cortisol levels down.' She adds: 'Getting a warm response back from a stranger  is so powerful.' End the day on a high . It might be too late to start the day in a good mood, but there's one way to guarantee it finishes on a high. When both men and women orgasm, oxytocin is released, which is the brain chemical that makes us experience feelings of happiness. Oxytocin has also been found to calm fears and anxiety and increase trust and contentment. Positive interaction with friends and family increases the chemical somewhat too, as does any sexual activity. But sex with a partner you care about tops the list of oxytocin releasing activities.","Debt,  weather and failing New Year's resolutions  all contributing factors .

"American model Sean O'Pry is continuing to make waves this side of the pond thanks to his latest smouldering campaign for Next. The 25-year-old from Kennesaw, Georgia, who is the world's top earning male model according to Forbes, is back for a third season with the High Street label. Dressed in stylish Spring '15 looks, he's pictured strolling down the palm tree-lined streets of LA, on the beach and in a studio. Scroll down for video . Sean is pictured strolling down the palm-tree lined streets of LA in Next suits coming in at £40 for trousers and £60 for a jacket . Next's latest menswear range features sharp, affordable tailoring, casual weekend jumpers and chinos, plus street-wear parkas and shoes. The accomplished star is modelling the brand's third seasonal range, after making headlines with the SS14 and AW14 styles. He recently worked closely with pop princess Taylor Swift in her video for her number one hit, Blank Space. In the clip, he plays Taylor's love interest and they share a steamy kiss. And his portrayal of her lover won him a whole new fan base, as well as worldwide recognition. Despite getting close to the singer Sean's reportedly dating Australian Home and Away actress, Jessica McNamee, 28. 'They met through mutual friends during the summer. She fell for him hard,' a source has told magazine US Weekly. 'It's going well, everybody likes him. He has a good sense of humor on top of those looks,' the insider is also quoted saying. The High Street label is certainly a more accessible brand for Sean, and his work with it has exposed him to a wider audience . However, Sean's rep has denied the genetically blessed pair are an item, saying the reports are 'not true' and that they 'are just good friends'. Last month, when asked about his relationship status and if he was single, the smouldering music video star told E! News: 'I plead the Fifth. The less people know the better.' He also appeared in Madonna's 2012 video for Girl Gone Wild, but the hunk is better known for his role as in Taylor's film clip for Blank Space, which received more than 100 million views on YouTube.

He has been hard at work lever since, landing major ad campaigns for high end designers like Versace, D&G, Marc Jacobs, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Armani, Ralph Lauren, Jil Sander and Viktor & Rolf. Branching out into the British High Street could be a smart move on behalf of Sean's management. David Gandy went from D&G to M&S, and he's now a household name who models and designs for the trusted store.

"As lithe male models sashayed their way down the Gucci runway at Milan Fashion Week Men's this afternoon you'd be mistaken for thinking they'd showed up for the wrong show. For this season the fashion house clearly wants the gentleman in your life to explore his feminine side with outfits including  pussybow blouses, lace tops and floral patterned vests. These items, worn with low slung, wide legged trousers, seemed to be the mainstay of the company's autumn/winter 2015 collection, with many models also sporting a pair of the Italian brand's classic leather loafers. The stars of Gucci's fashion show in Milan wore feminine- looking clothing such as a frilled shirt (left) and pussybow blouse (right) This is not the first time Gucci has decided to go for feminine prints for men. The label's spring/summer 2014 collection was made up of floral suits and shirts, with clashing patterns on the top and bottom. The models it seemed too had been chosen with an androgynous look in mind with soft features and unstyled hair. Perhaps even more controversial than the clothes themselves was the fact that some of the models were wearing sandals with socks - thought to be one of the all time fashion no-nos. These out-there designs follow London Collections: Men where the models were dressed in all manner of bizarre get up. At the Agi & Sam show they had their faces adorned with Lego, with some of the masks so big the models could barely see in front of them. At the Gucci show today  one gentleman wore a floral vest with a neck tie detail (left) another wore his pussy bow blouse with a beret (right) Then at the house of Christopher Shannon the models were photographed coming down the runway with plastic bags on their heads and others had the same emblazoned on their jumpers. Then at the DSquared2 show and Salvatore Ferragamo in Milan it was all about giant winter warmers. While DSquared controversially showed giant fur hats and huge lined coats, Ferragamo had models walk down the runway in giant scarfs. Milan men's fashion week started in earnest on Friday with brands showing off the AW15 ranges. Stars such as Tinie Tempah, Paris Hilton and Jamie Campbell Bower are all in town to see the shows. This red lace number - worn with socks and sandals and dark orange trousers - would be just as at home in a woman's wardrobe .

"Created: . 11:32 EST, 25 February 2014 . A former Tory has been arrested after allegedly biting the founder of Fathers 4 Justice and his landlord while trying to serve him with legal papers. Adrian Yalland, 44, was held on suspicion of assault after apparently biting Matt O'Connor, 46, and his landlord in Stockbridge, Hampshire. Mr Yalland claims he was trying to serve the Fathers 4 Justice campaign director with a libel claim when the incident happened. Scroll down for video . Row: Adrian Yalland claimed that he was trying to serve Matt O'Connor with legal papers when they became involved in a confrontation. Mr O'Connor said he had called the police and Mr Yalland is shown as he replied ""Good, good!"". The Westminster lobbyist is the former . executive vice-president of political PR company Chelgate and the . director of pro-life campaign group Right To Know. Mr O'Connor, who lives with his wife Nadine and four children, claimed that the former prospective Conservative candidate forced the electric gates outside his home when he went to deliver the legal papers. Once Mr Yalland had left the property he attempted to take a photograph of it as proof that he had served his legal papers. He then became involved in an apparent scrap with Mr O'Connor and his landlord. Mr O'Connor claimed that he was 'punched' by the former Tory before both he and the landlord were bitten. Mr Yalland said the two men tried to snatch his mobile phone and said he only reacted proportionately in self-defence after being 'punched' and 'pinned down'. He also claims Mr O'Connor was constantly advancing towards him throughout the encounter. This is the injury Mr Yalland admitted causing Mr O'Connor's landlord in self-defense. Mr Yalland was not subsequently charged. Scuffle: Mr O'Connor also claims he suffers this injury to his thumb during the confrontation in Hampshire . Alleged victim: Mr O'Connor, who lives with his wife Nadine and four children, claimed Mr Yalland forced the electric gates outside his home when he went to deliver the legal papers . Police arrived at the scene and arrested the 44-year-old who is understood to have been in a long-running dispute with Mr O'Connor. Officers are examining video footage of the incident recorded by the O'Connors. Mrs O’Connor said: 'He took pictures of our home and eight year-old son and tried to speak to him before he was removed from the premises. 'At this point the police were called. Mr Yalland said 'there are two sides to every story - especially this one'. He claimed that the two men had attempted to steal his mobile phone. Row: Adrian Yalland, 44, was held on suspicion of assault after apparently biting Matt O'Connor, 46, and his landlord in Stockbridge, Hampshire . Scene: Mr Yalland was arrested on Stockbridge High Street after the confrontation . The incident unfolded in the small town of Stockbridge in Hampshire . In a statement issued to the media, he added: 'After having been pushed to the floor, I was punched in the back of the head by a second individual, and had a hand forced over my face, whilst I believe a second attempt was made to steal my phone. 'Whilst pinned down, and fearing further attack, I acted proportionately, in self defence, and only to allow me to escape – which I did immediately. The only person punched was me. 'I am pleased a witness came forward to confirm my version of events, and I therefore look forward to the police concluding their investigations with interest.' A spokesman for Hampshire Police confirmed that a 44-year-old man was arrested. 'Police were called at 4.10pm on Thursday February 20 following a report of a dispute outside an address in Stockbridge,' he said. 'A 56-year-old man and a 46-year-old man both from Stockbridge suffered minor injuries. 'A 44-year-old man from Marchwood was arrested on suspicion of assault. He has been bailed pending further enquiries until March 27.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Adrian Yalland, 44, held on suspicion of assaulting Matt O'Connor .

"Comedian Al Murray has boasted that he could drink ‘Nigel Farage under the table, as he steps up his election campaign against the Ukip leader. The ‘Pub Landlord’ announced last week that he will stand against Mr Farage at the next election, potentially taking crucial votes off the Ukip leader in his bid to unseat the Tories. He has now unveiled a series of comedy policies for his newly-formed political party ‘FUKP’ – the Free United Kingdom Party – including renaming benefits ‘scrounge credits’, turning off the internet at the weekend and making the rock band Queen play the national anthem ‘at all state occasions’. Scroll down for video . The 'Pub Landlord' said he will stand in Thanet South, Kent, for his newly-formed Free United Kingdom Party . CURRENCY . The pound will be revalued at £1.10, so it will now be worth 10p more. NHS . If you come to A&E and it's neither an accident nor an emergency, then you will be sent to a random hospital department to be practised on. FOREIGN POLICY . Germany has been too quiet for too long. Just saying. IMMIGRATION . The reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. EUROPE . Greece to be bought and operated by Kent County Council. Couldn't be worse. Someone to do the bins at least. LAW AND ORDER . Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. Murray will stand in Thanet South, Kent - the seat targeted by Mr Farage in his bid to finally enter Parliament. Explaining his decision to stand last week, the Oxford-educated  comic said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions.' He pledged to 'lock up the unemployed', run Greece from Kent County Council and revalue the pound at £1.10 so it will be 'worth 10p more'. But today Murray has gone further - promising nationalise all pubs and make it illegal to call casseroles with pastry lids ‘pies’. Asked who would win in a three-way lager-off – you, William Hague or Nigel Farage? – he said: ‘These men are amateurs.' He added: 'The drinking itself wouldn’t be a challenge – in fact, I’d say there isn’t a table in the land I couldn’t drink them under. ‘No, it’s the company that would be an issue. You’d have Farage pretending he’s not a public-school stockbroker and actually some sort of man of the people – and what sort of muppet pretends to be someone they’re not, eh? ‘I ask you. And then Hague droning on and on about the time he met Angelina Jolie. No thanks.’ Asked about protecting people from ‘snooping’ security agencies, he added: ‘Personally, I think it would be good for the country if we turned off the internet at 5pm on Friday and only turned it back on on Monday morning. ‘There would be no more drunk tweeting, no more vengeful emails to the ex, impulse purchases on Amazon (or whatever right-on site you lot use at the Guardian), no more having to use In Private Browsing or whatever it’s called as you cry lonely tears in your bedsit.’ Murray also promised to make rock band Queen ‘play the national anthem at all state occasions’ and ‘change the name of benefits to Scrounge Credits’. In a video posted online he explained: 'Let it be known that like many of the Parliamentary hopefuls in the forthcoming election, I have no idea where South Thanet is - but did that stop Margaret Thatcher from saving the Falkland Islands? No.' Murray, 46, is standing in a constituency which the Conservative Party won from Labour at the previous election in 2010. It is already the focus of huge attention due to Mr Farage's decision to stand there as UKIP experiences a surge of support and now has two Parliamentary seats. His party took 5.5 per cent of the votes in the seat five years ago. The Pub Landlord took a dig at Mr Farage, explaining his decision to stand. He said: 'It seem to me that the UK is ready for a bloke waving a pint around, offering common sense solutions' Al Murray will stand for Parliament for the Free United Kingdom Party (logo, above) His decision to stand comes two years after fellow comic Simon Brodkin - known for his character Lee Nelson - handed in nomination papers to stand in a by-election at South Shields, for David Miliband's former seat. He went on to withdraw later the same day. Other proposals include his pledge on law and order: 'Unemployment causes crime: I propose to lock up the unemployed. Common sense.' And on the hot topic of immigration, he says: 'Of course the reason they are coming here is because this is the greatest country in the world. The only way to stop them is for a government to change that and make things a whole lot worse. Look no further. 'However, in the meantime, we brick up the Channel Tunnel. With British bricks. Probably have to get some Poles in to do it. Common sense.' In his online address, Murray explains: 'The reason I'm standing is because the system is broken, we all know it is. You hear people saying 'you shouldn't vote'. Well you should vote boys and girls, you should vote for me.' He also promises '1p a pint', although 'crisps will remain at the current price'. The party's logo features an upturned pound sign, in a clear parody of the UKIP symbol. Mr Farage's team appeared unconcerned about the threat posed by The Pub Landlord. A spokesman for the Ukip leader said: 'At last, serious competition in the constituency.' Age: 46 . Born: Stewkley, Buckinghamshire .

"This is the bruised face of a prostitute who claims that she was assaulted by a leading economist after the pair smoked crack together. Professor Douglas McWilliams, executive chairman of influential City think-tank the Centre for Economic and Business Research, allegedly attacked Beverly Shearon at her flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Ms Shearon reportedly called police after she was left with a black eye and an injury to her hand, claiming McWilliams had 'flipped out' when a neighbour arrived at the one-bedroom flat. In the first image of the 47-year-old's injuries dark bruising to her right eye is clearly visible. This is the first picture of Beverley Shearon's bruised face, pictured left, after she claims she was assaulted by Professor Douglas McWilliams. Ms Shearon claims the pair smoked crack together . Accused: Douglas McWilliams outside his London home today. He was reportedly questioned under caution over claims he assaulted Beverley Shearon after the pair smoked crack together . She claims the pair had smoked crack cocaine together, and she had performed a sex act on the married 63-year-old when he visited her unannounced on New Year's Eve. He reportedly left before police arrived, but was later questioned under caution by officers. 'I didn't want him to come in really, but because he was there and I was thinking of all the neighbours, I said OK, come in,' said Ms Shearon, who was trying to quit her drug habit. 'I've told him that the last four times I've seen him, that I don't want to do that any more. 'He said: 'Oh come on, it's New Year's Eve, have one more smoke for me.' 'I was weak and I did.' Ms Shearon, who calls McWilliams 'Posh Rob', said his mood changed suddenly when a neighbour called in to wish her a Happy New Year. She alleged McWilliams, who she said had been a regular visitor to her home in the past year, had then attacked her in front of the well-wisher, before leaving the flat. 'He smashed me so aggressively my head hit the wall really hard. He was on top of me, I couldn't breathe. I was trying to get him off, I was shouting: 'Help me, help me!' Her neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I was paralysed, I was just in shock and couldn't believe my eyes. I feel awful that I didn't step in to help her, but I shouted, 'Call the police', and that spooked him and he ran off, but not before he got a few more punches in.' Ms Shearon said that she first met McWilliams in Camden Town after visiting a client and had known him for six years. Ms Shearon said McWilliams changed his behaviour when a neighbour arrived at her home in St Albans (above) to wish her a Happy New Year . 'I first met him in Camden Town, I was walking along, I'd been to see a client and he was obviously kerb crawling because he pulled up and asked me for crack. 'He took me to a hotel room that he'd already booked. A horrible dingy place. I gave him my phone number and he started seeing me. He'd come and pick me up and take me to a hotel every month. We'd binge and then he'd drop me off at the nearest train station, usually Kentish Town. Miss Shearon said he'd come to see her in an Audi TT, a Jaguar and a blue Aston Martin. 'I thought I'd got rid of him, I was trying to come clean. But a few months ago he turned up out of the blue, and he was influencing me to take crack and was saying I should get heroin. He is an evil man. 'He'd come round for hours and sometimes I'd have to pretend I had a phone call to get him to leave. 'Sometimes he comes to my house and I just turn the lights off and keep quiet in the hope that he'll think I'm not in. 'He'd spend £1,000 on crack in one go. He'd bring other prostitutes around here that he'd picked up in Kings Cross. 'He called himself Rob and told me he was an advisor for British Telecom, and he'd say things like: 'I'm waiting for this deal to come through, that'll be a nice £50,000 for me.' 'Once he told me he had to rearrange because he had to be in the House of Commons. Police arrived at the one-bedroom property and are said to have taken photographs of her injuries . 'He never wore a wedding ring, but I'd heard him on the phone to his wife lying and saying his car had broken down. 'I could hear her on the other end of the line saying: 'Just come home darling.' 'I was thinking, you scumbag.' 'I told him I knew his real identity, but I told him he could trust me, because I've got other clients, barristers and a vicar for example, people I've known for years. You have to be discreet. 'But when he did this to me, I was shaken up. ‘I think more women and girls might come forward. He hit me like it was nothing. I’m terrified he’s going to come round or send someone round to hurt me. ‘He’s the most horrible man I’ve ever met. He’s a raging crackhead, he really is.' 'Police are investigating an ABH assault which is alleged to have occurred at an address in St Albans at around 5pm on Wednesday, December 31st,' a Hertfordshire Police spokesman told MailOnline. 'A woman reported she had been assaulted, she suffered an injury to her hand and bruising to her face. 'A 63-year-old man from London has been interviewed under caution and investigations are on-going at this time. No drug offences are being investigated.' McWilliams has not commented on the claims. A CEBR spokesman told MailOnline the claims involving McWilliams were 'not a matter' for the think-tank. A representative of McWilliams told The Sun he had been unable to contact the economist since Friday evening. 'I am aware he has denied this lady's allegation,' he said. Former Professor of Commerce at Gresham College McWilliams is described on the CEBR website as 'one of the most widely quoted economists'. On Christmas Day, McWilliams tweeted a link to a story about his predictions regarding the British economy, writing: 'Prostitution and illegal drugs help UK overtake France in global wealth league.' He set up the think-tank in 1992 having previously served as Chief Economic Adviser to the Confederation of British Industry and Chief Economist for IBM UK. The think-tank's website states: 'CEBR's clients are mainly public, private, government, professional bodies and third sector organisations. Most are UK based although several have a global reach. We advise 25 of the FTSE 100 companies.' It adds: 'We advise a number of UK government departments and independent government bodies. Recent projects include the Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) and Arts Council England.' McWilliams has also advised London Mayor Boris Johnson on housing, and in April estimated that voters would be £165 a year better off  by the time of May's General Election, giving Chancellor George Osborne 'rather more scope' for cutting taxes in the spring budget. He said: 'The Government – and especially George Osborne – have credibility in the City and partly because both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls do not.' In December the CEBR claimed Britain's economy would be larger than Germany's by 2030, and suggested that the UK overtook France in 2014 to become the world's fifth largest economy. The growth in Britain's national accounts was aided by the decision of the Office for National Statistics to include earnings from the previously uncharted economy of drugs and the sex trade. The French figures do not yet include these industries. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Douglas McWilliams, 63, accused of attack on Beverly Shearon, 47 .

Walking away from her successful designing career, she founded the charity MAD (Making A Difference) for Peace and inspired audiences as a motivational speaker and author. At the core of her work, including her latest initiative #BeTheBridge, is the belief that everyone has a role to play in helping to promote unity.

Having recently given birth to her first daughter, Amelie, Ms Hicks says she's conscious of the permanency of her injuries but determined to channel her anger constructively.

"A woman has taken her former lover to court and is demanding the return of $65,000 which she claims she lent him so he could divorce his then wife and also pay for a third woman - pregnant with his unborn child - to have an abortion. According to her Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit, Amy Marie Cooper dated Martin Priest, 36, for four years. She claims she didn't know that he was still living with his wife Tianna, 32, at the time. The relationship between Cooper and Wall Street trader Priest ended in 2012, when she found out his wife was pregnant, although she admits that she still had 'feelings for him.' Financial adviser Martin Priest, pictured with his new wife Carrie Wharton, is being sued by ex-girlfriend Amy Marie Cooper who claims that she lent him $65,000 which she wants returned . According to court papers, Cooper claims that Priest got back in touch the next year and told her that his marriage had 'irretrievably broken down and that he was a victim of abuse from his wife.' Cooper also claims in her lawsuit that 'another woman, Carrie Wharton, was pregnant with his child... and likewise abused him.' Priest, a financial advisor at Daiwa Capital Markets, allegedly told Cooper he 'was in dire need of money in order to protect himself and his children from his wife and pay Carrie to abort her unborn child.' When Priest told Cooper that he wanted to rekindle their romance, she agreed to help him out of his fix and lent him $65,000, according to court papers.

Police at the time issued an artist's impression of the suspect, right . Police received a tip-off from a man who had been arrested that Degan was responsible for the murder. Officers checked DNA from the crime scene against Degan's and are believed to have discovered a match. Investigators found that Yleen, 33, was beaten, stabbed, shot and sexually assaulted while her younger sister Lillie, 23, was shot. Cold case officers managed to secure some DNA from the murder in 2009 and developed a profile of the killer. Police received a tip off late in 2014 that Degan may have been responsible for the killings and tested his DNA. He has previous convictions for aggravated robbery, assault, making a terrorist threat and possession of drugs.

"That's not what I meant: Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore stirred up controversy on Twitter this weekend by calling snipers 'cowards'. He has since backtracked to say the comments were not meant in relation to the late Chris Kyle, or the recently-released movie based on his memoir,  American Sniper . Michael Moore claims he didn't mean to offend the memory of Chris Kyle when he wrote a series of tweets yesterday calling snipers 'cowards'. The Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker wrote a lengthy Facebook post today clarifying his statements, saying they were not intended as a criticism of the movie American Sniper, based on Kyle's bestselling memoir. The Navy SEAL became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history for shooting dead at least 160 during tours of duty in the Middle East, but was tragically killed just four years after he was discharged by a fellow soldier who was allegedly struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moore caused an uproar on Twitter on Sunday, when he tweeted his thoughts on snipers. 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse,' the Fahrenheit 9/11 director said. 'But if you're on a roof of your home defending it from invaders who've come miles, you are not a sniper, u are brave, u are a neighbor,' he added. After an onslaught of criticism, Moore tweeted again today to claim he was not talking about either Kyle or the film, pointing out the fact that he didn't mention either directly in his tweets. 'Hmm. I never tweeted 1word bout AmericaSniper/ChrisKyle. I said my uncle killed by sniper in WWII; only cowards would do that 2 him, others,' he said. He went on to write about his mixed-feelings towards the film in a protracted Facebook post, saying that while some aspects of the movie were praise-worthy, director Clint Eastwood (noted staunch Republican) didn't cover the history surrounding the Iraq War to Moore's liking. Scroll down for video . American Sniper: The biopic of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, starring Bradley Cooper, has become a box office hit since its wide release last week. Kyle was credited with the most confirmed kills in American military history but tragically died a few years after leaving the military . 'Awesome performance from Bradley Cooper. One of the best of the year. Great editing. Costumes, hair, makeup superb! 'Oh... and too bad Clint gets Vietnam and Iraq confused in his storytelling. And that he has his characters calling Iraqis ""savages"" throughout the film. 'But there is also anti-war sentiment expressed in the movie. And there's a touching ending as the main character is remembered after being gunned down by a fellow American vet with PTSD who was given a gun at a gun range back home in Texas - and then used it to kill the man who called himself the 'America Sniper'. American Sniper has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor and Best Picture. Anger: Michael Moore took to Twitter with his views on snipers the day after American Sniper was widely released . Family: Moore's uncle was shot dead by a Japanese sniper during World War II, so the topic of snipers hits close to home . Clarification: The following day he clarified that his comments did not mention American Sniper or Chris Kyle . Critiques: However, he went on to write out his mixed-feelings about the film in a lengthy Facebook post . History: Moore wrote that while many aspects of the film were well done, he was not happy with director Clint Eastwood's depiction of the Iraq War . The film, which is based on Kyle’s autobiography of the same title reveals not only how he became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him. Raised in rural Texas, Kyle started out as a cowboy and his initial application to join the SEALs was turned down because a rodeo accident had left him with metal pins in his arms. However, in the late nineties, the unit relaxed its entrance policy and Kyle was put through the fearsomely tough selection and training regime. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq, where he made his first long-distance kills even though he had not  been trained as sniper. With an obvious talent, he was sent to the SEAL sniper school, where he was taught warfare’s loneliest and most controversial job. True story: The movie is based on Kyle's autobiography, written before he was shot dead in February 2013 . Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper . In 2004, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, and it was during the battle for that city where he made his mark. However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that Kyle gained his nickname as ‘The Legend’ from his fellow SEALs. One day, while positioned on a roof, Kyle watched a moped coming down a street. Riding it were two men, one of whom dropped a backpack into a pothole. A sniper is a highly trained military marksman, whose job is to engage targets from concealed postitions or from long distances. They usually operate alone or in small groups and use highly specialised weapons to take out their targets. It is believed the first use of snipers came during the American Revoluntionary War when colonists hid in trees and used early rifles to shoot British officers. The first unit of marksmen was established by the British army during the Napoleonic wars and the team were nicknamed the Green Jackets due to their distinctive green uniform. Snipers were widely used in the trenches during the First World War, with Germany equipping their fighters with scoped rifles, which could easily pick out targets. In the Second World War, British and French snipers were credited with halting the German advance. The longest recorded sniper kill was carried out by Corporal Criag Harrison of the British army's Household Cavalry when he two killed two Taliban machine gunners from more than a mile and a half away in Afghanistan in November 2009. He was using the British-built L115A3 Long Range Rifle, the Army's most powerful sniper weapon. Realising that it contained an improvised explosive, Kyle took a shot at the speeding moped from a range of 150 yards. The bullet hit one of the riders, passed through him, and hit the other. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained himself a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry. In February 2013 he was shot dead by a soldier he was trying to help who was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress. The movie of Kyle's life is hotly tipped for glory at the Oscars, after being nominated for six awards including Best Actor for Cooper and Best Picture. It has also been tipped for best adapted screenplay, sound mixing, film editing and sound editing. Moore won an Oscar in 2002 for his documentary Bowling For Columbine, exploring gun violence in America and the main reasons for the Columbine High School massacre. He is outspoken in his views against firearms and has previously described America's national symbol as the gun, not the bald eagle. Last year Moore wrote on his Facebook page that that while other countries have more violent histories than the U.S., more guns per capita and consume the same violent movies and video games as the U.S., none have anywhere near the rates of mass killings that America does. He explained: 'The bloodshed is just the latest in what is fast becoming a regular occurrence in the United States, and one that is sure to happen again, says Moore. 'We won't pass the necessary laws, but more importantly we won't consider why this happens here all the time,' he writes. 'When the NRA says, ""Guns don't kill people - people kill people,"" they've got it half-right. Except I would amend it to this: ""Guns don't kill people - Americans kill people."" Enjoy the rest of your day, and rest assured this will all happen again very soon.'","The documentary filmmaker caused controversy on Sunday by tweeting that snipers are cowards .
Moore's tweets corresponded with the wide release of the film American Sniper, which raked in a record $103.5million this weekend .
However, he later said the comments were not directed at the movie or real-life Chris Kyle who was the inspiration .
He went on to praise Bradley Cooper's acting, while calling out director Clint Eastwood's 'confused' portrayal of the Iraq War ."
"Tesco has lost the trust of customers and suffered a failure of leadership, a former boss said today. Sir Terry Leahy has traded blows with fellow ex-chief Philip Clarke over who was to blame for the problems at the business which were to foreshadow its alarming decline in fortunes. Sir Terry, who ran Britain's biggest supermarket for 14 years to 2011 - quadrupling annual profits - accused Mr Clarke of a ‘failure of leadership’. Former Tesco bosses: Sir Terry Leahy (left) has traded blows with fellow ex-chief Philip Clarke (right) over who was to blame for the problems at the business which were to foreshadow its alarming decline in fortunes . But Mr Clarke, while acknowledging the ‘unprecedented success’ under his predecessor, said ‘critical challenges’ had been building up at the time he took over. He was shown the exit last summer after overseeing sliding sales and a series of profit warnings that contributed to a dramatic fall in the share price. Mr Clarke was replaced by Dave Lewis, who earlier this month announced a dramatic shake-up including the closure of dozens of stores, the mothballing of others that were planned, and the sell-off of peripheral businesses. Sir Terry told the BBC's Panorama that all of the major supermarkets had struggled to some extent during the recession but that it seemed ‘to have hit Tesco the hardest’. Dropping: This graph shows Tesco's share price falling as low as 165p recently from a 2010 high of 454p . He added: ‘People tried very hard to do the right thing, it clearly has not worked. In the end that's a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business. ‘When you're the CEO, if it goes well you get credit, if it doesn't go well you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job. ‘For whatever reason my successor went in a different direction and I think, it may or may not have been with the right reasons or intentions but it clearly didn't work. ‘The one thing that was missing was this great strength of Tesco to take the pulse of the customer and know what they need today and be prepared to change and innovate in order to respond to customers' needs now. ‘I think the culture did change under Phil Clarke and not for the better. I think if you talked to people who knew Tesco, worked in Tesco when I was there, actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be.’ Problems: Sir Terry said that all of the major supermarkets had struggled to some extent during the recession but that it seemed 'to have hit Tesco the hardest' He said it was ‘very damaging’ for Tesco to have lost the trust of customers that it would deliver the best price. ‘I think that some of that trust has been eroded which has meant that people have shopped around, not just actually from Tesco.’ Mr Clarke told Panorama: ‘Although the company had enjoyed unprecedented success in the past, it was plainly the case when I took over Tesco in March 2011 that it faced a number of critical challenges which had been building for some time. ‘It was recognised that this involved achieving cultural changes as well as business ones in order to move the business forward.’ Among the legacy issues that Mr Clarke had to deal with during his tenure was the exit from the US Fresh & Easy chain of US stores in 2013, resulting in a £1.2billion charge. The venture had been launched under Sir Terry. Sir Terry’s comments come as the Panorama investigation claimed that as sales fell at Tesco there was a major fallout between the supermarket and one its biggest suppliers, L’Oreal. Venture launched under Sir Terry: Among the legacy issues that Mr Clarke had to deal with during his tenure was the exit from the US Fresh & Easy chain (above) of US stores in 2013, resulting in a £1.2billion charge . This allegedly led the French cosmetics giant to threaten legal action after a disputed payment of around £1million. On that allegation, a Tesco spokesman said: 'L’Oreal is the largest cosmetics company in the world, with turnover of €29bn (£22.2billion) generating profits of €3.9bn (£3billion) in 2013. 'As such it is a major supplier for Tesco in all our markets and we value our relationship with them. Differences do sometimes occur in the course of commercial relationships and we always aim to resolve them amicably, as we did in this case.” The programme also reported that the former chief financial officer, Laurie McIlwee, sent an internal email in 2012 warning about financial controls at the retailer after problems with commercial income were discovered in its Polish business. The email told finance staff: ‘You should be in no doubt as to the seriousness [of] mis-declarations.’ This came less than two years before Tesco’s accounting scandal of September 2014 which led to senior staff being suspended and an investigation being launched by the Serious Fraud Office. ON HIS EMOTIONS OVER THE DECLINE OF TESCO . 'I do feel sad, I, I spent my career at Tesco and, I’m particularly sad for the people in the business and actually the customers who come into the stores and, and spend their money every week. It didn’t have to be this way, I don’t think I think all of the big four supermarkets have struggled to some degree through this recession, but it seems to have hit Tesco the hardest.' ON PHILIP CLARKE . 'For whatever reason my successor went in a different direction and I think, it may or may not have been with the right reasons or intentions but it clearly didn’t work and, and the one thing that was missing was this great strength of Tesco to take the pulse of the customer and know what they need today and be prepared to change and innovate in order to respond to customers’ needs now.' ON FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP . 'Well I, look people tried very hard to do the right thing, it clearly has not worked, in the end that’s a failure of leadership, not a failure of the business, not a failure of the people who work hard every day in the business. When you’re the CEO erm, if it goes well you get credit, if it doesn’t go well you must take responsibility and Phil Clarke has taken that responsibility and paid the price with his job.' ON THE CHANGE OF CULTURE UNDER PHILIP CLARKE . 'I think the culture did change under Phil Clarke and not for the better I think if you talked to people who knew Tesco, worked in Tesco when I was there, actually the culture was pretty positive and it has to be because it employs half a million people and you can’t make them do things you have to motivate them to do things, they’ve got to want to do it. They’ve got to believe in something similarly customers you can’t force them to come through your doors, they’ve got to positively choose to come and suppliers to from all over the world, they’ve got to invest in your business and the best way of getting them to do that is to actually motivate them so you need a very positive culture, it has to set high standards of course for safety on behalf of consumers, and also to be fair to good suppliers, you can’t reward a bad supplier and not give the business to a supplier who does things better.' ON TESCO LOSING ITS REPUTATION FOR HAVING THE BEST PRICES . 'It’s very damaging [with reference to Tesco losing its reputation for being the best on price] … Tesco is the biggest, people expect it to have the best prices for the products that they buy - and know they can trust Tesco to deliver that and not have to shop around and check that they’re getting the best deal and, and I think that some of that trust has been eroded which has meant that people have shopped around, not just actually from Tesco but from the other big four supermarkets.' ON WHETHER TESCO LOST TOO MUCH SENIOR MANAGEMENT TALENT . 'I think it lost too much talent, it’s a big company Tesco and also very empowered, people were given responsibility and trusted to get on with their job so there was a big team of experienced leaders and, and too many of those were allowed to go in to short a period of time and so there was, there was a shortage I think of experience, the kind of experience you need to carefully navigate a business like Tesco through this very turbulent and difficult period of this long, long recession with these changes in structure of retailing taking place.'","Sir Terry trades blows with Philip Clarke over who is to blame for issues .

"British spooks intercepted emails from US and UK media organisations and rated ‘investigative journalists’ alongside terrorists and hackers as potential security threats, secret documents reveal. Internal advice circulated by intelligence chiefs at the Government spy centre GCHQ claims ‘journalists and reporters representing all types of news media represent a potential threat to security’. Intelligence documents leaked by the fugitive US whistleblower Edward Snowden also show that British security officers scooped up 70,000 emails in just 10 minutes during one interception exercise in 2008. Among the private exchanges were emails between journalists at the BBC, New York Times and US network NBC. The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) is Britain's eavesdropping centre in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . The disclosure comes amid growing calls for the security services to be handed more power to monitor the internet following the Paris terror attacks. Internal security advice, shared among British intelligence agencies, scored journalists in a table of potential threats. One restricted document, which according to the Guardian was intended for those in army intelligence, warned that ‘journalists and reporters representing all types of news media represent a potential threat to security’. It continued: ‘Of specific concern are “investigative journalists” who specialise in defence-related exposés either for profit or what they deem to be of the public interest.' The document adds: ‘All classes of journalists and reporters may try either a formal approach or an informal approach, possibly with off-duty personnel, in their attempts to gain official information to which they are not entitled.’ It warns staff that ‘such approaches pose a real threat’, adding it must be ‘immediately reported’. One table scored journalists a ‘low’ information security risk – compared to terrorists who are seen as a ‘moderate’ threat. David Cameron has promised to give the security agencies more powers to monitor people's emails and internet use . The latest revelations about GCHQ are buried in documents leaked by the fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden . A spokesman for GCHQ refused to confirm or deny if the leaked documents were accurate. The spokesman said: ‘It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters. ‘Furthermore, all of GCHQ’s work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the interception and intelligence services commissioners and the parliamentary intelligence and security committee. ‘All our operational processes rigorously support this position. In addition, the UK’s interception regime is entirely compatible with the European convention on human rights.’ According to the Guardian, GCHQ scooped up emails to and from journalists during one 10-minute 'tapping' session in November 2008. Emails from the BBC, the Sun and the Mail on Sunday were picked up and shared on the agency’s internal computer system - alongside memos from US media organisations. The revelation comes as the British government faces growing pressure to ensure journalists’ texts and emails are protected from snooping. Newspaper editors and lawyers have called for a new freedom of expression law.","Journalists represent 'a potential threat to security', according to GCHQ .

"Michael Wenham is accused of stabbing prostitute Karolina Nowikiewicz, 25, (pictured) to death in a seemingly unprovoked attack at her flat . A father-of-three who suffered a failed penis enlargement operation arranged to meet a prostitute before knifing her repeatedly in the neck, a court heard today. Michael Wenham is accused of stabbing Karolina Nowikiewicz, 25, to death in a seemingly unprovoked attack at her flat in Slough, Berkshire, before lying her face-down on her bed, showering himself clean and calling the police. Reading Crown Court was told that at the time of Ms Nowikiewicz's death on February 17 last year, married Wenham, 35, was recovering from unsuccessful surgery on his genitals, carried out in the U.S. in late 2013. The jury was told that Wenham still had a dressing on his penis which had affected his sex life with wife of eight years Dawn and that he was self-conscious about the size of his genitalia. On the day of the killing, Wenham bought a pay-as-you-go mobile phone from an Argos store and tried to use it to arrange a meeting with a prostitute, the court heard. The IT contractor had also called in sick to work before heading to a hardware store and buying a Stanley knife, disposable gloves and plastic sacks which he used in the killing. When the first woman he tried was unavailable, he booked to see Ms Nowikiewicz, arranging to meet her at her flat, where she worked as a prostitute to fund her studies. The jury was told how Wenham, who was working on a project for the Office of National Statistics in Southampton, had been not taking his medication for depression in the days before the killing. 'The killing was utterly premeditated, planned and clinically executed,' Alan Blake, prosecuting, told the jury of six men and six women. 'Attacking her from behind, he sliced open her neck, cutting through her major arteries and her spinal chord. There was no evidence that she had been able to even try to defend herself. 'The first prostitute he tried was unavailable. Tragically for Karolina, he booked to see her instead. There is no evidence to suggest that they had ever met before. 'Having killed Karolina and left her face-down on her bed, the defendant washed himself in the bathroom, placed the bloody knife in a drawer in the bedroom, went outside and called the police to admit to what he had just done. When the first prostitute Wenham tried was unavailable, he booked to see Ms Nowikiewicz, arranging to meet her at her flat (pictured after her death), where she worked as a prostitute to fund her studies . The court was told that after the killing, Ms Nowikiewicz was left face-down in her bed, before Wenham took a shower to wash himself clean and called police . 'Although the victim was a prostitute both psychiatrists seem to agree that this was not in fact a sexual killing, in that there was no evidence of sexual assault, consensual sexual activity or even arousal. 'Karolina was chosen because her job made her an easy target.' The jury heard how a friend of Ms Nowikiewicz, who was visiting from Poland, had seen large arm 'with a black tribal tattoo' through a crack in the door shortly before the prostitute was killed. Katarzyna Rutowska said she heard the shower running soon after Wenham arrived at the flat, then Ms Nowikiewicz uttered a weak moan and the words 'I am sorry.' A short while later  Wenham called police to tell them he had just killed a prostitute. The jury heard how a friend of Ms Nowikiewicz, who was visiting her at her flat (pictured) from Poland, had seen large arm 'with a black tribal tattoo' through a crack in the door shortly before the prostitute was killed . When asked if it was deliberate or an accident, he replied: 'I don’t know' before giving his name and home address and hanging up to call his wife. In a phone call to her, he said: 'Hi, it’s me, I’ve done a stupid thing, I’ve killed someone, I’m really sorry, I’ve killed someone.' He then begged her not to tell the couple’s two boys, aged six and five. They also have a one-year-old daughter. The first officers at the scene found Wenham sat by the side of the road outside the block of flats with his head in his hands. The jury at Reading Crown Court was told that the killing of Ms Nowikiewicz (pictured) was 'premeditated, planned and clinically executed' When they approached him he told them: 'I can’t believe I have done it.' He was taken to a police station in nearby Maidenhead, where he told the custody sergeant that he had recently been circumcised and that he was bandaged as his penis was not healing properly. When police trawled through his medical records, they found a draft letter from a GP written in support of an application for a firearms certificate. The jury heard that a post mortem examination showed that Karolina was stabbed at least four times in the neck and that the injuries were consistent with her having been attacked from behind. Wenham, from Uxbridge, Middlesex, denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Michael Wenham, 35, denies murdering Karolina Nowikiewicz, 25 .

"Crowds once again lined the streets of Manila to see Pope Francis one final time as he made his way to the airport at the end of his visit to the Philippines.

The Pope's motorcade passed through Manila earlier this morning as he travelled to the air base to meet Catholic dignitaries . Biggest Mass ever? Six million gathered to see Pope Francis saying Mass in Manila, the Philippine capital, yesterday . Hundreds of thousands of Catholics gathered in the streets of Manila to get a final glimpse of the 78-year-old Pope as he was driven to the airport in his white Popemobile. People shouted his name and wept in joy as he passed through the city's streets for the last time. 'He's my No. 1 world leader,' said Rita Fernandez, a 63-year-old mother-of-four. 'He rides on a bus. He flew to Tacloban to visit the typhoon survivors despite the storm and he stops to talk to the poor. He's a living saint.' Those who were unable to squeeze through the roadside throng stood on top of ladders to unfurl posters proclaiming their love for the Pontiff. Speaking at the airport, President Aquino said the Pope's five-day visit was a success. He said: 'He was very happy with the hospitality. He said he really felt the warmth.' A girl, who was rescued and found shelter in a Church-run community, broke down in tears and could not finish her prepared welcome after meeting the Pope at yesterday's Mass .

Hundreds of thousands of Catholics gathered in the streets of Manila to get a final glimpse of the 78-year-old Pope as he was driven to the airport in his white Popemobile . Pope Francis dedicated the trip to the Philippines to the poor, marginalised and victims of injustice. He denounced the corruption that has robbed them of a dignified life, visited street children and traveled to Tacloban to offer prayers for survivors of Typhoon Haiyan, the deadly 2013 storm that ravaged the city. A record six million poured into Manila's rain-soaked streets and its biggest park yesterday as Francis ended his Asian pilgrimage, surpassing the five million who turned out for Pope John Paul II's Mass in the city in 1995. The Pope also dedicated the final chapter of his Asian trip to children as the Mass fell on an important feast day honouring the infant Jesus. His focus was a reflection of the importance the Vatican places on Asia as the future of the church since it is one of the few places where Catholic numbers are growing, with the Philippines the largest Catholic nation in the region. 'We need to care for our young people, not allowing them to be robbed of hope and condemned to a life on the streets,' Pope Francis said. The Pope's last full day in the Philippines began with a youth gathering at a Catholic university in Manila, where attendees were moved by a question posed by a 12-year-old orphan girl. Glyzelle Iris Palomar asked him: 'Many children are abandoned by their parents. Many of them became victims and bad things have happened to them, like drug addiction and prostitution. Why does God allow this to happen, even if the children are not at fault? Why is it that only a few people help us?' One final glimpse: Thousands bid goodbye to the Pope as leaves the Philippines, Asia's most predominatly Catholic country .

The girl, who was rescued and found shelter in a Church-run community, broke down in tears and could not finish her prepared welcome. The Pope hugged her and later put aside most of his own prepared speech to respond. 'She is the only one who has put forward a question for which there is no answer and she was not even able to express it in words but rather in tears,' he said, visibly moved. 'Why do children suffer?' the Argentine Pope said, speaking in his native Spanish. An aide translated his words into English for the crowd of about 30,000 young people on the grounds of the Church-run university. 'I invite each one of you to ask yourselves, ""Have I learned how to weep, how to cry when I see a hungry child, a child on the street who uses drugs, a homeless child, an abandoned child, an abused child, a child that society uses as a slave?""' The crowd in Manila - a sea of humanity in colourful rain ponchos spread out across the 148-acre park - erupted in shrieks of joy when he drove by, a reflection of the incredible resonance Francis' message about caring for society's most marginal has had in a country where about a quarter of its 100 million people live in poverty. In Sri Lanka, during the first leg of his Asian trip, Francis pressed his call for national reconciliation by canonizing the country's first saint, the Reverend Joseph Vaz, and visiting the war-ravaged north to pray at a shrine. Reverend Vaz was a 17th century Indian missionary who revived the faith in Sri Lanka during a time of anti-Catholic persecution by Dutch colonists, who were Protestants. Pope Francis said the Sri Lankan church today wants to continue Vaz's legacy of service to all, asking only for the freedom to preach in return. 'Religious freedom is a fundamental human right,' he said.","Crowds lined the streets of Manila one final time as Pope Francis made his way to the airport at the end of his visit .

"A car plunged into a massive, watery sinkhole late Sunday evening - forcing the couple inside the vehicle to flee as it continued to be engulfed. Ashley Guzman was with her boyfriend Christopher Atkinson when the incident took place at the intersection of North 20th Street and East Yukon Street in Tampa, Florida, she told WTVT. 'Right when I got out the car it just - like the floor just started cracking towards me,' she told the affiliate station. 'That's when I started panicking more and I started yelling at him so he could get out.' Scroll down for video . Incident: Ashley Guzman and her boyfriend Christopher Atkinson had to flee their vehicle at a Tampa intersection late Sunday evening when it became engulfed due to a water main break . Danger: The car was removed from the water around 4am on Monday . Guzman continued 'And the water, it just started flooding the whole street, it started going down, and after that the car just kept going down and it was just - I'm just very glad we didn't stay stuck in the car because if we would have stuck in the car it would have been real bad, you know? 'And I just thank god for that, that we actually, you know - we're good, we're not hurt or nothing. It's just the car.' According to WFTS, it was slightly after 11pm when the hole opened due to a water main break - and the car was removed around 4am on Monday morning. Guzman told the news outlet 'I started panicking, my legs were shaking real bad. I couldn't even talk to police on the phone. He was stuck still inside the car trying to back it up, trying to get it out, and he ended up having to get out. 'By the time he got out that's when the floor actually fell like how it is right now and the car just kept going deeper and deeper. At that moment we couldn't do nothing. We was just terrified.' Caution: Tampa Public Works and Utility Services Administrator Brad Baird has said 19 families were told to boil their water as a precautionary measure . Under construction: There is a new pipe and and the hole has been closed, though an asphalt cover will be installed Tuesday . Guzman and Atkinson drove into the water, believing it to be surface water from a broken pipe - and the road sank when the vehicle traversed the intersection, WFTS reported. The couple told the station they ought to have turned the vehicle back instead. 'The neighbors around the streets was telling me that the water actually been running for three hours period to the time that the car accident happened,' Guzman told WFTS. She said there should have been a road block set up. Police told the news outlet that they had gone through the neighborhood shortly ahead of the car's submersion. Tampa Public Works and Utility Services Administrator Brad Baird also told WFTS that 19 families were told to boil their water in a precautionary measure. He also stated that the intersection will be shut down on Tuesday.

"A widow who lost her 'soul mate and best friend' husband after it took five hours for an ambulance service to get him to hospital has released a harrowing photograph of her last moments together. Mthuthuzeli Mpongwana, 38, died of meningitis after suddenly being taken ill at his Bristol home on January 5. His wife Lisa phoned 111, the NHS non-emergency helpline, but she was forced to wait five hours for her rapidly-deteriorating husband to be taken into hospital. Two days later, Mrs Mpongwana had to make the heartbreaking decision to turn off her husband's life support. He was later found to have died from meningitis of the brain. The ambulance service who answered her call have apologised, but Mrs Mpongwana insists her husband would still be alive today if it hadn't been for the delay. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Lisa Mpongwana posted this image of her husband before he died. Mthuthuzeli died after having to wait five hours before being taken to hospital for meningitis . Mrs Mpongwana - who described her husband as 'her rock' - said: 'The apology won't bring him back. The doctors and nurses when we got to the hospital were fantastic, but it shouldn't have taken so long to get him there. 'At the beginning my husband was talking and asking questions, by the time they arrived he was completely unresponsive.' Mr Mpongwana began feeling unwell at the couple's home in Bedminster, Bristol, and soon became extremely sensitive to light. His wife phoned the NHS non-emergency number and was told a blue-lights ambulance would be sent straight away. Two-and-a-half hours later a rapid response car arrived at their home. It took a further three hours for Mr Mpongwana to be taken to hospital, by which point he was seriously ill. Mrs Mpongwana, 27, said: 'I called 111 because I could see he was bad, he couldn't stand being around lights at all. 'The caller said they would send a blue lights ambulance straight away because they thought it was serious. We then had to wait until 1.30am for one man in a car to arrive.' Couple: Mrs Mpongwana described her husband as 'her rock' who 'stood by me through my highs and lows' Grieving: The widow described how she waited for hours while her husband's condition worsened . She added: 'At first he thought it was just the flu and called the GP out-of-hours for advice about whether he should admit him to hospital. 'I don't understand why the paramedic couldn't take him to hospital. He then called for an ambulance but it took until 4.30am for it to arrive.' Mrs Mpongwana spent the morning of January 7 in the arms of her husband, but doctors said he had no chance of recovery and she gave her consent for his life support machine to be switched off. She said: 'I got to sleep with him on Tuesday night. It was so comforting to me. It was something I'm really grateful I got the chance to do. 'The nurse was amazing afterwards. She helped me wash and dress him. She also got some paint and we did hand prints. 'I don't think I will ever have closure but I had the chance to say goodbye. I can't thank her enough.' Final moments: Mrs Mpongwana said she was pleased she was at her husband's side during his final night . Mrs Mpongwana, who met her husband in September 2011 and married in March 2013, decided to release the photograph to raise awareness of meningitis. She said: 'I was really hard to share it but I had no choice. People need to see the hurt I went through. 'I don't want sympathy but I want to raise awareness about meningitis. I didn't know the symptoms and I'm sure other people don't either.' South Western Ambulance Service has now apologised for the dalays. A spokesman for the service said: 'South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust received a call from the NHS 111 service in Bristol at approximately 11pm to attend a male patient suffering from a headache and fever. 'A Rapid Response Vehicle was dispatched and arrived at the scene at approximately 1.18am. The patient was treated by our crews before being transported to the Bristol Royal Infirmary.' The spokesman added: 'The trust would like to apologise for the delay in getting to this patient during what was a very busy time. 'We would like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and would urge them to get in touch so that we can investigate the matter further.' Hospital: The 38-year-old died after being taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary five hours after taking ill at home . Mrs Mpongwana is now struggling to pay for a funeral and is appealing for help with the costs. She said: 'My husband was my soul mate and best friend who stood by me throughout my highs and my lows and when my dad passed away last year at the age of 44 he was my rock. 'My husband's sudden death has caused me a lot of pain and I am really worried that I won't be able to provide a funeral for my husband as I am still paying off my father's funeral.'

"When it comes to the competitive world of superyachts, size is everything. Which is why one design firm has gone all-out in its bid to attract the rich and famous, drawing up plans for a vessel based on the dimensions of an oil tanker. Measuring 918ft in length and including a four-storey ski slope - complete with Austrian-themed Apres lodge - the mind-boggling boat is nearly double the length of the world's biggest superyacht, Azzam, owned by the Abu Dhabi royal family, which measures 590ft. Scroll down for video . The oil tanker-sized superyacht will measure 918ft in length and will have a grand hull painted white and gold . The bizarre design is the brainchild of an Austrian firm called MOTION Code: BLUE and is planned to appeal to billionaires in the Gulf, who may like to celebrate their oil-based wealth with a superyacht designed to look like a tanker. In fact, the world's first tanker sized yacht is called Imāra, a name based on the Arabic word for 'emirate'. Billionaire sailors will be able to entertain guests across the 11 decks, store five helicopters on board, receive visitors arriving at the three helipads, and relax in the four-deck-high atrium, complete with waterfalls. Wet garages will store tender boats and toys including speedboats and jet skis so guests can entertain themselves without having to head to the beach. As well as a hull painted white and gold, the enormous area can be explored using custom painted BMW 13 electric cars to zip passengers form one end of the boat to another. The spectacular design includes space for a four-storey ski slope, complete with Austrian-style lodge, four beach clubs with access to the sea restaurants, a spa and BMW cars to zip guests from on end of the ship to another . A Suezmax oil tanker can normally hold around one million barrels of oil and burn up to 60 tons of fuel on a daily basis to power them through the water. But filling the tank will be the least of this billionaire yacht-owner's worries. On board there will be eight two-storey VIP suites, another 12 guest cabins, theatres, four beach clubs with access to the sea, concert halls, libraries and offices. A seafront gym will offer the perfect view while working out, along with tennis courts, an enormous spa and a selection of restaurants and a shisha bar. But by far the most unusual centrepiece to the superyacht will be the four-storey ski slope, in case passengers tire of constant sunshine and beach clubs, complete with an Austrian-style lodge for apres-ski. The superyacht has three helipads and two hangars to stores and extra two helicopters if needed, as well as wet garages for speedboats and other toys that guests may want to use . Christian Gumpold, managing director of Motion Code: Blue, said: 'Motion Code: Blue defines itself as trendsetter in yacht design and has generated and pushed many trends in modern yacht design since its foundation back in 2009. 'We have developed the world's first tanker-sized yacht called Imara, which is based on the Arabic word for 'emirate'. 'Based on the dimensions and hull geometries of common 280-metre long SuezMax tankers, the design studio's concept was to improve the aesthetics of nowadays oil tankers by developing a private tanker-based yacht with emphasis to the preferences of Middle East clients who are willing to show their national pride and their country's resources by using a modified and upcycled oil tanker as private luxury floating residence. 'The overall exterior design concept was to generate a highly precious aesthetic combined with modern architecture-like elements but also incorporating every state-of-the art-superyacht feature. 'The interior design of Imara is simply enormous. 'With a length of 280m, a beam of 57m and a total of 11 decks, Imara set clearly new standards in private yachting. 'It shows what is possible when thinking outside the box.'","The 918ft tankers normally carry one million barrels of oil and use 60 tons of fuel a day .

"Two teenagers have died after plunging through thin ice while fishing at a rock quarry in rural Indiana. Clark 'Edward' Shoemaker, 17, and Dominic Arthur, 13, were fishing with family at the quarry just north of Spencer on Sunday when they fell into about 11 feet of water. After receiving a 911 call, first responders raced to the scene and had to navigate steep, rocky terrain to reach the edge of the water. Divers found the pair within minutes. Tragic: Clark 'Edward' Shoemaker, 17, (left) and Dominic Arthur, 13, (right) died after they plunged through ice while fishing in a quarry in Spencer, Indiana on Sunday afternoon .

The boys, who are believed to have been in the water for 90 minutes in total, were rushed to IU Health Bloomington, where they were pronounced dead. The ice was less than three inches thick when the boys fell through, the state Department of Natural Resources reported. Dramatic images of the search show that the ice broke several feet from rocks. Indiana Conservation Officers said that the warming temperatures had also weakened the ice. Temperatures in the area have been around 40 F (4.4 C). Terrifying: Workers can be seen near the broken ice, which was less than three inches thick at the time . Hopeful: Rescue workers look for the two teenagers, who are thought to have spent 90 minutes in the water . Scene: Rescuers look below after the boys were pulled out from the water in the rock quarry . At least four inches of fresh, solid ice is considered safe for ice fishing, the DNR said, and they warn people to always verify the thickness of the ice before venturing out on it. Autopsies on the bodies are scheduled for Monday at Terre Haute Regional Hospital, Fox59 reported. On Monday, relatives shared photos of the boys to Facebook, commenting on how they never saw 13-year-old Dominic without a smile on his face. 'RIP Dominic. We love you and going to miss you!' one relative wrote as he shared an image of the youngster grinning behind the wheel of a car.

"Two pensioners who lived 120 miles apart were killed in 'senseless' murders by a man they both knew who stole their valuables to sell online, a court has heard. Cynthia Beamond, 80, from Halesowen near Birmingham and Philip Silverstone, 67, of Belsize Park, north London, were found dead in their homes just one day apart last year. Leo Barnes is accused of murdering the elderly pair and stealing their valuables to sell on Gumtree. Cynthia Beamond (left) was killed in her home in Birmingham last year. Leo Barnes (right) is accused of her murder and the killing of another man in his north London home the following day . The 33-year-old from Balsall Heath in Birmingham, was described as being 'the only link' between the elderly pair. He denies the murder charges. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how Barnes stole a television from the home of Mrs Beamond, who he had known since childhood through her grandson, before beating her to death and hiding her body in a garage. He then spent three hours mopping up her blood in the kitchen of her home with a bucket, it was alleged. Barnes, a father-of-one, is then said to have rented a car to drive to London, where he allegedly killed former market trader Mr Silverstone on June 28. It is understood the defendant once lived in the building where the pensioner was killed with a car jack. Prosecutor Stephen Linehan told the court the only connection between the two victims was their acquaintance with the defendant. Mrs Beamond's body was found hidden under storage in the garage of her home in Halesown, Birmingham . Forensics workers and police at the house where Mrs Beamond was bludgeoned to death (above) 'This case is about the senseless and brutal murders of two entirely innocent people. 'They didn’t know each other - the only link between them was that at some stage in their lives they had had the misfortune to come into contact with the defendant, Leo Barnes, and he had got to know them and to know where they lived. That is what led to their deaths.' Barnes knew Mrs Beamond as a child having been a friend of her grandsons but had lost touch with the widow until Spring 2014, it was heard. On June 28, he was seen on CCTV near her Birmingham home and later spotted selling her television at a pawnshop. 'He had hired a black Volkswagen Golf and was spotted arriving in the area at 10.30am. He parked close to her home at 10.45am,' said Mr Linehan. 'Mrs Beamond was supposed to meet a friend at 12pm. Being punctual she always called if she was going to be late, so her friend became worried when she never arrived. 'Cynthia had a mobile phone and a land line, but she did not answer either.. 'Later her daughter, who always kept in contact, tried to call her and text her as she was going away that day. Barnes, a father-of-two, was seen in the area on the day of Mrs Beamond's death. He is later said to have been captured on CCTV pawning a television stolen from her house . 'When she could not get hold of her she asked her nephews to try. The reason she did not answer her mobile phone is that she had been attacked and killed in her own home.' Barnes is then accused of closing the curtains, concealing the pensioner's body in plastic bags and then ransacking the property for valuables to sell. CCTV shown in court purports to show the defendant driving to a Cash Generators to sell a television stolen from her house. He then allegedly listed the pensioner's car - left sitting in a street where she used to live - on Gumtree to sell for £550. The following day, he is said to have bludgeoned Mr Silverstone to death with a car jack. The 67-year-old's body was found on June 30. It had been in his home with his dementia-stricken wife for 30 hours by the time a carer arrived at the property. When questioned by police, Barnes claims both Mrs Beamond and Mr Silverstone were killed in separate murders, the latter's frail and elderly wife his alleged murderer. The trial continues.

"One of the inspectors, Lee Barham, was found guilty of misconduct while writing the report . Pressure mounted last night for an inquiry into an alleged Labour 'stitch-up' of the first privately run NHS hospital. A Tory MP wrote to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling for an urgent investigation into how the Care Quality Commission came to brand Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Cambridgeshire 'inadequate'. The demand came as it emerged that a CQC inspector was found guilty of professional misconduct while writing the damning report. Senior paramedic Lee Barham, 42, was part of the team that unexpectedly condemned Hinchingbrooke, despite previous findings that it was one of Britain's best-performing hospitals. Between the hospital's inspection in September and the report's publication this month, a conduct hearing upheld allegations that Mr Barham failed to tell managers an unqualified student paramedic had given a patient morphine. Mr Barham also swore abusively at his junior colleague and 'stole' his mobile phone, a Health and Care Professions Council panel ruled in October. The disciplinary committee found his actions amounted to misconduct and fell 'seriously below the standards expected of a registered paramedic'. The revelation raises questions about the CQC's highly critical report into Hinchingbrooke, which was published days after Circle, the private firm running the hospital, withdrew from its contract. A Tory MEP said it was 'shocking' that the inspection relied on someone found guilty of misconduct and the CQC had been 'seriously undermined'. A Daily Mail investigation has provoked suspicions that the CQC report was directed by senior Labour and union figures opposed to NHS privatisation. One inspector is linked to pressure group Keep Our NHS Public, another is a former member of the doctors' trade union, and a paediatrician standing for Labour at the General Election is believed to have heavily influenced the findings. Hinchingbrooke Hospital is in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, and serves 160,000 patients . A Daily Mail investigation has provoked suspicions that the CQC report was directed by senior Labour and union figures opposed to NHS privatisation . Jonathan Djanogly, the Conservative MP for Huntingdon, where the hospital is based, has asked Mr Hunt to 'urgently start an inquiry to get to the bottom of what did or did not happen'. 'Like many others, I simply cannot reconcile the negative tone of the CQC report with my own experience of the hospital,' he wrote. 'Nothing that I have seen before the CQC report would justify calling the hospital 'inadequate'.' Stressing he had not received any concrete evidence of 'corruption, fraud or political collusion', Mr Djanogly added: 'The hospital has been at the receiving end of an ongoing and vicious attack by the public sector trade unions, who have perceived Hinchingbrooke to be the 'thin end of the wedge' for what they call the 'privatisation of the NHS'.' Mr Barham's involvement in the Hinchingbrooke report was secret until now because he is not named in the 96-page document. When first contacted by the Mail about Mr Barham last week, the health watchdog incorrectly claimed that the misconduct allegations against him were 'dropped' and that he had a 'clean record in respect of his paramedic duties'. But in fact the HCPC panel upheld three of four allegations made against Mr Barham, although it decided not to impose any sanction on him. Jonathan Djanogly (pictured), the Conservative MP for Huntingdon, where the hospital is based, has asked Mr Hunt to 'urgently start an inquiry to get to the bottom of what did or did not happen' The allegations related to a student paramedic whom Mr Barham mentored while working as a manager for private firm Thames Ambulance Service. He discovered that the junior member of staff had given a patient morphine in July 2012 despite not being allowed to administer controlled drugs, the hearing was told. The NHS is treated like a sacred religion and it is 'taboo' to criticise it, a Tory MP warned yesterday. Charlotte Leslie, a member of the Commons health committee, said the health service was 'not equipped' to deal with 21st century problems. She said the 'dangerous' tendency to regard the NHS as an object of faith prevented people from discussing solutions sensibly. Miss Leslie wrote on the ConservativeHome website that the NHS was 'at the heart of our sacred taboos'. She added: 'The most dangerous aspect of this 'religion' is that it prevents anyone from sensibly discussing solutions.' A recent poll found that the NHS will be the most important issue for voters in the election. But Mr Barham did not tell his bosses about the incident, instead relying on the student to inform senior managers himself. The HCPC panel said this resulted in a 'potential risk to patients' because the trainee paramedic was not formally reprimanded for his error for ten months. Mr Barham later took his junior colleague's mobile phone without permission and sent text messages from it to the student's girlfriend. Mr Barham later admitted: 'It is the most stupid thing I have ever done. I took the phone because I knew he had been talking about me.' Ruling that he should not receive any punishment, the HCPC panel concluded: 'The panel were satisfied that these events amounted to lapses in behaviour which were isolated and out of character, and which did not affect patients.' But Tory East of England MEP David Campbell Bannerman said yesterday: 'It is shocking that in addition to the findings of Labour Party stooges, now we see that the CQC report on Hinchingbrooke relied on evidence from someone guilty of misconduct in their profession. A new independent inquiry must be carried out into the Hinchingbrooke report as a matter of urgency.' A woman who answered the door of Mr Barham's house in the village of Great Horkesley, near Colchester in Essex, referred all inquiries to the CQC yesterday. A CQC spokesman said: 'We have no concerns about Mr Barham's work as an inspector or [his ability] to carry out his role to the highest standards with professionalism and integrity.'","Tory MP wrote to Health Secretary calling for investigation into CQC report .

"One day Peter felt excruciating pain shoot through his lower back and buttocks . Thousands of Britons have foot drop - weakness or paralysis in one foot that can result in a limp. One cause is a slipped disc, so a back operation may be the answer. Peter Austin, 53, a planning manager from Leeds, had the surgery, as he tells CAROL DAVIS. THE PATIENT . For three decades I've had problems with lower back pain - at 24 I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a kind of rheumatoid arthritis; as a result the joints in my lower back and hips had become inflamed. I was told the bones can eventually fuse and stiffen, and that I could end up in a wheelchair if the ones in my backbone fused, so I was determined to stay healthy. Fortunately I've been able to keep the condition reasonably well controlled with medication and physiotherapy. Even so, I've had years of lower back pain - and by two years ago I could only manage to play golf a few times a year, whereas I used to play every week. A colleague recommended back specialist Deb Pal and my GP was happy to refer me - I have private healthcare through work. I had my first appointment in February last year and he sent me for more physiotherapy and said the next stage would be a nerve block injection in my back. However, a month later, getting up from a chair at work one morning, I felt excruciating pain shoot through my lower back and buttocks. I couldn't feel my right leg at all and it dragged on the ground when I walked, forcing me to limp. Thinking I'd trapped a nerve, I walked to a nearby shop to try to relieve it by moving - what should have been a three-minute journey took 45 minutes. I was in agony. A colleague took me home and my GP agreed I should see Mr Pal again the next week. My foot stayed numb - I couldn't drive: my wife Christine had to do everything. Mr Pal sent me for an MRI scan, which showed I had a slipped disc in my back that was squashing a nerve. This was what had been causing my back pain, he explained, but because this nerve controls movement and sensation in the lower leg, I also couldn't lift my foot - a problem known as foot drop. Peter had a slipped disc that was squashing a nerve that controls movement and sensation in the lower leg . He explained that he could operate to remove part of the disc and make room for the nerve. The sooner this was done, he said, the better my chances of a full recovery, as compressing a nerve for too long can damage it for good, causing permanent loss of sensation and movement in the foot. I had the hour-long operation ten days later. I had a morphine shot when I woke and paracetamol for two days, but the back pain had gone completely. Over the next few weeks sensation gradually returned to my leg and after six weeks I was able to drive again. I had months of physiotherapy and by December I was back on the golf course and even going jogging. THE SURGEON . Deb Pal is consultant neurosurgeon at Leeds General Infirmary and Spire Leeds Hospital. Proportion of people with a slipped disc who need surgery . Around 25,000 Britons a year are diagnosed with foot drop. It can be caused by stroke, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, muscle damage, Parkinson's or diabetes, and it also affects around 5 per cent of patients with lumbar disc prolapse (slipped disc). Slipped discs affect around a million Britons a year. The spine is made up of 24 individual bones, and in between them are cushioning discs. Sometimes the inner part of a disc, which is made of a jelly-like material, bulges out, compressing nerves in the spinal cord. We don't fully understand why this can cause foot drop - perhaps because blood supply to the nerve that controls the lower leg is restricted. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis (around 200,000 in the UK) are slightly more at risk because it can cause bones in the spine to thicken, narrowing the available space in the spinal column. A doctor removed part of the disc and make room for the nerve . While this doesn't make a disc any more likely to prolapse, the smaller space does mean the nerve is more likely to be squashed. However, in Peter's case his condition was well controlled so the two were not linked. With a slipped disc, doctors and patients often want to wait to see how it progresses, relying on painkillers, as in 80 per cent of cases the pain will resolve without surgery. However, I think the situation with foot drop from a slipped disc is different, as waiting can mean it may be too late to correct the problem, if the nerve is too damaged. There is no clear guidance on treatment. But in my view surgery should be offered early, especially in patients with a large disc prolapse and whose foot drop has only been present for a short time. I'd like to see a proper trial conducted so GPs, surgeons and patients know how great the chances of success are likely to be. The standard procedure for a slipped disc is microdiscectomy - surgery to remove the material pressing on the nerve. The operation takes less than an hour under general anaesthetic. First I make a 1-1.5cm incision in the middle of the lower back, and move the back muscles to one side. I then work through a tube, around 1cm in diameter, which I insert through the space I've made between the muscles. I make an incision through the tissue between the vertebra above the damaged disc, and move the compressed nerve gently to one side, using a microscope to see it. Then I cut away the protruding part of the disc. I move the nerve back into place and close the incision with stitches. Some patients go home that day, others stay overnight. Recovery is three to four weeks. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Disc surgery, whether to treat pain or foot drop, carries a risk of 1 to 2 per cent of infection around the disc,' says Amjad Shad, consultant spinal surgeon at University Hospital Coventry and BMI Hospital Coventry. 'There is also a 1 to 2 per cent risk of damage to the nerve, causing neuropathic pain which can be permanent, and a risk of increased back pain because you are cutting muscles and ligaments.' Surgery may also weaken the spine, increasing the risk of another disc prolapse. 'Where there is pressure on the nerve and the weakness is getting worse over a few weeks, there is evidence that patients can be helped by surgery.' The operation costs around £6,500 privately, £3,800 to the NHS. It is available for foot drop at the surgeon's discretion.","Peter Austin, 53, from Leeds, had a slipped disk which squashed a nerve .

"It is hardly what you expect when splashing out up to £9,000 on first class flights to the Caribbean. But after treating himself to the 'trip of a lifetime', TV news presenter Owen Thomas was horrified to find dirt and grime caked around his first class seat. Videoing the evidence, the former BBC anchorman posted the evidence on Twitter, dubbing the the service 'Filth Class'. When the footrest that forms part of the seat is pulled down, it reveals an area calked in dirt and grime . Narrating the short 30-second video, the presenter explains: 'So this is BA first class and it is abs filthy. You see the marks on here, most of these you can just actually scrape off. 'You see the stains down here. It's when you open your seat that the real horror begins . 'This is first class. This is British Airways First Class. It's disgusting.' The former BBC anchorman and reporter flew off to St Lucia with a companion on Saturday in First Class seats that retail on BA's website for nearly £9,000 each in peak-season January. BA were today advertising seats for this month at £8,798. But he was so disgusted that he posted on Twitter: 'Be shocked. This is what @BritishAirways FIRST CLASS is really like, as we experienced yesterday. Unbelievable.' On YouTube, his video was posted under the headline: 'British Airways First Class – Filth Class' he wrote: 'This is what first class in BA is really like. London to St Lucia on 17th January 2015. The TV presenter told Mailonline that he and his business executive partner flew out of Gatwick on Saturday morning  for a  luxury 10-day break. ‘My partner, Kai and I took this trip after a stressful couple of years where we’ve both been working in different countries. We’re not part of the jet-set. We saved for this once in a lifetime opportunity and I’m really appalled that BA could treat us, or anybody else, with such contempt.’ He added: ‘This is nothing short of corporate greed. They took our money - lots of it - and clearly can’t give a damn about their customers, whether they’re in first or economy.’ After being contacted by MailOnline BA apologised for the poor state of the First Class bay and admitted they had 'fallen short of our usual high standards'. Hinting that part of the fare was paid for in Air Miles points, Mr Thomas said of his travelling companion: 'After two years apart we had points and deserved this as a mega treat. Never again.' Owen Thomas posted the footage on YouTube showing how the area around the seat appeared not to have been cleaned . The surfaces next to the window seat appear to have been splashed but not wiped down after, causing stains . Another nearby traveller who posted under @hotelrepublic a photograph of their own grubby First Class seat said: 'I was sitting next to @OwenThomasTV seat 2a and my seat wasn't much cleaner. Health hazard. 'The purser agreed that it was 'pretty bad' and asked us to fill in a form.' Alex Deane said simply: 'Yuck.' Sky broadcaster Stephen Dixon joined in the chorus of comment tweeting: 'To be fair, you should just travel standard like the rest of us.' TV journalist David Ingles tweeted: 'They would have to pay me to consider getting anywhere near that. Rob Russell said :'I really hope the staff did something about that – looks awful. 'I love British Airways but sometimes they really let themselves down.' British Airways said: 'We have contacted our customer to apologise. We are very sorry that on this occasion we have fallen short of our usual high standards. 'We pride ourselves on delivering a relaxing and pleasant experience in First, and are taking immediate action to address this issue.' BA also said flights to St Lucia in First Class start from £2,700 return and said the £8,798 price it is currently quoting on its official ba.com website for January was ‘misleading’ because it would only be for ‘someone booking at the last minute’. Former BBC journalist Owen Thomas joined financial media firm Bloomberg in 2011 and has become a specialist in economics and business journalism. His website says his career in news started more than twenty years ago. He began while still a student at Aston University, reporting for the BBC's local radio station.

"A piece of papyrus used to make a mask worn by a mummy, may contain the oldest known copy of a gospel. The recycled material bearing part of the Gospel of Mark was written in the first century and predates the next oldest surviving copy of gospel texts by about a century, according to experts. The text, which is set to be published, was extracted using a technique that allows glue used in the construction of mummy masks to be dissolved, without harming ink on the papyrus. It does however, destroy the original artefact. While the death masks of pharaohs may have been made of gold, it was common for lower status ancient Egyptians to be buried with masks constructed from papyrus, paint and glue - a type of papier-mâché. Because papyrus was expensive, people often reused sheets, which were already written on. Scientists at Acadia Divinity College in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, unglued the mask to make the find. Craig Evans, a professor of New Testament Studies, told LiveScience: ‘We're recovering ancient documents from the first, second and third centuries’ used in mummy masks. He said that classical Greek texts including the poetry of Homer, biblical documents, business papers and dated letters have been found so far. Classical Greek texts including the poetry of Homer, biblical documents, business papers and dated letters have also been recovered so far from masks. Papyrus was expensive and so it was recycled to make masks. This famous ancient Egyptian papyrus, which was not recycled, is from the Book of the Dead . Scientists used a controversial technique to recover the fragment of gospel. They used a method that glue used in the construction of mummy masks to be removed, without harming ink on papyrus. It does however, destroy the original artefact. Scholars are debating whether the destruction of artefacts – even if they are not of museum quality – should be used. Professor Evans said the technique is bringing lots of new texts to light and that it’s not uncommon for over 24 to be recovered from just one mask. But archaeologists such as Paul Barford have criticised the work on the gospel. ‘Getting the mask off the wrapping was usually accompanied by the destruction of the whole mummy. Now these guys with their atrocious accents and patronising attitudes are destroying what's left to get their hands on trophy exhibits,’ he wrote in a blog post. Robert Mazza, a lecturer in Classics and Ancient History at the University of Manchester has criticised experts’ speeches about the gospel at conferences in a blog post, saying they are 'not only misinformed, but can even encourage more people to buy mummy masks on the antiquities market and dissolve them in Palmolive soap.' The team was able to date the fragment of gospel by examining documents found in the same mask, which was destroyed because of the destructive nature of the technique. While some scholars have criticised the practice, Professor Evans said that the mask in question was not museum quality and revealed interesting texts. The Gospel according to Mark is the second, and shortest, book of the New Testament. It is thought that Mark wrote his gospel around the mid 60s AD - about 30 years after the events he’s describing. Most scholars regard it as the earliest of the gospels and is the work of an unknown author. In the gospel, Mark tells of Jesus' ministry - from his baptism  to his death and burial and the discovery of the empty tomb. However there is no  birth narrative, nor any post-resurrection appearances. It portrays Jesus as a hero, an exorcist, healer and miracle worker. Jesus keeps his identity as messiah secret, concealing it in parables so that even the disciples fail to understand. All this is in keeping with prophecy, which foretold the fate of the messiah as 'Suffering Servant'. As well as studying the other documents used to make the mask, the experts dated the gospel fragment by examining the handwriting and using carbon dating. Some scholars have criticised the practice of destroying masks made of papyrus (an example is shown) in order to recover the texts used to make them, but Professor Evans says the ones he has worked on - and the one in which the fragment of gospel was found - are not of museum quality .

They think that it was written before the year 90, but more information cannot be shared until the text is published later this year, along with other papyrus pieces found in mummy masks. Despite being small in size, experts claim the Biblical fragment will provide clues as to whether the Gospel of Mark has changed over the centuries. Professor Evans is interested in how long the gospel papyrus was used before being transformed into part of a mask, because it could shed light on how biblical texts were copied over time. He explained: ‘We have every reason to believe that the original writings and their earliest copies would have been in circulation for a hundred years in most cases - in some cases much longer, even 200 years.’ This means that a scribe copying a script in the third century, could, for example, work from an original written centuries before. The fragment of papyrus and other texts obtained from mummy masks will be published later this year.","Scientists at Acadia Divinity College in Nova Scotia used a destructive technique to extract the fragment of papyrus from the mask .

"A policewoman has died following a mystery illness only four weeks after her baby girl was born. Officer Becci Dadswell, 35, was spending time with her newborn baby Isabella when she suddenly suffered acute pains. She died two and a half hours later in hospital. Police officer Becci Dadswell, 35, (pictured) died following a mystery illness after suffering acute pains . The former nurse had given birth to her first child, baby girl Isabella, only four weeks before her death . Husband Simon paid tribute saying 'she was an amazing woman, the kindest you could ever meet' She had given birth to her first child in December and there were no signs of any infection of problems. Tonight, her husband Simon, 39, told MailOnline: 'It's devastating. It's terrible. She was an amazing woman, the kindest you could ever meet. 'She was a caring person, gentle and bubbly. Words can't do it justice. 'She was a very pretty, beautiful person. She was like a Disney princess in her attitude to life.' He added: 'It was hard because she really wanted a baby and she got her wish. 'I knew she would be a fantastic mother because she used to be a nurse and was very caring.' Speaking about the day itself, he told MailOnline: 'I was in the house with her when she collapsed and I went in the back of the ambulance with her. 'I'm glad I was there but it's just a desperate situation when the person you love drops in front of you. I thought she had fainted, but then realised it was much more serious. 'It's hard to understand why it happened but it doesn't matter one way or the other because it isn't going to bring her back.' Married to Simon in 2013, Mrs Dadswell was also a mother to step-children Lydia, 14, and Daisy, 13. Her family said she was desperate to become a mother and her death had left them 'shocked' Mrs Dadswell suffered acute pains at around 12.30pm on January 5 and died shortly after at Whiston Hospital near Liverpool. It is not clear what caused the young mother's death. Her parents, Alan and Denise Butler, spoke of their heartbreak at her loss. Mr Butler said: 'You could see the love between Becci and Bella. 'She would hold her in her arms and look at her as if she couldn't believe she had given birth to her. 'We had a lovely family Christmas and New Year before it all went wrong. 'She saw the best in people. Where others would lose patience, she'd give them the benefit of the doubt.' Mrs Butler added: 'She was so excited to be a mum, a loving, caring girl who called me every day.' Mrs Dadswell studied nursing at university in Southampton, and was known for her wonderful bedside manner and care of patients when working at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport. She worked part time in hospitals to fund her studies, and her father believes it was her desire to help people that saw her join Cheshire Police in 2007. She served with Warrington Central Neighbourhood Policing Unit in Orford, Bewsey and Longford, Cheshire. Mr Dadswell said 'I knew she would be a fantastic mother because she used to be a nurse and was so caring' Brother Ben Butler, who is also expecting a child and said the siblings had looked forward to parenthood together, added: 'The whole family is mystified by the causes and shocked. 'As my wife and I became pregnant just a month after my sister, my parents were euphoric about two new grand daughters. Now they have lost a daughter. 'She was one of the kindest souls you could ever meet. As a child she was an aspiring singer and dancer, and started to have some success. 'But one day she had a life epiphany and wanted to contribute to society in a meaningful way. 'She spent time working as a nurse and then surprised us all by becoming a police officer. 'Since her passing the outpouring of grief has been phenomenal - nearly 50,000 people have viewed a tribute video to her on Facebook - and the stories of her kindness have flooded in. 'As a police officer she was known to have consoled both the victims of crime and hugged prisoners, take homeless people for walks and always show compassion to those around her.' A fundraising page has now been set up by friend Louise Shaw for Isabella, following her mother's death . Friend Louise Shaw has now set up a trust fund for Isabella, so the baby's future will be provided for - to donate visit http://gogetfunding.com/project/becci-dadswell. So far the site has raised £6,400 in donations. Ms Shaw said: 'We have set up this page on behalf of all her family and close friends and work colleagues who knew and loved her so well in support of her husband Si and new born daughter Bella Rose Becci Dadswell. 'Many of you have asked how you can pay tribute to Becci in supporting her new family and their future and the overwhelming suggestion was to provide for Bella's future, in particular her education. 'Becci's little world was complete when Bella was born less than a month ago. 'She left this world having her Daddy walk her up the aisle, marrying 'the one' and being the best step-mum to Lydia and Daisy and finally experiencing motherhood for herself. Albeit for not very long.' A memorial service will take place in Romsey, Hampshire, Mrs Dadswell's home town, on Friday. Well-wishers are welcome at Romsey Abbey with the service due to start at noon.","Police officer Becci Dadswell died suddenly following a mystery illness .

"Victim: Police said Aiwa Matsuko was killed during a visit to the accused schoolgirl's apartment . In one of the most grisly crimes tackled by Japanese police, a schoolgirl has been arrested for strangling a classmate, severing her head and chopping off one of her hands. Police who went to the 15-year-old high school girl's apartment in Sasebo, 900 miles south west of Tokyo, found the bedroom soaked in blood, with the decapitated body of her friend lying on the bed. The 15-year-old suspect was being interviewed today to establish the reason for the alleged murder. Police named the victim as Aiwa Matsuko, also 15, who died when she visited the accused schoolgirl's apartment in Sasebo, in Nagasaki Prefecture, 900 miles south west of Tokyo. Police alleged that the suspect struck Matsuo on the back of the head more than 10 times with a blunt instrument and while she was unconscious strangled her. Then as a final act, it is alleged, the suspect, who has not been named because she is a minor, cut off Matsuo's head and her left hand with a large knife. The horrific crime came to light after Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home. Police said Matsuo had earlier sent a message to her parents to say she was going to visit her friend at her apartment - then later sent her parents a text at around 7pm to say she was about to leave for home. What had started out as a casual inquiry about a schoolgirl returning home late from a friend's house turned out to be an alleged investigation into one of the country's most shocking crimes in recent years. Police found Matsuko's body lying on the suspect's blood-soaked bed. The knife and an unspecified 'blunt instrument' were lying nearby. Scroll down for video . Suspect: A van carrying a schoolgirl - who was arrested on suspicion of killing a school friend at her home - leaves a police station for the prosecutor's office in Sasebo in Nagasaki prefecture .

The horrific crime came to light after Aiwa Matsuo's parents contacted police to say their daughter had not returned home . Details: A teacher at the school which both the victim and suspect attended tells assembled media about the staff's response to the grisly murder following an emergency meeting . Location: Both the victim and the suspect attended this school in the small town of Sasebo. The murder  comes just 10 years after Sasebo was rocked by a primary school girl being stabbed to death by a classmate . Officers said the two girls were alone in the apartment at the time of the crime. They alleged that the suspect, who did not live with her parents, admitted murdering her friend. 'She has not provided us with a motive for the attack at the moment,' said a police spokesman. The victim had graduated from the same junior high school as the suspect. The murder comes 10 years after Sasebo, with a population of 270,000, was rocked by the killing of a primary school girl who was stabbed by a classmate.","Victim Aiwa Matsuko, 15, went to visit school friend in Sasebo, west of Tokyo .

"Getting fit is one of the most commonly made New Year's resolution, but in the toughest month of the year for financial worries, getting fit is often an expensive task. It's also a handy excuse if you are only half serious about toning your tummy and thighs. But now there one less excuse to stop you from getting healthy - Poundland has launched a range of fitness products for just £1 per item. Poundland has launched a range of 37 fitness products that cost just £1 each . In response to ever-increasing exercise costs, Poundland has launched a new range of fitness products . The discount store is now selling everything from free weights and protein shakes to yoga mats and sports bottles. The range has come at a welcome time for people in low income households - a recent report found a yearly gym membership for a council-run venue now costs £368 on average, with evening fitness classes at £5.95 per visit. Separate research has also found the average Briton will spend more than £37,000 on health and fitness fads in their lifetime. Poundland are now hoping their 37-piece range of £1 fitness products will be enticing to Brits who can't afford these prices. The low-cost retailer's new ActivLife range also includes weight gloves, protein bars, work out towels, skipping ropes and gym bags.

"Romanian Ioan Timofte has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in a trial which could cost the taxpayer £10,000 . A jury trial to find out whether a Romanian put his hand on a Polish woman’s bare leg will cost at least £10,000. A judge yesterday questioned whether such an outlay is needed over an apparently drunken incident outside a nightclub. Lasting three to four days, the trial will require both a Romanian interpreter for the defendant and at least one Polish interpreter for the victim and witnesses. If it does last four days, it will cost at least £8,600, according to Ministry of Justice figures. With interpreters costing £615 each – plus their expenses – the trial could result in a five-figure bill for taxpayers. Ioan Timofte, 25, has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, last April, two months after he moved from Romania to the UK. The carpenter and joiner, who is believed to work for Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, has also denied assaulting the woman’s fiance. Judge Jamie Tabor QC asked prosecutor Kannan Siva if it was correct that the allegation is that Timofte drunkenly touched the woman’s pelvis area over her clothing. Mr Siva said: ‘It was her bare leg and an attempt was made to touch between her legs. She was wearing a short skirt.’ The judge then told Gloucester Crown Court: ‘So we are having a three to four day trial to determine whether or not this defendant touched a lady’s leg when he was drunk outside a nightclub?’ He questioned why Timofte, who says he is in a relationship on his Facebook profile, had not been offered a police caution, as would usually happen in such cases. Administered by police, a caution is an alternative to prosecution used to resolve minor cases where a full – and costly – prosecution is not deemed necessary. Mr Siva said the decision to proceed with the charges against Timofte was partly because there was an independent witness, a security guard, who claims to have seen the sexual assault in Gloucester. Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The judge’s word is final, but taxpayers will wonder whether this case could have avoided court. ‘There’s an argument that the police should make better use of the caution in situations where it is merited so that taxpayers aren’t on the hook for unnecessary court cases. ‘Right across the justice system, the wheels must move a little quicker.’ The cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters has almost doubled to £15.5million in just one year, according to official figures released last year. The bill for translators brought in to assist non-English speakers appearing at magistrates or Crown courts for criminal cases soared from £7.9million in 2012. The three to four-day trial at Gloucester Crown Court could will involve paying interpreters £615 each, plus expensses, according to Ministry of Justice figures . The figures, uncovered in Freedom of Information responses from the Ministry of Justice, appear to show the rise occurred since services were outsourced to under-fire firm Capita Translation and Interpreting. They were revealed after the handling of court foreign language services to just one company was branded ‘shambolic’ by MPs amid concerns the change had caused trials to collapse or be delayed. Farcical episodes that have emerged since privatisation include the case of a man who was charged with perverting the course of justice was instead accused of being a ‘pervert’. And in a burglary case at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, a retrial was ordered when it emerged that the Romanian interpreter had muddled the words ‘beaten’ and ‘bitten’. Earlier this month it was revealed that taxpayers are spending at total of £100million every year on interpreters to help immigrants who cannot speak English. Police, town halls, hospitals and courts are all spending huge sums on translating documents and providing professional interpreters to assist people with poor English. The most common nationalities to require interpreters in Britain are Polish, Lithuanian and Romanian. Timofte has been bailed and will appear at Gloucester Crown Court for trial on June 22.

"Astronomers have for the first time seen a 'fast radio burst' – a short, sharp flash of radio waves from an unknown source – tearing through space. The discovery brings scientists a step closer to understanding the strange 'alien' phenomenon, which astronomers worldwide are vying to explain. Lasting only milliseconds, the first such radio burst was discovered in 2007 by astronomers combing the Parkes telescope data archive for unrelated objects. Scroll down for video . Astronomers have for the first time seen a 'fast radio burst' – a short, sharp flash of radio waves from an unknown source – tearing through space. The discovery brings scientists a step closer to understanding the strange 'alien' phenomenon, which astronomers worldwide are vying to explain . Exactly what may be causing these cosmic chirps represents a major new enigma. Possibilities range from evaporating black holes to alien communication and mergers of neutron stars. Six more bursts, apparently from outside our galaxy, have now been found with the Parkes telescope and a seventh with the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. 'We're the first to catch one in real time,' said Emily Petroff, a PhD candidate co-supervised at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. 'These bursts were generally discovered weeks or months or even more than a decade after they happened.' Lasting only milliseconds, the first such radio burst was discovered in 2007 by astronomers combing the Parkes telescope (pictured) data archive for unrelated objects . Banking that she'd spot a 'live' burst, Ms Petroff had an international team poised to make rapid follow-up observations, at wavelengths from radio to X-rays. After Parkes saw the burst go off the team swung into action on twelve telescopes around the world – in Australia, California, the Canary Islands, Chile, Germany, Hawai'i, and India – and in space. First discovered in 2007, 'fast radio bursts' continue to defy explanation. These cosmic chirps last for only a thousandth of a second. Possibilities of what causes them include a range of exotic astrophysical objects, such as evaporating black holes, mergers of neutron stars, or flares from magnetars - a type of neutron star with extremely powerful magnetic fields. 'Another possibility is that they are bursts much brighter than the giant pulses seen from some pulsars,' notes James Cordes, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University and co-author of the new study. So far seven more bursts, apparently from outside our galaxy, have now been found with Parkes telescope and a seventh with the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. No optical, infrared, ultraviolet or X-ray counterpart showed up. 'That in itself rules out some possible candidates, such as long gamma-ray bursts and nearby supernovae,' said team member Dr Mansi Kasliwal of the Carnegie Institution in Pasadena, California. But short or low-energy gamma-ray bursts and giant flares from distant magnetars - the most magnetic stars in the universe - are still contenders, she added. So too are imploding neutron stars. One of the big unknowns of fast radio bursts is their distances. The characteristics of the radio signal – how it is 'smeared out' in frequency from travelling through space – indicate that the source of the new burst was up to 5.5 billion light-years away. 'That means it could have given off as much energy in a few milliseconds as the sun does in a day,' said team member Dr Daniele Malesani of the University of Copenhagen. The burst left another clue as to its identity, but a puzzling one. Parkes's real-time detection system captured its polarisation – something that had not been recorded for previous bursts. Polarisation can be thought of as the direction electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio waves, 'vibrate'. It can be linear or circular. The radio emission from the new fast radio burst was more than 20 per cent circularly polarised – which hints that there are strong magnetic fields near the source. Identifying the origin of the fast radio bursts is now only a matter of time. 'We've set the trap,' said Ms Petroff. 'Now we just have to wait for another burst to fall into it.' The Parkes Observatory, also known informally as 'The Dish' is a radio telescope observatory, located  north of the town of Parkes, New South Wales, Australia .","This is the first time a 'fast radio burst' has been captured in real-time .

"The mother of missing Ben Needham is pleading for police to investigate a tiny village in Greece where eight witnesses have claimed to have seen her son. Earlier this month, the Home Office agreed to fund a team of British detectives to help search for the toddler, who went missing in Greece more than 20 years ago. Ben, from Sheffield, vanished, aged 21 months, on July 24, 1991, after travelling to the Greek island of Kos with his mother and grandparents. Now, Kerry Needham is urging detectives to use the £700,000 funding to visit the 'strange little village' in Veria on the Greek mainland - hundreds of miles from Kos - where eight witnesses claimed they spotted Ben. Ben Needham, left, was just 21 months old when he went missing on Greek holiday island Kos in 1991. His mother Kerry, right, has never stopped the search for her son . Ben's family have said they want South Yorkshire Police to investigate leads, including a file they have handed in that lists eight separate sightings in the mid to late 90s from unconnected people of a boy who could potentially be Ben with the same Greek family. Ms Needham told The Mirror: 'I'm praying they will listen to me and follow up these sightings.' 'We have searched all over the world but it always comes back to this strange little village. 'I am sure the key to finding my son lies with this family. I believe 99% Ben was there 1994 to 1998.' In 2012, the Home Office backed a South Yorkshire Police operation when land was excavated on Kos, near the farmhouse from where Ben went missing. But no trace of the little boy was found.

"A surge in interest in the Greens has taken the party to 11 per cent in a new opinion poll. The new survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens up three points in just a week, ahead of the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip, after their profile was boosted by a row over being excluded from TV debates. The poll and focus group findings will make grim reading for the other parties, with Labour and the Tories both on less than 30 per cent and Ed Miliband likened to a zoo animal 'you're not bothered whether you see or not'. The latest survey for Lord Ashcroft puts the Green party on 11 per cent, up three points in a week . While much attention has been focused on the rise of Ukip in recent months, the Greens have made steady gains. The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November. The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously. One in five people saying they will back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win. The Ashcroft survey puts the Tories ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip is on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Lord Ashcroft said: 'One factor could be that the Greens have benefited from their prominence in the arguments over TV debates – in which case it will be interesting to see in the coming weeks whether they can sustain their share.' The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously, with former Lib Dems turning Green . As a nation of animal lovers, it is no surprise Britons come to see their politicians as members of the animal kingdom. But a lot depends on whether they are a predator or prey depends. Lord Ashcroft asked a series of focus groups what they thought of the party leaders. He found David Cameron was viewed as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was branded a peacock or a weasel while Nick Clegg was dismissed as 'a Chihuahua in David Cameron’s handbag'. But Labour's Ed Miliband left most voters blank, telling the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' Today Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'. She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster. Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders. Ms Bennett said: 'I have seen a whole slew of surveys last week that showed that the public want the Green Party represented in these debates, and of course we had a petition with 275,000 people saying, 'invite the Greens'. 'The arguments don't stack up - the broadcasters have to invite the Greens.' 'It is very clear that we should be there if this is going to be a balanced debate.' Ms Bennett said it was time to move on from the traditional 'old boys' club of Westminster, and that debates should be inclusive and help promote that. Last week she wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip Leader Nigel Farage, urging them to back calls for them to be involved in the debates. She revealed Mr Farage had written back to her, 'basically saying 'no'.' 'This is the Green surge,' Ms Bennett said. 'We don't know where it is going, but it is certain that politics in Britain is not going to be the same again, and that is a very good thing. 'Let's get past the debating about the debates and let's actually debate the issues that we so desperately need, given the state of Britain today.' Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics' Asked what sort of animal Labour's Ed Miliband would be, the focus group told the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' David Cameron was viewed by voters as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody' Ms Bennett said the 'Green surge' pointed to the fact that politics is changing 'very fast', and that the main political parties were afraid of the political ground shifting. She said: 'There is a real potential at this election that we could see politics break wide open.' Polls and studies suggest Britain politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election, with at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition. At the weekend political commentator Iain Dale predict Labour will win 300 seats and the Tories 279, but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 MPs in the Commons. A separate survey showed a third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet. Mr Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May.","Ashcroft poll puts Greens ahead of Lib Dems and just behind Ukip .

"One of the biggest global pornography websites has exposed Australians' explicit online habits and stood them up against the world's other big porn consumers. Pornhub's 2014 year in review revealed that Australia was the eighth biggest porn viewer in the world and ranked seventh in the world for page views per capita, with the average Aussie clicking on the website 96 times. The top gong went to the United States in both categories, however Australians can let out a sigh of relief as New Zealand ranked one spot higher in views per person. Scroll down for video . Pornhub's 2014 year in review revealed that Australia ranked seventh in the world for page views per capita just after New Zealand, with the average Aussie clicking on the website 96 times . The average Aussie's visit to Pornhub lasts 9 minutes and 33 second with most people choosing to view the material on their phone and only 33 per cent of porn viewed on a computer (stock image) 'Lesbian' topped the list of popular search terms followed closely by 'teen', 'milf', 'massage' and then 'squirt', all of which also fell into the global top seven favourites. Moving away from mainstream adult industry personalities, Aussies clearly prefer their reality television celebrities with Kim Kardashian dubbed the country's 'top porn star'. Interestingly, she was also revealed to be the favourite amongst women worldwide. Apparently Aussies also love to watch their porn on the go with 50 per cent of the country's explicit material being watched on mobile phones. The website also showed that Australia was the eighth biggest porn viewer in the world . Only 34 per cent of porn was viewed on a desktop computer while 16 per cent was seen on a tablet device.

Nepalese viewers were revealed to have the longest visit duration in the world, taking their time at 13 minutes and 39 seconds, while Azerbaijan proved the quickest with an average of six and a half minutes. Pornhub even revealed the friskiest day of the week according to Australians whose viewing habits peek on a Friday and drops to their lowest on Saturday. The month of November had the highest number of views while February ranked the lowest and Australians' viewings were also recorded as being significantly interrupted by public holidays.

"Actor Billy Crystal has said graphic scenes of gay sex on TV have gone too far, and the industry must take care not to 'shove it in our face'. Crystal, who became one of network television's first gay characters on comedy show Soap in the 1970s, said contemporary programs are 'pushing it a little too far'. He declined to cite any examples, but implied that intolerant attitudes he struggled with while playing Jodie Dallas from 1977 to 1981 have now swung the other way. Scroll down for video . Remarks: Crystal expressed his opinion at a showbiz talk show audience . According to The Wrap, he told an audience at the Television Critics Association press tour in Pasadena, California: 'Sometimes, it’s just pushing it a little too far for my taste and I’m not going to reveal to you which ones they are. 'I hope people don’t abuse it and shove it in our face… to the point where it feels like an every day kind of thing.' He had earlier described how audiences were slow to accept openly gay moments in Soap while it was being aired on ABC - particularly when he was interacting with on-screen boyfriend Bob Seagren, who played Dennis Phillips. Back in the day: Crystal, shown above in character as Jodie Dallas, one of network TV's first gay characters . He told the audience: 'It was very difficult at the time - Jodie was really the first recurring [gay] character on network television and it was a different time, it was 1977. 'So, yeah, it was awkward. It was tough.' 'I did it in front of a live audience and there were times when I would say to Bob, ""I love you,"" and the audience would laugh nervously. 'I wanted to stop the taping and go, ""What is your problem?""' However, Crystal later rowed back on his comments and said: 'Maybe I shouldn't have said anything today'. Gratuitous: Crystal criticized the scenes, such as this one from HBO's True Blood . 'Don't want to see that': Crystal did not initially name shows, but HBO's Game of Thrones, above, has been noted for its many explicit scenes . In a discussion reported in a blog on Xfinity, Crystal first blasted the today's culture of taking offense, then expressed his regret over speaking out at all. He said: 'We live in a very scary time in many ways. You can’t say this, you can’t say that, you can’t offend this group, that group. 'People come up to you and ask if you were offended. I don’t understand that. I understand it why everyone is watching out for the other person. That’s offensive to me.' He also said that his comments apply to heterosexual sex scenes as well as gay ones. He said: 'When it gets too far either visually…now, that world exists because it does for the hetero world, it exists, and I don’t want to see that either.' He and fellow star Josh Gad later referenced HBO's Girls as a show which features large amounts of gratuitous sex scenes.","Actor didn't say which shows offend him but said many are 'pushing it'

"Democrats don't know enough about most of their party's possible presidential candidates to be able to say whether they should run for higher office or not, a new poll shows. Of the seven Democratic politicians tested by CBS News, just two, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden were well enough known for members of their own political party to come to a decision about their candidacy. Republican politicians fared slightly better. Six of the 13 potential candidates tested by CBS were recognizable enough for self-identified Republicans to offer an opinion on their potential campaigns. Who?: Most Democrats don't know about either of these men to be able to determine whether or not they should run for president in 2016. On the left is outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. On the right is former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. Webb is the only Democrat to have formally announced his candidacy for higher office . On the Republican side, a majority of Republicans said they were familiar with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Pain, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. They were mostly unfamiliar with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, outgoing Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. They also said they didn't know very much about Rick Santorum despite the fact that the former Pennsylvania senator formally sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, winning nearly a dozen states. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham confirmed on Sunday that he was 'testing the waters' for a possible 2016 presidential campaign. 'I am definitely going to look at it,' Graham, a rumored candidate for the GOP nomination, said on Meet the Press. 'I think the world is falling apart, and I’ve been more right than wrong when it comes to foreign policy,' he said. 'But we’ll see.' Graham is known for his hawkish views on foreign policy and his close friendship with 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain. Most popular among Republicans was Romney. Respondents said 59 percent to 26 percent that Romney should run again. The former Massachusetts governor delivered a shock to the GOP presidential field after he indicated recently that he was interested in making a third attempt at the White House after losing to Barack Obama in the last election and Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 during his party's primary. Bush came in second with a 50 percent approval rating for his likely presidential campaign. A Huckabee candidacy was the third most favored option  at 40 percent. No other Republicans even came close to the three frontrunners. Palin scored well with 30 percent of GOP respondents, Christie 29 percent, Paul 27 percent and Rubio 26 percent. All other Republican candidates included in the poll didn't make it above 25 percent. Not tested in the poll was South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said yesterday that he is 'testing the waters' for a 2016 run. Democratic politicians included in the survey were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Clinton, outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton continues to be popular with her party, earning the approval of 85 percent of Democratic respondents in the CBS poll. Biden was the most viable alternative with a 40 percent favorability rating. Progressive icon Elizabeth Warren was surprisingly unknown by 57 percent of Democrats. Just 23 percent said she should run for president.","Of seven Democrats tested, just two, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, were well enough known for their political party to come to a decision .

"ISIS cell members who used animals to practice how to behead people are the first to be discovered operating in Israel. The seven men were caught just before executing an attack, Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency said. All seven admitted to belonging to ISIS and that they were part of a plot to attack Druze Israelis - a branch of Shia Islam - as well as police officers and the security service. Scroll down for video . Members of the first ISIS cell in Israel were caught using animals to practice how to behead people ahead of an imminent attack (file picture) The defendants, who are thought to be the first ISIS members to be discovered operating in Israel, were arrested in Haifa and charged with joining and aiding the terrorist group as well as attempting to contact terrorists abroad. It is believed that the men, all from the northern city of Sakhnin, were trying to set up a branch of the terrorist network in Israel. The Jerusalem Post named the men as Adnan Aladin, 40, a lawyer in Nazareth, Hasam Marisat, 30, Karim Abu-Tzalah, 22, Alaa Abu-Tzalah, 27, Halad Abu Tzahalh, 30, Sarif Khaled Abu-Tzalah, 29, and Muhammad Abu Tazalah, 27. Israeli security services said that the men were planning to flee to Syria to fight for ISIS after carrying out their attack in Israel. The seven men were caught by Israeli security services in the northern city of Haifa and were charged with joining terrorist network ISIS (file picture) The extremist group currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria, where it has beheaded scores of captives. Victims include western journalists and aid workers such as Britons David Haines and Alan Henning and Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Thousands of Muslims from Western countries are believed to have flocked to Syria to join ISIS, including an estimated 30 Israelis. Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to increase trade with the Far East following a 'wave of Islamisation' in western Europe. The Israeli Prime Minister said rising hostility in Europe had forced his hand into expanding trade with countries like Japan, China and India. 'We definitely want to reduce our dependence on certain markets in western Europe,' Mr Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting yesterday. 'Western Europe is undergoing a wave of Islamisation, of anti-Semitism, and of anti-Zionism. It is awash in such waves, and we want to ensure that for years to come the state of Israel will have diverse markets all over the world.' His remarks came as Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, arrived in Israel with a trade delegation. According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, Europe accounted for 45.8 percent of imports and 35.8 percent of exports in the first 11 months of 2014. Asia accounted for 22.5 percent of Israeli imports and 25.4 percent of exports. Viewers of Israel's parliamentary TV channel were asked: 'Can Israel do without exports to Europe and pursue policy that is liable to bring about an economic embargo?' 62 two percent of Israelis said no and 32 percent said yes.","ISIS cell caught using animals to practice how to behead people .

"When you're engrossed in the latest blockbuster at the cinema, there is perhaps nothing more annoying than another person checking their noisy, luminous phone nearby. But a patent granted to Microsoft may go some way to solving this problem, because if integrated into Windows phones, it could automatically adjust the settings to make it less intrusive. The ‘inconspicuous mode’ would automatically adjust the brightness and volume of a handset, so when a user checked the time, for example, the screen would look dimmer and show simplified information, while the phone would be muted too. Microsoft has been granted a patent for 'inconspicuous mode,' which would automatically adjust the brightness and volume of a handset  to show a a dimmer and simplified screen (right) The patent was granted last week, having been submitted in 2013 and shows the feature is intended to be used in theatres, cinemas and when a smartphone user is going to sleep, The Next Web reported. An illustration in the patent shows a simplified version of a home screen, which is dimmed with the time clearly displayed in the centre. The feature would mean that checking the time on a phone in the middle of the night, would be less likely to wake someone up, or distract someone in a cinema. The patent was granted last week, having been submitted in 2013 and shows the feature is intended to be used when a smartphone user is going to sleep as well as in cinemas, where noisy phones with bright screens can be very distracting for people trying to concentrate on a film (illustrated with a stock image) Microsoft applied for the patent in 2013 and it was granted last week. 'Inconspicuous mode' is intended for use before bed, during meetings and in the cinema, for example. It would automatically adjust the brightness and volume of a handset using GPS, or a calendar entry, for example. An illustration in the patent shows a simplified version of a home screen, which is dimmed with the time clearly displayed in the centre. According to the patent, sensors on the device could launch the mode when a smartphone user is visiting a cinema, or it could be switched on manually. Phone features such as GPS, Wi-Fi addresses and other data, such as the online purchase of a cinema ticket in the device’s browser, could also be used to detect when to switch on inconspicuous mode. It could also be turned on based on notes in a user’s calendar – for instance, if someone has a cinema visit marked in for a certain time. According to the patent, sensors on the device could launch the mode when a smartphone user is visiting a cinema, or it could be switched on manually. Phone features such as GPS, Wi-Fi addresses and other data, such as the online purchase of a cinema ticket in the device’s browser, could also be used to detect when to switch on inconspicuous mode. Similarly, it could be turned on based on notes in a user’s calendar – for instance, if they have a cinema visit marked in for a certain time. Users could exit the mode at will, or it would be turned off automatically after leaving a venue, for example. While Windows Phones currently don't have such a sophisticated app, they support a feature called 'quiet hours'. Using Cortana - Windows Phone's personal assistant - a user can block out chunks of time for their phone to be on silent and go straight to voicemail. It can be set up to allow texts through during this time from specific numbers and send a reply to others saying a user is busy. A similar 'do not disturb' app is available for Android handsets that uses calendar notifications to know when to silence a handset or turn on night mode. It mutes calls and notifications during 'quiet time' and can be set up to be silent during office hours, meetings, calendar appointments or overnight. There already similar apps available, including one for Android handsets.

"Virtual reality, drones and data centers are behind a massive hiring spree at Facebook set to swell its ranks as much as 14 per cent, according to a review of job listings on the company's website. The social networking company aims to add nearly 1,200 new employees, the outgrowth of aggressive investments that executives have said will define the coming year. Oculus Rift, the maker of virtual reality headsets that Facebook acquired in a $2billion deal last year, is among the key areas slated for growth, with 54 jobs listed on its website. Scroll down for video . Work for me? Facebook is advertising for another 1,200 employees on its website. COO Sheryl Sandberg, right, said the hiring spree is because of 'ambitious' CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Facebook had 8,348 full-time employees at the end of September, far fewer than Google's roughly 55,000 employees or Microsoft Corp's roughly 127,000 (Microsoft announced in the summer that it plans to cut 18,000 jobs). At the same time, Facebook gets more out of each employee, according to calculations using company revenue figures. Facebook's revenue works out to roughly $384,000 per employee in the third quarter of 2014, versus $300,000 for Google and $183,000 for Microsoft. That efficiency has helped Facebook enjoy rich profit margins. Among the roles that Facebook needs to fill for the Oculus business are managers to oversee logistics, procurement and global supply chain planning - a sign, some analysts say, that the product is nearing its commercial release. The hiring spree is likely to bring with it bumper salaries - it was recently revealed that even entry-level engineers at the company earn $106,000. The market for virtual reality headsets is still nascent. But if virtual reality takes off for entertainment, gaming, communications or computing, Facebook could be at the center of the new platform with Oculus. Facebook's ambitious effort to build its own satellites and drones capable of delivering Internet service to remote regions of the world is another important area for hiring: the program has Facebook searching for specialists in areas such as avionics, radio frequency communications and thermal engineering. 'We are an ambitious company run by an ambitious CEO,' Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said. 'Our users are growing and our business is growing and we want to support that,' she said, noting that Facebook's business is much more expansive today than a few years ago, with offices throughout the world. The jobs run a gamut from sales people to software engineers for Facebook's 1.35-billion-member social network. Facebook's growth spurt comes as the company expands into new markets and faces stiffening competition from web rivals Google Inc , Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and well-capitalized start-ups such as Snapchat. New tech: Conference guests try out a prototype Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in Las Vegas. Facebook's hiring intentions could indicate that the device is going to ship soon . 'There's a fairly direct correlation between their investment in people and servers and infrastructure, and their ability to remain competitive,' said Robert Baird & Co analyst Colin Sebastian. Facebook had 8,348 full-time employees at the end of September, far fewer than Google's roughly 55,000 employees or Microsoft Corp's roughly 127,000 (Microsoft announced in the summer that it plans to cut 18,000 jobs).

Facebook's revenue works out to roughly $384,000 per employee in the third quarter of 2014, versus $300,000 for Google and $183,000 for Microsoft. That efficiency has helped Facebook enjoy rich profit margins. And the company's relatively small headcount provides an important talking point in the battle to attract the most talented computer programmers. Facebook has long touted to potential recruits their ability to work directly on products used by hundreds of millions of people, a marked contrast to some larger tech companies. 'We're growing as fast as we can, where the ""can"" part is really a factor of how many people we can absorb while maintaining a strong culture,' Paul Carduner, an engineering manager who runs Facebook's Seattle office, told Reuters at one of the company's famed 'Hackathon' events last week. The hackathons feature Facebook programmers hunched over their computers and working through the night on personal projects that could eventually become Facebook products. Facebook is growing exponentially in Seattle, a tech hub with a rich, and relatively cheap, talent pool created by local tech companies Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc . Facebook currently has more than 400 employees in Seattle, and is looking for a larger site close to the center of the city that could hold as many as 2,000 people, according to a person familiar with the matter. At Facebook's Menlo Park, California, headquarters, construction is expected to be completed this year on a new, roughly 500,000 square foot building designed by architect Frank Gehry that can accommodate 3,000 employees. Atlas, the online advertising technology that Facebook acquired in 2013, is another big area of hiring, with more than 20 open positions listed. The many opportunities Facebook is chasing could lift the company's annual revenue to $30 billion within a few years, estimates Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach. 'To get to that level, they're going to have to get people now,' Bhatia said.","Company currently advertising for huge range of new employees .

"Walking free: A stalker, pictured but cannot be named, subjected his TV star victim to a campaign of 'serious alarm and distress' but was still able to walk free today . A 'sad' loner who stalked a TV personality and made sinister references to the murder of Jill Dando before trying to kiss her outside her office was spared jail today. The middle-aged fantasist bombarded the presenter with 517 tweets and scores of emails, texts and phone calls declaring his love for the woman. Both parties cannot be named for legal reasons. The stalker dreamed of sweeping the victim off her feet on 'a white charger' before getting her 'happily pregnant' and believed they were having a 'cyber-affair'. Judge John Hillen QC said he lived 'a sad, lonely and isolated existence', and told him at the end his trial at Blackfriars Crown Court it was just 'a continuation of your stalking and obsession'. But the man was still allowed to walk free after Mr Justice Hillen gave him a suspended sentence. His trial heard how had terrified the star with messages with bizarre references to crimes including the Jill Dando murder, which the victim made her 'blood run cold' and left her fearing for her life. The Crimewatch presenter was shot outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999, aged 37, and her killer has never been found. The stalker, who now has a permanent restraining order, claimed in court: 'I wanted to start a conversation about the Jill Dando killing, and why nobody ever talks about it'. But the TV personality spoke of her horror at the message, saying: 'For any woman on television - the name Jill Dando - it strikes terror into your heart, that if you are on screen and you are on TV, you are going to get targeted. Reading that, my blood runs cold'. She also described to the court an unwanted kiss on the cheek at a charity event at the O2 Arena, which prosecutors claimed amounted to sexual assault. 'I felt humiliated wiping that [saliva] off my cheek', the victim said. But the obsessive argued it was a 'flamboyant air-kiss' to say thanks for an autograph, and that his behaviour was not sexually motivated. The stalker - who described himself as 'cheeky' - even tried to bring hand-warmers to her office as a gift and sent her an inscribed edition of romantic novel The Scarlet Letter for Christmas. As a result, bosses insisted she stop taking public transport and police advised her to step up her home security. The stalker, who was one of the first prosecuted under the tougher Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, was convicted after a trial at Blackfriars Crown Court. Fear: The stalker mentioned the unsolved murder of Jill Dando in 1992, which he claimed was just for a general conversation, but his victim said she then feared for her like . But he walked free from court after Judge John Hillen QC said he lived 'a sad existence' and was 'lonely and isolated'. He said: 'You contested this trial before the jury. It seems to me - in my judgment - that it was apparent that the trial was a continuation of your stalking and obsession. 'You gained pleasure from having [your victim] in the witness box all to satisfy your vanity and self-gratification. 'She was left feeling that she constantly had to be careful for herself and her family. Your unwanted attentions therefore had an adverse effect on her usual day-to-day activities. 'In short, you took away her peace of mind. Your repeated behaviour, your pestering of her was unacceptable, oppressive and demonstrated obsessive attention towards her.' The judge added he was satisfied he 'had followed her or watched her at the restaurant to which she took contacts'. He sentenced the stalker to six months imprisonment suspended for 18 months and an indefinite restraining order. Neither the stalker nor the victim can be named. Defence counsel Karen Walton said her client was 'theatrical and fantastical' and said he 'apologises profusely' and'has had to hang his head in shame'. Referring to her client's health problems, Miss Walton commented, 'He is a fairly classic example of somebody who can't physically go out and see the world but becomes infatuated with what he has seen through his computer.' Trial: The fantasist had denied stalking and a sex assault saying that he and the woman were friends and he believed they had a 'cyber-affair' The stalker had claimed to be in a 'cyber-affair' with the presenter, after she politely replied to a handful of emails and Tweets about current affairs. 'She and I had had a pen-pal relationship on email', he said at his trial, adding: 'I sent her an email and she wrote back to me. She was so friendly. She wrote back to me straight away.' The stalker, from north London, was convicted of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. Jurors failed to return a verdict on the alleged sexual assault, and prosecutors asked for the count to lie on the file. He was ordered to contribute £250 to prosecution costs of £2,000.","'Loner' bombarded her with 517 tweets and dozens of emails and texts .

"As the Dawn spacecraft closes in on Ceres, new images have emerged showing the solar system's largest asteroid at 27 pixels across - three times better than the images taken in early December. Over the next weeks, Dawn will provide increasingly sharper images of the icy world, leading up to the spacecraft's capture into orbit around Ceres on March 6. 'We know so much about the solar system and yet so little about dwarf planet Ceres. Now, Dawn is ready to change that,' said Marc Rayman, Dawn's chief engineer and mission director, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. As the Dawn spacecraft closes in on Ceres, new images have emerged showing the solar system's largest asteroid at 27 pixels across - three times better than the images taken in early December.  This GIF shows bright and dark features . This most recent images from Dawn were taken January 13 at a distance of 238,000 miles (383,000 km). While these latest images from Dawn aren’t quite as sharp as Hubble’s images from January 2004, Nasa says they will be very soon. 'Already, the [latest] images hint at first surface structures such as craters,' said Andreas Nathues, lead investigator for the framing camera team. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second. This is a raw image, taken January 13, 2015. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb (6kg) per second . On the left is a processed image, taken January 13. It hints at craters on the surface of Ceres. Dawn's framing camera took this image at 238,000 miles (383,000km) from Ceres. On the right, is a zoomed-in raw image . 'Now, finally, we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious, alien world,' Dawn mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman, of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California said. 'Soon it will reveal myriad secrets Ceres has held since the dawn of the solar system.' Observations by the European Space Agency's Herschel telescope suggested they could be coming from geysers or ice volcanoes. Ceres orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and is very similar to Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus - both considered potential sources for harbouring life. Ceres is the bright spot in the centre of the image. Because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background, the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible. The long exposure made Ceres appear overexposed, and exaggerated its size A cropped, magnified view of Ceres appears in the inset image at lower left . Dawn will be captured into Ceres' orbit in March, marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. In January, researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface . Ceres is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. Scientists think Ceres may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. It is due to land next year. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice, water, and minerals. Dr Michael Kuppers, of the Esa's lab in Villanueva de la Canada in Spain said: 'Although ground and space-based observations may further map the behaviour of Ceres over its orbit the Dawn spacecraft mission arriving to orbit Ceres in early 2015 is expected to be key in providing a long-term follow-up on the water outgassing behaviour of Ceres.' The presence and abundance of water in bodies like Ceres could have relevance for the origin of life on Earth and the large-scale migration of planets such as Jupiter. One scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early Earth and Moon - delivering organic molecules and water to Earth. Ceres is twice the size of Saturn's geyser-spouting moon Enceladus which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform. Since launching in 2007, Dawn has already visited Vesta, a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles (168 million km) away from Ceres. The distance between Vesta and Ceres is greater than the distance between the Earth and the sun. During its 14 months in orbit around Vesta, the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights, including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history. Vesta and Ceres are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt. The image was taken as part of a final calibration of the science camera before Dawn's arrival. On December 1, Ceres was about nine pixels in diameter - nearly perfect for this calibration .","The Ceres asteroid orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter, and may have water gushing from its surface .

"A Texas wedding photographer is holding a couple's pictures hostage because they have refused to pay a fee they say wasn't in their contract. Andrew and Neely Moldovan, who married in October, have not yet received their professional images from Andrea Polito, who says they still owe her money for a cover for their photo album. The couple, who paid Polito $6,000 to capture their wedding, insist their contract included a photo album but never mentioned an extra fee for the cover. They say they assumed a book would automatically include a cover, NBCDFW reported. Scroll down for video . Newlyweds: Andrew and Neely Moldovan, pictured on their wedding day, have not yet received their professionally taken photos because the photographer claims they owe her an extra $150 . Incredulous: The couple, who live in Dallas, Texas, say the extra fee is for a cover for their photo album - but the cost was never outlined in their contract with the photographer . The extra fee is $150 - and if they don't pay it, they will be unable to get the book or a CD of their photographs. 'We can pay the $150, but it's the principle,' Neely Moldovan, from Dallas, told the local channel. 'It's not the money to us. It's the principle of the fact we already paid you.' The contract simply says they will receive a '40 page 8.5x12 Storybook Album with up to 80 images' without mentioning an extra fee for the cover. Polito told NBC that she had told the couple about the $150 fee in an early meeting - but they said this did not happen. 'It just didn't make sense,' Andrew Moldovan said. 'An album comes with a cover. It's a component of an album. It's a book.' Memories: If the couple do not pay the fee, they cannot get the photo album or CD of the photos . Firm: The photographer, Andrew Polito (pictured), said the extra fee was discussed before the wedding . The photographer also told them that if they fail to pay the fee by February 18, the photos will become archived and it will cost them an extra $250 to access them. 'It's heartbreaking because these are our memories,' Mrs Moldovan added. 'Our wedding was over three months ago.' In a statement to NBC, Polito, who is also based in Dallas, said: 'We make the utmost effort to consistently provide the best customer service and highest quality of photography in the industry.' She said she is now trying to work with the couple to resolve the issue.

"A woman beheaded in a Saudi street for killing her husband's six-year-old daughter screams her innocence in graphic footage of the execution uploaded to the Internet. An executioner in Mecca, the holy city, took two swings to hack off Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim's head, after she was found guilty of beating the girl and raping her with a broomstick. The incident has sparked outrage in the country, but not because of the brutal punishment meted out. Rather Saudis are up in arms that the execution was filmed and posted online, where the woman's family might see it. Justice seen, justice done? Saudi Arabia is up in arms after a witness to this public execution filmed it and then posted the footage on the Internet . Now Saudi authorities have arrested someone for filming the execution, local media reports. But it was not clear what crime he has been arrested for. The video of Bassim's execution shows how she begged for her life, protesting her innocence right up until the executioner dealt his first blow. 'I did not kill. There is no God but God. I did not kill,' cries Bassim, who is dressed entirely in black and is kneeling on the pavement circled by police officers. 'Haram. Haram. Haram. Haram. I did not kill ... I do not forgive you ... This is an injustice,' she screams in the video, which was posted online on Saturday. The executioner, dressed in a white robe, forces her to lie down on the ground. 'I did not,' she continues before a final scream as the executioner swings his curved sword into her neck. His first blow fails to sever Bassim's head entirely and he has to swing again before she is decapitated. A voice then reads out her crime. It is a traditional execution for the kingdom, which carries out death sentences in public. Sloppy work: An executioner in Mecca took two swings to hack the head off Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim, after she was found guilty of beating her huband's daughter and raping her with a broomstick . 'I did not kill': Bassim continued protesting her innocence right up until the execution swung his sword . Many Twitter users protested the video being circulated on the internet because it could be seen by the woman’s family, but did not object to the beheading itself. Bassim was one of 10 people beheaded In Saudi Arabia so far this year. Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013. The kingdom had the third-highest number of recorded executions in 2013, behind Iran and Iraq, Amnesty International says. The official Saudi Press Agency said last week that Bassim's execution came after she was found guilty of the rape and murder of Kalthoum bint Abdul Rahman bin Ghulam Gadir, her husband's daughter. 'Investigations led to her trial which proved she was guilty,' the interior ministry was quoted by SPA as saying. A United Nations special rapporteur has said trials leading to the death penalty in Saudi Arabia are 'grossly unfair'. An aerial view shows the holy city of Mecca: Bassim was one of 10 people beheaded In Saudi Arabia so far this year. Saudi Arabia executed 87 people last year, up from 78 in 2013 . Rape, murder, apostasy, armed robbery and drug trafficking are punishable by death in the oil-rich Gulf state, which is a close ally of Washington and a regular customer of both American and British arms companies. Saudi authorities identified Bassim as holding Burmese nationality but did not specify if she was from its Rohingya Muslim community. The United Nations describes Rohingya as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. Buddhist-majority Burma views its population of 800,000 Rohingya as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and denies them citizenship. Burma's embassy said that without seeing her passport, it could not confirm whether or not she was a citizen.","Layla bint Abdul Mutaleb Bassim was publicly executed in Mecca .

"A woman has walked free from jail on Tuesday morning, 16 years after strangling a 15-year-old girl to death in a plot to steal her identity. In 2000 Caroline Reed Robertson, then 19, was jailed for 20 years after pleading guilty to the murder of aspiring dancer Rachel Barber, with a non-parole period of 14 and a half years. The 15-year-old victim was drugged and strangled to death with a telephone cord in 1999 in Prahran, a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria. Despite their daughter's brutal murder, the victim's parents are asking the public to give the woman responsible privacy. Early on Tuesday morning, Robertson left the facility at Dame Phyllis Frost Centre surrounded by two people into a waiting car. Scroll down for video . Caroline Reed Robertson (middle) walked free from jail on Tuesday morning, 16 years after strangling a 15-year-old girl to death in a plot to steal her identity . 'I ask that people do not harass Caroline or her family,' read a statement from the victim's family, including her parents Elizabeth and Michael Barber. '(Caroline) must be given the opportunity to quietly readjust to life outside of prison.' When Robertson became eligible for parole on August 10, 2013, the victim's family fought furiously to make sure the killer was kept behind bars. Mrs Barber wrote a letter to Parole Board general manager David Provan asking the board to deny Robertson's bail. The family campaigned for the murderer to spend at least 18 years behind bars. Rachel Barber, a 15-year-old dance student, was murdered by strangulation in Melbourne in 1999 . Caroline Reed Robertson was 19 years old when she murdered Rachel Barber, pictured here after her arrest . Yet in November 2014 the Parole Board announced their decision to release Robertson from prison under strict bail conditions. Rachel's parents now support Robertson's release - as long as she is strictly monitored when out on parole. If Robertson was to serve her total effective sentence of 20 years in prison, she could be subject to less stringent monitoring. The family desperately hope that Robertson, who suffers from a personality disorder, will be properly rehabilitated and supervised so she is not a danger to society. In 2000 Caroline Reed Robertson, then 19, was jailed for 20 years after pleading guilty to the murder of aspiring dancer Rachel Barber, with a non-parole period of 14 and a half years . Caroline Reed Robertson, pictured in 2013, will be released from jail on parole on January 20 2015 . In November 2014 the Parole Board announced their decision to release Robertson from prison under strict bail conditions . 'With the correct supervision and support she will hopefully keep to herself and not re-offend,' Mrs Barber said. 'It is absolutely essential for the benefit and safety of the community that she is monitored on her release.' The family still has fears about Robertson's mental state, but hope rehabilitation can protect the community. 'No one wants Caroline Reed Robertson to commit another crime. I can only hope that the Adult Parole Board of Victoria are sure she is rehabilitated, and is so without doubt.' It is a case so twisted yet fascinating that it inspired a star-studded 2009 Australian film, 'I Am You' (also known as 'In Her Skin'), starring Guy Pearce, Miranda Otto, Sam Neill and Rebecca Gibney. Robertson was the victim's former babysitter, a trusted family friend and neighbour, who lured the teen to her death by manipulating her trust. The grizzly death and bizarre circumstances were depicted in an Australian film, starring Ruth Bradley (left) as the murderer Caroline and prominent actor Sam Neill (right) as Caroline's father, David Reid . The parents: Miranda Otto (left) starred as Elizabeth Barber and Guy Pearce (right) starred as Mike Barber . No one realised that she was plotting to kill her beautiful neighbour and assume her identity for a new start. Robertson's diary entries were used by police as evidence in the trial. 'How to change in nine weeks' was written by Robertson on the front of her journal; the pages inside detail her sick plans. They reveal the disturbed woman's terrifying obsession with the beautiful dancer as she plotted to kill and 'disfigure' the teen. The journal and emotional letters to her father also expose the intense self-loathing Robertson felt, which fed her to assume the identity of Rachel, a pretty, talented, well-liked dance student. Caroline Reed Robertson, aged 19, is pictured speaking with police after her arrest for the premeditated murder of Rachel Barber. Robertson confessed to the crime before Barber's body was found . When sentencing the young woman to jail, Justice Frank Vincent told the convicted murderer was at times emotional. 'You represent a real danger to anyone who may become the unfortunate subject of your fixation,' he told her. The Supreme Court heard that Robertson had convinced herself that after killing Rachel she could in some way assume her identity. 'It is possible that she thought she could somehow magically reinvent herself in the image of the victim,' said forensic psychiatrist Justin Barry-Walsh in a report submitted to court. It was a grotesque, twisted crime involving two very young girls. Rachel was a beauty with delicate features, striking emerald eyes and a lithe dancer's build. Caroline Reed Robertson became fixated on the young girl's beauty, enraged with her own heavier build and curly hair. Robertson had grown up disgusted by herself, frequently painting digusting self-portraits and scribbling hateful words about herself. 'Loser, unwanted, dirty, obese, funny in the head,' she wrote around one drawing when she was 14 years old. 'I don't belong anywhere in this crazy world because I'm ugly, obese, pizza face, white worm, massive nose and just plain weird.' Robertson had a deep-rooted self loathing, as demonstrated in this self-portrait which was used as evidence in her trial. At age 14 she drew this exaggeratedly ugly image of herself surrounded by degrading words . She would write angst-filled letters to her estranged father, explaining how much she hated her life and how worthless she felt. 'I feel like a troubled, tortured, lost soul that's been thrown into an alien environment full of angels,' she wrote in a letter to her father. But later detectives found that the diary entries became more sinister as the then 19-year-old plotted to murder her former neighbour. She wrote about the teen obsessively, with vivid descriptions – and in the past tense, as if writing an obituary. 'Rachel was always ""wild"". Let run barefoot in the country. Began dating very young. Very talented at classical ballet,' wrote Robertson in her diary. 'Tried modelling… Strikingly attractive - dancer's body. Very clear pale skin, hypnotic green eyes, dyed hair lots of different colours.' The murderer concocted a complex plan to coerce Rachel to return to the apartment Robertson lived in by herself. Robertson told Rachel that she could make $500 if she took part in a highly confidential psychological survey, as long as she did not tell anybody about her involvement. Trusting her family friend, she took up the opportunity and was drugged and strangled to death in Rachel's Prahran unit. Robertson had planned every detail. In another image Robertson drew of herself, it is clear that she has very low self confidence and is obsessed with her appearance. It is believed that jealousy and obsession was the reasoning for the murder of Rachel . One entry read: 'On the way to dance school, say that she can't tell anyone that she's meeting me as I'm not allowed to give the study results to anyone — ethics — highly confidential. Not even your boyfriend/parents ... Drug Rachel (toxic over mouth), put body into army bags and disfigure and dump somewhere way out. No car ...' Another entry read: 'Check farm (including bag) ... Tuesday arrange bank loan ... Moving van ... Night to disguise hair ... Thoroughly clean house, and steam clean carpet.' Robertson had a name chosen, 'Jem Southall', which she would adopt after she took out a bank loan and fled the state. For around two days, Rachel's body was hidden in Robertson's apartment. As Rachel's devastated family desperately searched for their daughter, Robertson wrapped the body in two rugs and took a taxi to her father's Kilmore farm, telling the driver she was moving a statue. Rachel's body was buried in a shallow hole, bizarrely positioned next to the grave of the murderer's pet. Not long after, Robertson was arrested by police. She confessed to the murder and 12 days later Rachel's body was found - the cable used to kill her still tightened around her neck. Caroline's brutal crime was depicted in a film (pictured) called 'I Am You'. It is also referred to as 'In Her Skin' When sentencing Robertson, Justice Vincent ruled that the culprit had a deeply entrenched personality disorder. He told the court that he was not convinced Robertson had 'developed any real insight into the true significance of what she has done.' However whilst incarcerated the teen killer has reportedly reinvented herself, according to the Herald Sun. Robertson has allegedly found Buddhism, is liked in jail and 'fits into Deer Park Institution so well.' 'She finds it a better life than she ever found outside,' defence barrister Colin Lovitt, QC, told the Herald Sun. The Herald Sun also reports that whilst in jail, Robertson formed a lesbian relationship. The prisoner has lost a lot of weight and completely changed her image whilst in jail. She will be released under strict bail conditions. In 2013, the victim's parents confirmed that they have forgiven their daughter's killer. ‘It has taken time but Mike and I have forgiven Caroline,' Mrs Barber told SMH. 'If we continued to hate her, we would be angry and bitter and I can’t do that to my own children.’ Disturbed predator Caroline Reed Robertson, who in 1999 planned, stalked and murdered promising dancer Rachel Barber, a girl she obsessed about as being perfect and pure. She will walk from prison with four years remaining on her sentence. This image is from the film created about the crime .","A 15-year-old dance student Rachel Barber was strangled to death in 1999 .
