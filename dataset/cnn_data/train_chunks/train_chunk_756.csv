Two of the arrested suspects accused of gang-raping a 51-year-old Danish tourist in New Delhi have appeared in court with their faces covered.

Police officials escort an accused in the gang rape of a 51-year-old Danish tourist to produce him in court in New Delhi, India, on Thursday . The suspects were ordered to be held in police custody for three days for further investigation . Two other suspects were picked up . Wednesday night and accused of taking part in Tuesday's attack, which . lasted nearly three hours and involved six men. It happened near Connaught Place, a popular . shopping area in the heart of New Delhi, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat . said. ‘We have identified the culprits. All of . them are vagabonds,’ a police official said, according to the Press . Trust of India news agency. The two men brought before the court in New Delhi were part of a gang of six that allegedly raped a Danish tourist . Police officials escort one of the accused out of court . It's a case that highlights the plague of sexual violence in the country and threatens to tarnish its tourism industry. Violence . against women in India has caused increasing alarm since the fatal gang . rape of a 23-year-old Indian physiotherapy student in New Delhi in . December 2012. Several foreign tourists also have been targeted in . attacks that often get international attention, although Indian women . are assaulted far more frequently. Tourism . figures fell significantly in the three months following the 2012 gang . rape, with visits by women dropping 35 percent, according to the . Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Although the . industry appears to have bounced back, recent attacks on foreign women . could have another chilling effect. Indian policemen sit inside the police station which is investigating the gang-rape of a Danish tourist in Delhi . Tourism accounted for 6.6 percent of India's GDP in 2012, the latest year for which figures are available. Last . week, an 18-year-old German charity worker said she was assaulted on a . train in southern India by a fellow passenger. She said she was too . scared to shout for help from the other passengers asleep in her . compartment, police said. The teen was attacked during a . train journey from Mangalore to Chennai, according to police. She was . travelling there to carry out volunteer work. A man from Bihar has been arrested for the attack. In . March, a Swiss woman reported being gang-raped in central India as she . and her husband camped out in a forest after bicycling from the temple . town of Orchha. And in June, a 30-year-old American woman was gang-raped . in the northern resort town of Manali as she was hitchhiking to her . guest house after visiting a friend. Police . said the Danish tourist was raped at knifepoint Tuesday after she . approached a group of men for directions back to her hotel. Instead of . helping her, the men lured her to a secluded spot and raped her . repeatedly, according to police. One . of the suspects in custody was found with the victim's glasses case and . 1,000 rupees ($16) in cash, a police statement said. Last . year, the Tourism Ministry launched an ‘I Respect Women’ campaign to . reassure travelers. Some hotels also have introduced new programs . focused on safety. Anasuya Basu, director of marketing at Le Meridien . Hotel in New Delhi, said the hotel has designated rooms for single women . and recommends that women only take hotel taxis. Public . fury over the 2012 rape case has led to more stringent laws that . doubled prison terms for rape to 20 years and criminalized voyeurism and . stalking. But many women say daily indignities and abuse continue . unabated and that the new laws have not made the streets any safer. Still, . there has been a surge in the number of rapes being reported recently, . suggesting women are emboldened to speak up. Between January and October . last year, 1,330 rapes were reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared . with 706 for all of 2012, according to government figures.

Mr Mills rubbished the claim, saying: . ‘My father told me who hit him and he told me the circumstances.

"By . Chloe Lambert . PUBLISHED: . 10:31 EST, 27 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:40 EST, 27 February 2014 . When British mom Jennifer Devitt discovered she was pregnant with her second child in quick succession, she decided to take a preventative strike on her mummy tummy. ‘I’m a size eight (U.S. size four) and have always had a flat stomach, but when I had my first daughter I found it really difficult to get it back,’ says  Jennifer, 29, a beauty therapist and mother to Indie-May, 20 months, and Holly, four months. ‘My muscles were non-existent, everything stuck out and it was six months before I could wear a T-shirt because of my jelly belly. I felt really self-conscious and didn’t even like looking in the mirror. The big squeeze: Mother-of-two Anna Blakey wore a compression girdle after her two pregnancies . ‘I knew that with your second baby . everything can really go haywire because your muscles are already . weakened, so I started looking for something to help.’ To most women, that might be a gym membership, a sharp swerve away from the cookie aisle or a brisk walk with the stroller each day. But, like a growing number of mothers, Jennifer wanted results more quickly than that. The Belly Bandit promised to be a solution to her problem. The huge band of thick, strong elastic, that retails for anything between $50 and $80, is worn around the midriff after pregnancy and promises to shrink the belly, waist and hips. It is also said to remind women to tighten their core muscles, to reduce swelling and stretch marks, and support the spine. Similar compression garments are called The Cinch, the Squeem and the Gowri wrap. The trend has been growing for a number of years, despite warnings that it can be damaging to women’s health. Jennifer strapped herself into the Belly Bandit just three days after giving birth. 'I wore it day and night - I was pretty determined. And it was so expensive that I wanted to get my money’s worth' 'I wore it day and night — I was pretty determined. And it was so expensive that I wanted to get my money’s worth,’ she says. ‘I found it comfortable and even slept in it. My partner, Wesley, didn’t mind it.  He knew I wanted to feel good in my clothes.’ Jennifer says she was ‘gobsmacked’ by the results. ‘Within two weeks I was a (U.S.) size six and could wear a tight T-shirt. I really noticed the difference in my abdominal and pelvic-floor floor muscles, even though I wasn’t doing any exercise. ‘It took me six weeks to get back to a size four and a weight of 112lbs. I never thought it would be so dramatic.’ Belly-binding is rooted in ancient . tradition. In Japan, the Middle East and South America, it is normal for . women to wear a compressing wrap, corset or girdle to speed up their . return to their pre-pregnancy size. Its . revival in the West has been fuelled by celebrity endorsements: actress . Jessica Alba credited her enviably tiny and toned post-baby body to . wearing two corsets, one on top of the other, day and night, for three . months. Slimmed down: Anna I loved the feeling of support and confidence her girdle gave her, and says people were amazed when she was back in her size-six jeans within two weeks of giving birth . Kourtney Kardashian and Minnie Driver sang the praises of the Belly Bandit while Angelina Jolie and Gwen Stefani wore The Cinch, a $90 wrap available in upmarket maternity shops. While there’s no doubt shapewear can make lumps and bumps appear to vanish, some experts warn against squeezing your post- pregnancy body back into shape. Some obstetricians say women are risking stress incontinence, digestion problems and weakened back muscles. Nicky Croft, a women’s health physiotherapist at the APPI Clinic in London, says: 'After giving birth, the uterus is still enlarged and the whole of the abdominal wall has lengthened and stretched throughout the pregnancy. 'This will return to normal, but it . takes time. The evidence shows that the best way to reduce abdominal . distension is breast-feeding and specific exercises to strengthen the . abdominals during and after pregnancy. 'A . belly-binder won’t help you lose baby fat — the only things to affect . that are your metabolism and diet. If you bind the abdominal wall too . tightly, you’re putting your pelvic floor under pressure, which could . lead to urinary leakage. The pelvic floor has just been through a big . stretch, so the last thing it wants is to be pressured.’ Celebrity endorsement: Angelina Jolie (left) wore The Cinch after giving birth, and Minnie Driver (right) wore a Belly Bandit . In shape: Kourtney Kardashian (left) also wore a Belly Bandit, while Jessica Alba (right) credited her toned post-baby body to wearing two corsets, one on top of the other, day and night, for three months . The other concern is that belly binders take over the job of the stomach muscles, meaning deeper, core muscles become lazy. ‘If . you give too much external support to the stomach, the abdominal and . pelvic-floor muscles will be deterred from working as well,’ says Croft. ‘So, . in the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep . yourself supported, rather than retraining your core muscles to do it.’ Kathryn Lister tried two belly binders following the birth of her daughter Daisy. 'In the long term you might become reliant on wearing the wrap to keep . yourself supported, rather than retraining your core muscles to do it' ‘As I’m 41, I was aware my body could go south after I had a baby,’  says Kathryn, who works in finance and is married to Simon, 45. ‘The rest of me is fairly flabby, but my stomach has always been flat. So I really wanted to try to hold on to it. I was reading online mothers’ forums and saw all these mentions of belly binding. ‘I remember reading about Jessica Alba doing it and that really stuck in my mind. I ended up buying The Cinch and some Squeem shapewear.’ Two days after her daughter was born, Kathryn strapped herself into The Cinch, but struggled to get used to it. ‘Daisy was born on one of the hottest days of the year, so it was uncomfortable. It was also very obvious. If I was wearing anything other than a thick shirt or jumper you could see it under my clothes. ‘It’s recommended to wear it for 18 hours a day, which seemed like madness. Fan: Gwen Stefani, who is currently pregnant with her third child, has used The Cinch top get back into shape in the past . ‘In the end, I had to take it off every time I wanted to feed Daisy because I simply wasn’t comfortable sitting in it.’ After two weeks, Kathryn decided to try the Squeem, a girdle that runs from under the bra to the bikini line. ‘This was even worse. It had hook and eye fastenings, so it took ages to put on and bits of you spill out. The fat has got to go somewhere, hasn’t it? I looked like an overstuffed sausage.’ Yet the internet is awash with . ‘miracle’ stories about women racing to get back into their . pre-pregnancy clothes. Mother-of-two Anna Blakey wore a compression . girdle after her two pregnancies. ‘I’m a small build, so I didn’t put on much weight, but my muscles were weak and I was looking for something to support my back,’ says Anna, 40, a graphic designer who lives with her husband Dominic, 45, a sales director, and their children in South London. ‘I loved the feeling of support and confidence it gave me and people were amazed when I was back in my (U.S.) size-six jeans within two weeks of giving birth.’ When Anna had her son, now three, she had to have an emergency Caesarean. Without discussing it with her midwife, she used a girdle designed for  post C-section bellies, with side-fastening eyehooks. ‘It sat smoothly over the scar and made all my clothes more comfortable. I think it also helped the scar to heal, in the same way that if you cut your finger you put pressure on it,’ she says.Anna still occasionally wears her compression garment. ‘I will put it on if I want to wear a certain dress. It helps cinch in my waist and tum.’ However, despite such reports, the . belly-binding trend worries midwives, who feel women are under too much . pressure to snap back into shape after pregnancy. Janet . Fyle, who leads the Royal College Of Midwives’ policy on obesity and . maternal public health issues, says: ‘It is far better to lose your . pregnancy weight gradually, by eating healthily and taking gentle . exercise, such as swimming, with your baby. ‘Women . who are pregnant or who have just given birth should be celebrated, not . hidden away. We’re at risk of making women feel guilty about their . bodies.’ Kathryn, who . had suffered an abdominal split — where the muscles do not reconnect . properly after birth — ditched the two different belly binders and saw a . physiotherapist. ‘She gave me some Pilates and pelvic-floor exercises, which are helping. I just don’t think there’s a quick fix,’ she says. And like many new mothers, Kathryn found that the arrival of her little girl signalled a change in her priorities. ‘I haven’t worried about my stomach as much as I thought I would,’ she says. ‘Daisy . is my focus. All I cared about was being able to feed her, to cuddle . her and feel her skin on mine. Yes, my tummy is probably a bit squishy, . but it’s all worth it for her.’","The Belly Bandit .

From levies on cabin baggage to billing for printed boarding passes, it seems there's little that budget airlines won't charge for. Now a new survey has revealed that airlines are charging up to seven times more for food and drink than your local supermarket. Among the overpriced products highlighted were a 330ml bottle of water that cost 22p in a supermarket but £1.80 on a Jet2.com aircraft while a bar of chocolate priced at 25p on the high street totted up to £1.20 on an EasyJet flight. Hidden cost: Budget airlines such as Ryanair charge up to seven times more for food than supermarkets . The research, which was carried out by money-saving website TravelSupermarket.com and published in the Sunday Mirror, compared airline prices to those in a typical branch of Asda. On average, the survey discovered that food and drink were at least 241 per cent higher in the air. Bob Atkinson, of TravelSupermarket, said: 'Passengers travelling away this summer can easily get caught out by inflated prices for food and drinks, simply by failing to plan ahead. 'Airlines can get away with charging whatever they want for simple items such as a can of your favourite soft drink or a bar of chocolate as customers have no other option once on board the aircraft. 'For those families who have worked hard for their annual getaway, these marked up prices are both unwelcome and unnecessary. Picking up a few snacks before departing for the airport or even in the airport itself can save holidaymakers significant amounts.' Along with Jet2.com and Easyjet, Ryanair was another airline singled out for its price hikes which included charging £1.74 for a 38p can of 7UP and £1.74 for a stick of pepperami that would cost 50p at Asda. Price hike: This 38p can of 7UP cost £1.74 on Ryanair while a £1 bag of Haribo totted up to £2.75 on Monarch . Kit Kat chocolate bar: 33p in store but £1.30 on Aer Lingus . Twix chocolate bar: 25p in store but £1.20 on EasyJet . Haribo Starmix (160g bag): £1 in store but £2.75 on Monarch . Pepperami (25g stick): 50p in store but £1.74 on Ryanair . Pepsi (330ml can): 30p in store but £1.60 on Flybe . Red Bull (250ml can): 67p in store but £2.50 on Thomas Cook . Coca Cola (330ml can): 30p in store but £1.60 on Thompson . Other offenders include Flybe, which charges £1.60 for a 30p can of Pepsi, Monarch, which prices a packet of Haribo Starmix at £2.75 compared with Asda's £1, and Aer Lingus which hiked the price of a Kit Kat from 33p to £1.30 - a difference of 294 per cent. Also in the firing line was Thomas Cook, which charges £2.50 for a 67p can of Red Bull, and Thompson which upped the cost of a can of Coca Cola from 30p to £1.60 - an eye-watering 433 per cent hike. Asked to comment, a Ryanair spokesman said: 'Ryanair delivers Europe’s guaranteed lowest fares and a range of affordable, top quality inflight food, drinks and snacks on our Getaway Café menu. 'Passengers are free to bring their own snacks on board if they wish.' Jet2.com, meanwhile, argued that price hikes were the result of catering costs - allegedly much higher in the air. 'We always endeavour to deliver a quality experience, from the moment people start their holidays with us. This includes the catering in-flight where we provide hot food and healthy snacks. 'Our products are sourced from a variety of different suppliers, as are those from other airlines. The costs for supplying an aircraft are far higher than for a supermarket or restaurant and as such we believe this is a very difficult comparison to make. It’s not like for like.' Easyjet, however, said that prices should be compared to those in restaurants but not in supermarkets. In a statement, the airline said: 'Our prices should be compared with bars and restaurants rather than supermarkets. 'A supermarket operation will have huge economies of scale, lower cost prices along with lower supply chain and operating costs, is therefore not comparable to the service offering and specialised loading requirements of an airline environment.'","Prices are hiked by as much as 433%, according to a new survey .

While the clip has not been removed, it has been edited to remove the necklace after the petition attracted 65,000 signatures in three days. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: Katy Perry's video for Dark Horse featured a man wearing a pendant which read Allah in Arabic (left). However it has now been removed (right) after an outraged Muslim man set up a petition . In the video Perry plays an Egyptian princess looking for a suitor but disintegrates each one when they displease her . The first man, who is wearing the Allah pendant, presents Perry with a giant diamond but is disintegrated . However it is not clear whether it was YouTube or Perry's record label which removed the offending item. Calls from Mail Online to the record label have not been returned. Compared to raunchy videos by the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, Perry's offering could have been considered tame, if it weren't for the Arabic symbol for Allah around the man's neck. In his complaint, Mr Iqbal said: 'The video is considered as highly controversial to its viewers as a result of its portrayal of blasphemy. 'Blasphemy is clearly conveyed in the video, since Katy Perry (who appears to be representing an opposition of God) engulfs the believer and the word God in flames. 'This is the reason for lodging the petition so that people from different walks of life, different religions and from different parts of the world, agree that the video promotes blasphemy. The petition claimed that the video 'promotes blasphemy' and urges people from around the world to sign, arguing that no religion would tolerate the name God being used in a 'disrespectful manner' The petition collected 65,000 signatures from countries including Australia, India and Saudi Arabia . 'Using the name of God in an irrelevant and distasteful manner would be considered inappropriate by any religion ' The video currently has more than 38million views though has more than 100,000 'dislikes' and several negative comments mentioning the pendant. After signing the petition, Bilal Khan, from Birmingham, said: 'Absolutely Disgusted at the music industry for allowing this to happen, music should be about spreading love not hate. It's shameful that you allow stupidity, you need to look up the meaning of the word explicit.' Fellow signatory Taufik Hidayat, from Bandung, Indonesia, added: 'This video is really offensive to [the] Muslim faith!' Dark Horse is Perry's third single off her new album 'Prism' and features American rapper Juicy J. The hip-hop infused pop song is currently sitting at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 list.

Spike Lee's made the . interview rounds Wednesday to defend his Tuesday tirade over . gentrification in New York City, but one need only look to his native . neighborhood to see he's got a point. 'Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the mother*****’ Westminster Dog Show,' he ranted while addressing the a Pratt Institute audience. Lee's appearance on Anderson Cooper insisting his birthplace has greatly changed may not have been necessary as MailOnline photos reveal Fort Greene really does have an awful lot of dogs. Descriptive: The dogs of Fort Greene: Spike Lee's rant against 'mother******* hipsters' changing the names of neighborhoods and turning his Brooklyn birthplace into the 'mother******* Westminster Dog Show' There ARE a lot of dogs: Lee made some media rounds Wednesday in the wake of his rant row. He wanted to clarify some of the ideas he expressed, but did he have a point? The row began a long-winded rant against gentrification in the Brooklyn art school on . Tuesday night when he was asked to argue against the development of . poorer neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Harlem. The . director, who has focused on racial issues and gentrification in his . films, blasted an audience member at the Pratt Institute who started . defending the changes in the neighborhoods. 'Let me just kill you right now,' Lee said to the unidentified questioner. While we can't so easily travel to the Fort Greene of yesteryear, we can take a look at how the neighborhood looks now. And, in a word (or two), it looks dog-friendly. 'Hot beignets': Mariah Cooperson walks her Chow-Huskie mix past Cammareri Bakery on Dekalb Ave. adjacent to Ft. Greene Park Wednesday. These are sights Lee says seem completely alien to him, but they're very common sights nonetheless . 'I grew up here in New York. It's changed': Henrik Milsen, left, and his Irish Setter, Snobben, Swedish for Snoopy, plays with Matt Estay's miniature Schnauzer, Pauli, right, in Ft. Greene Park . 'Have some respect for the history': Sarah Weir, left, walks with,  her Australian Terrier, Tucker, a block from Ft. Greene Park Wednesday . Lee told Anderson Cooper on Wednesday that he wasn't pointing the finger at white people per se. 'I just find it interesting you have to have an influx of white New Yorkers to move into these neighborhoods for the services to go up' In Lee's memory, the area just didn't used to be the type of place where groomed canines roamed freely with latte-sipping owners at their backs. He made this abundantly clear in Tuesday's talk, but wanted to clarify on Wednesday that the rant was not an attack purely on white people moving into black neighborhoods. 'My problem is that when you move into a neighborhood, have some respect for the history, for the culture,' Lee told Anderson Cooper. In spite of the row and his need to Clarify, Lee said he's happy he got people talking. 'What I wanted to do was expand the dialogue,' he told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront. His soapbox: Spike Lee argued that New York City is being gentrified at an alarming rate and it is no longer the same city that he grew up in . Lee initially pointed the finger at white New Yorkers who have moved into historically black neighborhoods and changed the environment, arguing that those changes have caused the areas to evolve into something completely different. 'Here’s the thing: I grew up here in Fort Greene. I grew up here in New York. It’s changed. And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the south Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better?' he said. 'The garbage wasn’t picked up every mother*****’ day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. P.S. 20 was not good. P.S. 11. Rothschild 294. The police weren’t around. 'When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o’clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something.' Protecting a legacy: Lee complained that residents in Brooklyn and Harlem are now stopping events in public parks for fear of excessive noise of garbage . 'Crystal ball': Lee said that a scene in his 1989 hit Do The Right Thing foreshadowed gentrification problems to come in Harlem . The entire 10-minute exchange was transcribed by New York Magazine, and it was clear that he knew it would cause a firestorm. 'My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in nineteen-motherf*****’-sixty-eight, and the motherf*****' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not — he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! We bought the motherf*****’ house in nineteen-sixty-motherf*****’-eight and now you call the cops? In 2013? Get the f*** outta here!' 'You can’t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you’re motherf*****’ Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. There’s a code. There’s people.' 'I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect. You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now s*** gotta change because you’re here? Get the f*** outta here. Can’t do that!' 'The black American population in New York City is going down because of... reverse migration and what we have and - and its something that de Blasio's going to, I mean he can't get the snow off the ground but still- what we need is affordable housing for everybody.' In spite of his outrage, Lee has moved to a cleaner, less noisy . area himself as he has lived in the Upper East Side since 2000. He . keeps connected to his Brooklyn roots by basing his company's . headquarters in Fort Greene, however. The topic was raised when a male audience member asked about a recent New York Times article that extolled the benefits of gentrification. This was not the paper's first recent foray into the issue, as a series they ran about homelessness in the city pointed out that some of the worst-run shelters is located next to brownstone houses that now sell for multiple millions. Lee said that gentrification is shown by more than just a heavier police presence on the streets but also by the dismissal of cultural customs. 'Then comes the mother*****’ Christopher Columbus Syndrome. You can’t discover this! We been here. You just can’t come and bogart. 'There were brothers playing mother*****’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it anymore because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud.' He boasted that his . critically-acclaimed film Do The Right Thing, which was released in . 1989, predicted the gentrification debate like a 'crystal ball', citing a . scene where a white man in Harlem is berated by his black neighbor . after the man accidentally scuffs up his new Air Jordan sneakers. Lee . told a story about how a party in Fort Greene park was proposed in . honor of Michael Jackson when the singer died but the plan got nixed . after residents complained that there would be too much garbage. Changing scene: Lee said that Fort Greene Park is cleaner than it has ever been . 'Garbage? Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the mother*****’ Westminster Dog Show. There’s 20,000 dogs running around. Whoa. So we had to move it to Prospect Park!' Lee said. 'I mean, they just move in the neighborhood. You just can’t come in the neighborhood. I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect. 'You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now s*** gotta change because you’re here? Get the fuck outta here.

A former Olympic gold medalist boxer has been awarded his latest victory but this time is comes in the form of a tense legal battle. Pernell 'Sweet Pea' Whitaker has been fighting in court to have his mother evicted from the house that he bought her decades ago. The 50-year-old athlete, who has accumulated significant debt and faced drug problems in the past, did not seem torn up about it and after a Virginia court ruled in his favor on Wednesday, he called it 'a beautiful moment'. New ring to fight in: A Norfolk, Virginia court ruled that Pernell Whitaker is allowed to evict his mother and siblings from the home he bought them because he wants to sell the house to pay off debts . Finding a new home: Novella Whitaker, 73, has been living in the home since 1984 and now must move in with another one of her seven children . Whitaker bought a two-story brick home in Norfolk, Virginia in 1984 and he gave it to his mother Novella Whitaker when he was at the height of his career when he had earned millions. Glory days: 'Sweet Pea' won the Olympic gold medal in boxing at the Los Angeles Games in 1984 . She lived in the home with some of Pernell's six siblings while he moved into his own house in the upscale neighborhood of Church Point. Problems ensued, as ABC News reports that he had a number of drug abuse incidents and accumulated a rap sheet. In order to pay off debts, he asked his mother and two siblings who were living in the house to help contribute to the upkeep costs or move out so that he could get cash from the mortgages. 'It’s sad for him to have to take action against his mother, but none of the family would contribute to the real estate and he had no alternative but to use the court process,' his attorney Bruce Gould told ABC News. 'He’s not happy that it was necessary to go to court but he now has two mortgages on the house and the alternative was if he didn’t sell, it was going to go to foreclosure.' He legally held onto the deed for the home and still owns it even though he has never lived there, and the court ruled that the verbal agreement that he made with his mother and siblings was non-binding. Whitaker officially announced his retirement in April 2001 and he has been training other boxers in the time since but that has not brought in as much cash as hoped. 'It’s significantly diminished over the years and he’s not able to maintain this $400,000 house for his mother and siblings to live in,' Mr Gould said. Homestead: Though Pernell's mother and two siblings lived in the home (pictured) he held onto the legal rights . His mother maintained a relatively positive outlook on the issue when interviewed by local station WVEC following the Wednesday verdict. 'I'm going to survive. I'm a survivor. I'm going with my daughter...she is taking me in,' Novella Whitaker said. His sister Zelda Brown was not as diplomatic. 'He’ll be a son forever until death do us part, but he is putting a rip through the family,' she said.","Pernell 'Sweet Pea' Whitaker is now allowed to kick his mother and two siblings out of the home he bought for them 30 years ago .

She was convicted of using threatening behavior after trying to punch her daughter in the face in a 'drink-fuelled' brawl . A police officer was punched, kicked and bitten by a mob of school children after he tried to stop a mother and daughter from fighting outside in pyjamas. Donna Matthews, 46, was spotted by the officer trying to punch her daughter in the face, before banging her face on a stone step outside her house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The officer tried to break up the alcohol-fuelled brawl, but was attacked by three children aged seven, ten and 13, who proceeded to bite, punch and kick him at the moment he was pulling the mother away from the daughter. Defending, Jonathan Taylor told Blackburn Magistrates Court that she has had an alcohol problem since she was 16. She began arguing with her daughter after the pair had been drinking. The police officer saw the two women, one wearing a white vest and pyjama bottoms and the other wearing a white onesie, fighting at the front of the house. Mr Taylor said: 'The officer was outside another address attending an unrelated incident when he saw a fight spill out of the house. 'He witnessed both women punching each other and Matthews tried to smash her daughter’s face into stone steps. 'Her daughter tried to gouge her eyes out and Matthews was in an extreme amount of pain. 'They were exchanging blows during the scuffle. 'As the officer tried to break up the fight, he was attacked by three children of primary school age - something he has not witnessed in 12 years as a police officer.' He calmed the situation but when he later said he was going to arrest their mother, the children attacked him again. Mr Taylor said Matthews’ daughter did not have any significant injuries and accepted she was equally to blame for the behaviour. The police officer (not pictured) said he had never experience anything like the attack in 12 years of police work . Matthews suffered a black eye and a cut to her nose and pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour. Sentencing, magistrate Austin Molloy said: 'You followed your daughter outside and it was a prolonged incident. 'There was harm caused to both participants and there were vulnerable children present. 'You have not taken full responsibility in this case.' She was given an 18-month supervision order and given 100 hours of unpaid work. Matthews must also pay £85 court costs and a £60 victim sucharge to be paid at £5 per week out of her income support benefit.","Mother and daughter were fighting in pyjamas outside home in Blackburn .

For most woman, hair is a part of their feminine identity and shaving it off- no matter how good the motivation- is a big deal. For a model, whose entire career revolves around their appearance, the sacrifice of voluntarily stripping themselves of their hair is perhaps even greater. But lingerie model Lizzie Adams bravely took a razor to her long brunette hair to raise money for Breast Cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel!, with her new husband looking on. Lizzie hopes to raise a total of £10,000 for the charity for shaving her head . Lizzie, who recently married, works as a lingerie model for Curvy Kate . This is in fact the second time Lizzie has cut off her hair for charity after becoming motivated to fund raise when her own father was affected by cancer . The courageous newlywed – who has modelled for Curvy Kate and is a Star in a Bra winner- set the bar high when it comes to fundraising, at £10,000, and so far she has managed to raise just over £7,500 with donations still flooding in. No stranger to fundraising, Lizzie cut her long hair to a short bob in 2005 after her father was affected by cancer, managing to raise an impressive £3,500. But before the chop last week, her hair was the longest length it had ever been and she pledged to go one better and shave her head entirely after seeing the work of CoppaFeel! at a recent lingerie event. Before the chop last week, her hair was at its longest length ever . Lizzie explains, ‘It’s as much about awareness and keeping it in the public eye as it is fundraising, this is happening to women in my demographic, to women who are my friends and it is more important than ever for everyone to sit up and take notice’. She adds, ‘Curvy Kate is working with CoppaFeel! on several initiatives this year and as an ambassador for the brand I have to support the good work that they will be doing, along with the amazing efforts of CoppaFeel!’ She took the brave step on Valentine’s Day as she wanted to promote the idea of loving yourself and your boobs whilst emphasizing the importance of CoppaFeel!’s message to check your breasts. The charity’s mission is to make sure all breast cancers are diagnosed at the earliest stage possible, making treatments more effective and survival rates higher. Lizzie explains: 'It's as much about awareness and keeping it in the public eye as it is fundraising' Lizzie poses with her shaven head alongside another two models as part of the Coppafeel campaign . Almost 50,000 women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and CoppaFeel! is determined to educate and remind people to ‘know theirs boobs’ in order to catch breast cancer early. The charity was set up by Kristin Hallenga in 2009, who at 22 was told she was ‘too young to get breast cancer’. Lizzie and her husband share an embrace after her hair has been shaved (left), and Lizzie as model (right) This meant that her cancer was diagnosed late and could only be treated, never cured. Kristin comments: ‘We're thrilled that Lizzie is supporting us with this hugely brave endeavour! The funds she has pledged to raise us will make a huge difference to CoppaFeel! and the vital work we do. 'The added great support from Curvy Kate has ensured that her brilliant idea and our message is heard by even more people. (And she really did have lovely hair!)’ The hair she had chopped off will go to Little Princess which is a charity that provides real hair wigs for childrenwho have lost their hair to cancer.","Lizzie Adams shaved off her long hair for breast cancer charity Coppafeel!

The baby will be christened in the royal palace church in Stockholm sometime this summer, the royal court said. ‘It's cute and exciting,’ Mistress of Robes Alice Trolle-Wachtmeister said at a press conference following the announcement, reported TheLocal.se.

Not everyone can be called Pelle and Lisa.’ The baby's second name is believed to be in honor of Princess Lilian, who died in March 2013 at the age of 97. Princess Lilian was born the daughter of a Welsh coal miner in 1915. A model and actress, she met Prince Bertil of Sweden at a London nightclub during World War II. They fell in love, but Bertil could not marry a commoner without giving up his rights to the throne. The couple lived together for more than 30 years, during which Lilian behaved with great discretion and received no official recognition. After the death of the old king, Gustaf VI Adolf, King Carl XVI Gustaf came to the throne and gave his uncle Bertil permission to marry his longtime companion. They married in 1976 and remained together until Bertil's death in 1987.

Shannon James, 16, underwent plastic surgery and was left with nerve damage in the wake of the attack on her and her mother Rebecca, 42. The A-level student also needs to take sleeping pills after being left traumatised after the men burst into the £350,000 property in Ashington, near Horsham, West Sussex, posing as police officers. Warning: Graphic content .

The robbers smashed two glass panels in . the family's front door to enter the house at around 8.50pm, as they . were settling down for an early night. The men - wearing balaclavas - shouted 'police, police' before . entering the home Miss James shares with partner Graham Childs, an electrician. Miss James and Mr Childs, 47, rushed out onto the upstairs hallway after her daughter called out after hearing some banging. Miss James said: 'We got halfway down the stairs and I shouted out ""Who is it?"" 'There was a pause and then someone shouted, ""police, police"".' Miss James - who has less visible injuries - was struck over the head with a hammer. Shannon, who has 22 stitches in her head after undergoing emergency plastic surgery, said: 'I was really scared and tried to hide in my room. 'Then I heard my mum screaming and went onto the landing to see her lying against the wall. 'I ran at the man and told him to leave my mum alone and then blacked out because he hit me twice - once on the forehead and the top of my head. Wound: A large cut to Shannon's forehead after she was attacked by the raiders who burst into her home in Ashington, West Sussex . 'All I remember is screaming ""I'm going to die, I'm going to die"". I genuinely thought we were all going to die, I really did. It was the scariest thing ever.'

Her mum desperately tried the house phone and then ran to a neighbour's property to call for help. Paramedics . rushed the pair to hospital and Shannon later underwent a two-hour . operation. She has been left with a scar in the middle of her forehead . and on the right side of her head, under her hairline. She still suffers . headaches. Shannon, who hopes to study architecture at university, added: 'How could they do it? 'People ask me every day how I got my scar. I don't like to tell them. I can't wear make-up; it feels strange to touch it. 'I'm alright now but it is still there. The moment I wake up I think about it. I say to myself, ""get over it"" but you can't. 'What . could I have done to change it? It happened so fast. It was horrible. The attack had a huge effect on me and I still get nightmares. 'It's scary to be honest knowing those men are out there. If I see a man walking down the street I'll cross over the road to avoid him.' The robbers smashed two glass panels in the family's front door to enter the house at around 9pm, as they were settling down for an early night. Shannon added: 'My scar is still quite numb and feels horrible, there's a tingling sensation from where the surgeons had to stretch my skin. 'I get quite a lot of people looking at me and asking how I got my scar. It's a constant reminder of what happens. 'My mother still cries every day she sees it and says she cannot ever get over it.' Second wound: Shannon also suffered a second cut to her head underneath her hair in the attack in her home . Miss James' mother Rebecca James, 42, also suffered at the hands of the balaclava-clad intruders. The health and social care worker wept as she recalled the terrifying incident last August. Cut: Another wound to Shannon's hand which she suffered during the attack in her family home last August . She added: 'The men wearing balaclavas rushed in . and straight away we knew they were not police. The man with the . sledgehammer came at me and without saying anything hit me over the head . with it. 'I remember falling forwards, then backwards and my partner grabbed me and tried to help me back up stairs. 'The man with the crowbar came running up the stairs and I put my hand up to stop him from hitting me and got a cut on my hand. 'I . thought ""thank god he's missed me' but then the next thing I heard was . Shannon screaming ""I am dying"". There was blood everywhere - even all . over the phone as I dialled 999. 'The . men ran off without taking anything and Shannon was raced to hospital . in Chichester and had microsurgery on her forehead. It is a lot to watch . your kid in the operating theatre.' Breaking down, she added: 'They scarred Shannon's head but they scarred me mentally. 'These . people need to be caught - they are dangerous people. There was no . motive and I need closure. 'We are always asking, ""why?"" 'I'm . supposed to be a mother and I failed to protect my child in her own . home. The whole attack has left me very, very sad and emotional. 'Seeing Shannon lying in the hospital bed was awful - you can imagine how that would make any mother feel. 'Until these men are caught and prosecuted, we have no answers for what they did. Attack: The raiders burst into the family home on this road in Ashington, West Sussex . 'Nothing spooked them, they simply walked away. I have my days, but the raid is on my mind every day. 'Shannon . and I share something that we will never ever be able to forget. It's . scary still living here with that fear that they will come back and do . it all over again. We're always on our guard.' Detectives at Sussex Police urged anyone who recognised the descriptions of the attackers to come forward. Detective Constable Katy Lewis, from Sussex Police, said: 'The attackers are both described as tall, white men. 'The . one with the sledgehammer was stocky and big and the other man is . described as slimmer. They were dressed all in black and wearing . balaclavas. 'We believe a . green VW Golf which was found burnt out in Storrington, West Sussex, the . next day could be connected to the attack. 'We are hoping someone might have seen this car being driven in Ashington either before or after the attack that could help us. 'This was a terrifying attack for the whole family and they are still suffering the effects now. 'If you know something that could help us find the people responsible please get in contact.' A Sussex Police spokeswoman said detectives had spoken 'extensively' to the family and all possible motives had been explored. 'Why the raiders chose to break into this house in particular is something we have looked at in great detail,' she said. 'Police have spoken to the family extensively in a bid to see if there is any indication to what the cause or motive might have been. 'But there doesn't seem to be anything. This is a very odd case and it's a strange attack, but every possible option has been considered. 'The family have all been spoken to and there's nothing to indicate they were targeted or victims of mistaken identity. 'As a police force, we hope that the media and the public at large will be able to help us ID who the culprits are and pinpoint what happened. 'We're hopeful someone will remember seeing the car being driven earlier or people getting into it so that we can bring who did this to justice.'","Raiders broke into family home shouting 'police, police' and attacked heron .

Jim Lange, host of the first Dating Game, has died of a heart attack aged 81 at his home in California . Jim Lange, the first host of the popular game show The Dating Game, has died at his home in Mill Valley, California. He was 81. He died on Tuesday morning after suffering a heart attack, his wife Nancy said yesterday. Though Lange had a successful career in radio, he is best known for his television role on ABC's The Dating Game, which debuted in 1965 and on which he appeared for more than a decade, charming audiences with his mellifluous voice and wide, easygoing grin. He played host to many celebrity guests. Michael Jackson, Steve Martin and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others, appeared as contestants. Even a pre-Charlie's Angels Farrah Fawcett appeared on the program, introduced as 'an accomplished artist and sculptress' with a dream to open her own gallery. During the show, a young man or woman questioned three members of the opposite sex, hidden from view, to determine which one would be the best date. The questions were designed by the show's writers to elicit sexy answers. 'I've never been out on a date before. What do two kids like us do on a date?' a teenage Michael Jackson asked one of his potential dates on a 1972 episode of the show. 'Well, we'd have fun,' the girl answered. 'We'd go out to dinner, and then I'd go over to your house.' Lange was born on Aug. 15, 1932, in St. Paul, Minn., where at 15 he discovered a passion for local radio after winning an audition at a local station. 'They wanted a boy and a girl,' he said in a 1992 interview with the Bay Area Radio Digest. 'They wanted the boy to do sports and the girl to do the dances and stuff that was going on in the Twin Cities — very sexist — and play music once a week.' Scroll down for video .

A concert pianist was jailed this week for eight years for sexually abusing boys over a quarter of a century. John Briggs, 65, assaulted two music students and three sea cadets, filming two of his victims with a camcorder. Briggs was branded a systematic and relentless abuser of young boys as it emerged one of his victims went to the police 20 years ago, but no action was taken. Pianist John Briggs, from West Yorkshire, has been jailed for eight years after being convicted of nine charges of indecent assault on young boys . Judge Jonathan Durham Hall, QC told Bradford Crown Court: ‘Of course to add insult to injury when (the complainant) went to the police in 1993 they did absolutely nothing. 'That is a disgrace but things have changed.’ Briggs, who was awarded an MBE in 2003 for his work with the cadets, targeted young boys during private music lessons and then at the sea cadets group, where he was president. The 65-year-old assaulted two music students and three sea cadets, filming two of his victims on camcorder . He was convicted on nine charges of indecent assault covering a period between the late 1960s and 1993, on victims aged between 10 and 15. Briggs, of East Morton, West Yorkshire, was jailed for between a year and 30 months for each offence, to be served consecutively - amounting to eight years. Nicholas Worsley, prosecuting at Bradford Crown Court, said: '(Briggs) is a concert pianist, in the past taking private pupils for music lessons. 'During the course of some of those lessons he would sexually assault boys he was supposed to be teaching. 'In more recent years Mr Briggs became involved in the Keighley Sea Cadet movement which was based near where he lived' Mr Worsley told the court that one of the students Briggs allegedly abused was scared to say anything in case the lessons stopped. He told the court: 'He was very proud to be taught by Mr Briggs. He was well known at the time, very famous at the time. He was put in for his Grade eight exam, which was advanced for his age. 'He was fearful that if he said anything that would be the end of his hopes as a pianist.' The court heard when the boy was . nearly 16, Briggs invited him to his home for an extended lesson and . ended up lying naked wearing a pink gown beside the boy, trying to get . him to touch him. The boy ran away and told his mother but nothing was done, a jury heard. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall, QC told Bradford Crown Court, Briggs was a 'systematic and relentless abuser' of young boys. He was convicted of crimes dating from the late 1960s to 1993, and his victims were aged between 10 and 15 . Mr Worsley said: 'Mr Briggs subsequently got in touch with (the boy's) parents and said their son had no talent and would never amount to anything as a musician.' In the early 1990s Briggs went on to abuse three teenage boys he knew through his role as president in the Sea Cadets - two of these he filmed on a camcorder, the court heard. The jury was told on both occasions he asked the boys if they were interested in modelling and paid one boy £80. The court heard that in the early 1990s, Briggs abused a 15-year-old boy he knew through the cadets. Police were informed and Briggs was arrested but wasn't charged. The court heard his arrest over the Sea Cadet allegations led to the music allegations coming to the attention of the police. In various interviews with the police Briggs denied any sexual assaults of music pupils and denied any sexual activity with cadets.","John Briggs assaulted two music students and three sea cadets .

"By . Kate Lyons . PUBLISHED: . 01:18 EST, 27 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:04 EST, 27 February 2014 . Crystal methamphetamine, street name ice, is known for its terrible side effects - psychosis, paranoia, ‘meth mouth’ in which a user’s teeth decay and crack, suicidal and homicidal thoughts, and sores, which result from a user picking at their skin because they feel like bugs are crawling all over it. But it seems that for a large number of young women, one side effect makes all the others worth it – weight loss. An estimated 30 percent of female meth users take the 'Breaking Bad drug' or do not want to give it up because it helps them to lose weight. Despite the harmful side effects of the drug, one third of women who use crystal meth report weight loss as a key reason they take it . Julie* took up crystal meth as a teenager. She entered a treatment program in her native Canada and was able to quit the drug. ‘She managed to abstain for many, many years,’ said Bob Hughes, the Executive Director of ASK Wellness Centre in British Columbia, who worked with Julie in the program. After quitting, Julie, now 24, gained 35 pounds (15kg). Her unhappiness about her weight gain was a key factor in her taking the drug up again. ‘She returned heavily back to crystal and a huge part of that was body image,’ said Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes, who has worked with addicts for many years, says that crystal methamphetamine, which has received significant attention in the last few years due to the television show Breaking Bad, is still a ‘niche drug’. But it is one that it is seeing a resurgence in recent years, particularly among young women. Unlike most drugs, which have more male addicts than female ones, Mr Hughes estimates that 60 percent of crystal meth users are female. ‘You’ll find that a lot of young women take it because it suppresses the appetite,’ he said. Crystal meth differs from other drugs in that a higher percentage of its users are female than male . Side effects of crystal meth use include psychosis, paranoia, decaying and cracked teeth, suicidal and homicidal thoughts, and 'formication', the sensation that bugs are crawling all over your skin . Mr Hughes estimates that among young female addicts, 30 percent use the drug, which is a powerful appetite suppressant and allows people to function for days without needing to eat, in part because of its weight loss effects. His estimation tracks globally. A 2011 study from the Burnet Institute of Medical Research in Australia found that 30 percent of female meth addicts reported that weight loss or weight maintenance was a key factor in them taking the drug. Because the body has been starved during the period of drug-taking, after someone has kicked their drug habit the body responds by storing fat in anticipation of future periods of starvation. Because of this, ex-addicts, like Julie who gained 35 pounds after quitting, often quickly regain any weight they lost after kicking their meth habit. For many of these young women, the fear of gaining weight is a serious obstacle to them seeking treatment and a key reason they take up the drug again after quitting, as users try to balance drug use and body image. Unlike almost all illicit drugs, more women are addicted to ice than men . ‘The thinking is: “I look a lot better when I use crystal, if I can just find that perfect balance between still using, but not using too much,”’ said Mr Hughes. Methamphetamine has been prescribed by doctors as a weight loss since the 1970s and is still prescribed as a medication for the treatment of ADHD and obesity in the form of the drug Desoxyn (methamphetamine hydrochloride) in the United States. There are strict controls in place around the Desoxyn’s use, which people are told should not be used for more than a few weeks at a time. A UN report released in 2008 reported that 24.7 million people worldwide used crystal methamphetamine during 2006-2007. In the English-speaking world, Australia has the highest use of illicit methamphetamine. Around 2.5 percent of Australians over the age of 14 - approximately 500,000 people - used the drug in the last year. This is three times higher than use in the USA and Canada (0.5 percent) and the UK (1 percent).","Weight loss a factor in meth-taking for 30 percent of female addicts .

Oscar Pistorius’s PR team have set up a Twitter account it claims will reveal ‘the hard truth’ about his imminent murder trial. The paralympian is accused of murdering his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and is due to stand trial at a Pretoria court on March 3, which will be televised. Pistorius, also known as the Blade Runner, shot Ms Steenkamp dead on Valentine’s Day last year, but he claimed he mistook her for a burglar and denies murder. Scroll down for video . Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp pictured together in 2012. Leaked court documents suggest the athlete was looking at pornographic websites on his mobile the night the model died, local media is reporting . However, the loose contempt of court laws in South Africa mean newspapers have reported the story with what some might say has been a carefree attitude to objectivity and this has clearly worried Pistorius’s PR team. As a result they have set up a Twitter account called @OscarHardTruth, which immediately claimed would set the record straight. After it was created on Sunday, a tweet was posted that said: ‘As the trial approaches, many untruths half truths and versions of the truth have, and shall be spread across the world.' A picture taken on January 26, 2013 shows Pistorius posing next to Steenkamp at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg . Pistorius's PR team has set up a Twitter account it claims will reveal 'the hard truth' Pistorius's PR team is clearly worried about media bias surrounding the court proceedings . Another read: ‘We WILL address the truth and expose those with ulterior motives. The Truth will Prevail.’ However, these two tweets have since been deleted, with the only remaining post from Sunday carrying a more sober tone. It said: ‘This feed will provide the hard truth as it unfolds and provide information that will become clearer during the trial.’ Other tweets on the profile link to stories about the trial that throw doubt on the prosecution case. At the time of writing the account has attracted over 18,000 followers. A South African judge ruled on Tuesday that most of Pistorius's trial can be broadcast live, but not the Paralympian's own testimony. Judge Dunstan Mlambo said cameras would be allowed 'to obtain a video and audio recording' of opening arguments, the evidence of state witnesses, closing arguments and the verdict and sentencing. But cameras will not be allowed to film Pistorius, witnesses for the defence, or anyone else who objects to appearing on camera, he added. The news follows an allegation that Pistorius was looking at pornographic websites the night Steenkamp was shot and killed. The paralympian used his mobile phone, which was recovered at his home in Pretoria, to access the material online, reports from in the South African media suggested recently. Media attention: Pistorius at the Pretoria Magistrates court in Pretoria, South Africa, last June . A document, believed to be court papers leaked from the investigation, are thought to state data from the phone shows he would have visited the sites while Ms Steenkamp was in the building. The document goes on to state the sites are in 'direct contrast to that of a loving couple spending their time together', it is alleged. The reports come two days after it was claimed neighbours heard screams in between gunfire on the night Ms Steenkamp was killed. Court documents suggest a final round of shots ‘extinguished’ the screams, it is believed. On Valentine’s Day 2013, Pistorius is alleged to have shot the model four times through a locked bathroom door of his home in a gated community in Pretoria. Pistorius says he thought his girlfriend was an intruder. Pistorius took to Twiiter on the anniversary of the shooting and said: 'No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva. 'The pain and sadness - especially for Reeva's parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow. The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.' The claims come as the athlete was pictured posing with fans in Johannesburg. In one picture, Pistorius looks relaxed and tanned as he poses with Tatum Moodley and Pegan Trivangalo. Meanwhile, the family of Ms Steenkamp are said to be struggling as the trial approaches. The model's father Barry, 69, recently suffered a near fatal stroke. He is now at home in Port Elizabeth and is said to be recovering. Mr Steenkamp's brother Mike said his condition was a direct result of the forthcoming trial. He told the Sunday People: 'When my brother opened a newspaper report about the upcoming trial and an out-of-court settlement, it broke him to pieces. 'That's why he had a stroke. He is not coping very well.'","Pistorius is accused of murdering his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .

Motorists driving on a major road were shocked to see the rotting carcass of a huge whale being carried on the back of a lorry. The 50ft sperm whale had been lying on a beach for five days after getting stranded on the Kent coast. And when it was finally taken to a landfill site, the sight and smell of the leviathan proved to be too much for some motorists. Surreal: Commuters spotted this enormous sperm whale carcass on the A2 in Kent . It was first spotted last Thursday, when the dead whale was stranded near the village of Seasalter. After being towed on shore this week, the whale was loaded onto the back of a flat-bed truck and covered with a tarpaulin. Boyd Roberts Casualty Livestock, a contractor specialising in the disposal of animal carcasses, took it along the A2 to a deep landfill site in Canterbury. Commuter Mark Stephens, 41, saw the truck on its way to the landfill, with part of the whale hanging off the back. 'There was a Land Rover in front and behind, flashing orange lights and this massive whale with its head and tail chopped off,' he said. Leviathan: The sperm whale was stranded on the Kent coastline last week (file photo) 'There was blood and guts dropping off the back and everything. The smell was unbelievable. I've worked near an abattoir and that smelled bad, but this was something else. 'It was incredible really. You would have thought given the state it was in they would have transported it at night. I don't think I'll see anything like that again.' A spokesman for the contractor denied the suggestion that any parts had dropped off the carcass. 'The small parts were transported in a sealed container the day before, so there wasn't anything that could have dropped off,' he said. A spokesman for Peel Ports, the company which manages the local harbour, said that it was not responsible for anything that happened during the transportation of the whale carcass. 'Because the whale carcass posed a potential threat to the navigation channel, a Peel Ports vessel was instructed to tow the carcass back to the port,' she added. 'The port contacted a licensed and experienced contractor in order to facilitate a responsible and safe removal from the port.'","Giant whale was stranded on the Kent coastline last week and died .

It has already tested early versions in India, and hopes to see the sensor features on consumer cars as well. Scroll down for video . Your car could soon monitor your health and even take over driving if you get ill or fall asleep at the wheel, Ford has revealed. Its technology works by analysing the driver's 'workload' from the use of steering and brakes to biometric sensors telling the car about the driver's health . ‘Health applications are something that will be an amazing opportunity in car,’ Vijay Sankaran, Ford’s Chief Technology Director to the VentureBeat conference in San Francisco. ‘In India we are testing functions where doctors can use onboard electronics to take basic diagnostics and transmit them back to a central location. ‘The vehicle becomes a sort of mobile ambulance on wheels.’ The firm also says the health sensors will appear in everyday models. ‘We’ve also thought about how can we help different kinds of conditions. 'For instance, we have tested sensors that can tell when people are having seizures to safely steer or park them. There are the ""few too many drinks"" or the ""drowsy’ application.""' Ford is also developing smart seats, steering wheels and seat belts with sensors built in. ‘Infrared sensors on the steering wheel monitor the palms of a driver’s hands as well as his or her face looking for changes in temperature,’ a spokesman for Ford said. ‘A downward-looking infrared sensor under the steering column measures the cabin temperature to provide a baseline for comparing changes in the driver’s temperature. With a more complete picture of the driver's health and wellness gleaned through onboard sensors (pictured) blended with knowledge of what is happening outside the vehicle, the car will have the intelligence to dynamically adjust the alerts provided to the driver and filter interruptions . 'The final sensor is embedded in the seat belt to assess the driver’s breathing rate.’ Mr Sankaran also predicted that self driving cars, such as those being developed by Google, are unlikely to hit roads in the next decade in large numbers. ‘The notion of self driving vehicles is on the minds of many- we’ve already been developing this to several years, we have adaptive cruise control, parking - these feature will be constantly introduced. ‘We’re paying attention to Google and others. Autonomy has to be something the consumer desires as well. ‘A truly autonomous vehicle is probably a number of years away - more like a decade.’","Ford has tested sensors that use body temperature to tell when a driver is having a seizure so the car can steer or park them to safety .

Crews are preparing to investigate a mystery radiation leak 2,000 feet underground in a facility where waste from the country's nuclear weapons program is kept in sealed containers . Officials are at a loss to explain what has caused the excessive leak at the Carlsbad Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico which is designed to store waste underground for centuries. Operations at the desert facility were shut down following an incident earlier this month when a truck caught fire underground and several workers suffered smoke inhalation. Mystery below: The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad was placed on shutdown after an underground alarm was triggered from a possible radioactive leak . Deep below: Radioactive waste is buried in the salt formations in special casks . Sealed: The salt is supposed to keep the waste from penetrating water supplies . Connected? Work at the facility stopped last week after a truck caught fire underground and several employees suffered smoke inhalation . Massive: WIPP is the third deepest geological storage site in the world, behind two facilities in German . Search postponed: Investigators haven't been able to go underground yet to find the source of the leak . Timeline: The facility is expected to continue accepting waste until 2030 . The World Isolation Pilot Plant was opened in 1999 to store transuranic radioactive waste for 10,000 years. It is the third deepest geological storage center int he word after two different repositories in Germany. The facility receives waste contaminated with plutonium, uranium, americium and neptunium. Transuranic waste are materials that come in contact with radiation such as gloves, tools, rags and machinery. While they may not be as potent as nuclear reactor byproducts, transuranic waste can continue to contaminate for up to 24,000 years. Since it opened in 1999, WIPP has processed 400,000 55-gallon drums containing these radioactive materials and functioned without incident until Friday. These cask drums are stored in rooms constructed into the salt basin 2,150 feet below ground. The rooms will help seal the materials from posing a risk to public health since it takes a billion years for water to move even an inch in the salty basin. Department of Energy investigators . still don't know whether that incident played a role in this new leak, . since they haven't been cleared to go underground to find the source. 'They . will not go in today. It's a safety thing more than anything. We're . waiting until we get other assessments done before we authorize . re-entry,' DOE spokesman Bill Mackie said. An air monitor which detects airborne radiation went off around 11pm Friday. While it wasn't the first time alarms have rung at the facility, officials believe this was the first real alarm in the history of the plant since it opened in 1999. Because the plant was in shutdown mode, no employees were underground when the alarm went off and none of the 139 workers above ground were exposed. The alarm system automatically . switched the the facility's ventilation system to filtration in order to . keep the leak from reaching the surface. The . WIPP sits over salt deposits which help seal transuranic waste . discarded from the country's nuclear weapons program such as machinery . and clothing. The . salt deposits keep the material from contaminating water supplies since . it takes about a billion years for water to move an inch in the . deposits. The plant processes some 6,000 cubic meters of radiative waste a year and employs 800 people. It is expected to continue accepting materials until 2030.

The apparent decision by the Duchess of Cambridge to breastfeed has been given a boost by fresh evidence showing it can help raise a baby’s IQ. The longer the child is breastfed – ideally exclusively – the higher the intelligence scores are at the age of seven. The study also found breastfeeding can enhance language skills from the age of three. The Duchess of Cambridge's apparent decision to try to breastfeed Prince George has been boosted by evidence showing it can raise a child's IQ . The US researchers recommend babies are solely fed on breast milk for the first six months and are given the chance to breastfeed until a year old. However, British experts warned that . delaying the introduction of solid foods until six months at the . earliest might leave some babies feeling hungry. It emerged yesterday that the Duchess has at least one maternity dress made for breastfeeding and was given encouragement in hospital to help her baby George start on her milk. Earlier research has shown breast milk protects babies against stomach bugs, chest infections, asthma and allergies, and confers health advantages in later life. But only a small number of women in the UK breastfeed their babies for long periods and the number of new mothers starting in 2011 fell slightly to 73.9 per cent. Barely 2 per cent of babies are breastfed exclusively for six months. The latest study included 1,312 mothers and children who had taken part in Project Viva, a long-term investigation of pregnancy and child health in the US. It found seven-year-olds breastfed for the first year of life were likely to score four points more in a test of verbal IQ than bottle-fed children. Verbal intelligence scores at seven increased by 0.35 points for every extra month of breastfeeding. Three-year-olds also benefited, having higher scores in a language-acquisition test the longer they had been breastfed. Exclusive breastfeeding had the greatest effect. The US team of researchers reported the findings in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. The scientists, led by Dr Mandy Belfort, from Boston Children’s Hospital, said: ‘Our results support a causal relationship of breastfeeding in infancy with receptive language at age three and with verbal and non-verbal IQ at school age. 'These findings support national and . international recommendations to promote exclusive breastfeeding through . age six months and continuation of breastfeeding through at least age . one year.' A number of factors that might have influenced the results, . including home environment and mothers' IQ, were accounted for by the . researchers. Children took part in several tests, including the Peabody Picture . Vocabulary Test at age three and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test at . age seven. Certain nutrients in breast milk may benefit the developing infant . brain, it has been suggested. One of these is docosahexaenoic (DHA), . which is abundant in fish. Part of the research looked at whether mothers' fish consumption was . linked to the benefits of breastfeeding but the results were not . statistically significant. Kate has had at least one maternity dress made for breastfeeding, it has emerged . It is thought that chemicals naturally present in breast milk can aid . brain development, but skin to skin contact and bonding during . breastfeeding may also play a part. But Clare Byam Cook, an independent breastfeeding counsellor and former midwife, said: ‘It’s best to keep an open mind about what your baby’s individual needs are. 'Many babies feel hungry if they only get breast milk and most need solids before six months.’ She said mothers who can breastfeed their babies easily are giving them a great start in life. She said: 'Most women who give up find it too difficult to continue. The Duchess was given encouragement in hospital to help baby George start on her milk . 'They are not unaware of the benefits to the baby, they have been . brainwashed into thinking if they don't their baby will miss out and it . can be a very worrying time. Ms Cook, the author of Top Tips For . Breast Feeding and Top Tips For Bottle Feeding, said there was new . evidence that breastfeeding exclusively for six months may not be best . for baby, putting them at risk of allergies, food aversion and even . obesity. Babies can be safely given solid foods at least eight weeks earlier in . life than official Department of Health guidelines telling women to . breastfeed exclusively for the first six months, according to . researchers.","US researchers found breastfeeding can enhance language skills from three .

Free to study: Rudy Guede is being allowed out of prison after serving just six years of sentence for the murder of Meredith Kercher . The drifter convicted for the killing of Meredith Kercher has insisted Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito are guilty of her murder, as it was revealed he is being allowed to leave prison to study for a degree. Rudey Guede, 27, who is serving a 16 year jail sentence for the murder and sexual assault of Meredith, spoke out as it emerged he is now eligible for day release after serving just six years of his sentence. Because of the Italian legal system Guede is entitled to early release as he has served almost half his sentence - and has been a model prisoner with no incidents of misbehaviour during his time in prison, the Daily Mirror reports. In a letter to his lawyer Walter Biscotti, he said: ‘I want to underline that the people who committed this terrible crime are still free and that the truth has still not emerged and that it will never be found, especially if people continue to listen to false testimony and liars.‘All I have heard is lies and a distortion of the facts especially when it comes to my character. The judiciary must seek to establish the truth because that night I did not kill anyone and the people responsible for what happened that tragic night are still free.‘The court still insists that I was guilty of sexual assault but I did not commit that crime and even the autopsy proves that. This is a painful episode for me and for Meredith’s family. I am seen as the ideal guilty person but  I had nothing to do with this.’ Guede was initially convicted under a fast track trial in 2008 and sentenced to 30 years in jail for Meredith’s murder and sexual assault but this was later reduced to 16 years on appeal. During his trial he admitted being at . the murder scene but he insisted he had been in the toilet at the time . Meredith was attacked, and that he emerged to see ‘someone resembling . Sollecito’ fleeing the scene and ‘Knox outside the house’ where the . murder took place in Perugia in November 2007. British student Meredith Kercher was found with her throat cut in her bedroom in the central Italian city of Perugia. Rudy Guede was found guilty of murder and sexual assault . DNA tests established Guede was at the scene after his fingerprints were found in Meredith’s blood and he was also identified from a faeces specimen found in a toilet at the house. He told the court that convicted him that he had found Meredith bleeding to death and then tried to save her by stemming a wound to her neck but then  fled as he relaised she was dying. Last night Guede’s lawyer Valter . Biscotti confirmed that Guede was now eligible for parole and had been . given permission to study at an undisclosed university near Perugia but . he had not yet left prison to take up his place on the course. He said: ‘Rudy can go out of prison for . several hours at a time now and that’s the law all over Italy. He spends . his days studying history. Raffaele Sollecito has been ordered to serve 25 years and Amanda Knox 28  years  after a judge upheld their original guilty verdicts for the murder of Meredith Kercher . 'He spends some hours with a teacher, we don’t want to say where he is because he will get swamped by people from all over the world. ‘At the moment he’s not going out. But he can if he wants to, he just has to make an application. Last month an appeal court in Florence upheld the original murder convictions on Knox and Sollecito and a judge ordered that she serve 28 years while he was given 25 years - although neither sentence has been enforced as a further appeal stage has to be concluded. Both Knox and Sollecito have insisted they are innocent and have blamed Guede for the murder with Sollecito saying: ‘There is no evidence of me or Amanda at the scene while Guede’s DNA is everywhere.’","Rudey Guede is serving a 16 .

A fisherman is set to have his probable world-record lake trout disqualified because it was caught in Canada. Rob Scott of Crane Lake, Minnesota, pulled the 52-pound, 3-ounce fish through the ice on the Ontario side of Lac la Croix on February 8 after an hour-long struggle. Unfortunately for Scott, 65, earlier that day he had already caught a smaller, four-pound trout and the rules in Canada prevent a fisherman from catching more than one fish per day. Rob Scott of Crane Lake, Minnesota, pulled the 52-pound, 3-ounce fish through the ice on the Ontario side of Lac la Croix on February 8 after an hour-long struggle . In an attempt to circumnavigate the law which would only allow him to return to Minnesota with one fish, Scott gave the smaller one to a fellow angler. But two officers from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources had stopped to check Scott's license and noted that he had made his catch, before he caught the behemoth trout. The world record for a lake trout caught by tip-up through the ice is currently less than 30 pounds and so Scott's massive catch was reported by The Star Tribune as a potential world-record. Unfortunately for Scott, one of the Ontario-based officers saw the article and recalled that it wasn’t the same fish that Scott had caught when they had stopped him. Ironically, Scott said he was fishing only about 100 feet from the Minnesota side of Lac la Croix, where the lake trout limit is two . Scott was then interviewed at his home on Monday evening by two Minnesota conservation officers . His trout was also taken into the possession by an Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officer, after being confiscated from a taxidermist. It will now be hand-delivered at the border to an investigating officer of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. In an interview with the Star Tribune Scott conceded that the fish probably was taken in violation of Ontario law, but he argued that given the long time he had spent fighting it it would have died quickly beneath the ice. ‘It wasn’t illegal for me to keep fishing after I caught the first trout. But when I caught the bigger fish, with the adrenaline and everything I had going, and the fact that it wasn’t going to survive if I released it, I figured if I gave the smaller fish away, that would be OK,’ he said.

Ironically, Scott said he was fishing . only about 100 feet from the Minnesota side of Lac la Croix, where the . lake trout limit is two.

The Southeast Missourian spoke to Public information officer Darin Hickey on Thursday who said that when off-duty cops saw the men fighting they 'immediately separated them.' Alexander told the Missourian that he became angry with Steck after he forcibly pulled his step-daughter from his hands which she said, 'hurt her.' Alexander claims that Steck slapped him with the back of his hand and says that Steck spit in his face.

Incompetent: Brent Bartel, 40, has been deemed unfit to stand trial for carving a pentagram into his son's back . A Texas father charged with carving a pentagram into his six-year-old son's back has been ordered to a psychiatric hospital after being found incompetent to stand trial. Brent Bartel, 40, is accused of using a box cutter to carve a pentagram into his son's back in December 2012. Doctors have diagnosed Bartel as paranoid schizophrenic, and a judge has ordered him to spend at least one year in treatment at Kerrville State Hospital. According to the Star-Telegram, Bartel has been found incompetent by doctors twice previously since his arrest. In November after he was found incompetent, he was sent to the North Texas State Hospital in Vernon for treatment. The Star-Telegram reports that Bartel made several bizarre statements to doctors as he was evaluated this month, and was unable to speak about his case without incorporating religious ideas and delusions. 'There’s a lot of spiritual warefare going on'; 'I was hearing voices coming through the television, back when I was on block 56'; 'When I leave here, I’ll fast and eat only rabbit pellets for 40 days'; 'Devil makes sounds that don’t bounce'; 'Got a hernia due to my computer'; and 'Electromagnetic pulse can detonate people' are some of the remarks he made to doctors. Disturbing: Officers said the father took some of his son's blood and smeared it on the door frame . Unsettling scene: The six-year-was was found shivering outside his home dressed only in pajama pants and no shirt . Chilling: Bartel, pictured here with his young son, told a 911 dispatcher that he 'shed some innocent blood' in honor of the 'holy day,' likely referring to the historic date 12-12-12 . On February 11, he said, 'Dreams suggest not to live with my son.' After Bartel attacked his son in 2012, he called emergency services to tell them he had done it because ‘it's a holy day.’ The date was 12-12-12, a once-in-a-century event without any discernible religious meaning. Bartel could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Bartel called 911 shortly after midnight to report the incident, The Dallas Morning Star reported. 'I shed some innocent blood,' he calmly told the emergency services. 'I inscribed a pentagram on my son.' Shortly . after Bartel confessed, the boy's mother ran to a neighbor's house and . also called 911 to report that her husband was hurting their son and was . armed with a knife. Medical help: Bartel will receive treatment at Kerrville State Hospital . Officers . who responded to the two calls arrived to discover the boy shivering in . the front yard dressed in pajama pants without a shirt. Most . of the child's back was covered with a large pentagram. Officers . wrapped the six-year-old with a jacket and called the paramedics. Inside Bartel's house police recovered a box cutter they believe was the weapon used to carve the symbol. A pentagram is a five-pointed star inside a circle that is most commonly associated with the occult, including Neopagan faiths and Freemasonry, as well as satanism. In a bizarre twist, Sergeant Nathan Stringer, of Richland Hills police, said that Bartel smeared some of his son's blood on the frame of his front door, according to CBS DFW. 'This is something you normally hear about in the movies, not something you expect to see,' Stringer told the station KENS5. Occult symbol: Police say the father used a box cutter to cut a large pentagram - a five-pointed star inside a circle - on his son's back  (stock image) The cuts to his back were not very deep, and the boy did not have to have stitches. According to police, they had responded to Bartel's home in the past over verbal domestic abuse, but they said that none of the previous incidents involved the child.

A Texas teenager who suffered serious head injuries at a gymnastics class is starting to make progress a week after doctors said he had only a 50/50 chance of survival. Blake Hyland was learning a new move, which involved performing jumping from a spring board and twisting in the air, when he landed badly at a Waco gym on February 18. The 14-year-old is said to have hit his head with the same force as a high-speed car crash, and had to be put in a medically induced coma. Fighting for life: Blake Hyland, pictured with his dad, Pat, was seriously injured at his gymnastics class . But Blake's parents, Pat and Cindy Hyland, say he has started to respond and doctors have started to move him off a ventilator that has been helping the teenager breathe. Blake was rushed to Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco where surgeons removed part of his skull because of bleeding and swelling on the brain. He was then moved to Cook Children's Hospital, where he has been kept sedated while his body recovers. 'The doctors there went above and . beyond. And if they did not do that the doctors here at Cook Children's . said that Blake would not have survived,' Mr Hyland told NBC5. After being given only a 50/50 chance of survival, Blake is now able to move his left arm and leg, and squeeze his doctor's finger on request. Support: Blake, second from left, had part of his skull removed to reduce swelling . Vigil: Pat Hyland, pictured with Blake, is staying at his son's bedside . Support: Messages have been pouring in from across the world for Blake, including this one from UK GymKatz . Family friend David Stringer told KWTX: 'They said most people don’t wake up from this type of injury, and left it by saying it would take a miracle for Blake to come out of it. The athletic teenager received his injuries while practicing a new move at his power tumbling class. 'There was a pad on the side, but his . side hit it. Then his head came down and there was no pad on the concrete and his . head hit concrete,' Mr Hyland said. Blake's family and friends have set up a Prayers for Blake Hyland Facebook page, which has updates on his progress and a fund to help with costs. Recovery: Despite his serious head injuries Blake has started to make progress and responds to doctors . Talented: Blake is pictured above, doing back flips at a display in Waco, Texas . The page has attracted support from across the world, with hundreds of people sending messages of goodwill, and the University of Kentucky tumbling team and UK GymKatz posting pictures of themselves holding up signs saying 'Pray for Blake'. Mrs Hyland described the outpouring of support for her son as overwhelming.

Despite a rise in credit card fraud, the most commonly-used PIN is still 1234, with 1111 and 0000 coming in second and third. Research has revealed that one in ten codes is so obvious it would take criminals just one attempt to guess it correctly, while more than a quarter of the codes are used so often they can be guessed in fewer than 20 attempts. The study from DataGenetics analysed . 3.4 million four-digit codes and found that many people use birth years as PINs, making it even easier for hackers to guess a code simply by finding out a person's age from online accounts. A study by DataGenetics has uncovered the most commonly-used PINs used worldwide. The research also reveals it would take a hacker just 20 attempts to be able to guess more than a quarter of secure PINs and 10 per cent of codes could be guessed first time . 1. 1234 . 2. 1111 . 3. 0000 . 4. 1212 . 5. 7777 . 6. 1004 . 7. 2000 . 8. 4444 . 9. 2222 . 10. 6969 . Research from security experts McAfee . has found that 17 per cent of people in Europe have been victims of . credit card fraud, at a cost of £1,076 per person. Last year the total cost of credit . card fraud in the UK from criminals hacking and cloning cards was £42.1 . million and the total amount of fraud committed through all credit . card-related crimes was £388 million. There are 10,000 possible combinations for four-digit PIN codes using 0 to 9. DataGenetics used data from previously released password tables and security breaches. By combining the password databases, researchers filtered the results to show just four-digit numbers and were able to analyse 3.4 million four-digit passwords. They discovered that all of the possible 10,000 combinations - from 0000 to 9999 - were found in the data list. The most popular password was 1234, but the amount of times this number occurred 'staggered' the researchers - almost 11 per cent of the 3.4 million passwords were 1234. This PIN was also more popular than the 4,200 codes at the bottom of the list combined. The next most popular 4-digit PIN was 1111, used more than 6 per cent of times. In third place was 0000 at  two per cent. Data Genetics compiled a list of the top 20 passwords and found that 26.83 per cent of all the passwords in the list could be guessed by attempting these 20 combinations. The researchers also noted that many of the high-frequency PINs could be interpreted as years because many began with 19. This chart shows the ratio of 19+ to non-19+ codes. Every single 19+ combination appeared in the top fifth of the list . The researchers said: 'Statistically, with 10,000 possible combinations, if passwords were uniformly randomly distributed, we would expect these twenty passwords to account for just 0.2per cent of the total, not the 26.83 per cent encountered.' The more popular password selections dominate the frequency tables and the study found that 10 per cent of PINs could be guessed correctly first time. More than 20 per cent could be guessed by using just five attempts and statistically, one third of all codes could be guessed by trying just 61 distinct combinations. The data found that the least-used code was 8068 with just 25 appearances in 3.4 million - far fewer than random distribution would predict. The majority of PINs in the DataGenetics list began with the number one, which may be due to the popularity of using birth years. Zero and two were also popular. The higher the number, the lower its frequency . The researchers also noted that many of the high-frequency PINs could be interpreted as years because many began with 19, for example, 1984, 1967 and so on. This could be a birth year or anniversary and if a hacker can guess someone's age, or even obtain it through birth records or online accounts, for example, they could make an educated guess at the PIN. In fact, every single 19+ combination appeared in the top fifth of the list. The majority of PINs in the DataGenetics list began with the number one, which may be due to the popularity of using birth years. The numbers zero and two were also popular.

It sounds like a scene from National Lampoon's Animal House: furniture rearranged for drinking games, smell of marijuana all around and over 1,000 empty beer cans. But, in an unprecedented move, four Boston University students have spent three nights in jail on charges of repeatedly throwing raucous parties at their house in Allston. Police allege a recent knees-up thrown by the four accused - Michael Oldcorn, 20; John Pavia, 20; Sawyer Petric, 19, and Terry Bartrug, 20 - violated the probation terms they were given following a party in September, which involved more than 200 people. The groups faced court Friday morning and we released after three nights in jail, however all four kept their faces covered with the hands for the duration of the appearance - even when they were being addressed by Judge David Donnell. Their dramatic arrests come as police continue to crack down on noise disturbances from parties in the area, with calls of complaint said to have now been halved. In hiding: Facing court this morning but hiding their faces, the four accused - (from left) Michael Oldcorn, 20; John Pavia, 20; Terry Bartrug, 20 and Sawyer Petric, 19 - were charged with violating probation terms they were given following a party in September . The boys try their best to hide from the press while facing court in Boston on Friday morning . Boston police Sergeant Michael O’Hara told The Boston Globe that officers were left with no choice but to arrest the group after consistent warnings. 'It gets to the point you have to say enough is enough,' he said. 'These kids were given every opportunity, and they blew it.' The first incident occurred in September, when police were called to the 'animal house' on Linden Street. Upon their arrival, revelers raced back inside the property and turned off the music and lights. Once inside, officers said there 200 . people at the house, which was scattered with empty liquor bottles and . smelled of marijuana. Jailed: Michael Oldcorn, 20 (left) and John Pavia, 20 (right), along with their two other fraternity brothers, were arrested for allegedly violating their probation and throwing a house party on Tuesday night . Terry Bartrug, 20, was one of four Boston University students charged and jailed after all;allegedly throwing a wild party while on probation. The group were party of the Z.B.T. fraternity . At 19, Sawyer Petric (pictured) is the youngest of the Z.B.T. frat brothers jailed for their house parties . The house, at 85 Linden Street in the Boston suburb of Allston, is one of about 63 on the Boston Police Department's 'Party Call Hotsheet', based on regular noise complaints . The four hosts were given one charge each of keeping a disorderly house. They were put on pretrial probation, police said, and were told that if they stayed out of trouble, all would be forgiven. However on January 26 - four months later - they threw a second a party. Police say doors were slammed and locked in their faces when they arrived at the house at 1am. Scores of people, many underage, began pouring out of doors and windows. When police did get in, they found more than 1,000 beer cans. The four students were arrested, with Judge David Donnelly revoking their bail for violating probation. The four have been held here, at Nashua Street Jail, since Tuesday, police said. They are expected to go before a judge on Friday . As raucous parties go, O’Hara said these two were in 'the top 10 percent'. 'But they’re not being put in jail for being a keeper of a disorderly house,' he said. 'They’re being put in jail because of the fact that they violated the probation. . . That’s a serious offense. That’s an affront to the court.' According to the police report, the house was being used by the BU fraternity Z.B.T., Zeta Beta Tau. However the website, Facebook and Twitter accounts for the fraternity have been disabled. On Friday it emerged that BU Dean of Students Kenneth Elmore suspended the fraternity, Zeta Beta Tau, because the school believes the Jan. 26 party was part of a recruitment effort by the fraternity and that underage drinking was taking place. The news coincided with a court appearance by the four, who stood shoulder to shoulder and kept their faces concealed throughout the hearing. They were released from jail  on personal recognizance, after three nights behind bars, however Judge David Donnelly was was scathing in his statements. 'Their parents have gone to great lengths, great sacrifice, great expense, for these four young men to go to a world-class university,' he said. The students had learned their lesson and 'manned up', said defense attorney David R. Yannetti, adding that all four were moving out of the house. Boston University is one of the more expensive colleges in the country, with students paying about $58, 530 per year. In 2012, O’Hara said, when he took over as community service supervisor at District 14 in Brighton, he and his officers came up with a plan to track houses with lots of complaints. Michael Oldcorn, 20, one of the four alleged party animals, is seen here in a photo from Facebook . Terry Bartrug, 20, and his three housemates were charged with keeping a disorderly house in September. After allegedly throwing another party this week, they were arrested . Now, residents who attract loud-party complaints are usually asked to perform 30 hours of community service in the Allston-Brighton area in exchange for dismissal of the complaint. A second offense, however, will result in partiers going before a judge, said O’Hara. 'The residents who have been affected by these kids like the program,' he said. 'They like to see the kids giving back, instead of just paying a $100 fine and walking out the door. These kids have no problem writing a check.' The house is one of about 63 on the Boston Police Department’s “Party Call Hotsheet,” O’Hara said, because it regularly receives noise complaints . The Allston-Brighton area, he said, has the highest concentration of college students in the city, and landlords often pack more tenants than are legally allowed into homes to make extra rent money. Terry Bartrug, 20, along with his three other frat brothers, were released from jail on Friday morning following a court appearance. They spent three nights behind bars . The unusual circumstances surrounding the jail time brought out a chorus of complaints from students that attend the school. 'It was just a party, won’t be the first, won’t be the last,' one wrote. 'What the heck kind of crime is “keeping a disorderly house”? How did the MA lawyers on the legislature dream up a way to get this charge around the 4th amendment? Is it not my right to keep my house as I desire?' posted another. 'I mean yeah, a college party. Let’s ruin those kids lives. God forbid BU help have responsible parties instead of forcing them underground. You really shouldn’t have any fun while mortgaging your future away.'

Paramount has agreed to include a message with all trailers and posters for the film, which stars Russell Crowe, Anthony Hopkins, and Emma Watson. The gesture of goodwill came after the head of the National Religious Broadcasters appealed for the studio to make clear that the plot was a creative interpretation of the Genesis story. Plot point: Advertising for Noah, starring Russell Crowe, is to carry a disclaimer to please religious groups . Message: Paramount is adding a note to promotional material and the film website, pictured, to state the plot was inspired by the biblical story . The Darren Aronofsky film, due to be released at the end of March, stars Crowe as Noah - a man suffering from apocalyptic visions who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect his family. Under the marketing agreement, all promotional material will now include the following message: 'The film is inspired by the story of . Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film . is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a . cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. The biblical . story of Noah can be found in the book of Genesis.' The message was added after Jerry Johnson, president of The National Religious Broadcasters, contacted Paramount after a panel from his group watched clips from the film in Nashville. The panel discussed the film's interpretation to the biblical text, and raised concerns about any differences. 'We are deeply appreciative of Dr . Johnson's efforts to bring this idea to us,' Paramount Picture's vice-chairman Rob Moore told Hollywood Reporter. Star cast: Anthony Hopkins is among the A-lister actors featured in the film . Epic: Noah, starring Crowe, above, was described by director Darren Aronofsky as the first apocalyptic film . Modern message: Emma Watson plays Noah's adopted daughter in the film, which its director has said reflects environmental concerns . 'Our goal has been to take every measure we . can to ensure moviegoers have the information they need before deciding . to buy a ticket to see the film.' Johnson said he was pleased with the response from the studios, adding: 'We . are grateful that Paramount is striving, with this disclaimer, to . strike a proper balance between artistic creativity, character . development and honoring the sacred Scripture.' Aronofsky, who directed the Oscar-winning Black Swan, described the story of Noah as the first apocalypse story, and said he was keen to portray a more adult version of what had become a children's tale. Changes: A Christian group contacted Paramount to ask for a message to be added to the film's promotional material . 'The first thing I said to Russell Crowe was, ""I'll never shoot you on a houseboat with two giraffes standing behind you"",' he told Rolling Stone. 'We tried to remain truthful to the themes and the ideas that are written, but to create a dramatic story for a 21st-century audience.' When posters for the film were released, showing Crowe holding an axe, comparisons were drawn with the Mad Max movies. Aronofsk, who filmed the big-budget movie in Oyster Bay, Long Island, has said previously he was drawn to the story because of its environmental message.","Promotional material will state film was 'inspired by Book of Genesis'

Emergency responders closest to the mountain where a 21-year-old student was swept up in a deadly Utah avalanche were never dispatched to the scene, it has emerged. Ashleigh Cox, a Brigham Young University student from Colorado Springs, was snow-shoeing and tubing with friends at Tibble Fork Reservoir in American Fork County on February 8 when the group upset the snow, sparking an avalanche that carried Cox down the mountainside. The slide swept Cox into a stream where she was held underwater and covered in snow until her friends dug her out 20 minutes later. A witness drove from the mountain to get cell service to call 911. But once 911 was contacted, dispatchers failed to send the nearest team - causing a delay in reaching Cox and depriving her of precious minutes of oxygen, the Deseret News reported. Killed: Ashleigh Cox, 21, was caught in an avalanche and trapped under snow for at least 20 minutes before she was found. Records suggest that the nearest emergency crew to her was not dispatched . 'This can't happen again,' Lone Peak District Fire Chief Brad Freeman told the paper. 'This is unacceptable. We're in the business of saving lives.' The avalanche took places at 5.28pm and scooped up four of the group, although three managed to get free. A man who had been sledding nearby was asked to call 911 for help. 'It's Tibble Creek Reservoir,' he told the Utah Valley Dispatch Special Service District at 5.40pm. 'There's an avalanche. We've lost someone there.' Three deputies with the Utah County Sheriff's Office were dispatched from different locations three minutes later and dispatchers repeatedly tried to get through to the sheriff's search and rescue team. But just two minutes away from the . canyon were Lone Peak paramedics and firefighters who were ready to go - . they just didn't receive a call. Ten . minutes after the initial call, the team were paged and told to call . the dispatchers, who then said that other emergency services were on . their way. Scene: The group were walking near Tibble Fork Reservoir when they disturbed the snow on February 8 . 'Do you want us to head up that direction?' a firefighter asked the dispatcher, records show. 'That's . up to you,' the dispatcher replied. 'We're just giving you a heads-up . at this time 'cause we don't have any, you know, confirmation or . anything yet. We've got deputies en route.' Anger: Fire Chief Brad Freeman said he had to dispatch his own team - the nearest to the scene . The fire chief, Freeman, decided to send his team. He told the Deseret News: 'We were never dispatched. We had to self-dispatch on this call. 'What stands out the most is kind of how nonchalant the call (dispatcher) was and leaving it up to us. 'I'm not saying it wasn't taken seriously, but we should have been dispatched immediately. I mean, this is a critical call the way the caller called it in.' A police officer nearest to the scene reached the group at 5.58pm, where he learned that Cox had just been found face down in three feet of water. Bystanders were administering CPR. The Lone Peak ambulance arrived at 6.06pm, about 26 minutes after the 911 call was made and about 20 minutes after she was found. Cox was taken to Utah Valley Regional Medical Center but she was taken off life support the next day. Freeman said he does not know if the 10-minute delay in his team reaching the scene could have saved her life, but it would have given her more oxygen. 'I can't say she would be alive today,' he said. 'But her chances would be a lot better... This cannot happen again.' Loss: Cox was rushed to hospital nearly half an hour after the avalanche and died the following day . No hope: Staff at the Utah Valley Regional Medical Center were able to revive Cox but her life support was switched off the next day. Freeman said if they had got there earlier, she might have had a chance . Freeman said he will be investigating further, while Utah Valley Dispatch Special Service District said a review of the incident was being conducted. Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon said the avalanche that struck Cox was short and narrow, extending about 80 yards on a steep hill. 'It wasn't a big one - It was just enough to get caught up in it,' he said. The . Utah Avalanche Center issued a red-level advisory for the day of the . tragedy, and reported several natural-occurring slides throughout the . day along the Wasatch Front. Around 4 p.m., the Utah Avalanche Center reported that slide danger had become extreme. Cox spent three months of last year in Romania, where she was on exchange with BYU to work with children in an orphanage and childrenâ€™s hospital. She documented her experiences in a blog.","Ashleigh Cox died after she was caught in an avalanche in Utah on February 8 and stuck beneath snow for at least 20 minutes .

A family have told how their son's deteriorating condition in hospital turned into a heart-breaking custody battle that stripped them of their right to visit their child. Bret Bohn, 27, went to hospital in his home state of Alaska after developing a relatively minor case of nasal polyps - overgrowths in the nose - last fall. He was an athletic, healthy man who worked as a field guide for hunters. The Bohn family are fighting to visit their son Bohn, who has been declared a ward of the state in Alaska . Bret Bohn was an athletic, healthy man who worked as a field guide for hunters in Alaska before he went to hospital . But after the polyps were surgically removed, the growths came back and he was prescribed Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medication. Mr Bohn's family say it had a devastating effect on him. Soon afterwards, he started to have trouble sleeping, they said. In October, his parents, Glenn and Lorraine, took their son . to the Providence Medical Center in Anchorage for severe insomnia. Doctors there . prescribed drugs and sent him home. Mr Bohn's health then deteriorated rapidly and, after a . seizure, his family decided to take him back to the hospital, TheBlaze reported. In the hospital, Mr Bohn was unable to . sleep for some 24 days and his mental faculties were significantly . diminished. His parents said that at this point they assumed power of . attorney over him, using a written agreement allowing them to make . medical decisions for him. Mr Bohn's parents Lorraine and Glenn said they assumed power of attorney over their son, using a written agreement allowing them to make medical decisions for him . More than 35 lab tests were conducted to diagnose Mr Bohn at Providence Medical Center (pictured) in Anchorage . That agreement was initially drawn up in . 2007, when Mr Bohn was a healthy 20-year-old. More . than 35 lab tests were conducted to diagnose Mr Bohn. Meanwhile, his family said, doctors were medicating him with . dozens of drugs, rendering him in a state of 'delirium.' At one point, . they said, Mr Bohn became so frustrated that he attempted to leave the . hospital on his own, but was talked down by his parents. That's . when his family, who contend the hospital's course of treatment made . their son worse, asked for a second opinion or different course of . medical action. They say they were denied and were not permitted to . withdraw their son from the hospital. Eventually, a custody battle broke out. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of the state. Mr Bohn's mother Lorraine said: 'It's a nightmare that this even could be happening. I'm heartbroken, very heartbroken' Now, Mr Bohn is a ward of the . state and has been diagnosed with a mental-disorder, which has resulted . in doctors heavily medicating him with various drugs, his family said.

A 62-year-old Florida man's February 16 death is being blamed on a brown recluse spider bite, a fatality so rare that statistics aren't even kept for them. Ronald Reese was bitten in the neck by the spider, which are usually about the size of a U.S. quarter, all the way back in August while clearing out an old house. What followed were six agonizing months of related illnesses as the Lakeland man clung to life with an abscess eating away toward his spine until he finally let go last week. Scroll down for video... Tragic: Ronald Reese was a generous and kind man according to family but his left ended at age 62, six months after a brown recluse spider bite sent his health spiraling all because of complications from an abscess the bite caused on his neck . 'I thank the lord for it': Reese's 88-year-old father William says he was happy his son finally died after six months of painful misery . Reese managed to make it home that day in August after he was bitten, but by the following day his father told TheLedger.com that his son could barely get out of bed. Days after that, a paralyzed Reese collapsed. The Polk County Medical Examiner deemed his death the result of complications from a spider bite, but between his collapse and his eventual death, Reese suffered terribly. Reese's 88-year-old father William . Reese said his son went through numerous procedures and was in and out . of the hospital, but nothing seemed to work. 'They tried to alleviate his pain, but for six months they didn't,' Reese said. 'We would beg the nurses to give him something.' Finally after months of suffering, Reese's pain stopped. 'I was glad when he died. I said, ""Thank you, Lord, for getting him out of his misery?""' said Reese. Rare: A Florida man bitten by a brown recluse and died six agonizing months later from complications from the bite, making him an extremely rare example of a spider bite fatality . Abscess: A brown recluse bite can cause an abscess such as this. Sometimes these wounds become extremely large and can become seriously infected, as was likely the case with Reese (FILE) A brown recluse bite may start as a blister that eventually becomes an abscess after necrosis sets in. Other symptoms may include: . Brown recluse spiders are typically found in cool, dark, damp places. The midwest and southern states more commonly see large numbers of the arachnid, but they are present in parts of Florida. The United States sees no more than 1 or 2 spider bite deaths a year, if that. However, most such fatalities are caused by the brown recluse. Ronald Reese's death is startling not just for all its needless suffering but also for its astounding rarity.' The . medical examiner said Reese was never tested to determine what type of . spider bit him, but medical records show there were definite . complications from a spider bite wound on his neck. Few . statistics on deaths attributed to spider bites are available. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, only . two people died from spider bites between 2001 and 2005. Both were . believed to be caused by brown recluse spiders. The . brown recluse spider, which is not native to Florida, is one of just a . handful of spiders that are dangerous to humans, though all spiders . carry venom as a way to kill and digest their prey, said Polk State . College biology professor Logan Randolph. According to the Centers for Disease . Control and Prevention, a bite from a brown recluse spider starts with . two small puncture wounds and develops into a blister. The venom can . also cause a severe lesion by destroying skin tissue, which requires medical attention. However, the bites typically aren't lethal, Randolph said. ‘In . most spider bites, complications arise mostly if there's some secondary . factor. If the person has a specific allergic reaction, if their health . was compromised in some other manner, or if the bite causes an open . wound with a secondary infection,’ Randolph said. Spiders typically avoid humans, he said. ‘Most . spiders aren't going to attack you,’ Randolph said. ‘It's when you trap . them, or you're moving something out of a cabinet and your hand brushes . them — it's typically a defense. They react rather than attack.’ Scary: The brown recluse is not native to Florida but it's commonly found in the Sunshine State nonetheless. The yellow area indicates the potentially dangerous arachnid's normal stomping grounds. In parts of the South and Midwest, the brown recluse can be found in large groups inside homes .","Ronald Reese, 62, of Lakeland, Florida died February 16 from complications from a brown recluse spider bite .

He flirts and stuff,’ a source said. ‘When you're in a position like that you could get 10 girls per week.’ Raymondo-Felton, . who is a student at the prestigious Fordham Law School, also told . police that she and her philandering husband had four fights since the . summer, and on two occasions Felton pulled his FNH Five-Seven 28mm . handgun on her. The final altercation between the newlyweds came on Valentine's Day, which erupted over domestic problems. During . the fight, Felton’s wife claimed that the 29-year-old star athlete . brandished the gun in front of her to 'intimidate' her, the woman later . told police. Raymondo-Felton filed for divorce four days after the confrontation with her husband. The . law student's attorney advised her to turn over her husband's . unregistered handgun, which Felton had been keeping under their bed in . the couple's apartment on West 63rd Street. Rumors . of Felton’s extramarital trysts have long been swirling around the . dashing Knicks player - and they have even made it into a song. Rapper Fabolous allegedly alluded to Felton's status as an avowed ladies' man in the ‘Cuffin Season' lyrics. ‘4 . Celtics, Knicks guard, you know Felton,’ he rapped. ‘This n—- in .

In their wedding video from July 2012, Felton vowed to be true to his leading lady. ‘Beautiful . as ever, from the first day I met her,’ the Knicks player declared. ‘I’m going to take care of her. You have my word. I promise you. No . matter what it is, I’m always there for you. I love you.’ Wearing . a black sweatshirt with a peace sign and other symbols on it, Felton . was seemingly upbeat as he appeared before Judge Diana Boyar, nodding . affirmatively after he was ordered to stay away from his wife, Ariane . Raymondo-Felton. He did not enter a plea, which is common for this stage . in the case. 'Mr. Felton has no interest in having . contact' with her, one of his lawyers, James Walden, told the judge. Court records show she filed for divorce from Felton last week. Felton . was released on $25,000 bail and was ushered into a black SUV following . his arraignment. Under the terms of his bond, Felton can travel to . games, bail bondsman Ira Judelson said. Prosecutors . said they were told Felton stored the Belgian-made FN Herstal model . handgun in the home from August through February. A lawyer for Felton's . wife, a Cornell University graduate, dropped off the . weapon at a station house on Manhattan's upper West Side Monday . evening, shortly before tipoff of the Knicks game against the Dallas . Mavericks at Madison Square Garden, police said. Wife: A lawyer for Felton's wife, a student at Fordham University School of Law, dropped off the weapon at a stationhouse on Manhattan's upper West Side on Monday evening, shortly before tipoff of the Knicks game against the Dallas Mavericks at Madison Square Garden . Final straw: Raymondo-Felton filed for divorce just days after a Valentine's Day fight with her husband, during which the man allegedly waved his handgun in her face . The gun had 18 rounds of live ammunition in its magazine, which can hold about 20 rounds, prosecutors said. He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and criminal possession of a firearm. The firearm charge is punishable by up to four years in prison. The weapons charge is punishable by up to seven years in prison. The section under which he was charged concerns having a large-capacity ammunition magazine. Police had arrested Felton on charges that included a mid-level weapons-possession charge that can entail having a loaded gun outside one's home or business or having a loaded gun with the intention to use it against someone. The DA's office didn't comment on why prosecutors chose the charges they did; it's not uncommon for charges to change between arrest and arraignment. Investigators reached Felton by . contacting the director of security at Madison Square Garden after his . wife made a statement to detectives Monday night, police said. Felton . turned himself in at 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, not long after the Knicks' buzzer-beater loss to Dallas, police said. The former University of North Carolina star made no statement after he arrived at the precinct with a lawyer, police said. A . Knicks spokesman has said the team had no immediate comment.

Free to play: Felton was ushered into a black SUV following his arraignment. Under the terms of his bond, Felton can travel to games . Felton had eight points and seven assists Monday in the Knicks' 110-108 loss to Dallas. The Knicks brought the point guard back for a second stint in New York in July 2012, opting to let Jeremy Lin leave, and Felton helped the Knicks win the Atlantic Division last year. But he has had a disappointing season, averaging 10.4 points and shooting 40 percent while missing 16 games with a series of injuries. He has been frequently criticized by fans as the Knicks have fallen to 21-36. Felton had allegedly stored an FN Herstal similar to this in his Upper West Side apartment since April . NBA spokesman Tim Frank said the league was monitoring the case. It could fine or suspend Felton, but usually waits until after the legal case has been resolved. The league did break from that policy . to suspend Gilbert Arenas for the remainder of the season after he . brought guns to the Washington Wizards' locker room during the 2009-10 . season. He was eventually sentenced to 30 days in a halfway house. Felton . is not the first pro athlete to run afoul of New York's strict gun . laws. Plaxico Burress was a New York Giants wide receiver when he was . arrested in 2008 after accidentally shooting himself in a Manhattan . nightclub. He served two years in prison. Fighter . Robert Guerrero was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport last year after . he presented a locked gun box containing an unloaded handgun during . check-in.

Both pleaded guilty to attempted gun possession charges; . Lil Wayne spent about eight months in a city jail; Ja Rule served most . of a two-year prison sentence. Felton . is set to earn $3.8million next season and has a player option that . would pay him $4million in 2015-16.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:06 EST, 27 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 28 February 2014 . A California court has ruled that drivers can legally read maps on their cell phones while behind the wheel without being penalized for driving while on their mobile devices. The 5th District Court of Appeal reversed the case of a Fresno man who was ticketed in January 2012 for looking at a map on his iPhone 4 while stuck in traffic. The driver, Steven Spriggs, challenged the $165 fine because he did not feel it was right that he had to pay after using his phone while his car was not moving due to roadwork. Approved: A California court ruled that even though the state requires hands free devices to be used while driving, drivers should not be ticketed for using their phone for directions . He had grabbed his cellphone to find an alternate route when a California Highway Patrol officer on a motorcycle spotted him and wrote the ticket. Mr Spriggs first challenged the case in traffic court, where he lost, and then appealed it himself to a three-judge panel in Fresno County Superior Court, where he lost a second time. Mr Spriggs knows the dangers of texting while driving as his son suffered a broken leg from a driver who was chatting on a cellphone. As a result, he always uses a hands-free device to talk and drive. Determined that the hands free law didn't apply to him in this case, Mr Spriggs took it to the appellate court. In their 18-page ruling, the appellate judges said California's law that prohibits people from talking on their cellphones without a hands-free device could have been written more clearly, but it doesn't apply to looking at maps on cellphones. The law the CHP officer used to ticket Mr Spriggs applies specifically to people 'listening and talking' on cellphones, not using their mobile phone in other ways, the court said. Archaic: Car GPS systems have become common but many drivers still use their phones for directions, which the court ruled was fine because the driver in question was not moving at the time . Texting while driving remains illegal under another California law passed after the one at issue in Mr Spriggs' case. Attorney Scott Reddie, who represented Spriggs, said it's now up to the state attorney general's office to decide if it will challenge Thursday's ruling to the California Supreme Court, which is choosy about which cases it hears. Nicholas Pacilio, a spokesman for Attorney General Kamala Harris, said the office is reviewing the ruling. Neither Reddie nor Mr Pacilio were familiar with other states that prohibit drivers from looking at cellphone map applications. Mr Spriggs, who is entitled to recoup his $165 fine, said the Superior Court judges who had upheld his violation were guilty of overreaching by applying the spotty law to him. He hopes that California legislators will now revisit the issue and fix it. 'They're going to have to do something,' Mr Spriggs said. 'I just hope they take a look at the big picture.'","A Fresno court ruled that a driver who was ticketed for using his phone's map function while stopped due to roadwork should be reimbursed .

Prosecutors said Thursday they have changed their minds about reducing charges against an undercover police detective accused of taking part in a motorcyclists-versus-SUV driver melee that was caught on video. The Manhattan district attorney's office had said in December that the SUV driver's facial injuries were healing and might not warrant the first-degree assault and gang assault charges against Detective Wojciech Braszczok and nine other bikers. The charges require permanent disfigurement. 'Unfortunately, it appears the victim's injuries have not healed as well as we initially believed they would,' so the charges stand for now, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said Thursday. Scroll down for video . Alexian Lien was horrifically beaten in front of his terrified wife and daughter after he was mobbed by a members of a biker gang last September . Wojciech Braszczok (center) conceals his face as he walks into court in November. Braszczok, an undercover NYPD detective, is charged with assault and gang assault - both in the first-degree . Defense lawyer John Arlia told a judge the developments meant ""the game will change"" in the case, which grabbed headlines last fall as a highway horror. Arlia and fellow Braszczok lawyer Bruce Wenger declined to comment after court. Braszczok - who walked through the courthouse hallway with a hood up and a scarf covering most of his face to shield himself from photographers - has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers have said that he never came close to the SUV driver and that the video footage will exonerate him. The other nine motorcyclists have court dates Friday. The DA's office declined to comment on whether their charges would also remain the same, but they are based on the same injuries. A spokesman for the SUV driver, Alexian Lien, had no immediate comment Thursday. Lien hasn't been charged, and he has filed a legal notice saying he plans to sue the city over Braszczok's role in the September 29 confrontation. The tension began when an SUV carrying a family on a Sunday drive crossed paths with a motorcycle rally - with at least one rider capturing events on a helmet-mounted camera and later posting video online. Disfigured: Authorities say Alexian Lien (seen here in October) will bear permanent injuries from the beating he sustained . Police say a motorcycle slowed in front of the Range Rover, which then bumped the bike. Motorcyclists dismounted and converged on the SUV. Lien has said he feared for himself, his wife and their toddler. He hit the gas to get away, running over and seriously injuring motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr., of Lawrence, Massachusetts. The other bikers chased after Lien, dragged him from his car on a side street and beat him, some bashing him with their motorcycle helmets, authorities said. He needed stitches to his face. The off-duty Braszczok wasn't accused of hitting Lien. But prosecutors have said he shattered the SUV's back window and did nothing to end the assault or get help. The 10-year police veteran told authorities and his union that he didn't intervene partly because he works undercover. Crushed by the SUV, Mieses suffered broken legs and severe spine injuries. He has gone home from a hospital but still needs a wheelchair, and he most likely never will walk again, his lawyer, Gloria Allred, said this week.","Alexian Lien was horrifically beaten in front of his wife and daughter after getting into an altercation with a biker gang in September .

Former NFL safety Darren Sharper turned himself into Los Angeles Police Thursday night after two  aggravated rape charges were brought against him in New Orleans. Sharper, who played with the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints, stands accused of raping a total of eight women, and drugging a total of 11 people including one man. The latest charges were brought against Sharper, 38, and accomplice Erik Nunez, 26, New Orleans police after two women recently came forward saying they were sexually assaulted September 23, WVUE reported. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wanted: Former NFL safety Darren Sharper, leaves a courthouse last week after his arraignment on rape charges was postponed - he now faces two more charges of aggravated rape in New Orleans . The former Super Bowl champ turned himself in after New Orleans Police issued a warrant for his arrest earlier in the day. It is not known if Nunez has followed suit. CNN first reported that Sharper turned himself in. Authorities told WVUE the warrants were issued after an investigation showed the women were each raped by both men that night in a New Orleans apartment. 'New information uncovered also indicates that Nunez also allegedly raped both women that night at the same location,' said spokesperson Remi Braden. The decision to charge both men with aggravated rape brings with it a life sentence if convicted, according to a legal analyst who spoke to the station. 'They've now got enough information that they deemed they should issue an arrest warrant for him, and it's for aggravated rape which is as big as it can get.' Sharper has already pleaded not guilty to charges that he drugged and raped two women he met at a West Hollywood night club . He also faces possible charges in Florida, Nevada and Arizona, according to reports. Facing jail time: Former NFL safety Darren Sharper appeared in Los Angeles court Thursday to face charges of drugging a raping two women at a night club . Their case: Sharper plead not guilty to the charges Thursday and his lawyers say they can prove the sexual encounters were consensual . Lawyers for Sharper, who played in the . NFL from 1997 to 2010 primarily with the Green Bay Packers, said they . would prove that any sexual contact Sharper engaged in was welcomed. 'All . of these were consensual contact between Mr. Sharper and women who . wanted to be in his company,' said attorney Leonard Levine. But a prosecutor pointed out the fact that Sharper is also under investigation for similar crimes in Florida, Arizona, Louisiana and Nevada and asked a judge for $10million bail. The judge rejected that as excessive, though increased it from $200,000 to $1million. 'The court considers these crimes quite serious and has to protect the public,' Superior Court Judge Renee Korn said. Sharper, wearing a gray suit and black t-shirt, went to court last week with his lawyers and a bail bondsman who immediately arranged to post his bail. The judge originally ordered Sharper to remain in Los Angeles, stay away from nightclubs and not be alone with any woman he did not know before October, when the first allegations emerged. It is not clear how soon he will be extradited to New Orleans. Glory days: Sharper spent most of his careers playing for the Green Bay Packers but was on the Saints team when they won the Super Bowl in the 2009 season . The judge set a court date for April 15 to schedule a preliminary hearing. Korn rejected a bid by defense attorney Blair Berk to shut down the release of information in the case. 'We're asking to litigate this in a court of law, not by Twitter feed and entertainment shows,' said Berk. The latest allegations surfaced in a Miami Beach police report released Thursday. It was filed January 19 - more than a year after the alleged attack. No charges have been filed but Detective Vivian Hernandez said the investigation remains open. Mr Sharper met his latest accuser in 2012 at Club Mokai, according to a Miami Beach Police department affidavit. The former gridiron great, a friend, the alleged victim and two of her friends eventually went back to Sharper's apartment nearby. Video Source YouTube . The victim claims she was intoxicated . to the point she does not remember what she said to Mr Sharper once they . were alone in his bedroom, but her friends say she pleaded with him to . stop. 'No, no, stop, I don't want to,' a friend told police she said. Suspended: The NFL Network has removed Sharper from his role as analyst while police investigate the claims . Her friends tried to take her home, but the woman was too drunk to even leave the apartment, they told cops. The . woman awoke about five hours later, with her pants off and Mr Sharper . raping her without using any protection, she told police. 'What's going on,' the startled woman says she asked him. He made her get dressed and kicked her out of his apartment while trying to keep her cell phone. She eventually retrieved it. Disturbing . details from other police reports also made public paint the picture of . a possible serial rapist with a similar series of events in all . incidents. The former all-pro would meet women in a nightclub and invite them back to a hotel room or his apartment to party, said police. He would then offer them shots spiked with drugs and sexually assault his victims after they passed out, officials said. Multiple complaints said Sharper used morphine and zolpidem, which is sold under the brand name Ambien, to sedate his prey. The women then woke up and came to the realization they had been sexually assaulted, according to court documents. The . previously dismissed 2011 investigation in Miami Beach saw two women . complain of being drugged and waking up to Sharper trying to remove . their clothes and waggling his genitalia in their faces, according to . WPLG. Claims: Sharper was arrested on Friday over two allegations of sexual assault in Los Angeles . A separate assault . reportedly happened Sept 23 in New Orleans. The victim in that case was . also given a drink that caused her to pass out, she woke naked with . Sharper sexually assaulting her, according to a criminal complaint made . public by the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Police later found the former Saints player's DNA inside the woman, according to the complaint. The . accused rapist then attended a charity event for women the next day. Sharper also publicly promoted a women's breast cancer charity and . contributed to a book titled 'NFL Dads Dedicated to Daughters,' according to WWL. 'Money . cannot buy the women we love everyday security, which men take for . granted,' Sharper wrote in the book, according to USA Today. 'So, it's . going to take strong, accountable men to educate young boys and . influence other men to deal with women respectfully, honorably and . fairly at all times.' Las Vegas and Tempe police have since detailed similarly disturbing incidents. Sharper is even accused of drugging a man at one point, according to the Los Angeles Times. The . former Green Bay Packers star was arrested on January 17 and released . on $200,000 bail. He will be arraigned Thursday on the Los Angeles . charges. If convicted in the California case, he could face more than 30 years in state prison. Sharper . was selected All-Pro six times and chosen for the Pro Bowl five times.

Simpler and more easily recognisable names make people come across as more familiar and less risky to know, according to a new study. Simpler and more easily recognisable names make people come across as less risky to know, according to a new study. People meeting strangers for the first time (illustrated) are more likely to trust claims made by people with easily pronounceable names . Adults with attractive faces are more likely to win the trust of children, psychologists have said. Scientists tested 32 four and five-year-olds who were shown 12 photos of women aged between 18 and 29. Both boys and girls tended to believe answers assigned to pictures of pretty women, according to the study that was published in October last year. Lead researcher Dr Igor Bascandziev, from Harvard University in the US, said: 'When learning about the world, children rely heavily on information provided to them by other people. 'Previous studies have shown children can be influenced by a range of factors such as whether the adult was correct in the past or if they are familiar to them. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, found that people who speak English trust strangers with easier-to-pronounce names more than those with names that are more difficult to say– even when those strangers are from the same country. People are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight-forward names, they said. The scientists created fictitious pairs of names from different parts of the world, including the Middle East, Asia and Europe, making sure that one name was easy to pronounce and the other more difficult. They then examined people’s responses to the name pairs. In one experiment, participants imagined they were tourists looking for a reliable tour guide, while in another test, they were asked to decide how dangerous each person on a list of strangers was, based on nothing but their name. ‘In each experiment, strangers with easy-to-pronounce names were judged as being more familiar, more trustworthy and safer,’ said Eryn Newman, a postdoctoral fellow in the university’s Department of Criminology, Law and Society.

People trust strangers with simple names as they come across as being more familiar and less risky to know. People are more likely to trust claims made by strangers with straight-forward names. ‘But what was most surprising is that the pronunciation of names had effects that extended beyond the name. 'People actually thought claims attributed to easy-to-pronounce names were more likely to be true,’ she said. According to the study that was published in the journal Plos One, the assertion that ‘macadamia nuts are in the same evolutionary family as peaches’ was more believable when attributed to ‘Andrian Babeshko’ than when it was credited to his countryman ‘Czeslaw Ratynska.’ Dr Newman explained that the phenomenon isn’t confined to people’s names. ‘When we encounter new information, how easy or difficult it is to process plays an important role in all sorts of situations. For example, research shows people think that food additives with easier names are safer than those with difficult names.’ She thinks that the feeling of familiarity in the brain signals something we can trust, but information that is hard to process, signals danger.

An Illinois man kept at a secure psychiatric hospital since 1993 after he decapitated his co-worker and put the victim's head on display, has asked to be allowed out for day trips. Michael Bethke was 28 when he beheaded Joseph Lesinski Jr at the White Hen Pantry in June 1991, and reportedly scrawled the word 'repent' in blood on the head. He claimed to be suffering from hallucinations that commanded him to kill, but hospital staff say Bethke has made significant progress and should be allowed out on supervised visits. Held: Michael Bethke has been kept at the secure Elgin Mental Health Center after decapitating a coworker . A court had denied previous attempts to allow Bethke, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity, to leave the grounds of the secure hospital. On June 6, 1991, Michael Bethke used a butcher's knife to decapitate his coworker Joseph Lesinski at the White Hen Pantry in Burnham, Illinois. Bethke, who was 28 at the time, struck as his victim bent over to pick up a carton of cigarettes, and is said to have lopped off the head in one move. He wrote the word 'repent' in blood on his victim's head and left it, as if on display, in the glass counter of the deli. After wandering in nearby woodland for a few hours, Bethke approached a group of people and told them to call police. He claimed he was suffering from 'command hallucinations' that ordered him to kill. In 1993 he was found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to be held at the secure Elgin Mental Health Center. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Staff at the Elgin Mental Health Center want the killer to be allowed to go on supervised visits to places like the mall. The . trial court in 2012 said it wasn't convinced Bethke 'will not be a risk . to himself and others if allowed into the general public', according to the Southtown Star. Bethke . has appealed the decision, with a ruling filed Thursday that says the . court must elaborate on why it believes he is a risk. In court documents filed in 2012, Bethke is said to have made 'substantial progress' in the 20 years spent at the facility. 'He accepted his mental illness and recognized his need to stay medicated,' it stated. It added that he still experienced paranoia and voices telling him he was evil, especially if he was exposed to news of mass disasters. After the 2005 tsunami in Asia he . reportedly was aggressive to another patient, and now uses 'limited . media exposure' to control his reactions to such events. When . it denied his 2012 request to leave the hospital, the trial court said . it was concerned that the patient could have relapses, even while . medicated, if exposed to a traumatic event. It . added: 'There was no indication that trained staff would be present to . effectively handle the relapse given defendant's large size and apparent . strength.' At his sentence hearing in 1993 Bethke was ordered to spend up to 49 years at a state mental facility, after being diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder. The case will be sent to the lower court but it is believed to be unlikely that a trial court will allow the supervised visits.","Michael Bethke makes second request to be allowed on supervised trips .

U.S Marines were up in arms when a 2011 decree banned them from rolling the sleeves of their desert uniforms up – but now they’re getting ready to roll again, because army chiefs have done an about-face on the policy. Marines have long regarded the rolled-sleeve look as a point of pride as it marked them out from other divisions in the armed forces. It also allowed them to show off their muscles.

At the time of writing it had received 33,350 likes and hundreds of comments. Some of them revealed the dedication that Marines apply to the rolled-sleeve look. David Cowdrey Jr wrote: ‘If you didn't spend 20 minutes rolling your sleeves, you did it wrong.’ Justin Carrow replied: ‘20 minutes PER SLEEVE.’ Order: Marines will have to keep their sleeves down in combat situations to prevent sunburn and insect bites . Then John Edmiston issued instructions on how to produce the perfect look: ‘One roll, starch, iron, repeat.’ In fact, according to Wsj.com, there used to be official instructions issued to recruits on how to roll sleeves. It said: ‘When authorized, utility sleeves will be rolled with the inside out, forming a roll about three inches wide, and terminating at a point about two inches above the elbow.’ Marines will be required to keep their sleeves down in combat to prevent sunburn and insect bites.","U.S Marines were banned from rolling their sleeves up in 2011 .

A teenage mother who dumped her newborn baby in a dumpster moments after giving birth has been given hope of regaining custody of her son. The 16-year-old, who has not been named, was told during an emergency court hearing that she has a year to prove she is capable of looking after the child. If she satisfies welfare officers at the end of the process, she may be permanently reunited with the baby. Resilient: Child protective services was granted temporary custody Wednesday of a newborn found alive in a Houston dumpster Tuesday morning. The mother has been identified as a 16-year-old who says she didn't know she was pregnant . In the meantime, a judge has granted the . student at South Houston High School, Texas, access to the baby . discovered in a sack of rubbish on Tuesday. The mother insisted she thought the . child was dead when she threw him into the dumpster, a Child Protective . Services caseworker said in Houston during a court hearing on Wednesday. The . caseworker testified in an emergency custody hearing that the girl . didn't even know she was pregnant when she went into labor and gave . birth in her apartment bathtub. After giving birth, the teen cut the boy's umbilical cord herself but thought her son was dead so placed him in the dumpster. Texan law states that the girl and her family still have rights to the child if they wish to pursue custody. Namesake: The baby boy was found by maintenance worker Carlos Michel (pictured). The mother decided to name the child after him . In safe hands: The next court hearing for the 16-year-old Houston girl who left her newborn baby in a dumpster earlier this week is scheduled for March 7 . 'She's . the biological mother and until rights are terminated (through the . judicial process) until then she's got rights to the baby, Child . Protective Services spokesperson Estelle Olguin told KHOU.com. Harris County Juvenile Court Associate Judge Angela Ellis has given permission for the mother to visit her son who has been placed in foster care. Who gets final custody of the child will now be decided through protracted legal proceedings, during which the mother will undergo psychological assessments to see if she is fit to look after he son. The next court hearing is scheduled for March 7. The court has a year to decide if the baby goes up for adoption or is returned to the girl and her extended family. Shocking discovery: A maintenance worker found the tiny newborn baby in a sack of rubbish in a dumpster, pictured, after hearing what he thought was a cat meow . Safe and sound: The baby named Carlos, pictured, is now being looked after by foster carers while a court sorts out if the biological mother is granted custody . The teen's mother lives in Alvin, but she had been staying with her aunt while attending South Houston High School. She said she has not spoken to her son's 22-year-old father in about six months. A judge awarded CPS temporary custody of the child, but said she would allow the mother to visit the newborn if the attorney assigned to represent the baby agrees. The caseworker asked the mom if she wanted to name her son, and she chose Carlos after the man who found the baby and saved his life. The boy was found on Tuesday morning at the Reserve Apartments by maintenance worker Carlos Michel, who heard what sounded like cat mewing coming from the dumpster. Sad discovery: The baby was found stuffed in a trash bag among food containers, scraps and school homework . He investigated further and found the baby boy alive, stuffed in a white trash bag along with food containers, scraps and school homework. Michel and another man took the baby to a nearby car to keep it warm while they waited for police and paramedics to arrive. The boy was found purple and struggling to breath. But he is now in a good condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital. The mother was also taken to the hospital for examination after being identified. Once released she will be questioned by police, who will then decide whether to bring up charges. Strange noises: Maintenance worker Carlos Michel discovered the baby after hearing what sounded like a cat mewing coming from the dumpster . Both were still in the hospital as of Wednesday night, according to the Houston Chronicle. Adding to the tragedy is the fact that Texas has a special law to help new mothers who can't take care of their children. The Baby Moses law states that a babies up to 60-days-old can be dropped off without fear of prosecution at any hospital, fire station or ambulance station - as long as the baby is handed off to a person. CPS is currently trying to figure out if there are any other family members who can look after the boy when he gets out of the hospital, or if he'll need to be placed in the foster care system.","Mother told she has a year to prove she is capable of looking after the baby .

The father of a boy killed in the Chardon High School shooting in Ohio died on Thursday morning at his home on the second anniversary of the rampage. A family member found 48-year-old Russell King Sr. dead inside his home, said Lt. John Hiscox of the Geauga County Sheriff's Department. The cause of death had not been determined, and a coroner was investigating. Hiscox said there were no signs of foul play. Russell King Sr., 48, was found dead at his home on the second anniversary of the Chardon High School shooting in Ohio in which his son Russell Jr., 17, was killed . At his sentencing last March, Lane wore a T-shirt with 'killer' scrawled across it and cursed and gestured obscenely at relatives of victims in the courtroom . ‘Whatever transpired, there's no question Russell King is another victim of this tragic shooting two years ago today,’ said Craig Bashein, an attorney who represents the family in a wrongful death lawsuit. King's 17-year-old son, Russell King Jr., was one of three students killed in the shooting at Chardon High School east of Cleveland. T.J. Lane opened fire in the school's cafeteria with a .22-Ruger before classes began. He also killed Daniel Parmertor, 16, and Demetrius Hewlin, 16. Russell was 17. Three other students were wounded, including Nick Walczak, Nate Mueller and Joy Rickers. Tears of grief: Crystal King, sister of slain student Russell King Jr, addressed the court at Lane's sentencing in 20 . 'What happened took an enormous toll on all the families,' said Geauga County Prosecutor James Flaiz, who worked with the youths' families for several months during Lane's criminal case. 'It hit Mr. King as hard or harder than the others. He was extremely close to his son. Seeing the emotional pain on him concerned me.' Attorneys for families of the victims, including King Sr., and some of those who were wounded filed a personal injury lawsuit on Thursday against the Chardon school district, some of its administrators and the alternative school that the shooter attended. Online court records on the lawsuit listed 25 defendants, but did not indicate any monetary damages the families were seeking or specify their legal claims against the schools. ‘Because this is now a legal matter, it would be inappropriate for the district to comment,’ Chardon Superintendent Michael Hanlon Jr. said in a statement. Rude: Lane had flipped the middle finger and used profane language toward those in the packed courtroom, including the victims' families . ‘Our focus today has been on supporting our students, staff and the community on this important day.’ Prosecutors say T.J. Lane, who was waiting for a bus to the alternative school, took a .22-caliber pistol and a knife to the high school and fired 10 shots at a group of students inside the cafeteria on Feb. 27, 2012. Lane, who was 17 at the time of the shooting, pleaded guilty and is serving three life sentences. At his sentencing last March, he wore a T-shirt with ‘killer’ scrawled across it and cursed and gestured obscenely at relatives of victims in the courtroom. Investigators said he admitted to the shooting but said he didn't know why he did it. Grieving community: The February 2012 shooting rampage at Chardon High School left three boys dead . Russell King Sr. went to all of the court hearings involving Lane. A year ago, families of the three slain students filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the teenage gunman and his family. The suit alleged negligent supervision by Lane's parents and grandparents. Attorneys said the families hope the lawsuit, which is still pending, will resolve unanswered questions and ensure that Lane doesn't profit from his crimes.","Russell King Sr., 48, was found dead at his home on the second anniversary of the Chardon High School shooting in Ohio .

Researchers conducting a scan on the brain of a deceased soccer player have detected signs of a brain trauma disease believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head. The test results mark the first time that Chronic Traumatic Encephalopahty (CTE) has been linked to the game of soccer, which until now has been considered safer than contacts sports like football or hockey. Patrick Grange, of New Mexico, died at age 29 from complications associated with his ALS, better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Breakthrough: Photos of Patrick Grange, a soccer player who died of Lou Gehrig's disease - and who was posthumously diagnosed with  chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease linked to repeated blows to the head . Lifelong player: Patrick's parents said he had started heading balls at age 3 and had sustained several concussions over the years, beginning when he was a toddler . Grange played soccer in college and later at the Premier Development League in Chicago, the New York Times reported. Experts from Boston University and the VA Boston Healthcare System said that on a scale of 1 to 4, his CTE was at stage 2 at the time of his death. According to information from Boston University's CTE Center, the condition is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma, including concussions and blows to the head not accompanied by obvious symptoms. CTE has been known to affect boxers . since the 1920s, but in recent years, a protein associated with the . illness has been showing up in posthumous brain scans of athletes from a . wide range of disciplines. CTE in pictures: Brain tissue from an unaffected person (left), a football player (center), and a champion boxer with dementia. The brown areas are tau protein deposits, which are linked to head trauma and concussions . Risky practice: While soccer players do not usually tackle one another, it is standard practice in the sport to head the ball - something that Grange enjoyed doing . Patients suffering from CTE tend to be impulsive, forgetful, experience bouts of depression and can have suicidal thoughts. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia. Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later. According to experts, while soccer players do not usually tackle one another, it is standard practice in the sport to head the ball - something that Grange enjoyed doing. It is especially common during practice for players to bounce the ball on their heads over and over again. Mike and Michele Grange told the paper that their son had started heading the ball at age 3. In the course of his short life, the athlete, who aspired to play in the MLS, took some hard knocks to the head resulting in concussions beginning from the time he was a toddler. 'He had very extensive frontal lobe damage,' Dr. Ann McKee, the neuropathologist who performed the brain scan on Grange. 'We have seen other athletes in their 20s with this level of pathology, but they’ve usually been football players.' According to a published study that surveyed amateur soccer players in their 30s, the more they headed the ball over the course of a year, the more likely they were to show signs of brain damage and inflammations in MRI tests. The study by researchers at Yeshiva University’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine revealed that players who struck the ball with their head between 885 times and 1,550 times a year had ‘brain abnormalities,’ and players with more than 1,800 headers had lower memory scores compared to those who headed the ball less often. Researchers have suggested that repeated hits to the head may have caused Grange to develop CTE and resulted in an ALS diagnosis at age 27 - even though most people who suffer from the illness are between 40-70 years old. Famous patient: Cincinnati Reds baseball star Ryan Freel (left and right) became the first baseball player diagnosed with CTE. The 36-year-old killed himself after years of suffering from mental problems . Six months after learning his fate, the once-robust, strapping athlete was wheelchair-bound and inching ever closer to paralysis. He died less than a year later. The news comes just two months after Cincinnati Reds baseball star Ryan Freel, who killed himself at age 36 after years of mental instability, was posthumously diagnosed with CTE. Freel, who was famously taken off the field by ambulance in May 2007 after colliding with an opponent's elbow, became the first baseball player diagnosed with CTE.","Brain scan showed Patrick Grange, 29, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy .

His trial date has now been set for October of this year, but this could still suffer further delays . The Aurora theatre shooting suspect, also known as the 'Dark Knight gunman', James Holmes, has finally had a trial date set, for October 14, which will be more than two years after the attack. Holmes has been charged with multiple accounts of first degree murder and attempted murder after the attack in July 2012 that killed 12 and injured 70 at a movie theatre in a suburb in Denver, Colorado, and he has pleaded not guilty to the attack by way of insanity. Judge Carlos A. Samour set the date for later this year, but also said that it's possible that the trial date may suffer further delay, as the prosecution and defence attorneys argue over Holmes' sanity evaluations. Judge Samour told lawyers at a court hearing that, among other factors, a mental health expert may ask for more time to examine Holmes. 'As much as I know people are eager to have this trial take place...I also want to make sure we're doing things right,' he said. 'We're all going to have to be flexible.' Prosecutor Rich Orman said victims in the case want the trial to happen sooner. He said: 'They prefer that the . trial had started long ago.' The Judge said: 'I understand those wishes, but . there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not going to allow things to be . rushed.' Holmes has previously had a psychological evaluation to determine the legitimacy of the sanity plea, but the results have been kept confidential, and a second evaluation has been requested by the prosecution. In addition, defense lawyers have conceded Holmes was the . lone gunman in the shooting, but say he was in . the midst of a psychotic episode during the rampage.

Annette Bongiorno leaves federal court in New York on Monday after testifying she had no idea what most of the crimes attributed to Madoff were . Bernie Madoff's former secretary, one of the five Madoff workers on trial for abetting his fraud, says she did not understand any financial terms despite spending 40 years working for him at his office. Annette Bongiorno, 65, on trial in federal court in Manhattan, said she did not understand terms like Ponzi scheme, treasury bond, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index or events like the collapse of Lehman Brothers, despite being a key employee at the investment firm. Bongiorno is one of five former Madoff workers on trial in the case of the fraud attempt, which fell apart in December 2008, costing investors an estimated $17 billion in losses. When questioned about her alleged role in concealing Madoff's multibillion-dollar fraud, Bongiorno did not deny that she entered thousands of backdated trades in customers' accounts, sometimes years after they had purportedly occurred. But she said, again and again, that she was simply following Madoff's orders, knew next to nothing about Wall Street and had ‘no clue’ that anything she had done was illegal. She said: ‘All the trades were backdated... I did what I was told.' Also on trial are former director of . operations Daniel Bonventre, portfolio manager Joann Crupi and computer . programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. 'I loved Bernie': Bongiorno is one of five former Madoff employees on trial for allegedly playing a part in his vast Ponzi scheme. While testifying on her own behalf Monday the 65-year-old took the opportunity to heap praise on her former boss and said she once even called him her hero . Bonventre . and Bongiorno have taken the witness stand in their own defense, . hoping  that the jury will accept claims that they were duped by Madoff . into believing the business was legitimate. Ringleader: According to Bongiorno, Madoff was the mastermind behind the Ponzi scheme, and she claims that despite being his assistant, she had no idea what most of the financial terms were and was simply 'following orders' All . five defendants have said they were unaware that Madoff, who pleaded . guilty and is serving a 150-year prison sentence, was running a Ponzi . scheme. During her . testimony, Bongiorno said she believed Madoff was trading stock in bulk . and then deciding later how to divvy up the transactions among his . customers, something she thought was legal. Assistant . U.S. Attorney John Zach showed Bongiorno documents on which she had . plotted out backdated trades to enter into customer accounts, though no . trading actually happened. Zach asked: ‘You were the one who wrote all these trades in? ‘And your testimony is that for every single one of these trades, Mr. Madoff told you what to do?’ Bongiorno answered yes to both questions. Bongiorno said that when Madoff was arrested, she had to ask another employee what a Ponzi scheme was. In . addition, when she came under questioning from Zach about finances and . trading, she said she couldn't explain the difference between a stock . and a bond. Zach showed .

Fellow defendant: Daniel Bonventre was Madoff's former back-office director and is on trial alongside Bongiorno, charged with profiting from the massive $65 billion Ponzi scheme. All five have pleaded not guilty . Zach asked: ‘Do you remember what happened to Lehman Brothers in September 2008?’ ‘No, but I guess you're going to tell me,’ she said. Zach . then showed Bongiorno several front-page newspaper articles from that . month about the financial crisis and questioned her about the timing of . the backdated trades. ‘That didn't raise a red flag for you?’ he asked. ‘If I was told to do it, I did it,’ she said.

The trial, which began more than four months ago, will resume on Monday and is expected to end in March. PONZI SCHEME . Named after Charles Ponzi, who adapted a technique in 1920 from the Charles Dickens novel 'Martin Chuzzlewit', the scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing or new funds that have been paid by investors, rather than profit earned from the running of the organisation. Returns are short term and abnormally high, and require a consistent flow of funds from new investors to sustain the scheme. Money travels up, making the person at the top richer, while the people at the bottom simply get their investment back. TREASURY BOND . In interest bearing bond issued by the U.S. treasury, which repays periodic interest payments as well as repaying the value of the bond originally paid, in U.S. currency. STANDARD & POOR 500 . The S&P 500 is a stock market index based on the market capitalisations of 500 large companies having common stock on the New York Stock Exchange. The parts of the S&P 500 are determined by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It is one of the most commonly followed equity lists. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STOCK AND A BOND . Stocks are shares of a company, or a type of security that gives ownership in a corporation, and of a part of its profits. They are also known as 'equity'. A bond is a debt investment where the investor loans money to a company or government, that borrows the funds for a defined period of time at a specified interest rate.","Annette Bongiorno, 65, worked for Bernie Madoff for 40 years .

She also regularly shares photos of the couple arm-in-arm with her 33,000 Instagram followers as well as more racy bikini pictures with her. And Bortles said . he felt the coaches may have identified his girlfriend's . rapidly-growing fame as a potential weakness so made the comments 'to . see how I reacted to it'. Bortles . went on: '[The teams] knew [about my girlfriend] going into the . meeting. I think that was kinda the angle, how I would react to it.' Duke's popularity places her in league with Katherine Webb, the former Miss Alabama and girlfriend of 2013 draft favorite A.J.

'Apparently, . she is more of a household name than I am,' Bortles told ESPN. 'Sheâ€™s . more famous than me and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about that.' He's had time to get used to her appeal. They've been a couple since high school, where they attended prom . together, and then attended the same university.

The promising Alabama quarterback's spotlight quickly swung to Webb, who has since appeared in television commercials, a reality televsion series, and on the computer screens of a huge chunk of the American male populace. While Webb's rise to fame came quickly and almost out of nowhere, she and Duke both have another football beauty forebearer to thank for their success. In 2012, the breakout female star of the NFL draft was Lauren Tannehill. Featured on ESPN's draft coverage that year, the aspiring model and wife of the Miami Dolphin's pick Ryan Tannehill was a major hit, setting social networking sites abuzz with complimentary tweets.

Two women have been caught on camera viciously attacking a blind, elderly Australian Aboriginal man while he was sitting down in the disabled seat of a bus. The video, which was filmed on a mobile phone by a 13-year-old girl travelling on the bus on Australia's Gold Coast, shows the two women punching, kicking and spitting on the 77-year-old vision-impaired man. Shocked commuters watched in horror as the women physically and verbally abuse the indigenous man, who is seen in the footage cowering against a window. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Disturbing: Video footage shows these two women punching, kicking and spitting on a blind, elderly Aboriginal man while he is sitting on a public bus . No match: The male victim, who is pictured here trying to fight back against the physical and verbal attack, sustained bruising to his arms and his glasses were broken . The women, who appear to be dressed up for a day at the races or a wedding, are heard in the video saying ‘Oh bro, we’re in Abo land here, hold on’ before they begin to punch and kick him while he is sitting down, breaking the terrified man's glasses. The teenage girl filming the disturbing encounter pleads with the women, one of whom has a large tattoo on her right thigh, to ‘leave the poor man alone’. A male passenger then intervenes after the girls spit in the elderly man’s face, forcing them off the bus and throwing their handbags out after them. It is understood the foul-mouthed women started attacking the man when he told them to ‘go back to where you came from’. Gold Coast District Acting Superintendent Brian Swan said the victim, who sustained bruising to his arm, had made a statement to police and wanted to press charges. Supt Swan said police suspected the perpetrators were aged 17 and 21 but were yet to locate and interview them. 'We did receive a lot of calls from the public,' he told reporters. 'Quite quickly this morning we were able to identify who we believe were responsible.' Supt Swan said the man suffered bruising to his arm. 'As you can imagine, he is quite upset and shaken by the incident,' he said. He said the women could face serious assault charges, which carry a maximum sentence of seven years' jail. The women appeared intoxicated in the video, he said. Police Minister Jack Dempsey said the incident was an 'absolute disgrace'. 'It's deplorable to think that an individual can think they can use this type of violence against an elderly person on a public transport vehicle,' he said. The incident follows a spate of similar ones on Australia’s public transport. In June, where police charged a 55-year-old woman for racially vilifying an Asian schoolboy on a bus in Burwood, in Sydney’s west. That incident was also caught on camera. Another video shows a pregnant women being called a ‘fat s...’ after she asked a train passenger in Perth to move her bags so she could sit down. In November 2012, a French woman on a Melbourne bus was told to ‘speak English or die’ by a man who also threatened to cut her breasts off.

They call him PicASHo - because his bizarre work incorporates his dead subjects' ashes into his artwork. And he's certainly proved popular. Artist Adam Brown has cut out a rather odd niche in the art world by turn his customers' ashes, or the ashes of a loved one, into paintings. Among the bizarre requests he's had are paintings of a customer's favourite fishing spots, animals, flowers and even Albert Einstein. Artist Adam Browns receives daily requests from people wishing for either their ashes, or the ashes of others, to be turned into paintings. At work: Mr Brown, from Grandview in Missouri, came across the unique concept while watching a TV show . Mr Brown, from Grandview, in Missouri, . was approached by a friend of a friend, who asked if he could create a . memorial portrait of a loved one - and he suggested painting it with . their ashes. Though initially nervous, Mr Brown, 32, said that he found handling the human remains quite natural. The artist only requests a small amount of the cremated remains, which he then mixes into certain areas of a portrait. He works off a photograph provided by either the deceased's friend, relative or loved one, and asks for their input throughout the process. Mr Brown said that each work takes him between four and eight hours to complete, and that as well as mixing the ashes into the paint, he also adds some to the surface of the portrait, using special glues and resin. The artist marks the back of every portrait to state that the work was created using some human remains - just in case if falls into the hands of someone who is unaware of his methods. One of Mr Brown's masterpieces, painted using the ash supplied by a  customer . The artist has said some people find his work 'sick' or 'creepy', but he says his customers are pleased . Another happy customer: This woman looks overjoyed at the painting she commissioned from Mr Brown . Mr Brown, whose collection is called 'Ashes to Art,' now receives requests from people everyday. The artist, who believes the majority of people do not find his work creepy or weird, said: 'A friend of a friend in another state asked me to do a memorial portrait of her recently deceased husband. 'After agreeing to it, as I had done before, she asked if I could use the cremation remains in the work - something she believed he would have liked. Tentatively, I said that would be fine. Mr Brown, 32, was approached by a friend of a friend, who asked if he could create a memorial portrait of a loved one . Not all the work Mr Brown does is of dead people, here is a painting he created of a woman . 'I thought I'd have an odd reaction to handling human remains the first time, but it wasn't strange at all. It was just another medium to work in. I wore gloves, handled them respectfully, adhered them to the surface of the painting, and sent the unused portion back.' 'The majority of people seem to really love the idea and have expressed interest in getting one for a loved one or even having one made for themselves when they pass away. 'I've even had elderly people contact me to arrange this service for themselves when they pass. But I also had one girl on Facebook who compared me to Hitler - although others commenting on the thread were quick to correct her. 'For those that find it ""sick"" or ""creepy"", I just tell them they don't have to purchase one. For everyone else, they are truly touched by the unique service.

Beijing’s toxic smog finally lifted this week with dramatic before and after pictures taken on Wednesday and Thursday showing just how dense it had been. A strong cold front brought blue sky and sunshine to a city that had been masked by dense pollution for over a week. Earlier this week Chinese scientists said that pollution in Beijing was so dense that its effects were comparable to that of a nuclear winter. Remarkable: The above photograph was taken near the Forbidden City in Beijing on Wednesday and the lower one at the same place on Thursday . Relief: Blue sky and sunshine reappeared in Beijing on Thursday thanks to a strong cold front which dispersed the week-long smoggy weather . It has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated, so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply. This process was under way in China’s capital city and six northern provinces, according to He Dongxian from China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering. She warned that the toxic smog was hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer, it could affect food production, according to The Guardian. Clear skies: The photo on the left shows the sharp contrast of air quality at the Temple of Heaven while on the right, software on a mobile phone indicates the sharp contrast in pollution levels . The sun is finally revealed: The corner tower of the Forbidden City on Wednesday and Thursday (left) and before and after shots of the Central Business District that show the beneficial effect of the cold weather front . Dongxian demonstrated recently that seedlings in Beijing were taking over twice as long to grow as those in a lab. ‘Every farm is caught in a smog panic,’ she told The South China Morning Post. Pollution had been so severe that aircraft were grounded, roads closed and tourists numbers hit, while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing on Tuesday had alarming results. It was reported that the level of PM 2.5 particles, a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream, reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe, which is 25. Authorities have introduced anti-pollution policies and often pledged to clean up the environment but the problem has not eased. Beijing had been draped in stinking smog for more than a week and in an effort to cut pollution, 147 industrial companies in the capital had cut or suspended production as of Tuesday, according to Xinhua. City residents are growing angry and alarmed. ‘Of course, on days where pollution levels reach or even exceed the scale, we are very concerned and we have to see this as a crisis,’ Bernhard Schwartlander, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in China, told Reuters. Road to nowhere: Vehicles clog a highway in Beijing on Wednesday as a hazardous smog enveloped the city . ‘There's now clear evidence that, in the long term, high levels of air pollution can actually also cause lung cancer,’ he said. Hebei, a major industrial region surrounding Beijing, has some of the most polluted cities in the world's most populous country. Shijiazhuang routinely recorded ‘beyond index’ measurements of polluting ‘particulate matter’ in early 2013. The China Academy of Sciences identified the province as a major source of noxious smog that hung over Beijing a year ago. The government said in an action plan for Hebei in September that it would ban new projects in certain industries, close outdated steel and cement facilities and slash coal use. The province has promised to cut total steel capacity by 86 million tonnes, about 40 percent of last year's production, by 2020. Official data suggests that is starting to happen. Meanwhile, a man in a smog-ridden northern city has become the first person in China to sue the government for failing to curb air pollution. Li Guixin, a resident of Shijiazhuang, capital of the northern province of Hebei, submitted his complaint to a district court asking the city's Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau to ‘perform its duty to control air pollution according to the law’, the Yanzhao Metropolis Daily said. The Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences recently ranked Beijing second worst in terms of living environment among 40 major cities around the world and said it was 'barely suitable' for living. However, China's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country's awful pollution.The smog, he says, provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry. Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, a military expert at the National Defence University, spoke days after it was reported that the US Navy planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the Middle East. He said lasers were 'most afraid of smog' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired. 'Under conditions where there is no smog, a laser weapon can fire (at a range of) 10 kilometres,' he told CCTV’s Haixia Liangan (Cross-Straits) current affairs program, according to www.news.com.au.'When there’s smog, it’s only one kilometre. What's the point of making this kind of weapon?'","Scientists said that pollution in Beijing was so dense that its effects were .

A two volume set of Mein Kampf, signed by Adolf Hitler and dedicated with a personal message to one of the first members of the Nazi party, has sold for triple what it was estimated to sell. The manifesto of the future Fuhrer sold after 11 bids for $64,850 (£38,753), including a buyers' premium, at an action house in Los Angeles, after expecting to sell for between $20,000 and $25,000. Both volumes are signed by Hitler and dedicated to Josef Bauer, the 34th member of the Nazi Party and one of the leaders of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, the attempted Hitler-led coup of the Bavarian government. The Adolf Hitler-inscribed 'Mein Kampf' volume dedicated to future SS leader Joseph Bauer . The copy of Mein Kampf is a true original, and came in two volumes, dated 1925 and 1926, when the volumes were written and published a year after one another. Pictured right, the written inscription by Hitler to his friend, who later became a member of the SS . One of the two rare copies of Mein Kampf that Hitler wrote while in prison, detailing his Nazi manifesto . It is thought that the two volume set was given to Bauer as a Christmas gift between 1925 and 1926, when each volume was written and published. Hitler wrote 'Mein Kampf' while in prison, and in it he outlines his political . doctrine for Germany and blamed the country’s economic troubles after the First World War on the Jews, . Marxists, Social Democrats and the Weimar Republic leadership. The book is incredibly well preserved, which is likely why it sold for so much money at the auction in Los Angeles . The inscription in the 1925 volume to Josef Bauer. It identifies Bauer, one of the first members of the Nazi party (#34) as his friend and contemporary . Adolf Hitler (1889-1945)- signed volumes of his book 'Mein Kampf' were sold by the LA auction house, advertised as 'an ominously signed set of books that futilely warned the world of Hitler's intentions' adding they were more scarce for being signed to a fellow Nazi leader . The book was advertised as 'an ominous detailing of Hitler's Nazi manifesto and his plan for Germany' In addition to the sale of the signed copy of Mein Kampf, the auction also sold the jacket of a prominent Nazi figure, Albert Speer. Speer was the Nazi party's chief architect, who later in his career took political office as the Minister of Armaments and War Production, and was one of Hitler's inner circle. In addition, the auction sold a leather jacket owned by the Nazi architect and Minister for Armaments Albert Speer . The leather jacket sold for $10,068 (£6,030) and was possibly worn by Speer when he visited Hitler for the last time on April 23 1945. Inside the jacket are labels that bear Speer's name, the brand name W. Fliegner and the initials of the Reichszeugmeisterei, the German regulatory office for quality control in manufacturing. Albert Speer (left), German architect and National Socialist (Nazi) leader. A member of the Nazi party from 1931, he became its official architect after Hitler (right) came to power . The RZM label depicts the NSDAP eagle emblem denoting the Nazi elite, and also included is the original invoice for the coat with Speer's name printed . on it, found stored in the coat’s pocket. The coat made its way to the U.S. when it was taken by an Allied soldier named 'Ralph', who mentioned the coat in a letter to his mother about his time in the war, dated May 6 1945. The letter mentions that he 'looked around today in a huge chalet of a high-ranking Nazi. For you I have a gold necklace. And for Dad, I have a great leather jacket...I took a coat with no Nazi symbols on the outside...Unfortunately, the name of Nazi Albert Speer is stamped in the jacket...' World War II photos and films document Speer wearing the same (or similar) coat, and a written record also exists of his last meeting with Hitler that describes Speer as wearing a suit and leather coat, possibly this same garment. After World War II, Speer was convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials and imprisoned until 1966. He died in 1983.","The volumes were sold after 11 bids .

Justin Bieber’s bad boy father has split from the mother of his two young children and has apparently chosen a life of partying with his superstar son instead. Jeremy Bieber, 39, who was with Justin when he was arrested for drag racing last month, ended his seven-year romance with Erin Wagner and the pair are living apart, sharing custody of Jaxon, 4, and Jazmyn, 5. It is unclear when the couple split, but friends have said their relationship has been struggling for some time and rumors of a break up have circulated before. Scroll down for video . Split: Justin enjoys a sushi lunch with his father and Erin and their two children in happier times. Jeremy is living apart from Erin but they are sharing custody of the children, who Justin adores . Part of the family: A source told MailOnline that Erin and Justin are still great friends and that she is still on good terms with Jeremy despite the split . But the couple were regularly pictured together until late last year and spent Thanksgiving with each other. Sources say Erin – who is incredibly close to Justin – couldn’t handle Jeremy constantly going away with the pop star and living the high-life. The situation seemed to really start getting to the 27-year-old in the days leading up to Justin’s Miami arrest as she made a series of emotional tweets saying how unhappy she was. On January 16 she wrote ‘this is all I need’ and posted a longing quotation: ‘I don’t need a perfect one.. I just need someone who can make me feel like I’m the only one’. A week later Justin, 19, was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, on suspicion of driving under the influence, driving with an expired license and resisting arrest without violence. Jeremy had accompanied his son on the controversial break. Tattooed Jeremy – who has been jailed at least twice in the past – was heavily criticised in the wake of the incident with Justin’s millions of fans accusing him of being a terrible influence. It was even suggested he was in an SUV blocking the street to allow the drag race. The day after Justin was released from custody on a $2,500 bond, the father and son pair were pictured out partying. Trouble: Justin with his father on the beach in Miami hours before his high profile arrest for drag racing . Under the influence: A source told MailOnline: 'If you look at a lot of Justin’s . controversial incidents over the past few months, Jeremy has been in the . background. That is very worrying'. Police yesterday released footage of Bieber walking the line after his arrest . And then on January 31, Jeremy was present again when his son was accused of smoking marijuana on a private flight and verbally abusing a flight attendant. It seems everything got too much for Erin during that turbulent period and four days after the DUI arrest she wrote: ‘Hard to believe sometimes that things can get better! Trying to keep going!’ She followed that up with: ‘Ready for the next chapter.....wonder what it's about....#unknown’. This is not the first time Jeremy’s wild behavior has affected his family life for the worse. He split from Justin’s mother, Pattie Mallette, just 10 months after she had given birth to the future global superstar following a troubled on off relationship. According to Pattie’s autobiography, The Only Way Is Up, the teenagers were actually engaged, but called off the wedding when Jeremy cheated on her with a mutual acquaintance. She also claims Jeremy was in the county jail for fighting the day Justin was born and that he often let his son down, regularly failing to turn up when he was due to take him out for the day. A source told MailOnline: ‘Jeremy has always been a bad boy. When he first got together with Pattie he was a big drinker and loved to party. Close: While Jeremy was not always around during his childhood, they seem to be inseparable recently . Blood: Justin and Jeremy got matching tattoos. Those close to them say he's more of a friend than a father . ‘He has always adored his son, but he wasn’t mature enough to be a responsible parent and his lifestyle meant he couldn’t be there for him like a father should be. ‘He got in trouble with the police and would often leave town, sometimes for months at a time. ‘And if the truth be told his attitude towards partying and living the high-life has never changed. Again, he adores Jaxon and Jazmyne, in fact they are incredibly important to him, but that hasn’t altered his personality. ‘Justin hitting the big time in the way he has is an absolute dream come true for Jeremy and the temptation of being able to travel the globe, living like a superstar was too much to turn down. ‘Erin was always going to take second place to that. They are still on good terms for the sake of the children and she still has a great friendship with Justin, but their relationship has broken down. ‘Jeremy has the opportunity to party with beautiful girls in every city in the world. He was never going to let anything get in the way of that.’ The source added: ‘The fact Jeremy cannot seem to maintain a relationship is just another sign of how flaky he can be. He really isn’t the kind if role model Justin needs around him during this difficult time. Party! While Jeremy adores his children a source told MailOnline he has always been a wild child . Lonely: Erin and Jeremy have had an up and down relationship. They spent Thankgiving last year together, but then around the time of Justin's arrest in Miami she began posting some emotional tweets . Looking for love: Her postings made it very clear that she was no longer in a relationship . ‘Jeremy is more of a friend than a father. Far from trying to keep Justin on the straight and narrow he is often the one encouraging him.’ Throughout their relationship Erin has been referred to as Jeremy’s wife, although it is unclear if they ever actually got married. They met around seven years ago in the Mitchell, Ontario area, before Justin hit the big time. Soon after first getting together they moved West to Winnipeg and started a family. But when Justin’s career really started to take off in around 2010, Jeremy decided to move back to Stratford, bringing Erin with him. Initially they had their own place, but last year Justin bought his dad an $850,000 farm house on the outskirts of Stratford, just a few plots away from another property he bought for his maternal grandparents Diane and Bruce Dale. Sources close to Jeremy have told MailOnline he regularly boasts about receiving a massive $50,000 allowance from his son to help him pay for the upkeep of the mansion, which Justin also uses as a base when he is back in his home country of Canada. Jeremy – who uses some of the money to pay for a private butler - is known for having wild parties at the property, which he and his friends call, ‘the ranch’. Erin is still a regular visitor to the luxury pad, but she now has her own place and works for technology company Fibernetics in nearby Kitchener. Her family all live in Cypress Texas, having relocated there from Burlington, Ontario. She has been a regular fixture in Justin’s life, often going with the family to glitzy awards ceremonies, and many saw her as a positive influence. Butler: Sources said that Jeremy boasts that he has a $50,000 allowance from his son, which he uses to pay for a butler, at the $850,000 Canadian mansion his son also bought for him to live in . Justin is also incredibly close to his two younger siblings. His father on the other hand is generally seen as a bad role model. There is no official recording of his time in jail at the time of Justin’s birth – although records are expunged after a certain period of time in Canada. But he has got other offenses on his rap sheet. In 1997 he was convicted of assault and sentenced to 90 days in prison. Two years later he spent another 21 days in jail after violating his probation. He was also convicted of a second probation violation at the same time. Then in January 2004 he was charged with assault again, but the case was dismissed. Despite his criminal past Justin still seems to look up to his wayward father. Even though they were out of contact for extended periods during his childhood, Justin gave an interview saying: ‘I have a great relationship with my dad. ‘When I was younger, he taught me how to play some songs on the guitar, like ‘Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door’ by Bob Dylan. He taught me how to drive too.’ Days after his Miami arrest he tweeted: ‘I have the greatest Dad in the world. He’s taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superhero #batman.’ But far from keep his son out of trouble, often, when Justin hits the headlines for the wrong reason Jeremy isn’t too far away. The two were photographed together at a Maple Leafs hockey game in Toronto Dec. 29, just hours before a limo driver called cops to report he was assaulted in a car carrying Bieber. The driver said he was driving Justin and his entourage away from the Air Canada Centre after the game when an unidentified member of the group attacked him. Justin was charged with assault late last month. Mom: Pattie Mallette, Justin's mother, split with Jeremy soon after his birth - during which Jeremy was allegedly in county jail . Jeremy also was with Justin and his son’s pal Lil Za in San Francisco on January 6, three days before the singer allegedly threw more than a dozen raw eggs at his neighbor’s house in Calabasas, Calif. The day of the alleged egging, Jeremy posted a Twitter photo of himself and Justin smirking for a camera with the caption: “Father like son. Son like father.” A source said: ‘If you look at a lot of Justin’s controversial incidents over the past few months, Jeremy has been in the background. That is very worrying.’","Jeremy Bieber, 39, has ended his 7-year .

The families of the soldiers killed in the 1982 Hyde Park IRA bomb have been accused of ‘bitterness’ and failing to move on, by the ex-Labour minister who agreed to the scheme which saw a suspect walk free from court. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain refused to apologise for the deals which critics say amounted to an ‘amnesty’ for nearly 200 suspected IRA killers. He said that while the feelings of the relatives of the bombing victims were ‘understandable’, the Labour government had to help ‘society as a whole to move on’. Convicted IRA member John Downey, 62, of County Donegal, walked free . from court after being given a letter by the Blair government telling . him he was not wanted by police in a deal agree by then Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain (right) Fresh talks are being held today between government ministers and the devolved assembly, after First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign after being left in the dark about blunders by police and prosecutors which saw one of the alleged bombers John Downey walk free from court. Convicted IRA terrorist Downey, 62, was arrested last year and was due to stand trial for the July 1982 nail bomb atrocity which killed four Household Cavalry soldiers and seven horses and injured 31 people. He was told this week that he would not face prosecution because of a letter – dubbed a ‘get-out-of-jail-free card’ – mistakenly sent to him saying he was not wanted by police. The letter was sent in July 2007, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, assuring him he was not wanted for any offence despite a warrant for his arrest existing since May 29, 1983. A judge will be appointed to investigate the operation of a Government scheme to deal with on-the-run republicans, David Cameron has announced. The Prime Minister said he accepted calls for a 'full, independent examination' of the process after Democratic Unionist (DUP) First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to resign.Mr Cameron said: 'The case has already been referred to the Police Ombudsman but, as the First Minister has said, we should have a full, independent examination of the whole operation of this scheme. 'So I can announce today that we will appoint an independent judge to produce a full public account of the operation of this administrative scheme to determine whether any other letters were sent in error.' The judge will be given 'full access to government files and officials' and will report by the end May, Mr Cameron said, with the findings being published. The letters scheme was set up in 2005 after public outcry forced Mr Hain, then Northern Ireland Secretary, to drop legislation that would have written the amnesties into law. He has now refused to apologise, saying the deals were necessary to secure peace. ‘It was a necessary part of getting to the position where Northern Ireland escaped from its hideous past of evil and terrorism to almost universal peace and stability. I make no apology for that.’ However, writing for the Guardian he repeatedly suggested that the need to reach a deal over-ruled the feelings of the victims’ families. Mr Hain said: ‘The bitterness of . families and friends of the four soldiers killed in the 1982 Hyde Park . terrorist atrocity over the John Downey debacle is understandable,’ he . said. ‘After being . officially cleared as a suspect, he was prosecuted in circumstances I . still find astonishing; then yesterday that prosecution was aborted. No . wonder there is anger on all sides.’ He . insisted that  Northern Ireland today is ‘light years from where it . was’, the result of ‘determined leadership by Blair and his ministers’. He said the widows of prison officers killed in the Troubles would always view the endgame as ‘betrayal’. Mr . Hain added: ‘They didn't and still don't accept the abnormal measures . that were necessary to normalise Northern Ireland, just as bringing . closure to other bitter conflicts around the world has required . governments to do controversial and difficult things. ‘Although . nobody should presume to ask victims to draw a line under the past, . there are times when the government must take a view on the best way for . society as a whole to move on, to get closure on the past, difficult as . that is.’ Explosion: A detachment of the Queen's Household Cavalry lay dead, victims of a concealed car bomb detonated in London's Hyde Park . Two of the four victims: The families of . Household Cavalry soldiers Anthony 'Denis' Daly (left) and Roy Bright . (right) said they 'never ceased in their desire to see that justice be . done' Deaths: Simon Tipper (left) and Jeffrey Young (right), the other two soldiers killed in the bombing in 1982 . Families of the victims of the Hyde . Park bombing said they felt ‘devastatingly let down’ by ‘catastrophic . failures’ which led to Downey's release and called for a review of the ‘comfort letters’ issued to IRA . suspects. In a statement, . the relatives of Corporal Roy Bright, 36, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, 23, . Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, both 19, who were . slain when a bomb packed with 30lbs of nails exploded as the Blues and . Royals rode to the Changing of the Guard ceremony, said: ‘This . news has left us all feeling devastatingly let down, even more so when . the monumental blunder behind this judgment lies at the feet of the . Police Service of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Peter Robinson threatened to resign if the UK government refuses to order a judicial inquiry into the blunders . ‘The . end result is that the opportunity for the full chain of those terrible . events will never be put in the public domain for justice to be seen to . be done.’ Judith Jenkins, 52, the widow of L/Cpl Young, added: ‘It’s the cruellest injustice. For 32 years we have waited for justice. ‘We . all had our hopes raised and this has been a total shock. It’s . absolutely staggering how many blunders have happened in this case. This . case has made a mockery of the criminal justice system.’ Mr Robinson effectively . gave the Government 24 hours to respond to his demand for a public . inquiry into how the letters were agreed. Having . asked for the Assembly to be recalled tomorrow, he has made clear the . contents of a motion he would put before the House would be dependent on . the Government's response to his demands - prompting the prospect of a . resignation and subsequent election. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the Government was looking ‘urgently’ at Mr Robinson's call for a judicial inquiry, but warned against allowing the Downey case to escalate into a ‘full-blown political crisis’. Stormont's Deputy First Minister is to hold talks with the Northern Ireland Secretary as a political crisis triggered by the collapse of the Hyde Park bomb case continues to threaten the future of the devolved administration in Belfast. Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister, is to meet with Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers meet at Stormont Castle to discuss the controversy.","Former Northern Ireland Secretary refuses to apologise for deals .

'I will never again be the same husband, father, brother or son and my career and reputation are gone forever,' Buckley, 45, told the devastated family as he choked back his sobs.

He must also forfeit his job, his right to hold . public office and his police pension. He has claimed that he the crash was caused by his inexperience with driving a high-performance car, CBS reported. But during the plea deal, he said that he had enjoyed driving the car fast, even though he was putting the public and his passenger in danger, the New Jersey Star-Ledger reported. Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz told him on Thursday: 'The conduct you engaged in cannot be tolerated.' Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor . Michael Weiss agreed that Buckley, who had hoped to become police . chief, should not get leniency just because of his former job. 'What . if a mom and her baby were pulling out a shopping center as he crashed . and they were killed?' he asked. 'The defendant should not be treated . any differently than anyone else.' In their own emotional displays, Buckley's wife, mother and sister spoke of their loss. 'This is living hell,' Zerbyâ€™s mother, . Sally, 88, told the court. 'No parent should have to bury a child. I try to . remember Chris smiling, but all I see is him in the casket.'

She then turned on Buckley. 'Why were you driving a rented Dodge Viper around North Brunswick that day while you were on duty?' she said. 'A car that belongs on the race track, not residential roads. Why weren't you doing your job?' Kathy Horvath, Christopher Zerby's sister, said that Buckley 'not only took my brother's life. He endangered the whole community'.

Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has launched a robust defence of his tenure in South Wales and believes he has been portrayed unfairly as a villain. Tan's time at the Cardiff City Stadium has been hounded by controversy with the owner changing the club's colours, much to the displeasure of the fans, and sacking promotion-winning manager Malky Mackay after rows over transfers. The Malaysian businessman, however, insists that he retains the backing of the majority of Cardiff fans and believes he has been given a rough ride by the British press, who he branded 'a little bit racist'. 'Do you think that Malky Mackay would have got us promoted without my investment? Without me giving him money? After we got promoted the fans were all very supportive, everybody was appreciative,' he told BBC Sport. Thumbs up: Controversial owner Vincent Tan claims he has backing from '90 per cent' of Cardiff supporters . 'Overall, even now, I think, I would say even 90 per cent of the fans are supportive, the problem is you have 10 per cent or five per cent or maybe even a few hundred people that are not supportive, who are more vocal. 'And then you have the British press who have has been misled by some people, feeding them wrong information and saying what a terrible person I am and trying to make fun of me and paint me like a villain. 'But my experience is the majority are very supportive. I go to the club, many people come and shake my hand, want to shake hands with me, want my autograph, so generally I think it is not too bad. 'I will say that the British press is unfair and maybe they are unfair because because we didn't tell our side of the story that well. Under fire: The Malaysian owner has claimed he will quit Cardiff if the club's supporters 'really p*** me off' Anger: Cardiff fans are disappointed with Tan's treatment of the club's former manager Malky Mackay . Protest: But Tan insists only a 'few hundred people' oppose his ownership of the south Wales outfit . Flop: Andreas Cornelius left the club in January . 'And sometimes the British press (are) maybe a little bit racist and quite unfair.' Tan claimed that his family want him to leave the troubled Premier League club, who are in the relegation zone, but added he will only quit if the fans 'p*** him off'. 'Some of my family members really want me to leave. They think it's not worth it. They think no-one is grateful, but you have to be patient, accept the criticism and sometimes the insults,' said Tan. 'Right now at this point of time, I will stay, unless the fans really p*** me off so much, then I will leave.' Mackay was dismissed in December amid claims from Tan that he vastly overspent in the summer and chief executive Simon Lim recently released a statement criticising the £7.6million signing of striker Andreas Cornelius, who left the club in January after not scoring a goal. Cardiff made an £8.5m loss on the Dane, when wages and agents' fees are included. Mackay has since been replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Tan is confident that the Norwegian can keep the club in the Premier League, despite them currently being three points adrift of safety. 'We overspend on the transfer. He was supposed to spend £35m which is what I agreed to put in. We bought the wrong striker who does not score any goals,' Tan said. Out: Malky Mackay was sacked by Tan last year despite steering the club to the Barclays Premier League . 'He (Mackay) didn't do very well at Watford, but somehow our CEO and our chairman hired him and replaced Dave Jones. 'Dave Jones actually did much better. So I think Malky got lucky when he came to Cardiff.' He added: 'Although we're not doing very well now, we are in the relegation zone, I'm convinced and believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be able to keep us in the Premier League.' Despite the criticism, Tan insists he is in it for the long haul at Cardiff and believes that eventually the fans who are against him will be made to eat their words. Man in charge: Tan is confident Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can keep Cardiff in the top flight . 'The club would have gone bust many times if I had not been around,' he said. 'I came to invest in the club and I just put in some money and I thought that's about it, actually I didn't know the club was in such bad shape. 'I made a decision and when I make a decision to do something I want to stick by it and see it through (to) the end and make it a success. And likewise the same for Cardiff. 'We were going through some difficulties, we had the wrong people doing things for us but I think we will get it right. 'And I think when this thing is over, fans will understand and they should regret what they have done to me and maybe some of them should apologise to me.' In the spotlight: Tan has defended his decision to wear sunglasses and leather gloves at Cardiff games . Tan, who is well known for wearing his Cardiff strip over his shirt and tie, while sporting leather gloves and sunglasses, also insisted he will not revert the club's colours back to their traditional blue. 'There is no way I will change it back to blue under my ownership,' he said. 'Perhaps they can find an owner who likes blue and buy me out. Sure, he can change it to blue after that. I'll go somewhere and do another red club. 'I wear sunglasses because of the glare of the spotlights. I wear gloves because it is very cold in the UK. Frankly, sometimes I think they are nuts making all these comments.' 16580 . 35829 . 42586 . 26587 . 83128 . 34598 .","Vincent Tan believes he is owed an apology from the Cardiff supporters .

Blow: Entrepreneur Rob Law was dealt a crushing blow as judges ruled a rival to his Trunki children's suitcase does not infringe on his design rights . A Dragons' Den reject who has sold two million of his children's ride-on suitcases was today dealt a crippling blow as judges ruled a rival product does not infringe on his design rights. Rob Law left the Den in 2006 dismayed after each of the Dragons ruled 'I'm out', after the strap on his prototype broke during a demonstration. But the entrepreneur fought to make the Trunki a success, and today turns over £7million a year. By 2011, 20 per cent of British three to six year olds owned one of the ride-on pull-along children's cases, which can be designed with a number of different animal and insect motifs. But trouble began to brew when Paul Beverley, MD of Hong Kong-based PMS International Limited, spotted a Trunki while on his travels in 2010. PMS began marketing a rival product, the Kiddee Case, setting the scene for a legal battle over the design. Appeal Court judges today ruled that the 'more rounded' shape of the Kiddee Case - which comes in animal and insect designs - is 'very different' to the Trunki's 'sleek and stylised' appearance. Lord Justice Kitchin said: 'The Kiddee Case is softer and more rounded and evocative of an insect with antennae or an animal with floppy ears.' The Court’s decision that the Kiddee Case does not breach the Trunki’s community registered design rights is a disaster for Mr Law and his company, Magmatic Ltd, effectively opening up the European market to its discount competitor. Bristol-based Mr Law was a student at Northumbria University when he was nominated as a finalist for the 1998 Materials Design Award. Given the brief to produce 'a design for luggage', he was inspired to design a child's bag, after visiting a toy shop. The prototype, which he dubbed the 'Rodeo' - was awarded the top prize. From there the Trunki became a success, with Mr Law securing a contract with John Lewis, on the back of his appearance on Dragon's Den. Scroll down for video . Practical: Globetrotting children can sit on the suitcase as their parents pull them along . Sucessful: Mr Law employs more than 50 people and enjoys a turnover of more than £7 million a year . Largely due to the popularity of the Trunki - which now sells in 97 countries - Magmatic won a top prize at the National Business Awards in 2012. But Mr Law's success came back to haunt him in court as PMS argued the 'Rodeo' design had been honoured publicly at the 1998 prize ceremony, long before the design rights were registered for the Trunki in 2003. While no one disputed that the Trunki was an ‘innovative design’ - and it was accepted that the Kiddee Case was 'inspired by' its rival - PMS pointed to a photograph of Mr Law at the award ceremony and argued the Trunki’s design rights were invalidated by the publicity. Ruling on the dispute today, Lord Justice Kitchin said that the differences in the rival products’ shape, decoration, and colour meant that the possibility of parents being confused between them was slight. Design: His invention is made from the same material as adult suitcase brands and can be ridden like a toy . Demonstration: He sat on one of his products during his appearance in front of the Dragons in 2006. But he left the Den disappointed as one by one the Dragons declared 'I'm out' Describing the insect version of the Kiddee Case, he said: 'It looks like a ladybird and the handles on its forehead look like antennae. 'Overall the shape conveys a completely different impression from that of the Trunki.' Although there were ‘some similarities at a general level’, the judge, sitting with Lord Justice Moses and Lady Justice Black, said: 'I think the impression conveyed to the informed user by the designs of the two versions of the Kiddee Case is very different from that of the Trunki.' There were, he said 'many significant differences' between the profile of the two products as well as their colour and decoration. Curious: The Dragons were initially impressed with the product, with Theo and Deborah (second and third from right) calling it 'cute' Dreams dashed: Mr Law felt the investment slipping away when Theo Paphitis managed to break one of the straps . He added: 'The overall impression created by the two designs is very different. The impression created by the Trunki is that of a horned animal. 'It is a sleek and stylised design and, from the side, has a generally asymmetrical appeareance...by contrast, the design of the Kiddee Case is softer and more rounded and evocative of an insect with antennae or an animal with floppy ears. 'At both a general and detailed level, the Kiddee Case conveys a very different impression.'","Rob Law was sent packing from the Den in 2006 after a strap on his children's ride-on suitcase broke during a demonstration .

Even his underpants have been banished, not to mention his beloved David Bowie collection. They are just some of the mod cons and home comforts that Benjamin Carle has dispensed with in his attempt to become 100 per cent French, right down to the coffee he drinks and the films he watches. Proving a point: French journalist Benjamin Carle poses with some of the items he has bought after setting himself a challenge to use only French-made products . The 26-year-old journalist, who lives in Paris, embarked on the challenge in response to comments made by France's minister for economic renewal Arnaud Montebourg who urged the country to buy French to boost home-grown industry. But he was shocked to discover that barely 5 per cent of his belongings had been made in France. He set himself a monthly budget of â‚¬1,800 (Â£1,500) and even took out a bank loan to buy in all his new products, it was reported by The Guardian. Out went pretty much everything, from the Kenya-grown green beans and the light bulbs from China to his Moroccan-made underpants and his iPhone which he smashed with a Tefal saucepan. Patriotic purge: Mr Carle had to get rid of his beloved music collection by English musician David Bowie (left) and also his U.S.-made iPhone which he smashed with a French-built Tefal saucepan for his experiment . As did the refrigerator, which meant he had to chill his food on a window ledge, and even his Daft Punk music because, although they are French they sing in English. He was, however, spared having to sling out his girlfriend Anais and pet cat Loon, who are thankfully both French. After ten months, he had very nearly succeeded, save for a mere 3.1 per cent of non-French products that an 'auditor' ruled he still had in his possession - six Ikea forks, a Chinese guitar and some unsourced wall paint. Strict: Mr Carle even banned Daft Punk music because although they are French they sing in English . Mr Carle said his experiment wasn't designed to be patriotic, but rather to hold politicians to account for the comments they make. He said: 'This wasn't about French nationalism. It was trying to show that we should think about the way we consume and make different choices. 'If we want to save jobs and industries wherever we are, we might think about supporting them.' His journey has been filmed for a documentary that is due to be aired on Canal+ this month . At the end, he is presented with a medal... by Montebourg himself.","Journalist Benjamin Carle is now '96.9% French' after ten-month challenge .

The builder who refused to abandon his million-pound home to the floods, and instead constructed his own defences, has successfully kept the deluge at bay - as water levels begin to drop. Sam Notaro became a latter-day King Canute after protecting his property from the water which engulfed the Somerset Levels. The 40 year-old father-of-two triumphed over the elements with a seven-foot high mud dam around his four-bedroom home in Moorland, Somerset. Scroll down for video . Home and dry: Sam Notaro, 40, has successfully defended his house from the waters which have devastated much of Somerset . Man the barricades: Mr Notaro built high mud banks around his house to hold back the rising waters, which have now begun to retreat . Safe: The house, pictured today from above, is on the highest ground in the village of Moorland . Along with a team of family and friends, they worked around the clock to ensure that the property he built stayed dry. He now says that almost four weeks after he began his battle against the rising waters he feels he has won. Mr Notaro, who lives in Moorland, Somerset, said that he could now start getting back into a normal routine after the water had dropped by more than 18 inches. He said: 'We've done as much as we can do so now it's just time to sit back and relax really. The waters have now dropped a little bit. In the past week it has gone down about 18 inches. 'There is still about three and a half feet of water left on the drive still but fingers crossed it'll continue to go down as it has been. I feel like I can finally start going back to normal life - I'm back at work again now as well which is a bit of a relief. 'Obviously . we aren't really worried about the water coming up over the barriers . any more because the levels have stopped rising. The only concern now would be if the barriers broke, because obviously they are still holding back quite a lot of water. 'Thankfully that doesn't look like that will happen - it is looking strong and there aren't any cracks or anything. Undamaged: Mr Notaro poses in his kitchen, which has remained untouched by the floods . Write caption here . Relaxed: Since the waters have fallen Mr Notaro says his only concern is the huge mud barriers breaking . 'We've still got the pumps running every now and again just to make sure none of the last dregs of water get in the house. It's looking positive though.' When flood waters started creeping towards his home, the builder used all of his resources to create a mud barrier surrounding the property. He wrapped the base of the house in polythene in an attempt to stop any rainwater soaking through the bricks. A series of pumps were also in action to remove any water breaching his blockade. Mr . Notaro evacuated his partner Alana O'Dell, 31, and their two children, . who are 18 months old and 20 weeks old, at the start of his battle. He said that although the water is still too high to move them back into the home he hopes it won't be long. Mr . Notaro said: 'I haven't moved my partner and kids back in just yet, . obviously we still need to use a boat to get in and out so it isn't . really practical for them to be here. 'I . have managed to get out and go and see them though which was fantastic. They're doing alright, they knew I had to stay here and protect the . house.' Heavy machinery: Mr Notaro hired trucks, pumps and diggers to aid in the audacious defence of his home . Earlier days: The waters have receded since the peak of the floods, pictured, which prompted Mr Notaro to coat his walls with polythene . Rising tides: This is the scene Mr Notaro had to contend with on February 7, when the floods were worst . Sam began building his treasured home just two and a half years ago after purchasing the four-acre plot - the highest point in Moorland. It was built on a spot which, according to records, has never been previously flooded - a claim which Mr Notaro can proudly maintain. Though he has managed to keep the water out of the impressive property he says that they will still have a lot of work to do once the water disappears. He said: 'Hopefully, if the weather stays relatively dry, the water will disappear completely and normal life can be resumed. 'Obviously the hard work has paid off and the inside of the house is still dry but we will still have a clean up operation after. 'We will have to redo the garden and get a new driveway. There is still a lot to do but at least we're not having to do anything on the inside of the house either.'","Builder Sam Notaro, 40, built his own flood defences rather than allow his home in Moorland, Somerset, to be engulfed .

Tragic: Mark Wood, 44, was found dead at his home in Bampton, Oxfordshire, on August 9 last year . An Asperger's sufferer with a phobia of food died after his benefits were cut following a nationwide Government crackdown on handouts, an inquest has heard. Mark Wood, 44, was found dead at his home in Bampton, Oxfordshire, on August 9 last year - four months after he had been declared fit to work. His body was discovered in a decomposed and malnourished state, weighing just 5st 8lbs. Mr Wood, who lived alone, had suffered from Asperger's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as a range of phobias, including those of pollution, paint, food and certain social situations. He had been receiving housing benefit and employment support allowance from the Government after being signed off from work with sickness. But in January last year, he was deemed fit to work by Atos heathcare, which assesses people on behalf of the Government's Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). The decision saw Mr Wood's benefits stopped in April - leaving him with just his disability allowance to live off. In following months, his body mass index plunged to 11.5 - much lower than the 'healthy' 18.5 to 24.9 - while his phobia prevented him from spending his remaining money on food, the inquest heard. Mr Wood's GP told Oxfordshire Coroners' Court that his patient was a 'vulnerable' individual who was unfit for work. Doctor Nicholas Ward, from the Bampton Medical Practice, said: 'He was an extremely vulnerable and fragile individual who was coping with life. Case: Mr Wood, who lived alone, had suffered from Asperger's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as a range of phobias, including a phobia of food, Oxfordshire Coroner's Court (above) heard . 'Something . pushed him or affected him in the time before he died and the only . thing I can put my finger on is the pressure he felt he was under when . his benefits were removed.' Dr Ward added that he had not been contacted by either Atos or the DWP about Mr . Wood’s medical history, and revealed that if he had been asked for his . professional opinion, he would have said his patient was unfit for work. Mr Wood’s mother, Jill Gant, from . Abingdon, told the inquest she had sent £250 to her son before he died on August 9 - 10 days after he was last seen. 'By then it was too late, he was so fragile and unstable,' she said. 'We didn’t realise how bad things were. Decision: Mr Wood passed away four months after he was deemed fit to work by Atos healthcare, which assesses people on behalf of the Department of Work and Pensions. Above, the DWP office at Caxton House . 'He found it difficult to accept help from his family because he tried to live independently so he gave the £250 away. He had a lot of problems but he was very gentle and sweet.' She added: 'Extreme stress and lack of money caused . by the removal of his benefits led to his eating problems.' Pathologist . Doctor Clare Verrill told the court a BMI below 13 could prove fatal - but added that Mr Wood's cause of death had not been established because his body had decomposed. Recording a narrative verdict, coroner Darren Salter said: 'Mr . Wood had an eating disorder and food phobia. It is likely that this . caused or contributed to his death as he was markedly underweight and . malnourished. 'I accept the evidence about something pushing him over the edge heard from GP Mr Ward. 'On the other hand, we do know cash was provided prior to death, but because of his phobias he didn’t use that cash to buy food.' Speaking after the inquest, Ms Gant said she and her relatives had arranged to meet Oxford West and Abingdon MP Nicola Blackwood to try to find out why Mr Wood was declared fit for work. Atos healthcare spokesman, Tessa David, said: 'Our thoughts are with the family of Mr Wood at this difficult time. 'We carry out the Government’s Work Capability Assessment as professionally and compassionately as possible.' DWP . spokesman, Ann Rimell, added: 'A decision on whether someone is well . enough to work is taken following a thorough assessment and after . consideration of all the supporting medical evidence from the claimant’s .

A butcher who was pressured to remove animal carcasses from his shop window has reinstated his display after a huge show of support from the general public. JBS Family Butchers in Sudbury, Suffolk, say they were forced to take down the display of rabbits, pigs and poultry after people threatened to stop using other nearby shops. But today staff put the animals back on display after a deluge of support from all over the world. Proud: The re-instated display at JBS Family Butchers in Sudbury, Suffolk, after they were inundated with support in response to a campaign which tried to force them to take the dead animals out of the window . What else do you expect at a butchers? The shop had been displaying half-butchered animals in its window for several years before two letters published in a local weekly paper led to their removal last week . Assistant manager Richard Nicholson said: 'We have had terrific support from almost everyone. 'Businesses have told us we bring shoppers in, so now hopefully we can go back to being traditional butchers.' The shop had been displaying half-butchered animals in its window for several years before two letters published in a local weekly paper led to their removal last week. One writer complaining about the shop window had claimed that the 'needless display of multiple mutilated carcasses' could frighten children. And following a a claim that shoppers would boycott nearby businesses because of the display, its owner John Sawyer decided that it would have to go to keep the peace. 'We pulled it out because we have to get on with the people in the precinct,' Mr Nicholson added.

'It's not neatly-wrapped little packages like you find supermarkets - customers know exactly what they are getting and where it has come from.' Mr Nicholson added: 'We've had such a positive response from all over the country and the world. It's been a little bit overwhelming, but the public has decided that it goes back in, so it's back in.'

'Unsavoury': Mark Stephenson, pictured outside Birmingham Magustrates' Court, was fined after admitting his offensive behaviour . A football fan who ripped up pages torn from a the Koran at a football match, and told a steward 'we hate Muslims' Middlesbrough fan Mark Stephenson, 25, was at an away game in Birmingham when he was handed pages of the Muslim holy book by a fellow supporter. He proceeded to rip up the pages, and gestured with a lighter as if he were about to set them on fire. The 'through and through fan', part of a group of 20 attending a championship game between Middlesbrough and Birmingham City, was asked by a steward what the book was. Stephenson, who had been drinking, replied: 'It's the Muslim Bible, we hate Muslims.' Stephenson, a season ticket holder, was fined £235 by magistrates, who heard he was 'shocked and appalled' at his own actions. The £22,000-a-year purchasing manager from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, committed the religiously-aggravated public order offence last December. The court heard a female fan handed out the pages from her handbag during the match. Other fans were shouting and chanting at . the time of the offence, and the words 'Koran, Muslims and burning' were overheard by a steward. Stephenson was also ordered to pay £105 costs and a £23 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Jonathan Purser told Birmingham Magistrates' Court that Stephenson, who has no previous convictions or cautions, was seen with a lighter, apparently pretending to set fire to some of the pages. Defence solicitor Ash Mistry told magistrates that his client, who also follows England abroad, had been drinking alcohol before the match and at half-time, and had very little recollection of his 'inflammatory' actions. Scroll down for video . Religious offence: Stephenson and his fellow fans were watching Middlesbrough play Birmingham City at the latter team's home ground (pictured) The lawyer told the court: 'He is in no way racist and he holds no racist views towards Muslims.' Stephenson was deeply remorseful for what was an isolated incident, Mr Mistry submitted. Offensive: Stephenson told a steward that the pages of the Koran (pictured) were torn because the fans 'hate Muslims' Magistrates decided not to impose a football banning order on Stephenson. Passing sentence, chairman of the bench Ronald Healy said: 'The incidents that we have had described to us are extremely unsavoury and extremely regrettable. 'We have looked at the references that have been provided by friends and your employer, and they do appear to confirm that you are generally of very good character, and that this incident is particularly out of your normal character.' He added: 'It's lucky in some respects that nothing occurred as a result of your actions. 'Incidents of this kind are considered extremely offensive to some members of the community. We hope that in the future you will not ever, ever participate in any such incident.' Stephenson, who went to court with company of his parents, was on the verge of tears as he left the building without comment. Two women from Middlesbrough charged in connection with events at the match both pleaded not guilty to a religiously aggravated public order offence.

A young man who brutally murdered a 73-year-old by stabbing him 22 times after the pensioner discovered him  breaking into his south London home has been sentenced to life. Aaron De Silva, 21, will serve a minimum of 32 years for the murder of Joseph Griffiths in his £1.5million home in Fulham, south London. De Silva had admitted the manslaughter of Joseph Griffiths, but denied murder. However he was found guilty of murdering the 73-year-old on Tuesday following a trial at the Old Bailey. Aaron De Silva, 21, (left) broke into the home of Joseph Griffiths (right) armed with a knife before carrying out the brutal attack. The 73-year-old was found lying in a pool of his own blood by his wife . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said . the 21-year-old, of Earls Court, south west London, was also sentenced . to 12 years to run consecutively after admitting aggravated burglary . armed with a lock knife. De Silva killed Mr Griffiths after he broke into the basement of the grandfather's six-storey house armed with a knife. The . victim of the 'brutal' attack was asleep with his wife at the time and . got out of bed to challenge the intruder in the hallway. He was then discovered in a pool of blood by his wife and a friend, who was visiting for a wedding. Prosecutor Brendan Finucane QC told the jury when he opened the trial: 'There were no eye witnesses but people were awoken by a completely brutal and overwhelming assault on an elderly man in his own home, where he was knifed 22 times to the body.' In the act: CCTV footage shows de Silva in the process of robbing the home before the murder . Weapon: The knife used during the brutal confrontation was found in the terraced house in south west London . After the attack De Silva was caught . on CCTV taking a 'cool, calm and collected walk' back to the Earls Court . hostel where he was staying to wash his clothes and get rid of . evidence, Mr Finucane said. He was arrested three days later. The . court heard that De Silva had gone into a number of gardens on the . street before stealing a pair of bolt croppers from a shed. Using . the tool, he broke a rear window on the basement level of Mr Griffiths’ nearby  terraced home and walked around the lower two levels. Mr Finucane said: 'Mr Griffiths must have been woken by the defendant coming in, must have challenged him in the hallway, outside his own bedroom door.' It was at this point, Mr Finucane said, De Silva carried out the 'brutal and overwhelming assault', stabbing him 22 times in his chest and abdomen. He added: 'This awoke his wife and friends, but by the time they got there he had left.' Mrs Griffiths found her husband lying on his back in a pool of blood. The front door was still locked, and Mr Hall found the rear basement door had been opened. Closure: Mark Griffiths said after the hearing that Mr Griffiths' friends and family felt a 'great sense of relief' Family: Simon, the victim's son, arriving at the Old Bailey . Paramedics tried to resuscitate Mr Griffiths, but he died in the house. Mr . Finucane said: 'Given the savagery of the attack on Mr Griffiths and . his behaviour before and after, there can be no doubt that he had the . intention to kill or cause really serious harm.' He . added: 'Anybody who stabs a person 22 times with a knife like that has . at the very least the intention to cause really serious harm, and . further you can be sure that he did it with the intention to kill the . deceased.' De Silva looked impassively as the verdict was read out. He is said to have 31 previous . convictions from the age of 12 to his arrest for the murder when he was . 19, for matters such as robbery, burglary and carrying a knife. Mr . Griffiths’ eldest son, Mark Griffiths, 53, said afterwards: 'There is a . great sense of relief for all the family, friends and customers of . Joe.' The victim had a car repair business in which his son still works. He added: 'We are overwhelmed with all the support we have had from the police, and very impressed with the way they’ve handled it from day one. 'We are very happy that the legal system of this country has proved to be one of the best in the world, as usual, and we have come to the correct verdict.' Scene: The brutal attack took place in a £1.5m six-storey terraced house in Fulham, south west London . In an impact statement written by Mark . Griffiths, on behalf of the family, which was read to the court, he . said: 'The murder of Joe in such a senseless manner has left a gaping . hole not just in our family, but every family who knew him.' The statement added: 'We as a family are living with the devastating consequences of that act of violence.' The trial judge, Timothy Pontius, sentenced De Silva’s father Emmanuel de Silva to 24 years’ imprisonment in 2002 for robbery. Court reports at the time said he was part of a gang that was responsible for a number of well planned and executed robberies in the London area between January 2000 and May 2001. The reports said that Emmanuel’s nephew, Orson de Silva, was jailed for 24 years for similar offences. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Simon Pickford, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'De Silva is an extremely violent individual who had no hesitation in stabbing the victim repeatedly in a frenzied and brutal attack after he was disturbed having broken into Mr Griffiths’ home. 'I must pay tribute to Mr Griffiths’ family who have been left utterly devastated by what happened. They have conducted themselves with the utmost restraint and dignity throughout this tragic incident and my and my team’s thoughts are with them.' CCTV showed De Silva back at his hostel around an hour after the murder listening to music, seemingly entirely unaffected by what he had just done. Mr Griffiths had two grown-up sons and seven grandchildren.","Aaron De Silva, 21, stabbed 73-year-old Joseph Griffiths 22 times .

Domenico Rancadore - known as The Professor - will have to wait until at least March 17 after his lawyers accused international authorities of an abuse of process. The 64-year-old, who is wanted to serve a seven-year jail term after he was convicted in 1999 of Mafia association and extortion in Trabia, near Palermo, was arrested on two European arrest warrants last August. Battle: Domenico Rancadore, pictured in a court sketch in August, has had a long fight against extradition . Prosecutors accuse him of fleeing Italy as he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections. But his counsel Alun Jones QC - one of Britain's top barristers -  told Westminster Magistrates' Court today that 'misrepresentation goes to the heart of this extradition case'. Mr Jones told the court the difference between the two arrest warrants amounted to a 'deliberate decision taken to prejudice this man's rights', because the level of crime had been elevated in the second warrant. Today Mr Jones said: 'If you can't trust a warrant then the integrity of the scheme is undermined.' He added the language in the current European arrest warrant is 'flowery'. Addressing senior district judge Howard Riddle, prosecutor Hannah Hinton said: 'I say that the evidence you've heard is inconsistent.' Fugitive: The 64-year-old, left, is wanted in Italy to serve seven years in jail. Right, his wife Anne last August . She said Rancadore had given 'conflicting accounts' in his evidence. Mr Jones said the Italian authorities 'refused to say' what prison Rancadore would be detained in, but Ms Hinton said that information is 'rarely given' anyway. Rancadore is in custody after the High Court overturned a magistrate's decision to grant bail in November. He suffers from angina and has had a stent fitted. Mr Riddle said: 'Mr Rancadore is not in good health.' He and his wife, Anne, moved to Britain with their two children in 1994 and lived under the name of Skinner, the maiden name of Mrs Skinner's British mother.

Madeleine Webster and her husband Stephen (pictured outside Liverpool Crown Court at an earlier hearing) admitted buying £160,000 worth of printer cartridges before selling them on eBay . A NHS administrator who bought £160,000 of printer cartridges with public money before selling them on eBay was jailed today. Madeleine Webster, 47, from Stoneycroft, Liverpool, spent years defrauding her own department by ordering printer cartridges and selling them online. The £160,000 she and her husband Stephen, 46, took from the NHS would have funded six full-time nursing posts, a court heard. The couple made around a £90,000 profit from the sales - using the money to fund holidays and buy luxurious items. Webster was sentenced to 26 months in jail and her husband 13 months at Liverpool Crown Court. The court heard how Webster, who was based in Wavertree had worked for the NHS For 22 years. Steve McNally, prosecuting, told the court how her plot was uncovered 'quite by chance' when she sent an email to friend and colleague Debbie Brown which linked to her eBay account. Her account contained a lot of references to printer ink cartridges being sold and positive feedback from buyers. Mr McNally, said: 'Having seen those references Ms Brown became concerned because she could recall several occasions when there had been a lot of ink cartridges at their office which had either not been required or had been placed for use in printers they did not even have.' Webster's boss Bernadine Lynam also recalled occasions she had been working late and saw Madeleine Webster and her husband Stephen, 46, removing items from the office via the fire door. Mr McNally, said: 'When asked about what was happening at the time she'd given accounts about correcting mistaken deliveries and the like herself, to minimise inconvenience to others. 'Mrs Lynham had taken that to be commendable and beyond the call of duty. With hindsight those incidents take on a very different presentation.' An investigation was launched. It was found that before Webster took over ordering ink cartridges the department spent about £2,500 a year. After it became her responsibility, the bill rocketed to £10,854 in 2008 to 2009, then to more than £27,000, £45,000 and finally £60,000 in the following years. Mr McNally said the total cost of the cartridges ordered came to £168,420 - although some of that figure would have been spent on legitimate use. He said the loss to the NHS amounted to between £155,000 and £160,000 - roughly six times her salary. In terms of profit generated through eBay and cash payments, she made a total of £90,318. Webster . used the money to pay for foreign holidays including trips via . Eurotunnel and P&O cruises, as well as being spent on shopping . channels, eating out, bingo and bookmakers. When . arrested she tried to talk her way out of it, saying that she had a . contact in Germany who built up a stockpile of printers which she then . sold on but she had lost contact with her. Mrs Webster was jailed for 23 months while her husband for 13 months today. The court heard how the money they spent on the cartridges could have paid for six full-time nursing posts . She also suggested that problems with the NHS orders were down to the mistakes of receptionists or computer errors, and others may have had access to her accounts, which were all lies. Webster later pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position and her husband, who admitted taking nearly £100,000 of pounds worth of cartridges to a customer in Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to possessing criminal property. Michael Lavery, defending Webster, said it was a sad but inevitable given her dishonest behaviour. He added: 'She finds it difficult to come to terms with the amount of money that's been spoken of in this case. Her lifestyle hasn't been changed as a result of this offending behaviour.' Adam Brown, defending Stephen Webster, said he had lost his career as an account manager, was 'ashamed and remorseful' and had only got involved to 'placate his wife and keep their marriage alive'. He added: 'The family may never recover from this offending.' Judge Graham Morrow sentenced Webster to 26 months in jail and Stephen Webster to 13 months. He said: 'You and your wife have fallen from a great height. Greed must have been the driving force for your offending. Your combined yearly income would have been of a level many many people could only dream of and yet they, unlike you, do not commit the type of crimes which you did.' He added: 'You abused your position of trust within the NHS. You did so repeatedly and over a long period of time. 'You knew from your time within the NHS that at the time you were committing offences the service was under financial pressure. I cannot say any particular front line health service was adversely affected by your actions but it will have put pressure on an already hard pressed service.'","Madeleine Webster, 47, from Stoneycroft, Liverpool, ordered £160,000 of printer cartridges online using public money .

Menace: John Worboys attacked numerous women between 2002 and 2008 as Scotland Yard's bungled investigation failed to track him down . More than 100 victims of 'black cab rapist' John Worboys could sue Scotland Yard over its botched investigation into the menace after two women won a landmark case. The anonymous victims, attacked in 2003 and 2007, successfully claimed their human rights had been breached by the Metropolitan Police for failing to catch Worboys during his six year rampage across London. Worboys, a former porn actor and stripper, attacked numerous women during a five-year period between 2002 and 2008. The 53-year-old offered the women cheap lifts home after nights out but spiked their drinks before carrying out the assaults. Police also found a 'rape kit' in the back of his taxi which including sleeping tablets, condoms and gloves. Worboys, who called himself Terry the Minder, was jailed indefinitely in April 2009 with a minimum tariff of eight years. But today, the two women - referred to as DSD and NBV - were awarded a High Court order for . compensation from the Metropolitan Police under Article 3 of the Human Rights Act, . which relates to inhuman treatment. Mr . Justice Green at London’s High Court ruled that the Met was liable to hundreds of women for failures in its investigation and poor treatment of victims. DSD told the court she suffered from depression as a result of her . treatment by officers during the 2003 investigation. NBV claimed . that she suffered serious distress, anxiety, guilt and an exacerbation . of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after her experience of the investigation in 2007. Speaking on behalf of other victims, they accused the Met of allowing Worboys to run free and reoffend for an unacceptable amount of time. Mr Justice Green said: 'In this case I have identified a series of . systemic failings which went to the heart of the failure of the police . to apprehend Worboys and cut short his five- to six-year spree of . violent attacks.' He berated senior officers for failing to train . relevant officers in the intricacies of drug-facilitated sexual assaults and failing to supervise junior detectives. He also attacked detectives for not making use of intelligence sources to find links between the cases. Other . failures included losing the confidence of victims and not creating an environment where victims felt comfortable to express their ordeals. Landmark ruling: The High Court ruled in favour of the women who will now receive compensation and pave the way for more than 100 more victims to make claims . The judge said Worboys was clinical and conniving and the effect upon the women was profound. 'In . the cases of DSD and NBV, I received evidence about the trauma they . experienced at the time and subsequently, and have read the psychiatric . reports upon them,' he said. 'I have learned that the effects of the . assaults have stayed with them in a variety of ways over the ensuing . years, manifesting themselves in depression, feelings of guilt, anxiety, . and an inability to sustain relationships, including sexual . relationships. 'That trauma has to be multiplied one hundred fold, . and more, to begin to have a sense of the pain and suffering that . Worboys’ serial predatory behaviour exerted upon his many victims. 'But . their feelings are not the end of this circle of misery because, as was . evident from the psychiatric and other evidence, the effects rippled . throughout the victims’ families and their respective circles of . friends.' He said the Met was liable to both women for breach of the . Human Rights Act in relation to the period between 2003 - which . coincided with the first complaint to police - and 2009, when Worboys . was tried. Attacks: This is an image, released by Metropolitan Police, of the taxi he used to drug and attack the women . In a statement, the Metropolitan . Police Service said: 'The MPS has previously apologised for mistakes . made in the investigation of rapes committed by Worboys. 'The . judge acknowledged that the failings in this case were very much . historic; a recognition that in the interim we have made important and . significant changes to the way we investigate rape, which remains one of . the most challenging and complex policing issues. We are committed to . providing the best possible service to victims, ensuring that they are . at the heart of every investigation. 'We will now take time to consider the judgment in full.' DSD . said later: 'After 11 years of living with guilt, I can now finally . start to put it all behind me and move on with my life. I have always . felt responsible for what happened to Worboys’ other victims but I now . know this was not my fault. 'What I am now responsible for, and am extremely proud of, is making the Met finally accept they have a duty towards victims.' NBV . added: 'The experience of being disbelieved by the police was almost . worse than the rape itself. It’s been unbearably hard to bring this case . and spend years going over the same events. 'I am so relieved that our efforts have finally resulted in justice.'

According to chef Alan Lavender, who worked at Chequers from 1986 until 2010, Sir John served the Queen warm marinated salmon before presenting her with a jar of home-made Chequers chutney.

Despicable: Monty Croke Sr, pictured, was jailed for five years for an eight-years swindle on a pensioner . A conman and his two sons swindled a pensioner with Parkinson's Disease out of more than £250,000 in what officers say is one of the most despicable frauds they have ever seen. Monty Croke, 46, took £170,000 from the vulnerable man to build a holiday cottage - but instead of selling it and passing the proceeds to the victim, he lived in it himself. As the con unfolded over eight years his sons Monty Jr and Billy, joined by accomplice James Coverdale, swindled the man for around £80,000 more by carrying out shoddy, unnecessary repairs on his home. Eventually the men were tracked down when the victim's worried carer alerted the authorities and officers started probing their bank accounts. In hours of covert footage they watched the men at work - including stationing a helicopter high above the cottage to track their movements. They discovered the victim from Malton, North Yorkshire, was just one of a string of more than a dozen vulnerable people defrauded by the men. Others included a 70-year-old man who lost £12,200 and a woman in her 80s suffering from dementia who lost more than £18,000. They also took over £26,000 from a couple in their 80s and 90s, most of which came in just an eight-week period. A further 12 victims were also defrauded of a total of £30,772. The scams saw the men carrying out low-budget repairs on the victims' homes which were not needed in the first place. Monty Croke Sr, 46, from Pickering, North Yorkshire, his sons Monty Jr, 26, and Billy, 23, from Knareborough, and James Coverdale, 35, from Pickering, all admitted conspiring to defraud householders. Conmen: Croke Sr's sons Monty Jr (left) and Billy (right) were both jailed for their part in the scheme. Croke Jr, 26, was jailed for two and a half years and Billy, 23, was jailed for 12 months. A fourth offender avoided jail . The men also admitted paying victims' cheques into their bank accounts. Croke Sr and Billy Croke admitted three counts each and Croke Jr and Coverdale admitted two counts each of converting criminal property. Yet even the worst offender in the scam could be released in just two and a half years. Monty Croke Sr was jailed for five years, Monty Croke Jnr for two and a half years and Billy Croke for 12 months. Coverdale avoided jail as he received a 15-month prison term suspended for two years. The victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I was completely taken in. Monty David Croke befriended me and he then betrayed my friendship. It was all one big lie. 'I hope this case serves as a warning to others about the dangers of doorstep callers and that it helps prevent others from being defrauded in the way I have been.' Holiday home: Trading standards investigators used a helicopter to obtain evidence the men were working on the holiday cottage, pictured. The swindle went on for eight years before a carer caught on . His family said in a statement: 'It is difficult to comprehend the callousness of the people who inveigle their way into the lives of vulnerable people, groom them and often leave them in dire financial difficulties. 'It was only the vigilance of our brother’s carer that uncovered this matter and brought it to the attention of the authorities. Our family is indebted to her for all her care and kindness.' North Yorkshire County Council's trading standards department began the investigation in October 2012. Officers said the case against the Parkinson’s sufferer was the worst case of repeat victimisation they had ever encountered. Sentencing them at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, Judge Tony Briggs said: 'The elderly and vulnerable are a growing part of our community, and frequently have vaulable assets which are attractive to the ruthless and greedy.' He said Croke Snr had stripped the Malton victim of his assets and 'played him in a cunning and devious way.' Cheat: Monty Croke Jr pictured on a vulnerable victim's roof in covert footage shot by Trading Standards officers. They said the work he was doing was completely unnecessary . County Councillor Chris Metcalfe, executive member for trading standards, said: 'We are sadly getting used to investigating cases of this nature in trading standards. 'But this case has been shocking and distressing, even to those of us who are hardened to this type of appalling and heartless crime. 'That offenders such as these can undertake the ruthless exploitation of vulnerable adults in this way, often for prolonged periods, is disgusting and abhorrent.' Consumer Minister Jenny Willott said: 'The sentences handed down today send out a clear message to those looking to break the law – we will catch you and bring you to justice. 'Reporting unscrupulous traders to the authorities is vital to catching rogues like these. Anyone with concerns about possible conmen should ring the Citizens Advice Consumer helpline on 08454 04 05 06. 'Trading Standards can then investigate claims against rogue businesses, take court action if necessary and make sure consumers get a fair deal.'","Monty Croke, 46, and his sons Monty Jr, 26, and Billy, 23, were all jailed .

Energy firms have held on to more than £400million belonging to customers who have closed their accounts, it emerged today. The Big Six suppliers have now been ordered to do more to return the cash to 3.5million families and 300,000 businesses. Consumer groups condemned the ‘appalling’ behaviour by gas and electricity companies. More than 3.5million households and 300,000 businesses are owed more than £400million from closed accounts . Energy watchdog Ofgem said the industry had not done enough to pay back money built up by customers paying by direct debit. When they move house or switch supplier, money left in their account has not been returned by British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, Npower, EDF and Eon. According to Ofgem the biggest firms hold £202million built up in household bills and £204million from non-domestic customers. The crackdown comes after a surge in customers switching firms to find better deals without realising they were owed money by their old supplier. Ofgem boss Andrew Wright said: ‘When many people are struggling to make ends meet, it is vital that energy companies do the right thing and do all they can to return this money and restore consumer trust. Ofgem's Andrew Wright called on energy firms to 'do the wright thing' and return the money . ‘We want to see decisive action by suppliers, individually and collectively, to address this issue and, wherever possible, to ensure that the balances they currently hold are returned to consumers.’ He added that where the money cannot be returned it should be used to benefit consumers more generally. Ofgem found wide variation in the way companies dealt with the money, and how easy it was for customers to get it back. Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ‘It's appalling that firms have been sitting on hundreds of millions of pounds of customers' money, making little effort to return it. Hard-pressed households who are struggling to get by and businesses feeling the pressure on their finances would benefit from the money being in their pockets not their energy company's bank account. ‘Suppliers do not hold the purse strings of households in this country. If they have people's money they should return it as soon as possible.’ Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said:  ‘If true, it's shocking that some of the biggest energy companies are sitting on millions of pounds worth of consumers' cash. ‘Suppliers must return this money as soon as possible and be clear about what customers need to do when they close accounts.’ Ofgem has told the Big Six to do more to reunite individual customers with their money, tell people how the money is being used and improve communication to prevent it happening again. British Gas alone held £40million in closed accounts, but the company insisted that the company was owed £200million by customers. Ian Peters, managing director of residential energy, said: “British Gas will always provide a full and immediate refund to customers for any sum owing to them, whenever we can contact them. ‘Even if they are owed as little as a pound, we will always give them their money back, no matter how long ago they left us.’ Since 2012, British Gas has sent more than 32,000 letters, made 18,000 outbound calls and received over 16,000 calls, successfully returning money to 10,000 customers, he added.

Two women have been killed in attacks at lawyers' offices in Düsseldorf, west Germany today. The victims were struck down in two separate attacks, and police later arrested a 48-year-old Shanghai-born man who they said had dealings with both offices. The fatal attacks took place within 90 minutes of each other, at two separate lawyers' offices, and also saw two men injured. Killings: Police officers are seen at one of the lawyers' offices where a woman died after a man who allegedly had dealings with the lawyers attacked . The first attack took place at a lawyers' office in Düsseldorf, where a man stabbed a woman to death and injured a man, before reportedly also using a firearm and then set a fire, prosecutor Christoph Kumpa told reporters. The suspect had a dispute with a lawyer in the office, police later confirmed, but did not reveal the identity of the victim. About 90 minutes later, a lawyer's assistant was shot dead at an office in Erkrath, some nine miles away, and another man was injured. According to police, the arrested man's legal case had been referred to the Erkrath office. Security forces: Police officers guard a street near the Düsseldorf lawyer's office where the first woman was killed around midday . Captured: A Shanghai-born 48-year-old man was later arrested on suspicion of carrying out both killers, and he later confessed to the attacks . Under arrest: It is believed that the male suspect had dealings with both of the lawyers's offices . Police launched a massive manhunt and arrested the man Friday afternoon in Goch, near the Dutch border, after he forced his way into a pizza restaurant - setting off a scuffle in which two people were lightly injured. Kumpa said the suspect apparently had a score to settle with the restaurant's owner. Officials identified the suspect only as Yanquing T., in keeping with German privacy rules. They said the 48-year-old, who was born in Shanghai and lived in Düsseldorf, admitted the attacks.","Two women killed in separate incidents at lawyers' offices in Düsseldorf .

The 55-year-old denied she was very drunk and swearing profusely during . a Valentine's night dinner, but freely admitted she was ‘eccentric, extroverted . and loud, even when sober.’ Ms Bothroyd outside the Bay Hotel in Teignmouth which she bought for about £1.5-million from a £2-million nest egg she built up as a lawyer . The review left on Tripadvisor said: 'Basil Fawlty is the perfect host compared to this place' The TripAdvisor reviewer, only identified as Michael W of . Torquay, said he booked in for a Valentine and wedding anniversary weekend. When they went down for dinner, a woman who had . earlier been in the bar ‘intoxicated, loud and swearing like a trooper’, was . also in the restaurant with a man they assumed was her partner. ‘While waiting for our meal the very drunk lady staggered . over and tried to communicate to us that the lighting was too dark and should . be brighter, She turned a lamp on, almost falling into my wife’s lap and in the . process knocking a picture off the wall. ‘So while we were eating our meal, which was really good, we . were “entertained” by our fellow diner dropping things on the floor, shouting . at her partner and generally becoming annoying. The 55-year old conceded that around 50 per cent of the review could be true . ‘After a short while she grew tired of waiting for her meal, . so she went downstairs to the kitchen and promptly began a barrage of foul . mouthed abuse. After a few minutes of very industrial language she left the . building, the very embarrassed waiter / manager came in to apologise for her . behaviour and said that unfortunately it was not unusual as she was the owner. ‘Well I didn’t see that coming. However, she was gone from . the building and we finished our lovely meal in peace.’ The reviewer continued that they were kept awake by loud . music from the bar during the night, and he had to go down at 2.30am to ask for . it to be turned off. During breakfast, the owner was in the bar ‘looking better . than I was feeling’. They left for another hotel after refusing to pay for the . dinner, claiming their anniversary weekend had been ruined. He did praise the . staff saying they ‘deserved a medal.’ Shown the review, Ms Bothroyd, responded she had ‘no . specific recollection’ of everything said to have occurred, but pointed out . that her ‘partner’ was in fact her 24 year-old son, on a visit from China where . he lives. ‘Of course I had a few drinks - I was excited to see him and . we had a great time. I can be a bit raucous, but I was not drunk. The owner of the Bay Horse said the review could have been left by a disgruntled member of staff . ‘I did have strong words with the kitchen because we were . waiting too long for our dinner, and I told them in no uncertain terms that it . was not good enough. ‘I do know that some former staff who left have been . spreading all sorts of nasty rumours about me and the hotel, claiming that we . are closing, that I’ve had a nervous breakdown and staff are walking out.

I never read these online things.’ She said she has lost £2,000 in cancelled bookings since the scathing review - which she calls ""The Valentine's Day Massacre"". Ms Bothroyd, who spent 30 years at the top of her profession . handling many high profile cases, bought the Bay for about £1.5million from a . £2million nest egg she built up as a lawyer. ‘I looked at 37 hotels in Devon and Cornwall, because I . wanted something to do in my retirement and the money was earning very little . in interest.

Carol Payne stole £11,500 from a private school's minibus fund to pay school fees at the institution . A mother stole £11,500 from a private school's minibus fund – to pay a child’s tuition fees at the institution. Carol Payne, 31, used her role as treasurer of the parent-teacher association at Highclare School, in Birmingham, to steal from the group’s bank account. Birmingham Magistrates’ Court heard Payne, who was chosen for the PTA role because of her background in accountancy, used the money to pay for fees at the school, which charges almost £11,000 a year for secondary education. Jason Corden-Bowen, prosecuting, said Payne, of Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, ignored requests for bank statements from fellow PTA members. But she was caught when volunteers who deposited cash into the Lloyds account discovered it contained just £8,000 – around £10,000 less than expected. Mr Corden-Bowen said: ‘The PTA was established as a charitable organisation, a charity run by the parents at the school who organised events for raising funds for various things. ‘Most recently they were trying to raise funds for a school minibus.’ Mr Corden-Bowen said Payne had sole responsibility and access of the accounts when she became treasurer in September 2012. He said she was chosen because she was an accountant or former accountant and could ‘bring that experience to the charity’. But he said it later emerged there were ‘a number of payments and transfers which appeared not to make any sense and appeared to have gone to the defendant’s own business’. Mr Corden-Bowen said Payne met other PTA members and the matter was reported to the police. She admitted stealing the cash and spending it on bills and tuition fees at the school. The court heard she ‘felt bad’ about what she had done. Payne used the money she stole to pay fees at Highclare School, which cost up to around £11,000 a year . Mike O’Mahoney, defending, said Payne had fully co-operated with the police. Magistrates sent to the case to Birmingham Crown Court. Payne, who was given unconditional bail, was told to appear there on March 26. Highclare has three bases in Erdington and Sutton Coldfield and offers places for children from nursery age through to sixth form.

Military chiefs are fighting to save the grave of a First World War soldier called Private Ryan after a giant sinkhole opened up in a cemetery. The body of the serviceman who died aged 40 has been lost after the 20ft deep hole appeared in the spot where his body was laid to rest. Private Francis Ryan, who served in the 3rd Battalion, King's Liverpool Regiment, died in England in July 1915. Sinkhole: The remains of Private Francis Ryan have been swallowed up by a giant sinkhole that opened up beneath his war grave in Pembroke Dock Military Cemetery . Final resting place: Private Ryan's grave has lain undisturbed in the corner of this cemetery for nearly a century after he died in England during the First World War in 1915 . Recovery: The sinkhole in Pembroke Dock Military Cemetery is going to be filled up with grout to stop the headstone being lost . His army unit never served on the frontline during the First World War, and it is thought the serviceman may have died after an accident during a training exercise. Officials have so far been unable to trace relatives of the army volunteer - and only limited records about Private Ryan remain. His body had lain undisturbed in a quiet corner of a cemetery in Pembroke Dock, west Wales, underneath a Scots Pine for nearly a century after his death in England. But a 20ft-deep sinkhole has now swallowed up the spot where his coffin lay - leaving his military headstone teetering on the edge. A team of Ministry of Defence officials are now battling to rescue Private Ryan’s remains ready for the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War in August. Pembroke Dock district Parade Marshal David Boswell said: 'The graveyard is a monument to the Army, Navy and Artillery stationed here during the First World War. 'But unfortunately Mother Nature has taken over and when she opens up her body there is not much you can do. 'It’s a shame it’s happened but the MoD have looked into it and are trying to restore the grave to its original condition as soon as possible. Regiment: The 3rd Battalion Kings Liverpool Regiment which Private Ryan served in is seen here parading on Margate seafront in 1915. It is unclear exactly where and how Private Ryan died .

'We will be holding a service of remembrance in August to mark the centenary and it will be nice to have the cemetery back to its best so we can remember our fallen.' The MoD has so far failed to trace a living relative of Private Ryan - who was born in Longford, Ireland, in 1875. He died aged 40 on July 23, 1915, while serving in the reserve 3rd Battalion, Kings Liverpool Regiment, and stationed in Pembroke Dock, West Wales. His soldier number was 3/10511. The 6ft-wide and 20ft-deep sinkhole has left a gaping circular hole in the ground with only rocks and tree roots visible to visitors of the war cemetery. Sinkhole: The MoD has so far failed to trace a living relative of Private Ryan - who was born in Longford, Ireland, in 1875 . Final resting place: The sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone beneath Private Ryan's grave - and his remains are hidden beneath the fallen mud and rubble . Five other military graves are in danger beside the sinkhole with the names J O’Brien, Private J McGuiness, Gunner William Henry Hurley, Private Charles Joseph Duffy and Private E Sullivan. The cemetery is the final resting place for 23 Commonwealth service personnel from the First World War and 51 from the Second World War. It was closed for several months until a protective metal fence was erected around the six 'at risk' graves last week. The sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone beneath Private Ryan’s grave - and his remains are hidden beneath the fallen mud and rubble. An MoD spokeswoman said they want to avoid exhuming Private Ryan and plan to fill the sinkhole with grout mixture to stop his headstone falling in. She said: 'Work to fill in the sink hole is due to begin this week and is expected to be completed by the end of March. 'The chosen option does not involve any exhumation and the MoD is confident that work will be effective. 'However in the extremely unlikely event that the option chosen is not effective the MOD will have to consider other options some of which may involve exhumation. 'We are in the process of trying to locate relatives of those buried in affected plots. 'But it is believed the graves date back to the early part of the 20th century so it may be difficult to trace any descendants.'","The remains of Private Francis Ryan have been swallowed by the sinkhole .

A council clerk who stole £162,000 from taxpayers to fund her 'shopping addiction' was today ordered to pay back less than half. Patricia Bell, 58, was jailed for 28 months last year after a judge heard she used a special pen to forge cheques while working at Whitehill Town Council in Hampshire. She tricked councillors she worked for into thinking they were signing legitimate cheques after she had written the correct name using a fabric pen. Patricia Bell will have to pay back £70,684 of the £162,000 she stole - just 44 per cent . But Bell - who earned £46,000 a year - would then remove the name by heating the ink and replace it with her details. She used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays, Winchester Crown Court heard. But today a judge ordered her to pay back just £70,684 at a confiscation hearing - 44 per cent of that stolen. The married mum-of-two paid £110,000 of altered cheques into her account and transferred another £45,000 of additional cheques including extra salary payments. Bell also claimed £7,000 worth of expenses including food shopping bills, receipts, and eBay purchases - taking the total to £162,000. She used the money, which she stole over five years, to fuel her 'shopping addiction' which enabled her to pay for holidays, handbags and nail manicures. Sentencing judge Linda Sullivan said: 'I . have no doubt that you maximised the ease of how you were able to take . this money and you did so in a sophisticated fashion.' If she fails to settle the bill in six months she will be jailed for a further year. Once councillors identified financial irregularities an internal investigation was launched and Bell was forced to attend a meeting with senior councillors. She admitted the allegations were true and was suspended for potential gross misconduct. The council then commissioned an independent investigator to ascertain the facts of the financial irregularities. On February 18, 2013, the council dismissed Bell on the grounds she abused procedures to pay herself by falsifying reports, accounts and expense claims. She used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays, Winchester Crown Court heard . Bell was then arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position. Anthony Rimmer, defending, claimed his client had worked hard in the public sector up until the incidents that took place from 2007. He said: 'Mrs Bell had spent 37 years working in the public sector, working for Action for Children and other district councils. 'It was only until she turned 53 that she started doing this.

The taxpayer funded £140million in bonuses to civil servants last year, despite government promises to crackdown on Whitehall pay deals. Treasury minister Danny Alexander vowed to end bonuses for ‘run of the mill performance’ as George Osborne cut billions from department’s budgets. But new figures reveal that in some agencies and quangos every single member of staff received a bonus worth thousands of pounds. Payouts: In the last year civil servants have received £140million in bonuses, despite deep cuts in Whtiehall . The pay-outs were condemned as unfair irresponsible by unions and MPs at a time when the government was demanding austerity. The Cabinet Office revealed that 160,000 civil servants, around 40 per cent of the total workforce, received bonuses last year, costing the taxpayer £140million. Some of the pay-outs were worth up to £62,000 with most receiving several hundred pounds. A quarter of the 3,600 senior civil servants shared bonuses worth £8.6million alone. Mark Sewotka, head of the PCS union which represents junior staff, said: ‘These bonuses are unfair, favour the highest paid and are often discriminatory. ‘The civil service bonus system should be scrapped entirely with the money put back into basic pay to give everyone a proper pay rise.’ The biggest bonus bill was at the Department for Work and Pensions, where almost £45million was paid out to nine in 10 staff. Treasury minister Danny Alexander promised to end payouts for run of the mill performance . More than 60 senior officials received an average of £10,000, despite mounting criticism of the department’s handling of benefits reforms. A spokesman insisted the average bonus for staff earning less than £25,000 was between £500 and £600. ‘Those frontline staff ensure that the welfare system runs day in, day out for the benefit of millions of citizens’, he added. The Ministry of Defence gave officials bonuses worth £24millon. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - under pressure over its response to the winter floods - paid £2.6million. The Met Office, which predicted a 'drier than usual' winter before being hit by the wettest winter on record, paid out £1.5million . The Department of Education spent £1.7million, Department for International Development £1.2million, Department of Health £900,000, Department for Transport £1.2million, Department for Energy and Climate £250,000 and Communities and Local Government £210,000. Labour MP John Mann told the Mirror: 'There is a culture deep-rooted in banking , which has spread into this government, of seeing huge bonuses as justifiable and necessary. They are not. 'Across the country people work hard without receiving a large bonus and it is their taxes that are paying for the latest greedy bonuses. 'George Osborne needs to curb the culture of excessive bonuses.' In 2012 the coalition announced a crackdown on rewards for failure. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said at the time: ‘This is not about getting rid of performance pay. It is about making sure that performance pay is there for genuine excellence and not just run-of-the-mill performance.’ But last year’s £140million bonus pot was only £7million lower than the previous 12 months. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Since 2010 the government has restricted performance related payments for senior civil servants to the top 25 per cent of performers, saving the taxpayer around £15 million. They are only paid to reward excellence.’","Almost 40% of all officials were given a bonus last year, new figures show .

Dozens of children and members of staff at a secondary school in Essex have been treated for chemical inhalation after a GCSE science experiment went wrong. Ambulances were called to St Mary's Catholic School in Bishop's Stortford this morning after a classroom filled with noxious gasses, apparently after a pupil accidentally overheated a chemical. At least 33 people received medical attention after complaining of bronchial inflammation following the incident, with two adults and a child taken to hospital for further treatment. Evacuated: Ambulances were called to St Mary's Catholic School in Bishop's Stortford (pictured) after a classroom filled with noxious gasses, apparently after a pupil accidentally overheated a chemical . A spokesperson for East of England Ambulance Service said: 'The ambulance service was called to an incident at 11.15am at St Maryâ€™s Catholic School in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire to reports of up to 33 patients complaining of bronchial inflammation due to suspected chemical inhalation.' 'The Trust has a number of resources on scene including the hazardous area response team, two paramedic response cars, two ambulance officers, an ambulance and a community first responder,' they added. 'The first response was on scene in five minutes, with an ambulance being on scene within nine minutes.Two patients have been taken to hospital, both adults with minor conditions. Officers are currently treating those who are still at the scene, with seven patients with minor complaints,' the statement went on to say. Speaking to the Hertfordshire and Essex Observer, Emmanuel Bonich, assistant head at St Maryâ€™s, confirmed the cause was an experiment and said the classroom was evacuated and ventilated as soon as the chemical substance was noticed. Accident: The incident is believed to have occurred after a GCSE student accidentally overheated a chemical during a classroom experiment (file image) He said: 'It was a science experiment. As part of the experiment one of the chemicals was heated for too long by one of the students and resulted in some gas being released. The classroom was evacuated and ventilated.' He added: 'We immediately called for the assistance of the emergency services. Every single class member was given a check over, as were members of staff. So far everyone has been given the OK.' 'Two members of staff have gone to hospital as a precaution and for further checks and a parent has taken a pupil to hospital for further checks.' In 2009, 48 St Mary's Catholic School pupils escaped uninjured after a school bus caught fire on the busy A414 road near Hadhams. Older students were forced to help younger pupils get off the bus after it burst into flames. At the time parents said they had been complaining about health and safety issues surrounding the school bus for months, but nothing had been done.","Pupils at St Mary's Catholic School were evacuated after chemical incident .

A coroner has recommended that dangerous lakes are dyed black or ringed with stinging nettles to discourage swimmers, after hearing how two people drowned at a beauty spot on the same day. Ryan Pettengell, 41, and Umar Balogun, 16, drowned in separate incidents at Bawsey Pits in Norfolk on July 16 last year after going swimming on a hot summer's day. Swimming is banned in the waters because of dangerous, near-invisible weeds growing below the surface but warning signs are often ignored. Danger: Ryan Pettengell, 41, and Umar Balogun, 16, drowned in separate incidents at Bawsey Pits in Norfolk (pictured) on a hot summer's day last year. A coroner has recommended the lakes are dyed black . Tragic: Police officers stand guard at Bawsey Pits the day after Ryan Pettengell and Umar Balogun drowned last year. Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake said the water must be made less attractive to swimmers . At an inquest into Mr Pettengell's death, Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake said the water at Bawsey Pits should be dyed black to make it less attractive to swimmers. She said other options could include 'aggressively' planting nettles and having warning signs in foreign languages so there could be no mistaking the danger. The Norwich inquest heard how Mr Pettengell, from Kings Lynn, Norfolk, drowned as he tried to swim to an island to join his girlfriend Lauren Cole. Ms Cole told the hearing how she watched Mr Pettengell get into difficulties, then swam out to help. She said: 'I saw him swim about half way and then he began to slow down. He said in a breathless voice 'Get me a stick, get me a log'.' She said: 'I ripped off a branch and swam out to him. I held the branch but it wouldn't float...I grabbed his arm and started to pull him. I was being pulled under and I had to swim back to the side.' Location: Bawsey Pitt is a beauty spot close to the town of King's Lynn in northern Norfolk . Hidden danger: Swimming is banned at Bawsey Pits because of near-invisible weeds below the surface . 'As I swam back I could see him going under. I looked back and I saw the bubbles where Ryan had been.' Police and fire teams were called but the police officers at the scene were unable to help as they were not strong enough swimmers, the inquest heard. Mr Pettengell's body was eventually recovered by fire crews around 7.30pm that night - two hours before Mr Balogun's was recovered from a nearby lake. Emergency services were at Bawsey Pits searching for Mr Balogun when they were alerted to Mr Pettengell's disappearance. A postmortem later confirmed that 16-year-old Mr Balogun, who was originally from Waltham Forest in London but had been living in Ely, Cambridgeshore, also died by drowning. Signs: Swimmers continually ignore warning signs at Bawsey Pits. Coroner Jacqueline Lake suggested the waters are circled by stinging nettles to prevent swimmers accessing them . Speaking outside the inquest earlier in the week, Mr Pettengell's best friend Wesley Moule, who was also with him on the day he died, told the BBC: 'He was the sort of guy that if he knew someone was in trouble, he would have gone out of his way to help them out.' He said Mr Pettengell was a good swimmer and had thought he was joking when he first appeared to be in trouble. 'As soon as he didn't come back up again we realised that he wasn't and that something was seriously wrong'. Last summer a Blue Lagoon in Derbyshire was dyed black to deter swimmers from entering the toxic water.","Ryan Pettengell, 41, and Umar Balogun, 16, drowned in separate incidents .

The parents of a five-month-old boy who died from rickets after they neglected his care because of their religious beliefs were jailed today. Seventh Day Adventists Nkosiyapha Kunene, 36, and his wife Virginia, 32, from Erith, Kent, who admitted the manslaughter of their son Ndingeko, received three years and two years, three months' imprisonment respectively. The couple admitted the charge at earlier hearings. Mr Justice Singh, at the Old Bailey, said: ‘The secular courts of this country apply the secular law of the land. They do so equally to all who come before them. The law respects the right of everyone to freedom of thought and belief. ‘However the right to manifest one's religion is not absolute. It is limited in particular by the rights of others. The state has a particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young child is concerned.’ The death of a baby boy from rickets arose from the religious beliefs of parents Nkosiyapha Kunene (right) and his wife, Virginia (left), a court heard today. The couple have admitted the manslaughter of their son, Ndingeko . The judge said Ndingeko was born on January 1 2012 and died in June 14 that year. He was found to have been suffering from rickets resulting from severe Vitamin D deficiency. The court heard the child was born at Darent Valley Hospital, Dartford. From birth, he had medical problems, and the judge said it was emphasised on behalf of the couple that the vitamin D deficiency was not diagnosed at that stage, nor was Virginia Kunene given advice about taking supplements. The mother did not attend a scheduled check up on March 8 and Ndingeko was not seen by a health care professional from then on to the day he died. Mr Justice Singh, at the Old Bailey, said: 'The state has a particularly important duty to protect the right to life, especially when a young child is concerned' From April it was appreciated by the couple that their son was unwell, although his health fluctuated over the next two months. ‘It is clear that, because of their own religious beliefs, the defendants did not in fact seek medical assistance.’ Richard Whittam QC told Mr Justice Singh at the couple’s sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey that, . although their beliefs arose out of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, . that church does not approve of medical care being withheld. The couple . admitted the charge at earlier hearings. Mr Whittam, prosecuting, said the case arose out of religious belief, the overarching belief held principally by Nkosiyapha Kunene that there was a God in Heaven who would guide the family when it came to any matter that affected life. He said: ‘There is no suggestion of any ill treatment in the conventional way of neglect or cruelty, it is a neglect to seek proper medical care and then to call medical care at the end.’ The child was born on January 1 2012 and died on June 14 that year, and was suffering from rickets, resulting from a severe Vitamin D deficiency, the court heard. ‘There was, throughout the better part of pregnancy and into early life, a rejection of either medical advice or advice from relatives to seek medical advice,’ Mr Whittam said. Nkosiyapha was baptised into the Seventh Day Adventist Church in 2000 and in 2009 was recommended to be a delegate to its South England Conference. Mr Whittam told Mr Justice Singh at the couple's sentencing hearing that, although their beliefs arose out of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, that church does not approve of medical care being withheld . ‘He was highly regarded in the church,’ counsel said. A . senior figure in the church had said that the couple’s views, as . reported to him by police investigating the case, were perhaps the most . extreme that he had ever encountered. Mr . Whittam said: ‘The reality is that had rickets been diagnosed earlier, . and appropriate treatment given, there could have been a complete . recovery, and therefore the death was avoidable.’ Nkosiyapha remains of the view that death was God’s will, counsel said. Kerim . Fuad QC, defending Nkosiyapha Kunene, said: ‘This court will rarely . have before it such a gentle, humble and hitherto law-abiding peaceful . couple.’ He said his client could be a responsible, adoring and essentially wonderful father. The attraction of a suspended custodial sentence, with a lengthy supervision requirement, was obvious. ‘The loss of their son haunts them, and will do, for the rest of their lives. They don’t expect that pain to pass.’ He added: ‘The covenant he (Nkosiyapha) had sworn with God blinded his objectivity and common sense.’ Nkosiyapha, who was working as a nurse at King’s College Hospital, did not reject medical treatment outright. ‘He simply believes that a large amount of modern medicine is procedural and formulaic. He believes medicines are given to patients without much thought as to whether they are appropriate to a particular case.’ Mr Whittam told the Old Bailey that, although their beliefs arose out of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, that church does not approve of medical care being withheld . Mr Fuad said the baby was discharged from the hospital at Darent Valley without his mother being given the essential Vitamin D that she desperately needed. She is a vegan, and more starved of Vitamin D than most, Mr Fuad said. Had the Vitamin D deficiency been diagnosed, the parents would have been alert to the need to be vigilant. But the Vitamin D levels were not tested until after the child’s death. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins, defending Virginia Kunene, said: ‘Nobody could fail to be moved by this tragedy. Or the suffering of that baby’s mother. ‘She has confronted the reality that she failed the child, by virtue of her view that it would be a breach of a covenant made between her, her husband and their God, and an abandonment of her sincerely-held religious views.’ Rickets is caused by a lack of Vitamin D and calcium and can cause deformities . Rickets is a disease, which affects . bone development in children. The condition causes bones to become soft . and weak, leading to deformities. In adults the disease is referred to as osteomalacia or soft bones. The . most common cause of rickets is a lack of Vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D is essential for children to form strong bones and comes from . exposure to sunlight. It is also found in oily foods, including fish and . eggs. In rare cases, some children are born with a genetic form of the disease. Rickets is referred to as a Victorian-era disease, due to its prominence at the turn of the century. It . has largely disappeared in the Western world, thanks to the rise in . Vitamin D enriched foods, including margarine and cereals. But . in recent years, experts have warned of an increasing number of cases . in the UK. While still relatively small numbers - 900 cases were . diagnosed in 2012 - studies have revealed a high number of people in the . UK have low levels of Vitamin D in their blood. Any . child with a lack of Vitamin D in their diet can develop the disease. But the condition is more prevalent in children with dark skin, due to . the fact more sunlight is needed to deliver enough Vitamin D. Those born . premature and children taking medication that can interfere with . Vitamin D are also at a higher risk of developing the disease. Rickets . is easily prevented. A child's hands and face only have to be exposed . to sunlight for around 15 minutes several times a week in spring and . summer to provide enough of the vital Vitamin. That combined with a . healthy diet incorporating Vitamin D and calcium-rich foods help . strengthen the bones. Children . with rickets are more likely to fracture their bones. The condition can . cause pain, poor growth and deformities, including bowed legs, . curvature of the spine and a thickening of the ankles, wrists and knees. The disease is easily treated through encouraging a child to eat the correct foods and take vitamin supplements.","Nkosiyapha Kunene, 36, and his wife Virginia, 32, from Erith, Kent, admitted the manslaughter of their son, Ndingeko .

We want to be sure that the market works well when people need it - whether that's for one day, one month or longer. ‘Our new rules will help us to protect consumers and give us strong new powers to tackle any firm found to be overstepping the line.’ WONGA Typical APR 5853% .

Under the plans, a payday loan firm will . be able to attempt to try raid a borrower's account using a recurring . payment known as a continuous payment authority (CPA) twice. The FCA will also have powers to ban any adverts by payday lenders which are found to be misleading. Around 50,000 firms currently make up the £200 billion-a-year consumer credit market, which is currently overseen by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). The FCA will take over in April. Some payday firms were accused of basing their whole business model on people who would never be able to pay their loans back in time, meaning the original cost of the debt balloons and the borrower ends up rolling the loan over and sinking into deeper trouble. Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said it was good to see the regulator taking on ‘firms that have been exploiting millions reliant on high cost credit to pay for essentials’. He added: ‘Lenders should not wait for the new rules to take effect before changing their behaviour. ‘Borrowers must be treated fairly whatever form of credit they're using, so the regulator must clamp down on excessive fees and charges, particularly default fees charged by some payday lenders, to show it means business.’ The new financial health warnings will ensure customers are told: ‘Warning: Late repayment can cause you serious money problems. For help, go to moneyadviceservice.org.uk.’ The risk warnings will apply online from April and in print and on television from July. Craig Gentle, PwC's consumer credit lead and financial services risk and regulation partner, said the new rules ‘set the scene for the biggest overhaul of the consumer credit industry in four decades’. Joanna Elson, chief executive of debt charity the Money Advice Trust, said mandatory affordability checks have the potential to prevent much of the harm it sees. She added: ‘It is important these are rigorously enforced.’ Consumer campaigners said more still needs to be done to protect payday loan customers. Wendy Alcock, campaigns manager at consumer help website MoneySavingExpert.com said: ‘Payday lenders have got away with too much for too long and the FCA must keep its word when it comes to cracking down on this broken market. ‘But this is not the end. We're still waiting for the total cost cap and our call for a ban on payday loan adverts from children's TV is yet to be answered by the Government or regulators. ‘Until all the problems with high-cost short-term credit are addressed, people need to look after their own pockets.’ Financial Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid welcomed the rules as another ‘milestone’ towards creating a stronger and safer financial services sector to support businesses and families. He said: ‘A well functioning consumer credit market is key to this. That is why the Government has created the Financial Conduct Authority and provided it with the powers to act decisively to tackle bad practice and consumer detriment in areas like payday lending.’","Financial Conduct Authority warns firms against 'overstepping the line'

Hundreds of Beyoncé fans were left disappointed after discovered they had been sold fake tickets to the star's concerts as part of a scam worth at least £28,000. The online fraud saw music lovers turned away from Beyoncé's shows in Manchester this week after they were told that the tickets they had bought online were in fact forgeries. Police have now issued an appeal for victims - who apparently paid around £100 per ticket - to come forward in a bid to discover who was behind the lucrative scam. A number of the fraud victims said they bought tickets to see the star perform at the Phones4U Arena after seeing them advertised on classified listings website Gumtree. They picked up the tickets in person, but when they arrived at the venue for the concerts on Tuesday and Wednesday they were denied entrance by staff. Michael Hegarty agreed to pay £220 for a pair of Beyoncé tickets from a 'very plausible' tout after the man, whom he had met on Gumtree, sold him a genuine ticket to a Manchester United match. When he realised he was unable to attend the concert, he sold the tickets on to someone else - but the order number turned out to have been forged and the barcode did not work. Another victim told the Manchester Evening News she also bought her tickets via Gumtree, from a man who claimed to work from a London-based concierge service. 'They looked really real and he seemed so genuine,' the unnamed woman said. 'It's horrible. I don't know how anybody could do that to someone.' Other fans used Twitter to buy the fake tickets, only to be turned away once they arrived at the venue. 'A work colleague and myself found the ""tickets"" last week through Twitter,' Anna Boulton, from Manchester, told MailOnline. 'We contacted the seller through Twitter and payed through PayPal. 'We received the email with scanned in versions of e-tickets, which made me a little uneasy. However we were too excited to do anything about that. 'As soon as we handed the ticket over at the box office, the woman simply said, ""You've bought fake tickets. We've had probably about a hundred of this ticket bought here tonight not working with exactly the same name on it."" 'Luckily as we payed through PayPal and our seller seems very nice, we are in the process of receiving a refund. 'I thought I was a lot more streetwise than to be scammed like this - but by the sounds of it, so were a lot of people.' Fake: This is one of the forged tickets which was turned away at the Phone4U Arena in Manchester . Arena workers said that they had rejected at least 140 tickets at the entrance gates, according to British Transport Police, but just seven victims have reported the fraud to police. 'It seems that someone has been selling fake tickets to concert goers who only realise the tickets aren't genuine when they get to the venue,' Detective Constable Mike Dermody said. 'We believe there have been more than 140 sets of fake tickets sold, though only seven victims have come forward so far. 'In most cases the tickets have sold for at least £100 each and each victim has bought at least two tickets, so we are potentially looking at a fraud worth more than £28,000. 'Each transaction has taken place over the internet, using public selling websites, with the victims arranging to meet someone in Manchester to pick up the tickets. 'I believe the victims of this fraudster will be spread far and wide as people travel from all over the UK to see Beyoncé. 'I am, therefore, appealing to anyone who has been sold fake tickets, but has not yet spoken to police to come forward.' Angels Concierge, the company which the fraudster claimed to work for, today denied any involvement in the scam. 'Someone has clearly been using our name to sell these tickets,' a spokesman said. 'We are really disturbed by what we are reading.' Beyoncé is currently in the middle of an 11-month tour, the Mrs Carter Show World Tour, which has drawn sell-out audiences in more than 100 countries.","Fans bought tickets for star's concerts in Manchester via Gumtree website .

The residents of an Australian have been enveloped in a thick, smokey haze for the last three weeks after a coalmine caught fire. On February 9 an arsonist lit a bushfire that spread to the site in Morwell, Victoria, leaving Hazelwood open-cut mine ablaze. Coal mine fires like this one are particularly hard to put out because they are difficult for firefighters to access underground. Even if the fire looks extinguished it keeps smouldering. A mine spokesperson told MiningAustralia.com.au: ‘You can drop a bucket of water over it and it looks like the fire is out, but it will come back as a smouldering fire.’ Scroll down for video . Smoky haze: Residents of Morwell, Victoria are worried about the long-term health effects of the coalmine fire that has been burning for almost three weeks . The fire could take months to extinguish because coalmine fires are hard to access and keep smouldering . Morwell, a town 150km east of Melbourne, is touted by tourism agencies as ‘Victoria’s energy centre’. The town's 13,000 residents are worried about the long-term health risks associated with exposure to smoke, even though health officials say there is no risk. ‘We are in the dark, we don't know what's going on,’ one resident told ABC. Authorities say the ‘best case scenario’ would see the fire extinguished in 14 days but concede it could take months. And police are still hunting for the arsonist who they say has ‘knowledge of fire behaviour’ amid fears the perpetrator could strike again. Detective Sen-Constable Jason Benbow said police were focusing on arsonists who had struck before, The Herald Sun reported. The open mine fire glows in the dark because it keeps smouldering despite attempts to extinguish it . No end in sight: Firefighters have been battling to get the situation under control but with no success . Inferno: The smouldering fires and rising smoke can be seen from some distance away . 'We think someone with local knowledge is behind this, and definitely a knowledge of fire behaviour. ‘This fire has caused millions and millions dollars of damage, not to mention the health effects it has caused, plus the possibility of the power station going down.’ Victoria's chief health officer Rosemary Lester said an evacuation plan had been prepared but it was not yet necessary to carry out. ‘We've been keeping a very close eye on the carbon monoxide and that has not been a level of concern, which is good,’ she said. About 25,000 face masks have been given to residents, Vice reported. Residents are gathering evidence in order to launch a possible class action against the owners of the mine. Local protest organiser Nerissa Albon said: ‘We're going to collect data to find out whose businesses are suffering and what are the health issues. ‘They're scared, they're starting to get annoyed now.... nobody can say when it's going to finish, it could go on for months. They would want compensation.’ Thousands of masks have been given out to residents but authorities say there is no health risk .

Dementia patients will receive a diagnosis within six weeks rather than six months of presenting  symptoms in a radical shake-up of care for the elderly, the Health  Secretary said yesterday. Jeremy Hunt said people with suspected dementia should not be kept waiting for treatment because of delayed diagnoses. Mr Hunt pledged that Britain will become a ‘global leader’ in battling the illness under a new system to be introduced by March 2015. Jeremy Hunt said the NHS should follow the French model of care where family doctors are more likely to detect possible signs of the disease . He said too many elderly people suffer ‘stress and anxiety’ because their GPs are not detecting signs of the disease early enough. ‘There are parts of the country where it takes six months to get a dementia diagnosis, which is absolutely scandalous,’ he added. ‘I want to get to a situation where the average across the whole country is no more than six weeks.’ Mr Hunt pledged that Britain will become a 'global leader' in battling the illness under a new system to be introduced by March 2015 . Mr Hunt, who is attending a conference in Paris, said the NHS needs to respond to an increasingly elderly population and should follow the French model of care where family doctors are more likely to detect possible signs of the disease. In an interview with the Telegraph, the Health Secretary said: ‘How we respond to dementia is the litmus test of whether we can face up to the challenge of an ageing population, and do so in a way which allows compassion and dignity. ‘Dementia can be a horrific and heart-breaking disease, but it is my mission as Health Secretary to make this country the best place in the world to get a dementia diagnosis, as well as a global leader in the fight to find a cure.’ Experts recommend a patient with suspected dementia should wait no more than six weeks for an appointment at a clinic. Researchers calculated that 44 per cent of Britons with dementia have not yet been diagnosed – equating to 370,000 patients. Once given a diagnosis, patients can be given drugs such as Aricept which reduce symptoms and also slow the progression. Yesterday Mr Hunt said late diagnosis could be denying sufferers drugs that could slow down or halt the progression of the illness. He added: ‘There is still a minority of GPs who don’t think it is worth giving someone a dementia diagnosis. In fact, we know that a timely diagnosis can mean medicines to help stave off the condition in about one in three people and it can also mean putting support and plans in place for families trying to cope with the fact that someone has dementia.’ In January 2013 the Alzheimer’s Society uncovered a ‘postcode lottery’, with a huge variation in the provision of NHS services. In some trusts, more than two thirds of patients with dementia have not yet been diagnosed. Figures show that one in three people will develop dementia but Department of Health estimates suggest that just half of the 670,000 people in England suffering from the disease receive a diagnosis. Tomorrow Mr Hunt will announce that Marks & Spencer, Argos, Homebase and Lloyds Banking Group have committed  to sign up more than 120,000 staff to undergo training to support customers with dementia.","Hunt pledged that Britain will become a 'global leader' in battling the illness under a new system to be introduced by March 2015 .

Bored: David Watson, 74, admitted making images of Kym Marsh, Jennie McAlpine and Natalie Robb . A 'bored pensioner' is facing prison for superimposing the heads of Coronation Street stars onto the bodies of naked women. David Watson, 74, created the images of Kym Marsh, Jennie McAlpine and Emmerdale actress Natalie Robb at his house in Daventry, Northampton, before sending them to the stars' home addresses. The photographs left the women 'shocked and sickened', and prompted Miss McAlpine to increase security at her home for fear of attack. Watson now faces prison after pleading guilty to two counts of sending indecent images to Miss McAlpine, who plays Fiz Stape in Coronation Street, between October and December 2013. Under the Malicious Communications Act, he also pleaded guilty to two charges of sending indecent messages to Miss Marsh, who plays Michelle Connor in the soap, and Miss Robb, who plays Moira Barton in Emmerdale, for the purpose of causing them distress and anxiety. Prosecutor Matthew Treece told Manchester Magistrates Court that Miss Marsh was the first victim on October 18. She received a handwritten envelope marked 'personal' and asked her father to open the letter. It contained a picture that had been edited to include an image of Miss Marsh’s face on the body of a different woman exposing her breasts. Five days later Miss McAlpine got a similar letter with an explicit message on the photo. The court heard on November 2 a third . letter with a picture was received by Miss Robb. It was her face on the . body of another woman showing her breasts. Miss McAlpine then received a . second letter containing the same image as the first. Admission: Pensioner David Watson now faces prison after pleading guilty to sending indecent images to the home addresses of actresses Kym Marsh (left) Jennie McAlpine (right) Upset: Kym Marsh, who plays Michelle Connor in Coronation Street, said she had been left 'shocked and sickened' by the images . Worried: The photographs prompted Jennie McAlpine, who plays Fiz Stape in the soap, to increase security at her home for fear of attack . This time the pensioner wrote 'Jenny, I would love to see you like this' followed by an explicit message and kisses. Mr Treece said: 'Watson showed a lot of determination to get the addresses of the actresses and it was aggravated by the way he used the photos.' The court heard how he had got the addresses through an internet company who had supplied them for a fee. But this turned out to be his undoing as police later contacted the company he had used to track him down. On arrest Watson claimed he had sent the letters out of boredom. At first he told police he had got the . images of the naked actresses and had not altered them. But he later . admitted what he had done, said Mr Treece. Concerns: Emmerdale star Natalie Robb said she felt degraded by the photographs. 'It had crossed my mind I may have a stalker', she said in a statement to the court . Victims: David Watson, 74, created the images of Kym Marsh (right) and Jennie McAlpine (left) at his home in Daventry, Northampton. He claimed to have made them out of 'boredom' In her impact statement Miss McAlpine said the letters had left her feeling scared. She said: 'I have improved the security at my home with additional locks... It was degrading.”' Miss Robb said she had also felt degraded. 'It had crossed my mind I may have a stalker', she added. In her statement Miss Marsh said the incident had left her 'feeling sick and shocked'. James Street, defending, said Watson had never previously been in trouble.

Louise Port, 38, claimed more than £70,000 in housing benefits but has been spared prison . A former GMTV reporter who claimed more than £70,000 in housing benefits has been spared prison. Louise Port, 38, has been handed an 18-month suspended sentence after being found guilty of ‘deliberate deception’ over a four-year period. The case was brought by Westminster City Council after several months of investigation by fraud teams and Port was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court. The ex-girlfriend of former Scotland manager Craig Brown failed to declare that she was receiving more than £1,000 a month in rent from a flat that she owned near Canary Wharf. She had £87,000 in equity on the property, according to the Evening Standard. Port was also receiving £1,150 a month from a property in the West End. In all, she wrongly received £76,157.14 in housing benefit between September 2006 and August 2011. She used the money to pay off credit card debt, the paper reported. Sentencing, Judge Anthony Pitt said she was not a ‘wealthy’ woman, and pointed out she was ‘clearly in difficulty’ when the offences were committed. ‘As an act of mercy’, because she suffers from epilepsy, he suspended her sentence for two years. But he did impose 120 hours of unpaid work and three months’ curfew between 9pm and 6am – except on Fridays when Port works in nightclubs around the Vauxhall area. According to the paper, Port wept as the sentence was passed. The case was brought by Westminster City Council after several months of investigation by fraud teams and Port was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court . Councillor Lindsay Hall, Westminster City Council’s fraud tsar, said: ‘She may have been used to getting up at the crack of dawn to entertain on TV, but now she is waking up to the fact that housing benefit fraud is a criminal offence and is the equivalent of stealing money straight out of the pocket of the taxpayer.’ Port, who now lives in Brentwood, worked at GMTV until 2006. In 2008, she lost a disability discrimination and unfair dismissal claim against her former employer. Port claimed she was sacked for refusing to work night shifts because of her epilepsy.","Louise Port, 38, has been handed an 18-month suspended sentence .

A two-year-old girl may have a bald patch for life after a toy train ripped out a patch of her hair. Lilly Brokenshire was playing with the plastic 'Toot-Toot' locomotive, which was advertised as being suitable for children aged 12 months or older. But the motorised toy became tangled in her hair and ripped out a three-inch patch from the middle of her head - leading her father to fear that it may never grow back. Now the company which makes the train has been forced to issue a fresh warning about the dangers of children getting hair or clothes trapped in their toys. Ordeal: Lilly Brokenshire had a large patch of hair pulled out by a toy train made by Chinese firm VTech . Fears: The two-year-old could be left with a permanent bald patch in the wake of the accident . The toddler's father Paul Jacob, from Crawley in West Sussex, urged other parents to be wary of the Toot-Toot Drivers Train, made by Chinese electronics giant VTech. The Â£49.99 toy train set comes with a 32-piece winding track, signals and toy buildings, as well as the motorised train and a cargo car. 'We got Lilly the train for Christmas,' said Mr Jacob, 37. 'She has all the other VTech train toys, so we got her this one, the first motorised one they've made. 'I was sat next to her when she was happily playing with it, but before I knew what was going on, she had picked the plastic train from the track and ran it on top of her head. 'The wheels took her hair and kept wrapping it around the wheels, pulling it out by the roots and leaving part of her head scalped.' Torn out: This large clump of hair was caught in the wheels of the motorised toy locomotive . Danger: The firm that makes the train has now issued a new warning against getting hair or clothes caught . Mr Jacob, a chef, said that because Lilly is so young the accident earlier this month could have permanently damaged the growth of her hair. 'She could be bald there now for the rest of her life,' he said. 'If her hair doesn't start growing soon, we'll know that it probably won't ever come back. 'The hair was ripped clean from the roots and follicles. It is very powerful - I've placed it in the palm of my hand and you can feel the wheels and motor grinding. 'It is clearly a danger when young toddlers are playing with it.' Warning: Lilly's father Paul has demanded that VTech issue a recall of the train . The toy came with a disclaimer advising parents not allow their children to remove the train from its tracks, but did not mention the risk posed by the motor, according to Mr Jacob. He has called for VTech to implement a recall of the set and install an emergency cut-off feature to stop similar incidents in future. A spokesman for the company said: 'The VTech Toot-Toot Drivers Train has been tested to European safety standards and has passed all tests for children over 12 months of age. 'VTech aims to go above and beyond the standards required in the European tests and, as such, we have added a leaflet within the Toot-Toot Driver Train Station packaging which contains a warning about only playing with the train on the track and not close to hair, body or clothes.'","Lilly Brokenshire was playing with toy train made by Chinese firm VTech .

'Misled': Cindy Lee Garcia arrives at court in September. She has now been told to take down an anti-Muslim film that sparked violence in many parts of the Middle East . The court's ruling addressed control of the clip, not its contents, which YouTube determined didn't violate its standards. 'Garcia's performance was used in a way that she found abhorrent and her appearance in the film subjected her to threats of physical harm and even death,' Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote for the majority court. 'Despite these harms, and despite Garcia's viable copyright claim, Google refused to remove the film from YouTube.' Garcia said she was duped into appearing in the film by the man behind it, Mark Basseley Youssef. She said the script she saw referenced neither Muslims nor Mohammad, and her voice was dubbed over after filming. Cindy Lee Garcia, pictured in the 'Innocence of Muslims' trailer . 'Duped': The original casting call for what was billed as a 'historical desert drama' The 14-minute film, 'Innocence of Muslims,' depicts Mohammad as a religious fraud, pedophile and womanizer.

The court said the actress owned the copyright to her performance because she thought it was for another film unrelated to what ultimately aired.

Details of the crackdown, which also saw arrests in the US and Serbia, can now be reported after a reporting ban was lifted by a Spanish judge. Investigators targeted a number of organised crime gangs, aiming to take out the top levels of the networks as well as dozens of the conmen who work for them. Ill-gotten gains: This Aston Martin DB( convertible was among a number of luxury cars towed away in the raids . Seized: Their lifestyles have been likened to the excesses portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street, spending the stolen money on cars like this Ford Mustang Mach 1 . Lavish: This Ferrari Spyder and £500,000 in cash were also removed as police targeted the top levels of the criminal networks as well as dozens of the conmen who work for them . Sprawling criminal network: Police believe that these raids are 'the tip of the iceberg' and that there are thousands of people who have been duped . Excess: The fraudsters also spent the stolen cash on designer watches (above), drugs and prostitutes . Their lifestyles have been likened to the excesses portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street, spending the stolen money on sports cars, designer watches, drugs and prostitutes. One of the suspects was believed to be paying £40,000 per month just to rent an apartment. An Aston Martin, Mustang, Ferrari and BMW were among the cars seized by police, along with various watches and £500,000 in cash. Speaking near the site of one of the searches in Barcelona on Tuesday, City of London Police Commander Steve Head, said: 'What we've seen today is the culmination of a two-year investigation that has been worldwide in its nature. What we've seen is an unprecedented level of co-operation. 'We expect this network alone to have upwards of 1,000 victims. We've seen millions of pounds taken from people. International ring: Of the 110 arrests, there were 84 in Spain, 20 in the UK, two in the U.S. and four in Serbia . Facing trial: Most of the suspects are British and a core group are expected to be extradited back to the UK . Boiler room fraud is a scam where conmen sell worthless or non-existent shares to unsuspecting customers. They are called 'boiler room' scams because of the high-pressure techniques employed by the broker. They buy a list of investors who have already put money into companies, perhaps from a corrupt stock broker or from a data store that sells personal information, and then contact them, offering tempting investment returns. Most of their victims will be elderly and lonely people who live in rural areas and are more isolated and easier to trick. The gangs targeted in the unprecedented operation led by City of London and Spanish police would use high pressure sales techniques, assuming false identities and bullying them into handing over money. Sometimes they would use confidence tricks, paying out a small 'dividend' to persuade the investor to give them more of their cash. This kind of scam is considered to be one of the greatest fraud threats to the UK, with an estimated £240 million lost by victims last year. 'You see real victims in real communities whose lives have been devastated. Savings that they thought they could rely on in their old age have gone in a heartbeat.' In total, the international team executed 35 warrants on offices used to run the fraud and the criminals' lavish homes. Mr Head added: 'These people have no conscience in terms of what they do to people's lives. This is not at all a victimless crime. We've seen lives that have been utterly devastated. 'We have dismantled an international network of fraudsters. Make no mistake, this will make a difference to the ability of fraudsters to operate at this level. 'This network has been dismantled, hopefully we have sent a message to those who think that it's an easy crime that it doesn't matter where you are, we will come after you.' As well as the investment scams the gangs are involved in drug dealing, money laundering and gun crime, and use their ill-gotten profits to hire prostitutes. City of London Police has spent two . years looking at the top levels of the fraud gangs, and aimed to take . out key figures such as lawyers, money launderers and financiers. Around . 40 officers from the force travelled to Spain for the operation, staged . along with around 300 of their Spanish counterparts. Evidence: Officers from City of London Police and their Spanish counterparts from the Policia Nacional remove items after raiding a business property in Barcelona . Taken out: The operation closed down 14 boiler rooms in Spain, two in the UK and one in Serbia .

Commissioner Jose Luis Andre Vega from the Spanish national police, said: 'This sort of crime knows no frontiers or boundaries. It's important to investigate this sort of organised crime on an international level.' It is one of the biggest ever police . operations to crack down on fraud, and also involved the UK National . Crime Agency, Financial Conduct Authority and Serious Fraud Office. Mr Head added: 'In terms of economic crime and fraud this is one of the biggest operations there has ever been.

'That's a really important message to go out there to those international fraudsters who think they can act with impunity. 'We have shown that we can work together with law enforcement teams across the world to go after these people.'

A father who was so obsessed with gaining custody of his daughter that he beat his ex-girlfriend to death with a rolling pin was today given a life sentence after being convicted of murder. Adam Singer killed Sally Ann Harrison in an 'appalling and murderous attack' because she was planning to move out along with their 21-month-old daughter Isabella. He then fled the scene and left her to be found slumped on the sofa having suffered fatal head injuries. Murder: Adam Singer, left, has been jailed for life over the killing of Sally Ann Harrison, right . Singer, 30, denied murder - but a court heard that he had stolen the rolling pin days earlier from the HMS Drake naval base in Plymouth, Devon where he worked as a galley assistant. He had also 'rehearsed' the attack with a colleague, and asked whether a rolling pin could kill. The defendant was yesterday convicted of murder by a unanimous jury, and today judge Graham Cottle sentenced him to life in prison with a minimum of 18 years before he is eligible for parole. 'I have no doubt you were going to use any means at your disposal to try and secure custody,' the judge said at Bristol Crown Court. 'You produced the rolling pin from your rucksack and you bludgeoned Sally to death with it. 'She was sat on the sofa in her dressing gown and pyjamas when the attack started and she never moved other than to fall side ways under the blows you rained on her head. Couple: The killing was motivated by Singer's desire to gain sole custody of the couple's daughter . 'It was an appalling and murderous . attack. You are cunning, deceitful and manipulative and are somebody who . will continue to present a very real danger to any woman you meet and . form a relationship with in the future. 'You . have deprived Isabella of her mother and you have deprived Sally of the . joys of bringing up her child. You have deprived those near and dear to . Sally of a young woman who everybody spoke of in a warm and . affectionate capacity.' Simon . Laws QC, prosecuting, told the court that Singer and Ms Harrison, 24, . had met in November 2006 and moved in together in Plymouth shortly . before the birth of Isabella in July 2010. They split in early 2012, but continued living together even after they had both found new partners. When Ms Harrison announced she was planning to leave, Singer became increasingly obsessed with securing custody of Isabella. A . series of Facebook messages were read to the court in which Ms Harrison . claimed her ex-partner wanted sole custody and intended to make her a . 'weekend mum'. Planned: Singer took a rolling pin from his workplace days before murdering his ex-girlfriend . Singer discovered that Ms Harrison was in a relationship with another man by reading her email, and the prosecution claimed he planned to use the information as evidence during a custody hearing. 'You were digging for dirt to use against Sally,' Mr Laws said. 'You thought that might help you in the custody battle with Sally after Isabella. 'You said the way she dressed and the fact she was a ""slag"" would count against her. You told her, ""You dress in a provocative way and have sex with other men, that means I will get Isabella,"" didn't you?' Singer had been brandishing a rolling pin in front of colleagues in the days before the killing, and talked about murder and suicide in what Mr Laws described as a 'rehearsal'. On April 4, 2012, he bludgeoned Ms Harrison over the head and killed her, before leaving home and returning hours later to 'play the part of the bereaved boyfriend' in front of police. He later admitted taking the rolling pin from work, but said he had only taken it to bake with his girlfriend and daughter. The victim's grandparents, Ann and Peter McCurrie, said after the sentencing that justice had finally been served. 'There are no winners in this case, but justice has finally been done, two years later, for Sally,' Mr McCurrie said. 'But nothing will never bring her back. We miss her every day. 'Sally will never be able to see her daughter again, she will never walk through the door again. Isabella is now effectively an orphan, she will be 22 before her father is released. 'We miss Sally incredibly. She was an absolutely lovely girl, she was very close to us, she would visit all the time. She was bubbly and happy and always smiling and always putting others first.'","Adam Singer, 30, beat Sally Ann Harrison, 24, over the head with rolling pin .

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:07 EST, 28 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:43 EST, 28 February 2014 . A new survey by the Daily Mail has revealed millions of patients wait as long as three weeks to see their GP . Millions of patients wait as long as three weeks to see their GP, a Daily Mail survey reveals today. Only one in three manages to secure a same-day appointment, despite Government promises to make such slots routinely available. One in five cannot get a consultation within seven days. The survey suggests that two million adults wait between two and three weeks to see a doctor and half a million suffer a delay of three or four weeks. Leading GPs say the figures reflect their struggle to meet the demands of a growing population with ever larger numbers of pensioners. And they are increasingly worried about late diagnosis of deadly illnesses such as cancer and lung disease. Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We do worry on patient safety grounds that access is becoming more of a problem. ‘Take someone who’s had a cough for four or five weeks. The chances are that it’s a long-running cough from a viral illness. But what if they’ve got TB, what if they’ve got lung cancer? If it does turn out to be cancer or TB then the quicker they’re dealt with the better.’ Clare Gerada, a Health Service primary care chief, said: ‘GPs who have been the bedrock of the NHS are struggling, seriously struggling. They are particularly struggling in London. ‘As we get older, as we live longer, we are putting more strain on general practice. It would not be unusual for GPs to see 40 to 50 patients in any one day.’ Dr Gerada is helping to draw up new guidelines for GPs in London – which may later be adopted across the country – to make it easier for patients to see their doctor. They will urge surgeries to offer . phone consultations as well as ensure GPs and nurses are freed up to . offer more same-day appointments. The . Mail’s survey – in collaboration with over-50s group Saga – asked . 11,019 adults how long they waited the last time they saw a family . doctor. Twenty-two per cent had to wait longer than a week and 4 per . cent had to wait two to three weeks. Another 1 per cent waited longer than three weeks and a handful waited longer than a month. Nationally, 4 per cent equates to two million people and 1 per cent to 500,000. Many practices now offer same-day . appointments only to those prepared to queue outside from the moment a . surgery opens. In autumn the Care Quality Commission watchdog reported . that some patients have resorted to taking stools to make their wait . more bearable. Surgeries . have also become busier because fewer GPs work at evenings and weekends. A contract, which was negotiated under Labour in 2004, allowed them to . opt out, meaning services are now largely run by private firms employing . locums. Many patients would rather . wait and try for an appointment with their own doctor on the Monday . morning – which is when surgeries are busiest. The Mail survey – carried . out over a period of ten days on the internet this month – also found . it is much harder to book an appointment now than it was just five years . ago. Forty-nine per cent said it was difficult or very difficult, compared with 21 per cent in November 2008. Dr Maureen Baker from the Royal College of GPs (left) warned patient safety could be compromised while Clare Gerada, a Health Service primary care chief, (right) warned GPs are 'seriously struggling' especially in London . One in three people manages to see their family doctor on the same day as calling for an appointment despite Government promises from Jeremy Hunt's Department of Health, that these slots would be made routinely available. One in five patients cannot get a consultation within seven days . The situation is worst in London, where 27 per cent wait more than a week and 1 per cent wait a month. Joyce Robins of Patient Concern said: ‘Having to wait ten days to a fortnight is quite common and quite often you will hear of people waiting three weeks. ‘You have to wait longer if you want to see your own doctor – it’s easier if you’ll see any locum who’s popped into the surgery for a couple of weeks and will never be seen again. ‘For most people locums aren’t satisfactory. If you’ve got an ongoing problem you don’t want to discuss it with someone you’ll never see again.’ The lack of GP appointments has partly been blamed for the crisis in A&E units. NHS figures show that half of patients arriving in casualty need no treatment. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged GPs to provide more same-day appointments as one measure to ease the pressure in A&E. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘Unless urgent action is taken, we are going to see increasing pressure being placed upon an already overstretched A&E system, as patients visit the emergency departments in desperation.’","Daily Mail survey shows one in three cannot get a same-day appointment .

Two women were today jailed for carrying out a vicious assault that left a stiletto shoe lodged in another woman's cheek. Janet Atherton, 50, and Jacqueline Philips, 52, attacked their 59-year-old victim after she complained about the toilet being blocked at Philips's home in Wigan, Lancashire. They pulled her hair and scratched her face, before kicking her - causing one of Atherton's shoes to fly into her face so hard that the heel became stuck in her cheek. 'Vultures': : Janet Atherton (left), 50, and Jacqueline Philips (right), 52, assaulted their 59-year-old victim after she complained about the toilet being unclean and blocked at Philips's home in Wigan, Lancashire . The unnamed woman was left with blood pouring down her face, and was later taken to hospital with a puncture wound and severe bruising to her face and arms. Today, Detective Constable Claire Hughes, of Greater Manchester Police, branded the attackers 'vultures'. 'These two women acted like vultures, and viciously attacked an innocent women who theyhad invited back to Philipsâ€™s house,' she said. Horrific: They pulled her hair and scratched her face, before kicking her - causing one of Atherton's shoes to became stuck in the woman's cheek . 'They set upon her because she dared to criticise the cleanliness of the bathroom. 'The victim was so scared she feared for her own life and thought they were going to kill her - she had blood dripping down her face.' Atherton and Philips, both from Wigan, have now been jailed after being found guilty of varying assault charges at Liverpool Crown Court. Atherton was sentenced to seven years in prison for causing grievous bodily harm with intent, while Philips will serve a two-year prison sentence for the lesser offence of wounding. The victim had bumped into the pair, who were socialising with her friend at The Milstone Pub in Wigan, on the evening of December 31 last year, the court heard. They all left the pub at around 11.30pm and moved to another venue to see in the New Year, before Philips invited them back to her home. While at the house, the victim went to the bathroom, before returning to tell Philips that the toilet was messy and unblocked. Her comments caused Philips to point and exclaim: 'Who do you think you are?' Atherton was then said to have 'totally flown off the handle', before she and Philips started to pull the victim's hair and scratch her face. Atherton then repeatedly kicked her - causing one of her stiletto shoes to slam so hard into the side of the woman's face that the heel became lodged in her cheek.

Skier Dave Tapsfield smiled for a picture in the sunshine after summiting an Alpine mountain this week – but less than one hour after it was taken he was tragically swept to his death in a huge avalanche. The Scotsman who mounted a courageous rescue effort to rescue Mr Tapsfield has spoken movingly of the tragedy. Lorne Cameron, 29, has told how he desperately battled in vain to save his friend after he was flung down the mountain. Tragedy: This picture of Dave Tapsfield was taken less than an hour before he was swept to his death in an avalanche . Fall: The red line shows the path of the avalanche that Mr Tapsfield was swept along by . The experienced mountaineers were skiing on Mont Buet, near Chamonix in France, when a snow cornice, an overhanging edge of snow on a ridge, suddenly collapsed from under Mr Tapsfield. Lorne watched in horror as Mr Tapsfield, 28, from Whitley Bay, was engulfed by snow. He skied over the avalanche debris and managed to locate him after 20 minutes by using his avalanche transceiver. Mr Lorne, originally from Glasgow, saw one of Mr Tapsfield’s hands protruding from the snow and frantically dug him out. But he was dead. Local rescue workers have praised Mr Lorne’s efforts, describing him as ‘undeniably very, very courageous’. The tragedy happened at about 1pm on Tuesday on Mont Buet. The men had summitted at 11.30am and were descending. Courageous: Lorne Cameron (left) has told how he desperately tried to save Mr Tapsfield (right), skiing down treacherous terrain to reach him . Speaking from Chamonix, Mr Lorne, who has attended training courses with the Avalanche Academy in Chamonix, said: ‘We were on our way down after a five-hour hike up. Dave was in a great mood. It was a beautiful day. ‘I was in the front. Dave was behind and slightly to the right. ‘We knew there were cornices. We were skiing parallel to the ridge about five to six metres from the edge. ‘Suddenly, without warning, I fell to the ground. There was a crash, a boom sound. It was loud. I fell away from the ridge edge. ‘I looked up and saw Dave. He had fallen too but then I saw him literally bouncing over the precipice. ‘We had skied over a cornice and it had broken off. Dave was just a step closer and he bounced over with the broken edge of cornice. ‘It was four to five metres in depth. It was a huge mass that collapsed off the ridge on to the slope below. ‘This triggered an avalanche. The avalanche was massive. I could see Dave. Maybe for one second I could see him being carried off in the avalanche. I lost sight of him about 100 metres into the avalanche. He was completely engulfed in it. I had no idea of the terrain. Dave had been taken down terrain we had no plans of going into. It was steep. At least 40 to 45 degrees in gradient. Location: The accident took place on Mont Buet in the French Alps, near the ski resort of Chamonix . ‘The avalanche kept going and going. There were clouds of snow billowing into the air. It was a massive cloud. There was no mistaking that it was a huge avalanche. ‘I stood up. I was less than a metre from the edge of the ridge. I was on the new edge, where the cornice had broken off. ‘I desperately wanted to get to Dave as quickly as I possibly could.  I knew I had to ski down the avalanche debris. ‘It was a 10 metre drop down off the edge so I had to hike back up and find a way around. ‘I found a way to get on to the avalanche path. The avalanched snow grabbed at my skis. ‘It was now about five minutes since I had seen Dave. I switched my transceiver to search mode and swept it from side to side, desperate to pick up a signal from Dave’s transceiver. ‘The avalanche terrain was tough. There was a huge swathe of bare ice. The avalanche had stripped all the snow away. There were exposed rocks. ‘I suddenly picked up Dave’s signal quite a bit further down. I honed in on the area and then I saw one of Dave’s hands on the surface of the snow. ‘I grabbed it. I shouted his name. I kept shouting. His hand was bare. The glove had been ripped off. It was cold and it was limp. Accident: David Tapsfield fell when a snow cornice, an overhanging edge of snow on a ridge, collapsed from under him . ‘I started digging. Digging, digging, digging. I uncovered his face first, then freed his chest. I knew in my heart there was no hope but I couldn’t give up. ‘It must have been after about 15 minutes between turning on my transceiver to search mode and finding him. ‘I pulled my phone out. There was no signal. I started giving Dave CPR. I remember thinking if I could get oxygen into him there might be hope, however slim. My phone still had no signal. ‘Between every set of two breaths and two chest compressions I checked the signal on my phone. ‘Suddenly that bar of signal was there. I called a friend of Dave’s and mine, Angus Paterson. I thought it was better to get a quick message to him in case my phone cut out. I just shouted down the phone to him that we needed a heli on the north east face of Mt Buet and that there had been a big avalanche. ‘I got back to the CPR. It was all I could do. It was traumatic. So traumatic. Trying to resuscitate Dave was so nasty. It was horrible. I tried and I tried but he was dead. The reality was, he was dead when I found him.’ Mr Lorne was helicoptered off the mountain. Popular: Chamonix, famed for its challenging terrain, is visited by thousands of skiers and snowboarders every year . A Chamonix police spokesman said: ‘Lorne saw the avalanche and he was first on the scene to rescue his friend. ‘It meant skiing over the avalanche debris and then searching for him with his Arva (avalanche transceiver). He administered first aid at the scene until the mountain rescue arrived. ‘He was undeniably very, very courageous. ‘A cornice had ruptured and the victim had fallen 600 metres. ‘The fall triggered the slide of a huge mass of snow or an avalanche.’ A snow cornice is formed by wind blowing snow over a sharp terrain break, such as the crest of a mountain or along the sides of gullies, where it attaches and builds out horizontally. It is extremely dangerous to ski or hike on them or underneath them. The vulnerability of the structure poses a high risk of triggering avalanches. They are particularly dangerous during sunny weather. The area has experienced warm weather during the past week. On Thursday Mr Tapsfield’s parents and two of his sisters arrived in Chamonix to identify his body and collect his possessions. Mr Tapsfield had moved to Chamonix a few years ago to pursue his love of the mountains and set up a successful sausage-making business selling his wares to local restaurants and pubs. As a teenager he was part of the Football Development Scheme for 16 to 19-year-olds at Tyne Metropolitan College in North Tyneside. In 2005 he won a scholarship at Lafeyatte College in New Jersey, USA, one of the top six colleges in the country, to study and play the game.","David Tapsfield, 28, was ski touring when he was killed in the French Alps .

A Romanian who stole 54 bottles of . whisky told a court it was his first mistake since he’d arrived in the . UK – just nine days earlier. Simon . Calin had been lured to the UK with the promise of good job to support . his wife and child, Furness Magistrates’ Court heard on Thursday. The 37-year-old arrived in Britain on January 2 but by the 11th he found himself in Barrow, Cumbria, with no job or money. He . then loaded 54 bottles of Famous Grouse whisky, worth £1,080 in total, . into a shopping trolley along with tissues and some bags before walking . out of the Tesco store in Barrow without paying. Peter . Kelly, prosecuting, said: ‘‘He told police he was on his own and had . been here one week, two days, his money had run out and this was the . first mistake he had made.’ CCTV cameras caught Calin, of Leigh, Cumbria, getting into a car which drove off but was later stopped by police. He . pleaded guilty to theft and failing to surrender. He was given an . eight-week curfew and ordered to pay costs of £85 and a £60 victim . surcharge. But in a final . twist, the court was told he could not be sentenced to unpaid work as . his English was not good enough to understand health and safety . information. Trystan Roberts, defending, said: 'What Mr Calin tells me is he arrived in the UK about one week before this incident. The Romanian pushed a trolley loaded with bottles of whisky out of this Tesco store before police caught him . 'He was coming, as people do, in order to find work and to provide for his wife and child in Romania. 'He had been told when he came over here there would be a job available for him and that work would be well paid, but the reality was very different.' Mr Roberts told the court Calin had been cajoled into being the ‘fall guy’ by a group of others who said by stealing the whisky it would answer his money troubles. The goods were all recovered in a re-saleable condition, and the court was told Calin now had the promise of a job in a car wash in Leigh, where he is living with his sister. Calin was given an eight-week curfew from 7pm to 7am, and ordered to pay court costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge. The court was told he could not undertake unpaid work as his English was not good enough to understand health and safety information.","Simon Calin, 37, from Barrow-in-Furness, stole £1,108 of Famous Grouse .

Britain is preparing for a total withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year amid a security stand-off with President Hamid Karzai . Yesterday ministers at the Western military alliance – including Britain’s Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – agreed to draw up plans for a complete pull-out unless a deal is thrashed out. Nato Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: ‘We agreed the need to plan for all possible outcomes including the possibility that we may not be able to deploy to Afghanistan after 2014 due to the persistent delays we have seen. ‘It is not the outcome we think is in the interest of the Afghan people. There are fears that a total withdrawal would spark a security crisis in Afghanistan, which could raise the prospect of the Taliban re-seizing power . ‘However, it might be the unfortunate outcome if there is no security agreement in due time. This is what is at stake.’ Mr Rasmussen said he hoped plans to keep troops in Afghanistan beyond this year could be salvaged. But US President Barack Obama has told the Pentagon to prepare for the possibility that no US troops will be left because of President Karzai’s refusal.

A deadly new legal high which has a similar effect to heroin could lead to a surge in deaths, ministers warned yesterday. The emergence of synthetic opiates were becoming more of a problem in Britain than hard drugs, said Home Office Minister Norman Baker. He said he was ‘shocked’ by the spread of so-called legal highs, which was a ‘major new challenge’ that risked killing or injuring many youngsters. Warning: Home Office minister Norman Baker said Britain exists amid a changing drugs landscape . Mr Baker spoke out as he held a summit of experts to tackle the growing problem of substances which are developed in laboratories across the world. ‘Legal heroin’ has already cost one life in the UK. Father-of-one Jason Nock, 41, died in August last year after overdosing on AH-7921 – a legal morphine-like drug bought on the internet for as little as £25 to help him sleep. The 41-year-old computer technician, from . Cradley Heath, West Midlands, accidentally took five times the fatal . amount of the unregulated substance, known commercially as Doxylam, and . never woke up. Until now most legal highs have been . designed deliberately to mimic existing banned substances, such as . cocaine and Ecstasy, but chemically just outside the control of the . Misuse of Drugs Act. But now ministers are worried about the development of chemicals created to replicate the effects of other Class A drugs. Mr Baker said: ‘The fact is there is a problem that hasn’t yet been dealt with satisfactorily, both in this country and elsewhere. And that’s a challenge which we collectively face. ‘In particular I’m concerned by the . shocking emergence of new substances designed to have similar effects to . heroin and synthetic opiates, one of which was reported last month to . have caused the tragic death of Jason Nock. Tragic: Adam Hunt, 18, from Southampton, died last summer after taking a legal high he bought online . ‘We have a changing landscape in the drug world. The drugs which we have traditionally wrestled with, which have been there for decades if not longer, are now being added to by these new psychoactive substances. ‘It presents a challenge because if . they are perceived to be legal and they suddenly arrive in our country . before they have obviously been banned, then young people in particular . can conclude that they are safe when they are nothing of the kind.’ He has now asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which advises the Government on whether a drug should be banned or reclassified, to study the developments. Hester Stewart, 21, died after taking the dance drug GBL in 2009, which has now been banned . Mr Baker has appointed experts in toxicology, policing, education, health and prevention onto the review panel into new psychotic substances. He said the spread of legal highs was a ‘major new challenge’ and warned dozens of young people were dying or risked horrific injuries after experimenting with newly-designed chemicals. Campaigners blame more than 50 deaths a year on legal highs, including Adam Hunt, 18, of Southampton, and Hester Stewart, 21, of Brighton. Ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs, including mephedrone — known as meow meow — NBOMe and Benzofury. But Mr Baker said: ‘If you’re having new substances created almost on a weekly basis then inevitably we’re chasing after those substances.’ He has also vowed to tackle the growing problem of ‘head shops’ which sell legal highs on the High Street. Earlier this month the Mail revealed that there had been a huge surge in the number of deaths from legal highs. Ninety seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years. In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death. The Home Office-appointed review is expected to report in late spring. Meanwhile, a spike in violence at a prisone has been linked to use of the former legal high Spice. Inspectors said HMP Blantyre House, in Kent, had seen a rise in incidents, including two serious assaults. Inmates blamed the trouble on the synthetic cannabis drug - banned in 2009 - because it could induce paranoia and had led to debt and bullying. Current drug tests do not detect Spice.","Synthetic opiates mimic the effects of drugs like morphine and heroin .

A prisoner who begged to be sent back to jail so he could finish a prison course was asked by a judge 'how long' he would like inside - in a move costing taxpayers up to £25,000. Canterbury Crown Court heard this week how thug Troy Smith savagely attacked a man in Dover, Kent, in August last year, leaving him with bleeding on the brain. The 41-year-old beat up victim Adam Jaskurzynski, leaving him unconscious, and stole his rucksack before being nicked. Once inside a police cell he urinated on the bars and spat at a police officer. Smith, who admitted GBH and theft, pleaded with Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl to send him back to jail so he could complete a string of prison courses he was taking. He told the judge: 'I would like you to give me another six months because then I can complete the courses which will help me towards my future.' Smith spent six months in prison on remand before he appeared before court, where his lawyer asked the judge to indicate the maximum sentence he would give if the thug pleaded guilty. When Judge Van Der Bijl said he may hand Smith a suspended prison sentence if he pleaded guilty, the defendant appealed for more time behind bars. Thaiza Khan, defending, told the court how Smith, of Dover, Kent, was part way through a number of prison courses and asked the judge to give an 'indication' of a sentence Smith was likely to get for pleading guilty. Judge Van Der Bijl told the court that 'normally' he would not pass an immediate jail sentence and that Smith would have been freed, the Kent Messenger newspaper reported yesterday. Instead, however, the judge jailed Smith for six months giving him enough time to complete the courses. Smith, who admitted GBH and theft, pleaded with Judge Nigel Van Der Bijl at Canterbury Crown Court to send him back to jail . The judge told Smith: 'This is rather unusual for a defendant to want to stay in prison. 'You have told me you are undertaking courses inside and you say you are doing well inside prison.' The judge then asked Smith: 'You seem to be taking responsibility to alter your life - what would you like me to do?' Smith said: 'If I could get just a few more months and then the courses would be finished.' The judge agreed to Smith's request and jailed him for six months, meaning he will be out in three months. It costs around £50,000-a-year to keep a person in prison, meaning that if he does the full six months, taxpayers will shell out around £25,000 for Smith to complete his prison courses, or £12,500 if he is out in three months.","Troy Smith attacked Adam Jaskurzynski, leaving him with bleeding on brain .

MORE than 100 genetically-modified babies with three parents could be born each year in Britain, it emerged yesterday. The Government has published draft rules that will allow IVF doctors to make babies free of devastating diseases that can kill hours after birth. In a world first, the law could be changed by the end of this year – paving the way for the first GM babies to be born next year. Scientists could soon create embryos using DNA from three people - a man and two women - to prevent mothers from passing on genetic diseases. Stock image pictured. The Department of Health is starting a public consultation on the rules to gather as many views as possible before introducing its final regulations . Initially, just ten babies with three . genetic parents are expected to be born annually, but this could climb . to 125, the Department of Health said last night. Supporters . of the advanced IVF technique say it will give couples who have endured . the heartache of repeatedly miscarrying or burying much-longed-for . children the chance to have a healthy family. But . critics have accused the Government of a ‘truly frightening’ neglect of . safety and ethics. They argue that no one can guarantee the health of . children born this way and say genetically engineering eggs and embryos . crosses a critical ethical line and is banned in most countries. Done . differently, it could lead to the creation of ‘perfect’ babies, made to . order by hair or eye colour. About . one in 200 children every year in Britain is born with a mitochondrial . disorder, faults in a cell's energy source that are contained outside . the nucleus in a normal egg. Mistakes in the mitochondria's genetic code . can result in diseases such as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart . problems and mental retardation. The . new techniques essentially involve removing the nucleus DNA from a . healthy female donor's eggs and replacing it with the nucleus DNA of the . prospective mother, either before or after fertilization. After fertilization, the resulting child would inherit the mother's nucleus DNA - which contains most inherited traits like eye color and height - but the donor's healthy mitochondrial DNA. Scientists . say the DNA from the donor egg amounts to less than 1 per cent of the . resulting embryo's genes. The . row centres on work being carried out at Newcastle University into . incurable diseases caused by faults in mitochondria – the tiny . sausage-shaped powerhouses inside cells that turn food into energy. These defects cause serious illness in one in 6,500 babies and are . responsible for 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy. Women . carrying damaged mitochondria can also miscarry repeatedly and often . face the heartbreaking choice of whether it would be kinder to remain . childless. To help them, . scientists have developed techniques in which the mother-to-be’s . diseased mitochondria are swapped with healthy ones from an egg donated . by another woman. Successful . ‘mitochondrial replacement’ would allow the couple a healthy child that . is genetically their own. As the changes would be passed down the . generations, it would also eliminate the disease from future generations . of the family. Any child . would have DNA from two eggs and one sperm – and so effectively have two . mothers and one father – although the genetic contribution from the . donated egg would be very small.

The techniques under discussion involve removing the nucleus DNA from a healthy female donor's eggs and replacing it with the nucleus DNA of the prospective mother, either before or after fertilisation . Yesterday, . the Government laid out regulations that, if passed by Parliament, . would allow fertility laws to be relaxed to allow the technique. A . three-month public consultation is under way, but the Department of . Health said the question was not whether to allow the technique, but . about how it is implemented. This graphic explains the science behind the technique which has been slammed by critics for being a breach of medical ethics . Professor . Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, said: ‘Allowing . mitochondrial donation would give women who carry severe mitochondrial . disease the opportunity to have children without passing on devastating . genetic disorders. It would also keep the UK at the forefront of . scientific development in this area.’ Even . if the law is changed quickly, IVF treatment will not start until the . fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, is . satisfied of its safety. Any clinics that want to offer the £20,000 . treatment would have to be approved by HFEA, which will also decide . whether each specific case merits the treatment. The egg donor – the third parent – would remain anonymous. The . topic is under discussion in the US, where earlier this week regulators . heard it could take decades to confirm the safety of the technique. Two Government safety reviews have already been carried out here and a third is under way. The . last assessment concluded that although there was nothing to suggest . the technique would not be safe, no one could be ‘absolutely certain’ until the first children were born. Critics say couples could adopt and point out that if something goes wrong, generations will be affected. Dr . David King, of the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, warned that the . technique was a slippery slope that could lead to ‘a designer baby . market’. He accused the Government of rushing to regulate before safety . was satisfied and warned that the ‘unethical’ technique carried unknown . risks to the child. Josephine Quintavalle, of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, called the proposals ‘truly frightening’. But .

Anchor butter, once as much a part of New Zealand as the All Blacks rugby team, is now made in Britain. Owner of the brand, Arla, has moved production of the dairy product to Westbury in Wiltshire, breaking a tradition which lasted over 120 years and returning the butter to its English roots. The original recipe was created in 1886 by Harry Reynolds, a Cornish dairyman who had emigrated to the other side of the world. Golden glow: Anchor's owner Arla reported sales of £2.2billion last year, a 23 per cent rise . The inspiration for the famous red anchor logo was supposedly a tattoo on one of his worker’s arms. Imports to the UK began in 1924, ending in 2012 when Arla – a  co-operative owned by British farmers – began making it in England using British cream. The move did not go down well with fans of the original, who felt the product changed significantly as a result, becoming lighter in colour with a creamier texture. However, despite the objections, the company revealed last week that annual sales across all its products rose 22 per cent in 2013, reaching £2.2billion. Following a merger last year, Arla is now the largest dairy company in the country, making over 4,000 deliveries a day to shops and distribution centres across the country. Picturesque: The butter was famous for being made in the countryside of New Zealand . Anchor butter is still also made in New Zealand by the Fonterra company, who use the same recipe developed in 1886. From April 2014, the business will supply 30,000 tonnes of cheddar to its retail customer Asda, increasing cheese production by 50 per cent. It also signed an exclusive partnership with Starbucks to supply 30 million litres of Cravendale to all its 700 stores in the UK and Northern Ireland on an annual basis.","Firm reveals annual sales across all brands rose 22 per cent in 2013 .

First Minister Alex Salmond's plans for independence suffered a double blow as business raised concerns about its impact . Gerry Grimstone, chairman of Standard Life, said the company was ‘strictly apolitical’, but must act to protect its customers. ‘Scotland . has been a good place from which to run our  business and to compete . around the world,’ he said. ‘We very much hope that this can continue. ‘But, . if anything were to threaten this, we will take whatever action . necessary, including transferring parts of our operations from . Scotland, in order to ensure  continuity and to protect the interests of . our stakeholders.’ Standard . Life said it is worried about a number of ‘material issues’, such as . the currency that will be used in Scotland,  membership of the European . Union and personal taxes. It . might even move its headquarters from Edinburgh to London as well as . many of its different businesses. A source told the BBC: ‘There is no . stock exchange up here [in Scotland] and we are not sure we would wish . to become a foreign-registered company on the London Stock Exchange.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'no wonder' that business were worried about independence . In . a second blow for Alex  Salmond’s plans, Royal Bank of Scotland, . another large employer, raised its concerns over the possibility of a . ‘yes’ vote. In its financial results, it raised fears about the . ‘significant impact’ of independence on all aspects of the bank, . including its ability to raise money. The . credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s warned  yesterday that ‘a . large part’ of Scotland’s massive financial services industry could run . for the exit. It said Scotland would be ‘hard-pressed’ to borrow money . as easily as it does today if it loses the pound, and described the . challenges of  independence as ‘significant’. Danny . Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said he doubts that . Standard Life and RBS will ‘be the last’ to voice their fears about . independence. ‘These businesses are  reasonably and fairly setting out . the consequences of the SNP’s dangerous, risky and unclear plans for . independence,’ he said. Nick . Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said the growing anxiety among . employers in Scotland should be no surprise given the SNP’s failure to . ‘spell out what they mean by independence’. Former . Chancellor Alistair  Darling, who leads the anti- independence Better . Together campaign, said yesterday that independence will cost jobs. ‘This . is the reality of Scotland leaving the UK and losing the UK pound,’ he . said. ‘Companies like Standard Life rely on the strength, security and . stability of the UK.’ John . Swinney, the Scottish Finance Secretary, said: ‘We are very happy to . engage with the company [Standard Life] to address the issues raised and . we look forward to the company continuing to play its part in building . that strong Scottish economy in the future.’","Pensions giant Standard Life draws up contingency plans to relocate .

Jobless Britons should be made to pick fruit on farms or face having their benefits taken away, the Farming Minister said yesterday. George Eustice insisted there would be no replacement for the Seasonal Agricultural Workers scheme that provided 22,000 foreigners a year with temporary permits to enter Britain to harvest crops. It was scrapped in September. Instead, local unemployed people should be recruited to do the work, he said. British jobs: George Eustice was criticised for telling farmers British workers should take priority . But the proposal has sparked fury . among farmers -  who say British jobseekers have a ‘work ethic problem’ which means people simply refuse to do hard manual labour. The farmers insisted yesterday that . reliable foreign workers are vital for the industry and that foreign . migrant labour has fulfilled their needs for generations. Idle? Some farmers claimed workers from eastern Europe show more stamina (file photo) Mr Eustice told the National Farmers' Union conference in Birmingham: ‘I know that some people would say you won’t get them to do this work, they don’t want to do it. 'As a government we shouldn’t really tolerate that attitude that says we are going to pay people to stay on benefits because they don’t want to do certain types of farming work.’ Now farmers fear not being able to recruit enough staff to take in this year’s harvest. Some said Romanians and Bulgarians, who used . to do much of Britain's harvest work, now prefer to work in factories, construction . and catering because of their new employment rights. NFU president Peter Kendall accused the Government of attempting a ‘social engineering experiment’. ‘Just because the Government says people should do farm work doesn’t mean they are going to do it,’ he said. Hops and apple farmer Alison Capper, who lives near Worcester, said: 'We have a work ethic problem in this country... Every year we put out adverts and we try to recruit locally for the harvest. We are lucky if we get three replies for 50 jobs. ‘If you do manage to employ local people, by day five 70 to 80 per cent of them stop turning up. We have a huge dropout rate. ‘They can’t keep up with Polish workers and they drop out. ‘We need to... go back to a position where anyone could come and work. ‘The . benefit of the scheme was that they were guaranteed a job, they would . come for a given period of time and they went home again.’ ‘With . the 2014 harvest this now means more expensive recruitment and much . higher turnover of harvest staff, more costly training and more costly . administration. Hard work: At up to £8 an hour, fruit picking pays better than some jobs but has erratic hours and conditions . ‘It is a . perfectly normal phenomenon that people from poorer countries travel to . harvest richer countries’ fruit and veg. It is a fact of life. It might . not be a very nice fact of life but it happens all over the world, not . just in the UK.’ Mr Eustice, who is Conservative MP for . the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth, said: ‘We don’t think . it is acceptable that people who could work do not because they think . there is something unglamorous about farm work. A government report last year said: 'Growers tried to recruit British workers but without success' ‘We are doing a . number of things, including getting people who live locally to take some . of these jobs, to make sure it’s factored into the work that DWP is . doing. ‘Sometimes the barrier is that people feel it is not worth coming off . benefits for a month or six weeks because they then have the difficulty . of getting back on those benefits. That is something we are trying to . address.’ Mr Eustice, whose . family ran a strawberry farm in Cornwall in the 1990s, added: ‘Frankly, . we need to try to make sure we make it easier for people who live . locally who are on benefits but could work to take these jobs in . agriculture. ‘I know, having worked in farming myself, how challenging that can be.’ Migration Watch UK, which backed scrapping the scheme, said: ‘It’s hard to see why someone fit to work should not work on a farm, rather than just living on benefits.’ The Government’s independent Migration Advisory Committee last year warned about the impact of scrapping seasonal work permits. In a report on the subject, it said: ‘All the operators and growers we spoke to stated that they had tried to recruit, and retain, British workers but without success. The farms are not normally in high unemployment areas, British workers are reluctant to live on the farm and growers state that British workers either cannot or will not work at the intensity required to earn the agricultural minimum wage.’ Agricultural work pays slightly higher than other unskilled labour, at £7.50 to £8.00 an hour compared to the minimum wage of £6.31, but workers are put off by the hard outdoor work and rural locations.","Minister made claim at National Farmers' Union conference in Birmingham .

The BBC drama controller has said there are not enough gay characters on TV. Ben Stephenson, who is himself gay, called on writers to come forward with more stories which focus on homosexuality. The comments were made during the BBC's Reflect and Represent talk at New Broadcasting House on Monday which aims to discuss the Corporation's future vision. Mr Stephenson said: 'I am diverse, in that sense (gay), and are there many portrayals of gay characters on television? I would say it's probably one of the lowest (represented) areas. 'When the great gay script comes in, I shall definitely be commissioning it.' Despite Mr Stephenson believing there is diversity in BBC drama he said there is still 'a long way to go'. Mr Stephenson was appointed controller of BBC drama in 2008. Last month Eastenders character Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) broke down in tears as he revealed to his father Mick (Danny Dyer) that he is gay. Johnny's sexuality was first revealed by his sister Nancy (Maddy Hill) during an explosive family argument at the Queen Vic - where Mick is landlord. Despite Nancy regretting her revelation and attempting to then deny it, Johnny makes the brave decision to come clean and tell his parents the truth. The episode showed Johnny sobbing into his father's shoulder before Mick is seen apparently reassuring is son that he made the right decision by coming out. The big reveal: Sam Strike's EastEnders character Johnny Carter will be seen revealing to father Mick (Danny Dyer) that he is gay in Friday night's episode of the BBC soap . Johnny's coming out comes after the New Year's Day episode of the show saw him kiss Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy), in a scene which prompted several complaints on social media. One person wrote: 'Danny dyers son............ Is gay? Never cringed so much from eastenders! That's not good. Poor danny.' And another added: '‘#EastEnders was a disgrace. No wonder it was on after 9. Kids watch this program. Being gay is wrong and it shouldn't be promoted #Dirty.' However, others applauded the show for introducing more gay characters and diversifying its storylines. It's alright, son: Mick reassures his son after he tearfully comes out following sister Nancy first dropping the bombshell the night before during a family row at the Queen Vic . Pete Lawson, who write the episode, said on Twitter: '2014, and gay teens kissing on a soap still draws complaints. 'Makes me even prouder to have written that ep.' Another writer on the soap, Daran Little, also tweeted: '10 years ago Coronation Street had complaints when I wrote Todd kissing Nick... now complaints about EastEnders gay kiss... no progress. Christopher and his Kind with Douglas booth as Heinz Neddermayer and Matt Smith as Christopher Isherwood was a one-off drama with gay characters . 'I thinks it's encouraging that Hollyoaks gay kisses don't get complaints, cos its viewers are young and accepting,' he wrote. Amanda Rice, head of diversity, told Broadcast: 'Reflect and Represent is about recognising that more needs to be done, exploring how we can all achieve greater impact celebrating the progress we have made. 'We want to make sure that all staff have the opportunity to share their thoughts and ideas.' Gay author Tom Rob Smith is writing a new drama about a gay spy for the BBC. The story will look at Danny, described as a ‘gregarious, hedonistic, but ill-equipped spy’ who falls for the ‘anti-social and enigmatic’ Alex. The drama will be going into production later this year and is expected to be lined up to air in 2015.","Ben Stephenson is gay and called for more storylines which focus on homosexuality .

David Cameron yesterday thanked David Bowie for backing the Union  as Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond branded Westminster politicians ‘thieves’. The Prime Minister revealed that he ‘let out a cry of joy’ when the music legend used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards last week to urge: ‘Scotland, stay with us.’ Mr Cameron spoke out as both he and Mr Salmond, Scotland’s First Minister, stepped up hostilities over independence – both taking their cabinets to Aberdeenshire to fight over the future of the oil industry. Delight: David Cameron revealed his reaction to David Bowie's pro-union message, which he admitted would resonate more than his own plea against independence . Supermodel Kate Moss delivered the 'stay with us' message from  67-year-old since who chose to stay in New York rather than attend the event in London to pick up his first Brit for 18 years . The Prime Minister, speaking yesterday . on an oil platform in the North Sea, made clear his delight that Bowie . had put the independence issue at the top of the agenda in a way he has . failed to do. Bowie did not . attend the awards, but his message was read by supermodel Kate Moss when . she collected his award for best male artist. Mr . Cameron, whose cabinet met in Aberdeen, told the BBC: ‘I was watching . the Brit Awards and when I saw Kate Moss leap to the stage and utter . those words I have to say I did let out a cry of joy because I’m sure . that maybe someone like David Bowie might be able to reach parts of . Scotland that perhaps I can’t.’ The . Prime Minister issued his own positive message, saying: ‘This family of . nations is better off together, not just that Scotland is better off in . the United Kingdom but we in the rest of the United Kingdom think that . we are better off with Scotland – that we want you to stay.’ First Minister Alex Salmond today accused Westminster politicians of 'jetting into Scotland and jetting out again' Despite taking their Cabinet's to meet just seven miles apart, Mr Cameron will not meet Mr Salmond who repeated his call for a debate with the Prime Minister . Yesterday . Mr Cameron argued that Scotland risks losing £200billion of investment . in the oil industry if it chooses independence in September’s . referendum. He said that . only by staying with the UK could the oil industry get the tax breaks it . needs to invest in those North Sea oil and gas reserves that are harder . to reach. But Mr Salmond, a . former Westminster MP, said: ‘I’ve got some form in oil and gas as I . was an energy economist before I fell among thieves, by which I mean the . House of Commons and not the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish . Government.’ Mr Salmond, . whose cabinet met in Portlethen, near Aberdeen, earlier told Radio 4’s . Today programme that he had been working in the oil industry when Mr . Cameron ‘was fooling around on the playing fields of Eton.’ Bowie's . surprise intervention sparked a furious response from nationalists, who . used the internet to tell the singer to 'f*** off back to Mars' and . 'keep your big mouth shut'. However, . the pro-union campaign, led by former Chancellor Alistair Darling, have . been delighted with the impact of the comments from one of the world's . biggets music stars. They hope to persuade other celebrities to join the campaign ahead of the referendum on September 18. Mr Cameron today revealed his reaction to Moss's message at Thursday;'s Brit Awards. The . Prime Minister told the BBC: 'I was watching the Brit Awards and when I . saw Kate Moss leap to the stage and utter those words I have to say I . did let out a cry of joy because I'm sure that maybe someone like David . Bowie might be able to reach parts of Scotland that perhaps I can't.' The . admission came as Alex Salmond accused Westminster ministers of jetting . in on ‘Scare Force One’ to bully and threaten Scots, as his own Cabinet . arrived in nearby Porthlethen on a bus. Mr Salmond has repeatedly challenged . Mr Cameron to a head-to-head debate, but the PM insists arguments over . independence should be thrashed out between Scots. Mr Cameron (left) toured the BP Eastern Area Trough Project oil platform in the North Sea, around 100 miles east of Aberdeen . The Prime Minister warned investment in the oil and gas industry would be threatened by Scottish independence . While they hold their meetings just a short drive apart, there are no plans for the two men to meet. Downing . Street insisted that because Mr Cameron does not have a vote in the . referendum it would be wrong for him to go head-to-head with Mr Salmond. Instead . he wants to see Mr Salmond go up against former Labour chancellor . Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign. Visiting . an oil rig 150 miles east of Aberdeen, Mr Cameron said: ‘I profoundly . believe the United Kingdom will be better off if we all stay together. ‘We . all bring things to this United Kingdom and I've been very clear to say . on behalf of the rest of the United Kingdom to the people in Scotland . we want you to stay. ‘We . think that we'll benefit by you being in the United Kingdom, by keeping . this family together, but in the end the choice has to be for people in . Scotland. ‘It's their . choice, they will make it, but I think it's important to lay out all the . arguments of the benefits of staying together.’ The PM warned that an independent Scotland would find it harder to invest and deal with oil market volatility. ‘Because . we are a top 10 economy we can afford the tax allowances, the . investment, the long term structure that is necessary to make sure we . recover as much from the North Sea as possible,’ he said. The . Prime Minister argues that vital investment in the oil industry could . be put in jeopardy because Scotland would be unable to afford the . generous tax breaks needed to encourage firms to seek out the remaining . stocks. Mr Cameron claims . the 'broad shoulders' of the UK Government were able to support . investment in the industry as volatility in the oil market could have a . dramatic effect on Scottish finances in the event of independence. The . visit is designed to boost support against separation and comes as a . poll shows support for independence has stalled while backing for the . Union has bounced back. The . Scottish National Party is desperate to present Mr Cameron as an . out-of-touch Conservative Englishman talking down to Scots. But he has rejected advisers who urged him to keep out of the debate over independence, ahead of the referendum on September 18. Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon arrive at a meeting of the Scottish Cabinet at Portlethen Parish Church near Aberdeen . Mr Salmond  accused Westminster politicians of lecturing Scots as he chaired a meeting of his own Cabinet . Mr Salmond went on the attack, accusing Tory ministers from London of jetting in to lecture Scots. He . said: ‘Why don’t we have a debate? Why don’t we get that debate? Because I think there’s a difference between delivering a message on . high or sending his Chancellor or his Foreign Secretary up to Scotland . to tell us what to do. ‘There’s . a difference between jetting into Scotland and jetting out again than . having a real democratic debate about the future of the country.’ Following reports of senior ministers flying into the RAF base in Aberdeen, the SNP stepped up its attack. Angus . Roberston, SNP leader in Westmintser, said: 'This Cabinet Minister is . clearly living the high life by chartering ""Scare Force One"" to Scotland . – so that Westminster can once again talk down an independent . Scotland.' North Sea: The Cormorant oil field, north-east of Lerwick, Shetland. Scotland could miss out on a £200billion jackpot from North Sea oil if it votes for independence, David Cameron will warn today . According to an ICM poll, 37 per cent said they will vote Yes while 49 per cent said they will vote No. The most significant factor in the latest poll is the swing from the 'don't knows' towards voting No. An ICM poll in September found 32 per cent support for Yes, 49 per cent No and 19 per cent undecided. The . Yes camp took five points from the Noes in a second ICM poll in . January, with the Yes vote rising to 37 per cent, No dropping to 44 per . cent and a steadfast 19 per cent still undecided.

When Labour's first minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at a trust, his government waited over a year to order a probe . Labour stood accused last night of presiding over abuses and cover-ups on the scale of the Mid Staffordshire healthcare scandal at another trust. A leaked copy of an investigation into the appalling neglect of an elderly patient found that a Welsh trust failed to hold a proper inquiry into the case, despite having told her family that it had taken place. And when Labour’s first minister in Wales, Carwyn Jones, was alerted to the scandal of poor nursing standards at the trust, his government waited over a year to order a probe. Eighty-two-year-old Lilian Williams died after a string of failings at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales. She was denied life-saving medication, allowed to starve for days and left in agony because her prosthetic leg was not taken off at night. Her son said the three years of cover-ups and delays put other patients at risk, because action to improve standards were not taken. Dozens of other examples of poor care at the trust have emerged over the past few months – adding to fears of a Mid Staffs scandal in Wales. Three nurses have been arrested over the falsification of patient records. The family’s lawyer said that the case was even worse than that of Mid Staffs because of the trust’s attempt to ‘suppress’ criticisms and cover up failings. Lilian Williams, a mother of five who was left with one leg after an amputation, died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital, which is part of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University local health board. In 2010, she was admitted to the hospital with shingles, but when her family went to visit they found her lying in excrement. Eighty-two-year-old Lilian Williams died after a string of failings at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales . Her son Gareth, 54, said life-saving medicine was scattered on the floor, and she had spent the weekend without food or water. The family was told that police and social services would be carrying out a ‘Protection of Vulnerable Adults’ inquiry, and that staff would be retrained to ensure the neglect did not happen again. But two years later, when Mrs Williams was admitted to a different hospital run by the same trust, she had to endure ‘the same shameful neglect’. When her son demanded to know why the improvements promised had not been implemented, the hospital admitted the inquiry had never taken place. ‘We’d been lied to,’ he said. A POVA inquiry was finally held, which found that Mrs Williams’s dentures had not been removed at night, that nurses failed to administer prescribed medicine, and that they failed to care for her amputated limb. The report, which has been seen by the Mail, concluded that it was ‘proved’ that the board had given ‘false statements and false assurances’ over the scope of the earlier inquiry, and that the family had been ‘misled’. Under devolution, the NHS in Wales is controlled by Labour – not by the Coalition based in Westminster – and at the time of the failings, the trust’s board was chaired by a former Labour MP Win Griffiths. Lilian Williams's son Gareth, 54, said life-saving medicine was scattered on the floor, and she had spent the weekend without food or water . Jeremy Hunt called earlier this month for a proper inquiry into failings of hospitals in Wales. It emerged last week that the Welsh NHS ignored warnings from NHS England that death rates at hospitals like the one in Bridgend were dangerously high. The Health Secretary said: ‘These tragic examples of poor care in Labour-controlled Wales deserve proper public scrutiny. It is a total betrayal of patients in Wales to think the lessons of Mid Staffs somehow stop at the border.’ Mr Williams notified Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones of the case in June 2012, but it took until October 2013 for Welsh health minister Mark Drakeford to call a public review into standards at the trust. Last night Mr Jones said he was involved in the case not as first minister but as Mr Williams’s local assembly member. He said: ‘It is simply not true to say that no action has been taken by myself. I met with him and made several representations on his behalf.’ Last night a source at the ABMU trust denied there had been a cover-up and said there had been a misunderstanding over what sort of inquiry was going to be held. The source said that although there had not been a POVA inquiry with police and social services involvement in 2010, there had been an internal investigation. Lilian Williams’s family only found out that an inquiry had not taken place into her appalling care in 2010 when she was admitted to hospital again two years later. When Mrs Williams, pictured, became ill in August 2012, she begged her son Gareth not to take her back to the Princess of Wales, so they went to the neighbouring Neath Port Talbot Hospital, part of the  same trust. However Mr Williams said the standard of care at the second hospital was even worse than before. ‘We found her slumped in the chair amid pools of urine, tablets dropped and dissolved, bloody swabs hanging around,’ he recalled. ‘Two years on, we were finding the same shocking neglect. What this showed is that it was endemic throughout the trust; this culture of nonchalance and indifference.’ Later in the year she was admitted a final time. As her life ebbed away, the doctors withdrew treatment because they said she had pneumonia. But the post-mortem examination showed she hadn’t had pneumonia at all. Her death was put down to a heart attack, probably due to the withdrawal of anti-blood clot medication. After the POVA inquiry found that Mrs Williams had been treated badly, the police began to look at the hospital and have arrested three nurses for fabricating blood sugar records. Mr Williams said: ‘Three nurses have been hung out to dry to protect management, to cover up that fabrication of records had been going on for years.’","Lilian Williams died after failings at Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend .

A nurse was left in agony after being bitten on the bottom by a false widow spider that had crawled into her onesie. Catherine Moretti, 44, from Southport, was at home with her son watching television when she was bitten. She said: 'I felt something bite me and it became really itchy, but at first I thought it was just psychological. 'But by Tuesday morning it had swollen, become really red and felt hot and very uncomfortable. I couldn’t even sit down' Ms Moretti was given antibiotics by her GP but they made no difference and the following day the bite turned jet black. 'By this point I was terrified, so I went to the minor injuries unit at Ormskirk Hospital', she said. 'They advised that I stay and have it checked out but I was due to fly to Switzerland the next day and as I have health insurance there, I decided to take the trip as planned.' While in Switzerland, Ms Moretti's bite worsened and she began to suffer necrosis, which can lead to gangrene. She said: 'By Sunday, the bite had become really nasty. 'There was a gaping hole underneath and it was oozing quite badly. 'A Swiss doctor informed me that the antibiotics I had been given in the UK were useless and wanted me to have an operation there to have the wound drained and cleaned. 'I couldn’t, as I needed to fly home days later, so I had to make do with a much stronger form of antibiotics and some heavy duty painkillers.' Catherine Moretti's false widow spider bite which turned black before it was finally cured with very strong anti-biotics . Fashion statement: Onesies have become increasingly popular in recent years . Luckily, the medicine seems to have worked and Ms Moretti is now on the way to recovery. She wants her story to serve as a warning to others. She said: 'I don’t want to scare people but I want them to be mindful that poisonous spiders do exist in this country. 'As far as I am aware, the media has only reported incidents in the south of England up to now. 'I believe there has been a false widow spider in my home at least once before, as I remember seeing a spider in the summer with a peculiar pattern on its back.' The false widow spider, or Steatoda Nobilis, has been cited as Britain’s most venomous arachnid. It has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream coloured markings that are often said to look like a skull. False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions . of false widows, pictured right, Britain's most poisonous spider, are . found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known as Steatoda Nobilis, it is frequently confused with the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The . species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a . skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The . Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is . spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in . southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . The . key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it . because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To . avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the . only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the . four legs. Do not leave . clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in . them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If . you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with . your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if . you are storing things. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Catherine Moretti, from Southport, was with her son when she was bitten .

A grieving mother killed herself after the Samaritans refused to reveal details of her drowned son’s calls to its helpline, a coroner has said. The inquest into the death of 18-year-old Matthew Williams heard how a ‘lack of co-operation’ from the charity may have contributed to his mother’s suicide. While Matthew was missing, Susan Williams, 43, had discovered that the last phonecall made by his son was to the Samaritans’ helpline. Tragedy: Matthew Williams, right, said today his wife Susan, centre, was driven to suicide after Samaritans refused to co-operate when their son Matthew, left, went missing, an inquest heard . Bereft: Dennis and Susan Williams pictured holding a picture of son Matthew. Mr Williams told his son's inquest his wife never recovered from her son's death having believed he was in a Samaritans safe house . The court heard how she begged the charity to tell her about his state of mind. But the charity refused in accordance with its rules, saying the information was confidential. Struggle: Dennis Williams said Susan, left, 'went downhill' after Matthew was discovered dead and later committed suicide . Her . husband Dennis told the hearing how she then resorted to making a call . to the helpline herself, claiming to be suicidal, in a bid to gauge the . response her son might have received. When . a Samaritans worker told her she could stay in a ‘safe house’, it gave . the full-time mother false hope that this is what had happened to her . missing son, Mr Williams suggested. But . a month later Matthew’s body was discovered by a fisherman at sea, . close to the village of Malltraeth, in Anglesey. The court, sitting in . Llangefni, was told that Matthew had suffered from mental illness in the . past and was worried about his upcoming A-levels when he disappeared . from the family home in Bangor on April 23, 2012. Police . mounted a huge search and discovered the straight-A student, who hoped . to become a doctor, had made three calls to the Samaritans on the night . he vanished, with the final call made close to the Menai Bridge. Mr . Williams, 55, said: ‘My wife believed he [Matthew] was still alive. She . thought for weeks that he was in a safe house and didn’t want to be . contacted. ‘After we buried him she went downhill. She loved him – he was her little boy.’ Mr . Williams discovered the body of his wife of 16 years hanging at their . home in August 2012. She had also taken a ‘toxic’ dose of . anti-depressants. The couple have two other children. Coroner Dewi . Pritchard-Jones said: ‘I am sure the uncertainty relating to the death . of [Mrs Williams’s] son and the absence of any information and no . co-operation from the Samaritans may well have contributed to her . death.’ Only when the . coroner threatened to issue a summons for the head of the charity to . give evidence did the Samaritans eventually agree to co-operate with the . inquest. In the end it was . ‘of no use’ to the inquiry, the coroner added. The organisation said . Matthew’s call had been classed as ‘category one’, which is not . considered to pose a risk to life. The coroner said he could not say for certain whether the teenager intended to kill himself and recorded an open verdict. Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of Samaritans, right, said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to the Williams family. 'It's important to remember that suicide is a complex issue and is seldom the result of a single factor but likely to have several inter-related causes. 'Samaritans has the utmost respect for our callers' privacy and we take this issue very seriously. This is an essential and greatly valued feature of the service we provide. 'We believe that without our promise to keep everything confidential, people who have the greatest need might never have the courage or trust to speak to us. This confidentiality has been in place since Samaritans was founded sixty years ago. Since then we've received more than 115 million calls which clearly demonstrate the trust that the wider community has in Samaritans and the importance of maintaining our confidentiality policy. 'In order to retain the integrity of our service this policy remains in place even if we never hear from our caller again. 'There are only four circumstances in which Samaritans will release information obtained during a call, in these circumstances we will fully co-operate by sharing the information held with the relevant authorities: If a caller directly asks us to pass on information to someone else; we receive a court order requiring us to share information; we receive a call about acts of terrorism or bomb warnings; the safety of our volunteers or the delivery of our service is threatened, for example by making it difficult for other people to get hold of us.' Mr Pritchard-Jones said the inquest into Matthew’s death had been delayed because of the attitude of the charity. Only when he threatened Samaritans’ chief executive, Catherine Johnstone, with a witness summons did they eventually agree to disclose information. In the end it was ‘of no use’ to the inquiry, the coroner added. The organisation said Matthew’s call had been classed as ‘category one’, which is not considered to pose a risk to life. Mr Pritchard-Jones said: ‘They (Samaritans) were concerned that they might be disclosing confidential information or conversations relating to the deceased person and his family. 'When I explained all I wanted was to try and find out what had happened to Matthew, to know his intentions, and to try to work out how he came to be in the sea, that led to a change of attitude.’ The coroner said he couldn’t say for certain whether the teenager intended to kill himself and recorded an open verdict. Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Samaritans, offered her ‘sincere condolences’ to the Williams family. But she stressed that the charity took a callers’ privacy ‘very seriously’ and only disclosed information . if specifically requested to do so by the caller, in the event of a terrorist act or bomb warning, if required to do so by a court order or if the safety of their staff or service was under threat. ‘We believe that without our promise to keep everything confidential, people who have the greatest need might never have the courage or trust to speak to us,’ she said. ‘In order to retain the integrity of our service this policy remains in place even if we never hear from our caller again.’ For confidential . support call the Samaritans in the UK on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local .

Tony Blair could be called to give evidence about so-called 'get out of jail free' letters for IRA terrorists after David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into the scandal . Tony Blair could be called to give evidence about so-called ‘get out of jail free’ letters for IRA terrorists after David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into the scandal. The Prime Minister announced a judge-led probe into effective amnesties for Republican killers after a catastrophic blunder let the man accused of the Hyde Park bombing in 1982 walk free from court. Mr Cameron intervened after Northern Ireland’s First Minister Peter Robinson threatened to quit unless there was a full inquiry into John Downey’s release, claiming was kept in the dark about the system. The judge, who has not yet been named, will be allowed to quiz Mr Blair, former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain and Sinn Fein figures about the letters, which have been branded ‘dirty deals’ by MPs. Mr Blair was Prime Minister when the system was set up by Mr Hain in 2005. 187 letters have been sent to IRA men who were on the run telling them they will not face trial on the basis of the evidence against them. But Downey, who has been blamed for the bomb blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses, escaped trial because he was mistakenly sent a letter. The inquiry will check whether others have been incorrectly sent the letters and has the power to recommend an end to the system. Mr Cameron yesterday made clear that if new evidence emerges against a suspect they could still be prosecuted. ‘It is important to set out the facts of what has happened,’ he said. ‘When we came to power in 2010, we inherited a process where letters were sent, setting out the factual position on whether or not some individuals were wanted for questioning by the police. ‘This process continued under this government. There was never any amnesty or guarantee of immunity for anyone, and there isn’t now.’ The Prime Minister said the judge would report back by the end of May and the report would be published. A catastrophic blunder let the John Downey, the man accused of the Hyde Park bombing in 1982 walk free from court . ‘The judge will have full access to government files and government officials. This needs to happen quickly. It’s right that we should take swift action. It’s such a dreadful mistake that we have to make absolutely sure that other letters were not sent in error.’ Mr Cameron said that he did not want to ‘unpick’ the decisions of his predecessors when pushing the peace process forward. ‘Very difficult decisions were taken around the time of the Good Friday Agreement and around the . time of the peace process.’ But a No 10 spokesman made clear that the judge could call for an end to the letters scheme altogether. ‘He will be able to make recommendations on this or related matters.’ A Downing Street source said ‘serving ministers and officials will have to give evidence if asked’. While Mr Blair could not be forced to do so he is expected to cooperate if asked. Downey, who has been blamed for the bomb blast that killed four soldiers and seven horses, escaped trial because he was mistakenly sent a letter . Mr Robinson welcomed the inquiry and Mr Cameron’s insistence that paramilitaries who have had letters could still be charged if further evidence against them emerges. Withdrawing his threat of resignation, he said: ‘I think that makes it clear that they have a fairly worthless piece of paper. I think there will be a lot of on-the-runs who will sleep less easy tonight.’ Former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble said he knew ‘nothing’ about the letters and said the inquiry must find out who signed off the scheme. He said: ‘I would dearly love to know who signed off those letters. We need to find out how this process came into existence and how it operated. He disputed claims by Jonathan Powell - Mr Blair’s former chief of staff - and Mr Hain that the scheme was effectively the result of the Good Friday Agreement. Lord Trimble said: ‘The people who are making comments that this was all part of the peace process, it was not. The Good Friday Agreement, which had a provision for prisoner release, was quite clear there was only prisoner release, there would be no amnesties. ‘You can’t have a situation where one party - Sinn Fein - and the Government get together to undermine the Good Friday Agreement, because that is what has happened.’","Judge-led probe will be carried out into amnesties for Republican killers .

A couple who both carry the cystic fibrosis gene have beaten odds to have a fit and healthy baby boy - after nine years of trying to have a child. Chris Kiernan, who has cystic fibrosis, and wife Marylee, who carries the gene, had almost given up hope of ever becoming parents. Married in 2004, they starting trying for a baby the following year but with no joy. Chris and Marylee Kiernan tried unsuccessfully for nine years to have a baby before they conceived Alexander. Mr Keirnan has cystic fibrosis and his wife is a carrier of the genetic condition . Baby Alexander was conceived using fertility treatment. This allowed doctors to ensure he wouldn't have cystic fibrosis. He was born completely healthy last Saturday . According to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, although men who have cystic fibrosis can enjoy a normal sex life, about 98 per cent are infertile. This is because the vas deferens, the tube that carries sperm from the testis to the penis, does not develop properly. After numerous failed attempts and a miscarriage in 2009, the disheartened couple, both aged 32, considered IVF treatment. It was only as they were looking into the options that Mrs Kiernan discovered she was a cystic fibrosis carrier. The couple, from Camelon, Falkirk, then had to consider a complex set of options to ensure that if they had a baby, it would be protected from the genetic condition that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive system. Instead of ordinary IVF, they had to travel to London to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis - a procedure that provides a slimmer chance of getting pregnant than IVF but that allows the baby to be screened for genetic illnesses. Mr and Mrs Kiernan (pictured at their wedding in 2004) say they are overjoyed and relieved that Alexander has now been born safely . And after more negative results, they had given up all hope. But last Saturday little baby Alexander arrived five weeks early but fighting fit. Mrs Kiernan said: ‘It’s amazing he’s here. I keep looking at him and can’t believe he’s mine.’ About one in every 2,500 babies in the UK have cystic fibrosis. To be born with the condition both of a child's parents have to carry the gene or have the condition. If this is the case, their child will have a one in four chance of having cystic fibrosis, a one in four chance of not having the gene at all and a 50 per cent chance of being a carrier but not having the condition. Source: NHS Choices . Mr Kiernan, an HGV mechanic, said: ‘We were told there was a very high risk of the baby having cystic fibrosis and being very ill. ‘So instead of ordinary IVF, we had to have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis where the chances of getting pregnant are slimmer than normal IVF.’ Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis scans the cells of embryos, checking the genes for genetic conditions or disorders. The couple travelled from their home in Scotland to London’s Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in 2007 as this is the only place in the UK where the treatment was available. Mrs Kiernan said: ‘A week before Christmas in 2012, we got negative results again, and I thought, “that’s it, I’m not going through it again”. ‘I was in a lot of pain and had had two operations along the way. ‘By now, Edinburgh Royal was offering the tests, and a nurse begged me to try again.’ After paying £5,000 for a last try, the couple found out in June 2013 that Mrs Kiernan was pregnant. Mrs Kiernan said: 'It's amazing he's here. I keep looking at him and can't believe he's mine' Mr and Mrs Kiernan almost gave up after their first attempt at fertility treatment failed . Mrs Kiernan said: ‘We’re so happy. It was such a big relief.’ Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. This causes a cough, recurrent chest infections, and poor weight gain in children. The condition affects about one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK and reduces life expectancy significantly.

Wound: Hotel chef Azmat Farooq was left with a gash four inches long and an inch deep to his leg after being attacked by a police dog on his own doorstep last week.

A thrill-seeking paraglider fell 30ft to his death after telling his worried partner: ‘Wouldn’t it be a good way to go.’ Engineer Rob Kirkbride, 48, from Lytham, Lancashire, died after his paraglider wing, which is part of the parachute, collapsed shortly after take-off as 5mph wind speeds increased by up to five times at a renowned paragliding hill. Mr Kirkbride’s death was witnessed by his friend, a fellow paraglider, who ran to his aid when he saw him come crashing down. He was found unconscious on the ground and, despite efforts to revive him, was pronounced dead at the scene. Devastated: Angela Feehan has told how her partner, Rob Kirkbride, who fell 30ft to his death while paragliding, said to her: 'Wouldn't it be a good way to go' He died when his paraglider wing collapsed shortly after take-off as 5mph winds increased by five times . Only hours earlier Mr Kirkbride had kissed his partner, Angela Feehan, 42, goodbye at their home before setting off to a paragliding territory in Pendle Hill, Lancashire. The inquest in Blackburn was told the father-of-two had been a competent paraglider and had been paragliding for the last couple of years. After assessing the ‘benign’ weather conditions on December 4 he took to the skies using his new equipment which he had bought just a few weeks prior. The inquest was told that the equipment had not been at fault and his death amounted to a combination of changing winds, turbulence and convection that had caused his wing to collapse. Miss Feehan fought back tears after the inquest to say that he had been ‘an inspiration’. She said: ‘That morning was the same as every morning. I took him up a cup of tea and gave him a kiss. ‘I always said ""be careful"" and he would say: ""but wouldn’t it be a good way to go"". He died knowing I loved him and doing something he loved. He would take any opportunity he had to go and fly.’ Miss Feehan said: 'I always said ""be careful"" and he would say: ""but wouldn't it be a good way to go"" The friend who had accompanied Mr Kirkbride to Pendle Hill told the inquest that they had met through social media groups relating to the sport. He told the inquest that they had parked their car and walked a short distance to the position from which they were going to launch. But he said he had packed away his equipment after misjudging his own launch and injuring his ankle. He said: ‘The risk to any flying activity is that there is always a threat of an accident caused by the weather conditions, not doing the necessary checks, falling outside ability. ‘We took stock of the weather conditions and whether it was worsening or getting better. He deployed his equipment and I assumed he did the normal safety checks. He went into soaring pattern and soared across the front of the ridge. ‘He went went into hovering mode which indicated he was trying to come in to a landing. He flew across the face of the hill, gained a little bit of height and flew around and behind me. ‘I viewed half of his canopy collapse. He was flying forward, as he got to a level the whole right-hand side of the canopy collapsed under himself. It had half the capability of the wing. He travelled forward and down at speed at which point he impacted the ground. I didn’t see the impact.’ The inquest in Blackburn was told the father-of-two had been a competent paraglider and had been paragliding for the last couple of years . He told how he scrambled to his friend before calling the emergency services and performing CPR. North West Air Ambulance and Rossendale and Pendle Mountain Rescue were also called to the scene. The inquest was told that Mr Kirkbride had been wearing a safety helmet and a broken head camera was found close to his body. No footage of his fall had been recorded. Post-mortem tests concluded he had died from multiple injuries including multiple bone fractures and a haemorrhage of the spinal chord. Technical manager for the British Hand GIiding and Paragliding Association Mark Dale was asked to prepare an analysis of the incident. He told the inquest that Mr Kirkbride’s wing had collapsed at a very low height which can occur if flying into turbulence. He added that the wind speed on the day had increased from 5-10mph to at least 18-25mph but ‘could quite probably have become even stronger’. Post-mortem tests concluded he had died from multiple injuries including multiple bone fractures and a haemorrhage of the spinal chord . He said: ‘Evidence suggests that the weather conditions seem suitable for flying initially but very rapidly become unsuitable. It is quite possible he was the first ever paraglider that attempted to top land that part of the hill in these wind speeds. Winds can change pace very rapidly. ‘It is quite clear that conditions were changing very rapidly, it can very easily lead to getting caught out. With ten years flying experience he may have looked at conditions and noticed that they were changing. They were surprisingly benign to begin with and rapidly became worse.’ He added that another pilot had chosen not to fly after assessing the wind that day. Coroner Michael Singleton recorded a verdict of accidental death and said: ‘It seems to represent a very tragic accident. It is clearly a sport that with it brings some dangers, part of the exhilaration is the danger. It is tragic that some people end up paying the ultimate price.’","Rob Kirkbride, 48, died when his paraglider wing, part of the parachute, collapsed after take-off as 5mph wind speeds increased by up to five times .

Lawyers have pledged to stage a second strike to undermine the Government’s legal aid shake-up after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a final raft of reforms. Members of the Criminal Bar Association will bring the court system to a halt when they take part in a nationwide walkout next Friday in protest at the cuts. They insist the reductions in fees paid by the taxpayer will stop bright legal brains becoming criminal lawyers. Some junior barristers earn as little as £13,000 a year, their leaders said. Lawyers have pledged to stage a second strike to undermine the Government¿s legal aid shake-up after Justice Secretary Chris Grayling published a final raft of reforms . Lawyers on strike outside the Old Bailey last month were branded the most elite picket line in the history of British industrial relations. Their cause was undermined after one young barrister was pictured clutching a £1,100 Mulberry handbag, though she later claimed it had been a gift from her mother. Legal hackles are up because the Ministry of Justice is slashing £215million from the annual £2.1billion legal aid bill. The cuts target the fees paid to barristers defending criminals. Among the most contentious proposals is a 17 per cent cut in litigators’ fees to be phased in from next month. Yesterday barristers lashed out at the Government for pressing ahead with ‘significant’ legal aid cuts. Nicholas Lavender, chairman of the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said: ‘We are bitterly disappointed that, despite a sustained campaign emphasising that these proposals are contrary to the public interest, the Government is pressing ahead with significant cuts to legal aid for advocacy in the Crown Court. ‘These cuts are financially unnecessary, will cause significant damage to the justice system and to our international reputation for upholding the rule of law, and will drive skilled and experienced advocates away from publicly-funded criminal work.’ Privileged: Barrister Charlotte Hole (front row, second left) clutches a £1,100 Mulberry bag during January's action. She was among thousands of barristers across the UK to stage a protest against legal aid cuts . Alongside plans to cut legal aid fees, Mr Grayling announced measures aimed at supporting lawyers through the period of transition. They include plans to overhaul fees paid to defence lawyers so they no longer lose out when a case heard in the Crown Court, which could have been heard in the magistrates’ court, is dropped by the prosecution. Mr Grayling also announced plans to bring in interim payments to help with lawyers’ cash flow in long trials. He said: ‘This Government is dealing with an unprecedented financial challenge and I have no choice but to look for the savings I have to make across the full range of the Ministry of Justice’s work. ‘I cannot exempt legal aid from this but that doesn’t mean I don’t understand how challenging these reductions will be.’ Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘Legal aid is a lifeline to many of the most vulnerable in our society. A civilised society needs a system of legal aid to ensure access to justice for everyone.’","Members of the Criminal Bar Association will bring court system to halt .

Nile Ranger arriving at Newcastle Crown Court today, on day four of his trial where he is facing charges of rape . Ex-Premier League footballer Nile Ranger who is accused of raping a woman in a hotel, told a jury: 'I'm nothing like Jack the Ripper'. He made the comment in connection to the killer's name being mentioned during a series of phone messages where Ranger was trying to persuade his accuser to spend time with him, days before the alleged attack. Newcastle Crown Court heard earlier that when the victim refused he said: 'You’re moving like I am Jack the Ripper' in which the victim replied 'Nile Ripper'. During his evidence, Ranger told the court how he has never had sexual activity with a female against her wishes but admitted having 'quite a few' one night stands. A transcript of the message exchanges was read through with Ranger during his evidence. Prosecutors claim the content of the messages show the woman was not sexually interested in him and had refused his advances. In one message the alleged victim called him a 'sex pest'. During cross examination prosecutor Christina Egerton told Ranger: 'That's whatyou were, you were pestering her weren't you and you wanted sex didn't you?' Ranger said: 'As well as a friendship.' When asked whether sex or friendship was his priority in relation to the woman, he replied: 'Friendship.' Miss Egerton asked if sex with the woman was important to him at all, Ranger replied: 'Not really but I found her attractive.' Ranger said he would have 'taken every day as it comes' and did not want the woman purely for sex. Now with Swindon Town, and nursing a hamstring injury which meant he sat down to give evidence at Newcastle Crown Court, Ranger denied raping the woman he had been messaging over three to four months last January, insisting they had consensual sex twice. Mr Hedworth listed Ranger’s previous convictions which include burglary, handling stolen goods and robbery when he was a teenager growing up in north London. His offences continued after he signed for Newcastle United and he was sentenced for drink driving in November 2011, drunk and disorderly, scuffling with two police officers on another night out, and battery when he pulled his then girlfriend’s hair last year, Mr Hedworth said. His barrister then asked: 'Have you ever had sexual activity with a female against her wishes?' Ranger replied: 'Never.' The woman alleged she was raped in the Carlton Hotel, Jesmond, after agreeing to meet the footballer in a city centre bar. She said she could not remember anything until she woke up naked in the hotel room the next morning. Ranger told her she should take the morning after pill and she left, and they continued to swap messages that day, it was said. Now with Swindon Town, and nursing a hamstring injury which meant he sat down to give evidence at Newcastle Crown Court, Ranger denied raping the woman he had been messaging over three to four months last January, insisting they had consensual sex twice . She then visited her GP, was checked at hospital and made a rape allegation to police. After Ranger was arrested, his solicitor gave police a hand-written statement in which he said they got drunk, went to the hotel and had sex twice in 'various positions', the jury heard. In a second police interview the player revealed he paid £30 for the room, which was half-price because he was friends with the manager. He told detectives he helped the woman get up in the road outside the hotel after she dropped her handbag, rubbed her back and comforted her. In the interview he said: 'I’m a gentleman yer kna (you know), I’m rubbing her back, making sure she’s all right, holding her.' The next morning Ranger took a photograph of the hotel sheets with the room key on the bed, but he deleted the image after he was arrested, the court heard. Asked by Mr Hedworth how he now felt about taking the picture, he told the court: 'It was wrong, but at the time I was not thinking.' Asked why he took it, Ranger replied: 'I haven’t a clue, to be honest.' Mr Hedworth asked why he deleted the picture of the sheets, which experts were able to retrieve. Ranger replied: 'I knew the picture was wrong. I knew it did not look right.' He said the rape arrest was a factor in his contract ending on Tyneside. 'To be honest, with Newcastle I was getting in a bit of bother, lateness and stuff' he said. 'It was like a ticking time-bomb with the whole rape allegation. It affected me.' Trial: Nile Ranger, seen here (right) competing for the ball during a match for Newcastle against Fulham, denies rape . On the day of his arrest he was packing to move on loan to Hull City - then third in the Championship and chasing promotion to the Premier League, he said. 'I was getting no love or first-team action with Newcastle,' he said. 'I was literally packing my things on the day of my arrest. 'Once I got arrested, the next day it was all over the press.' Ranger told the jury the loan move to Hull fell through. 'With football and a lot of things, it put a pause on a lot of things,' he said. His contract at Newcastle United was terminated in due course, the jury heard. Since then he has signed for Swindon Town and started scoring goals again until injury struck. The court heard how the phone also contained photographs of the woman dancing from the night of the alleged attack and a selfie of the two of them together. In a police statement following his arrest Nile Ranger said: 'The victim and I entered the room together. By this stage we had been drinking alcohol for about three hours. 'We were drunk but aware of our actions. For the next three hours the victim and I had consensual sex. 'We had sex in various positions including her being on top of me and then slept together and she left at approximately 10am. She has since sent messages from her phone referring to our night out together.' Ranger also told police in his interview how he told the taxi driver to take them to a hotel and the victim was cool with it. He said: 'She didn’t say take me home, she said cool.' Christine Egerton, prosecuting, told the jury how the alleged victim had visited the GP for emergency contraception the following morning before visiting the emergency department at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The woman then reported Ranger to the police station the following day and he was arrested at his home in Forest Hall. No alcohol or drugs were found in the victim’s system by the time the tests were carried out by police. The trial continues.

Sir Trevor Brooking, the former England international who represented the Football Association at the funeral service, said: 'He was one of the most genuine invidividuals you would ever be likely to meet. 'Everyone admired and respected him. To come to this event today, over 50 years since he played, and see all these people both here in the minster and on the streets, I can't think of many who would get the same reaction. 'As a player, he was the match-winner, the crowd-pleaser, the one who could make the difference - I was a youngster in primary school when he was playing, I would watch him on a black and white telly and then go out into the garden with my brother to try to emulate him.'

'You only have to mention Preston and Preston North End... the conversation soon turns to Tom Finney and that sums up everything the man did for the club, the city and the game of football.'

Murdered: Father-of-three Dean Armitage, 49, who was killed as he tried to stop a thief stealing his Range Rover from the driveway of his home . A car thief who murdered a father-of-three on his driveway as he was making off with the family Range Rover has been jailed for life. Burglar David Sindall, 34, clubbed Dean Armitage on the head with a heavy metal torch as the businessman fought him outside his family home in Hoyland, South Yorkshire. The blow sent Mr Armitage crumpling to the driveway's concrete surface, shattering his skull, where Sindall punched and kicked him before fleeing. He never regained consciousness and died three weeks later. Sindall, a career burglar who had previously been jailed for armed robbery, had been drinking before breaking into 49-year-old Mr Armitage's home through an unlocked back door at 3.15am. He discovered the keys to the haulage firm boss's Range Rover in the kitchen and decided to use them to make off with the vehicle. Mr Armitage was alerted to the theft by the sound of the car's engine starting, and he rushed out in his underwear and pulled open the driver's-side door. A scuffle ensued, with Sindall telling the businessman: 'I'm gonna show thee.. f***ing seriously.. show thee.' As Mr Armitage tried to pull Sindall from the driver's seat the crook struck him a 'heavy blow' to the left side of his head with a lit torch, then punched and kicked him before running off. The now unconscious Mr Armitage - who leaves three children, Charlotte, Chloe and Josh - had suffered a massive skull fracture at the back of his head. He was taken to Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital where despite neurosurgery he never woke up. He died on Friday, August 9, three weeks after the incident. Sindall, of Eastwood, Rotherham had admitted manslaughter buy was found guilty of murder after a trial by a jury at Sheffield Crown Court. Jailing him for life with a minimum . term of 24 years, Mr Justice Stephen Males told him: 'While Dean . Armitage was man who built a business and a home for his family by his . hard work you are a man who preferred to get this by stealing them.' He . said Mr Armitage had rushed out to defend his property 'as he was . entitled to' and was punched in the jaw and body with 'considerable . force' leaving him insensible and bleeding. The . judge told the defendant; 'Thinking only of yourself you ran off. As . you did so you literally added insult to injury by shouting foul-mouthed . abuse at him.' Killer: Burglar David Sindall, 34, clubbed Mr Armitage on the head with a heavy metal torch, sending him crumpling to the ground and shattering his skull, where the thief kicked and punched him before running away . Neighbour Trevor Thornton, who witnessed the attack, said he saw Sindall kick and punch Mr Armitage as he was down on the ground before he ran off. Sindall took shopping he had stolen from the house to a friend's who described him as 'panicking and paranoid.' He told his friend: 'I might have killed somebody.' The court heard that Sindall, who was given a five-year jail term in 2006 for armed robbery, had been drinking in nearby pubs until 12.45am. The defendant told jurors he had found the house door 'ajar' and took the keys, a handbag and some shopping bags before trying to start the vehicle. He claimed he had been trying to get it into gear when Mr Armitage came out and grabbed him in the driver's seat. 'He was trying to haul me out. I just pushed him, my intention was to get some space between me and him so I could get away. I pushed him and he went backwards,' he said. 'It all happened so fast. He stumbled back, I didn't see him hit the floor. At no point did I have any intention of hurting him, unfortunately he smacked his head, didn't he?' But prosecutor Graham Reeds QC Reeds told the court: 'The prosecution say that if you deliberately hit a person over the head with an implement targeted to a vulnerable area like the temple or with sufficient force to make that person go weak at the knees and stumble whilst at the same time shouting ""I'll show thee. F***ing seriously' and that when the victim is insensible on the ground at least one further blow is delivered by a kick, well then what else can be intended but to cause really serious harm.' Crime scene: Police tape and an evidence tent outside Mr Armitage's home in Hoyland in West Yorkshire . Mr Armitage's widow widow Mandy, 48, who was office manager in the family business, said in a victim impact statement: 'Dean was cruelly taken from me trying to stop someone stealing our car from our driveway. 'Someone who thought it was OK to take things from other people rather than work hard to pay for their own things like Dean did.' She said: 'My husband Dean meant the world to me. Losing him is the hardest thing I have ever had to suffer.' After the hearing Detective Inspector Kevin Brown who led the inquiry said: 'I'm really pleased with the verdict. It was a difficult case that involved a lot of experts giving their opinion on the cause of the injuries. 'This case is heartbreaking and devastating for Mr Armitage's family. He was a hard-working, caring and honest man. While trying to protect his family and his home he tragically lost his life at the hands of Sindall.'","Dean Armitage rushed out in his underwear when he heard his car start .

A court heard Barlow, who has been jailed for three years, also pretended to be a teenage boy and even a young girl to meet children where he encouraged them to strip and perform sex acts over Skype. Richard Barlow (left), 24, posed as pop star Justin Bieber to groom girls as young as seven over the internet . He groomed children aged between seven and 11 for his own sexual gratification and even used headphones and cameras to record them. Barlow blackmailed some victims by threatening to upload films he had already made of them for family and friends to see if they did not do as he said. When police raided his home and seized his computer they found a shocking video of him enticing a seven-year-old girl to perform a sex act on herself via a webcam. He was arrested and charged with inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, three charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child over the Internet and 12 charges of making indecent images. On Wednesday at Mold Crown Court he pleaded guilty to all charges and was jailed for three years. Barlow was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life. Sentencing Judge Peter Heywood said: ‘It is clear that for a significant period of time you have had an unhealthy interest in this sort of activity. ‘You engaged in conversation with young girls to encourage them to engage in sexual activity with them. ‘Heaven knows how they will be affected in their future lives. They may seem to be only images but they are young children being exploited by others. ‘Huge sums of money are made by people who have a prurient interest in this sort of material. ‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did anything other than pass an immediate custodial sentence.’ On Wednesday at Mold Crown Court Barlow pleaded guilty to all charges and was jailed for three years . Prosecutor Jonathan Austin told the court police seized computer equipment when they executed a search warrant at the address in September 2012. He said Barlow, who lived with his parents, also had a fetish for feet and persuaded other girls to show their feet via his webcam. Officers found a total of 2,200 indecent images and 116 films of children had also been downloaded off the internet. Defending, Owen Edwards said his client had pretended to be Justin Bieber, and others younger than himself, to entice naive young girls. He said: ‘This behaviour is shocking. ‘He has to face up to what he has done and to face up to the sentence. He knows he is going to prison. ‘This is yet another of these sad examples of the internet opening up activities which would never have been indulged in had it not been there..’ After the case DC Rachel Garbutt, from North Wales Police, said: ‘The sentence sends out a strong message to the community that these types of offences will not be tolerated. ‘These offences are never victimless and people who commit them will be dealt with accordingly by the police and the courts.’","Richard Barlow, 24, from Big Arowry, North Wales, enticed 'naive' youngsters by posing as the star in online chat-rooms and music sites .

Vince Cable taunted the Prime Minister yesterday by saying the Government’s failure to control immigration was a ‘good thing’. The Tories were dealt a huge blow by new figures showing net migration to Britain had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013. It was driven entirely by a 40 per cent leap in the number of people taking advantage of EU edicts on free movement. Tory immigration minister James Brokenshire insisted the government could not control immigration from within the EU, but Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said rising immigration was 'good news' The . shock increase left Downing Street unable to say if David Cameron would . meet his key election promise to slash net migration to the ‘tens of . thousands’ by 2015. And his . opponents on the Left and Right both declared his flagship policy in . ‘tatters’. But, in remarks apparently calculated to infuriate his . coalition colleagues, Mr Cable declared the figures were a cause for . celebration. The Lib Dem . Business Secretary said: ‘Actually, those figures are good news because . the reason net immigration is going up is because fewer British people . are emigrating and surely that’s a good thing – people are getting jobs . here. ‘We are getting . people coming in from Europe to fill jobs in our expanding labour . market, but the key point is that nine out of every ten new jobs that . are being created are going to British workers. 'This is further proof that any quota on migration, such as the one Conservatives are pushing to get net migration down to tens of thousands, is unworkable and contradicts our aims of getting Britain back on its feet.’ Prime Minister David Cameron promised to cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands' but that aim is now a long way off . Running . salt into Tory wounds, he added: ‘Any target on migration is totally . impractical, cannot be delivered and would do great damage to the . economy.’ Mr Cable has . fought long-running battles with Tory ministers over immigration . controls and is likely to view the figures as a personal victory. Hailing the rise as a success twists the knife into Mr Cameron, because . Mr Cable knows that missing the cherished target will infuriate . backbench Tory MPs and voters. Ukip . and Labour both said Mr Cameron’s pledge was nothing more than ‘smoke . and mirrors’ since EU free movement rules rendered Britain powerless to . stop workers flooding in from the continent. There could be even worse news to follow later this year when more up-to-date figures are released.Yesterday’s statistics pre-date the controversial lifting of border controls on Romanians and Bulgarians on January 1. Some 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to . September 2013 – nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the . previous year. Ministers . tried to present the figures as an economic success story as migrants . fled the turmoil in the eurozone for Britain’s stable jobs market. While . migrants from Poland continue to top the list, there was a leap in . arrivals from Italy, Portugal and Spain, where youth unemployment is at . record levels. There was . also a jump of 25 per cent in National Insurance numbers handed out to . citizens of France, and the number  given to Germans increased by 10 per . cent, to 11,500. The Tories were dealt a huge blow by new figures showing net migration to Britain had rocketed by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013 . Overall, . 532,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending September, up . from the 497,000 people in the previous 12 months. Some 320,000 . emigrants left the country, down from the 343,000 the previous year. But . it was a surge in European Union citizens arriving in the UK that has . driven the overall increase, rising to 209,000 from 149,000 the previous . year, the Office for National Statistics said. Some . 65,000 citizens of so-called EU15 countries, that is pre-2004 members . of the union, arrived to work in the UK, an increase of 23,000 when . compared to the previous year. Immigration of non-EU citizens – who need a visa from the Home Office – fell to 244,000, down from 269,000 the previous year. Statisticians . said this was due to fewer New Commonwealth citizens – such as those . from India – migrating to the UK for formal study. Mark Hilton, of business group London First, said it was ‘game over’ for Mr Cameron’s migration target. Ukip . leader Nigel Farage said: ‘It is utterly pointless setting immigration . targets when you can’t even decide who comes into this country. ‘Until . we end the open-door immigration policy with the EU and take back full . control over our borders, nothing can really be done. It’s all smoke and . mirrors.’ Shadow Home . Secretary Yvette Cooper added: ‘These figures show the Government’s net . migration target is in tatters, and their immigration policy is a mess.’ Downing Street . insisted the Government was ‘absolutely’ committed to its target to . reduce net migration to tens of thousands by 2015. But . No 10 dodged questions about whether Mr Cameron was confident that . would happen. His official spokesman said: ‘We are putting in place what . we believe are the right measures that go towards meeting that . objective.’ Immigration .

These disturbing pictures show the horrendous conditions in which a farmer kept almost forty dogs - including 22 puppies. Paul Alton kept the animals in a static caravan at Trice Barn Farm in Bacup, Lancashire. Burnley Magistrates Court heard the 51-year-old neglected to ‘provide the proper care’ to the dogs, which he was breeding with the intention to sell. This filthy caravan was used as a makeshift kennel by the farmer who has been banned from keeping dogs . Over half of the animals were puppies, including these young alsatians which had been bred for profit . A dog and puppies walk in their own excrement in and outbuilding on the farm . The rest of the farm was also in a dilapidated state as this neglected stable block shows . Breeds including terriers, collies and alsatians were found in conditions described by the RSPCA as 'squalid'. One dog was found to have a bleeding malformed hind left leg after it was injured in a tractor accident a few years ago. Another was seen climbing on top of a dead cow next to the stables. The father-of-two was banned from keeping dogs for 10 years . He was also banned from transporting dogs, attempting to sell dogs or being party to any transaction or transportation. When . RSPCA officers visited the farm on April 23 last year they were shown . around the outlying buildings which were found to be ‘completely . unsuitable’ for the dogs.

Lea, defending, said Alton claimed the conditions were not like that . when he had left the farm four days previously after he was arrested on . firearms charges. Police were called after he assaulted his wife of 15 years and she told police about firearms at the premises.

The prospect of a Formula One race through the streets of central London took a huge step forward today when ministers entered a consultation over a radical overhaul of road safety and speed limit laws. A detailed 3.2 mile circuit is believed to have drawn up by Formula One supremo Bernie Eccleston that would see the likes of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton start on The Mall and race past Buckingham Palace and through Parliament Square. Experts predict a Monaco-style event through the capital could be worth well over £100million in ticket revenue and endorsements but would currently require an Act of Parliament to suspend 30mph speed limits and other safety laws along the length of the route. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A detailed 3.2 mile circuit is believed to have drawn up by Formula One supremo Bernie Eccleston that would see the likes of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton start on The Mall and race past Buckingham Palace and through Parliament Square . The route will take in some of the capital's most famous and iconic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square . The event could become the richest . race in the road with around 120,000 fans filling the grandstands around . the capital's most famous landmarks along a 3.2 mile route with a . potential global TV audience of a billion. Local authorities already have the power to close roads for sporting events but not to suspend traffic laws and the requirement for a vehicle to be road legal. The consultation launched today by Culture Secretary Maria Miller is over whether they should also be allowed to suspend the Road Traffic Act and, if successful, would pave the way for a London Grand Prix. Mrs Miller said: 'The excitement and buzz of motor sports attracts a legion of dedicated fans and drives investment. 'Looking at whether local authorities should be able to close public roads for road races and other motor sports could mean millions of extra pounds going to local communities. 'The UK is a world leader in the motor sport industry, supporting jobs and promoting our manufacturing and high tech engineering skills.' Experts predict a Monaco-style event through the capital could be worth well over £100million in ticket revenue and endorsements . If the proposal is successful Formula One bosses would still need to secure permission from Westminster City Council to stage the event. Tim Owen, the council's Events Commissioner, said: 'We are always keen for Westminster to set the stage for world-class events and attractions so will obviously be following the progress of this legislation very closely. 'If it passes, however, it would just be the first step. We would then explore the practicalities with our partners to see if and how F1 really could take to the streets of London.' Mayor Boris Johnson has previously spoken in favour of the plan provided issues with pollution and noise impact are addressed. His spokesperson said today: 'The Mayor thinks F1 is a fantastic event that any city would feel privileged to host, and he is always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth. 'He is positive that London would do a spectacular job of holding a Grand Prix; but it is impossible to say what the impact might be without detailed planning, consultation and research and the question of air quality and noise impact would have to be looked at very carefully.' The Mayor added it was important to see if there was 'a really good economic case' for a London Grand Prix. The idea also has the support of several senior Government ministers including Minister Without Portfolio Kenneth Clarke, Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretery, and Patrick McLoughlin. Mr Clarke said: 'I am delighted that the Government has been able to propose the necessary legal changes to enable motor racing events to be held occasionally for various categories of racing in towns and cities in different parts of the country. 'Sensible safety and environmental standards are always protected at sports events. 'The proposal is to sweep away a few absurd legal problems to exempt a motor race from the ordinary traffic rules that apply to a commuter traffic jam. 'Motor sports is one of the this country’s industrial and sporting strengths.' Ecclestone believes the race would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix, currently the most famous and glamorous of motor racing’s street circuits. British drivers Lewis Hamilton (left) and Jenson Button (right) could soon be racing through the streets of London . Bernie Ecclestone believes the race would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix (pictured), currently the most famous and glamorous of motor racing's street circuits . In 2012 Ecclestone said: ‘With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it. If we got the okay and everything was fine, I think we could do that. 'Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic — good for London, good for England — a lot better than the Olympics.’ A London Grand Prix is not a new idea and was first raised by the Government in 2011, but since then the launch of a formal consultation has been tied up in Whitehall wrangling. The move is expected to meet with opposition from environmental groups. Darren Johnson, a Green London Assembly member described the race through London as a 'terrible idea'. He said: 'Formula One should stick to the dedicated race tracks and leave our streets form ordinary Londoners to enjoy.' The consultation could also reach outside Formula One and remove potential legal obstacles to holding Tour de France cycle stages in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire this July. Under existing laws support vehicles following the riders will technically be breaking speed limits.","Formula One race through London could be worth well over £100million .

Former Manchester United and Leeds hard man Johnny Giles has labelled Robin van Persie a ‘prat’. The ex-Ireland midfielder-turned-TV pundit hit out at the Holland striker but leant his support to under-fire manager David Moyes who he believes should be given 18 months to make his mark on the squad. Giles read out on air on Irish channel RTE comments Van Persie made regarding team-mates occupying 'his zones' and whether or not his comments show Moyes can't cope with the superstars at Old Trafford. Night to forget:  Robin van Persie takes off his United shirt after losing to Olympiacos . Below par: Van Persie criticised some of his Manchester United team-mates for 'sometimes' occupying the spaces he wants to play but was blasted by TV pundit Johnny Giles . Giles said: 'It can also show you Van Persie is a prat. 'In other words [to the comments] he is not at fault. Right, he's not at fault. And I watched the game last night and he never tried a leg. 'Moyes can't make him play. He should be out there playing and doing his best. That's what all players should be doing, regardless of manager.' While Giles wanted Moyes to be allowed . more time to shape United, fellow pundit Richie Sadlier called on the . league champions to cut the Scot loose. ‘Moyes has shown in the last few . months that he is completely out of his depth,' said Sadlier. The former Ireland striker says he cannot . imagine a scenario in which United, managed by Moyes, will recover from . the current malaise that sees them well off the pace in the Premier . League and in danger of Champions League elimination. ‘People are exaggerating how bad this United side are,' Sadlier insisted. Fellow pundit Ronnie Whelan pitched . into the debate by declaring that defender Rio Ferdinand does not want to be at . United and questioning why Moyes does not follow the lead of his . predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson and get rid of fractious elements in his . squad.

It is absolute garbage to say that other players are getting into his zones or his space. ‘I played football at the highest level for the best part of 20 years, and I never heard such a thing.

Former Tottenham sporting director Damien Comolli has lifted the lid on the disastrous year when Juande Ramos was in charge. Ramos, whose Dnipro side lead Spurs 1-0 going into the second leg of their Europa League tie on Thursday, recently blamed the club for ruining his reputation in England. But Comolli, who worked with the Spanish manager at White Hart Lane in 2007-08, claims Ramos: . Hitting back: Former Spurs sporting director Damien Comolli has lifted the lid on the disastrous year when Juande Ramos, now boss of Dnipro, was in charge at White Hart Lane . All smiles at the start: Comolli, left, and Ramos were on good terms when the Spaniard joined but the pair's working relationship would not stay so healthy . At the beginning: Ramos was hired in 2007 but would not last long as Spurs boss . Comolli says Ramos was out of touch with the Barclays Premier League and did not listen to advice from chairman Daniel Levy and the board to adapt his style of management from Spain. ‘One thing that worried me straight away after we appointed him from Sevilla was something their sporting director Monchi told me,’ said Comolli, 41. ‘He was a friend of mine, so I rang and apologised for taking their manager halfway through the season. 'He said that the coach from their reserve team was probably better than Ramos and that we’d soon find out he’s not the reason for the club’s success.’ But within four months of taking over from Martin Jol, Ramos won the Carling Cup, the club’s first trophy since 1999. ‘We thought we were on to something good,’ said Comolli. But behind the scenes the situation was turning into a nightmare. Silverware joy: Spurs won the Carling Cup in 2008 by beating Chelsea 2-1 thanks to a goal from Jonathan Woodgate, centre, at Wembley . Champagne moment: Ramos gets soaked holding the 2008 Carling Cup by Robbie Keane as Jermaine Jenas looks on . ‘When you interview a manager or a potential candidate you put the culture of your club, what you’re about, on the table straight away. 'We made it clear to him we couldn’t afford to buy stars, we wanted to make them. We couldn’t compete with Chelsea or Manchester United like that. He said, “No problem, I’m good at that”. 'He mentioned he was the coach of Barcelona B. Then as soon as he came in, he said, “I want Samuel Eto’o and David Villa”. He wasn’t interested in young players at all.’ Not enough: Ramos, near left, signed, left to right, Chris Gunter, Woodgate, Alan Hutton and Giberto but wanted bigger names at Spurs . Unrealistic targets: David Villa, left, and Samuel Eto'o were two transfer targets Ramos wanted to sign for Spurs but the club could not afford their wages . At the insistence of Ramos, Comolli met the two players’ representatives. ‘Eto’o was already on four times what our biggest earner was on and his agent said he wanted more. It was impossible with Villa as well. Tottenham just couldn’t sign players like that.’ While Ramos was in charge, the club had Gareth Bale and Luka Modric, who would later move to Real Madrid for combined fees of £118million. Spurs finished 11th in the first season he took over and in the following campaign he was axed with the club bottom, on two points after eight games. Spanish swoop: Real Madrid bought Gareth Bale, left, and Luka Modric from Spurs . European ticket secured: Within two seasons of Harry Redknapp taking over at Spurs, the club were in the Champions League . Harry Redknapp replaced him and two seasons later they qualified for the Champions League. Ramos sold Younes Kaboul and Jermain Defoe — two players Redknapp brought back, Defoe for twice the price they received from Portsmouth for him. Comolli worked under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal and saw first-hand the training methods of tactician Steve Clarke at Liverpool, so speaks from experience when he says: ‘Harry instilled in the side a good team spirit, trusted the players and they rewarded him. Former Red: Comolli had a spell at Liverpool as the club's director of sports strategy . ‘With Ramos the players didn’t trust him. He tried to convince the board the players we had were poor but we had great players. 'He couldn’t use them or get the best out of them, couldn’t connect with them or get any kind of team spirit. ‘He pushed them so hard in training they got injuries. They were too tired mentally and physically from his training regime. I felt the players went into games tactically underprepared.’ Taskmaster: According to Comolli, Ramos pushed players too hard in training . Help not wanted: Gus Poyet, left, was brought in to help Ramos, centre, but he would not discuss team selection with the Uruguayan . Tottenham brought in Gus Poyet to help but Ramos would not discuss team selection with the Uruguayan. Problems mounted in the first pre-season Ramos had at the club in 2008. ‘It started to become a nightmare,’ recalled Comolli. ‘Training died, the relationship with players was gone, there was no dialogue with them.’ It came to a head when Spurs had their worst start to a top-flight season. Decision made: Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, centre, fired Ramos in 2008 when the club made their worst start to a top-flight season . Comolli, Poyet and first-team coach Marcos Alvarez were fired when Ramos was. ‘I lost my job because of him but after he left we kept in touch,’ said Comolli. ‘I . always protected his name. I prefer to remember him as the person who . brought a trophy to Spurs rather than by all the stuff he has said . recently.’","Former Spurs sporting director lifts lid on Ramos' disastrous reign .

They are just three of the items from the private collection of American art enthusiast Stanley Seeger, described as the 'greatest of our time' and set to fetch thousands when they go up for auction. Among the treasure trove is Orson Welles' personal draft script for the film Citizen Kane, which bears the director's amendments and is marked as 'Mr Welles' working copy'. Lot 1 - American Gangster Al Capone's silver-plated cocktail shaker . Gangster: A silver-plated cocktail shaker given to American gangster Al Capone is one of hundreds of items from the collection of art enthusiast Stanley Seeger, to go up for auction next month . Inscribed: The cocktail shaker, which was given to Al Capone by his underlings, is engraved: 'To a Regular Guy from the Boys 1932' Present: Sotheby's employee Alice Bleuzen admires the shaker, which was given to Al Capone as a Christmas present. It is expected to fetch between £1,000 and £1,500 when it goes up for sale . The lot, which has an estimated price of £15,000 to £20,000, is part of a sale which features more than 1,000 items owned by the late art collector Mr Seeger. Eight 100-million-year-old dinosaur eggs and a silver teapot which once belonged to Admiral Horatio Nelson, will also be up for sale. Sotheby's auction house in London will host the sale on March 5 and 6. Citizen Kane, which was released in 1941, has been voted one of the best films ever made. It depicts the rise and fall of an ambitious tycoon modeled on the real figure of U.S. publisher William Randolph Hearst. Lot 2 - Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson's silver teapot . Time for tea?: A bachelor teapot, dating from 1799, and owned by Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson will form part of the sale, entitled 1,000 Ways Of Seeing . Engraved: The tiny teapot is inscribed with the letter 'N' to denote its owner. The silver pot has been valued at £8,000 to £12,000 . Lot 3 - A cut-glass Claret jug from the stricken RMS Titanic . Saved: A cut glass claret jug rescued from the RMS Titanic when it sank, is another of the lots on offer at the Sotheby's sale . Historic: The glass jug bears the engraving RMS Titanic . Lot 4 - An armchair once owned by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Ministerial: Ms Bleuzen takes a moment to relax in an armchair once owned by British Prime Minster Winston Churchill. The chair is expected to sell for between £3,000 and £5,000 . Lot 5 - Actor Orson Welles' personal working copy of the script for the film Citizen Kane . Cinematic history: Another lot, which is expected to attract high bids, is this working draft script for Citizen Kane. The copy, which was owned by the film's star Orson Welles, bears the directors amendments and is marked 'Mr Welles' working copy' The script being sold - one of only two known surviving copies belonging to Welles - bears the movie's earlier title, American. It was changed, in part, to distance the fictional Charles Foster Kane from Hearst. Sotheby's director David Macdonald, who put together the sale, said Seeger often watched the movie, following along with script in hand. Seeger, who died in 2011 at the age of 81, lived quietly but on a grand scale. He and his partner Christopher Cone had 11 properties, including the Tudor manor house Sutton Place in southern England, once owned by J. Paul Getty. All were filled with art and artifacts, as was Seeger's yacht which boasted a Cezanne on its walls. Lot 6 - A painted relief by Evelyn Williams entitled Endless People . A work of art: A painted relief by Evelyn Williams entitled Endless People is part of the collection 1,000 Ways Of Seeing . For sale: The 1,000 Ways Of Seeing auction is taking place at Sotheby's in London on March 5 and 6 . Lot 7 - A Faberge frame  displaying a photograph of Emperor Nicholas I . Lot: Another piece set to be sold is this Faberge frame displaying a photograph of Emperor Nicholas I in the uniform of a Field Marshal in the British Army . Lot 8 - Eight 100-million-year-old fossilised dinosaur eggs . Fossils: Eight 100-million-year-old dinosaur eggs are currently on display at Sotheby's ahead of next month's auction . The sale includes items from 50 countries, from Admiral Horatio Nelson's silver teapot to a claret jug from the Titanic and dinnerware by graffiti artist Keith Haring. In his lifetime, Seeger sold major works including 88 Picassos that raised $32 million in 1993. Mr Macdonald said he would get rid of collections when he considered them complete, or when works became too famous. Once, when a visiting paramedic recognized a Francis Bacon triptych hanging on a wall, Seeger decided it had to go. Mr Macdonald said Seeger collected for pleasure and for fun. Every piece he added to his collection was used by himself and Cone during their day-to-day lives. Lord Nelson's teapot was used for afternoon tea and the Al Capone cocktail shaker came in handy when Seeger or Cone fancied a Bloody Mary. Proceeds from the sale will go to the Seeger Center for Hellenic Studies at Princeton University, of which he was benefactor. Lot 9 - A selection of glassware .

After the implosion at the Stadium of Light ended the chaotic reign of Paolo Di Canio, Sunderland’s target was Premier League survival. As hope has replaced resignation with improved performances, a new and welcome objective has appeared which may bring the club’s first major trophy since their famous FA Cup victory in 1973. Five months ago, when Gus Poyet took over as head coach, cup competitions were a distraction. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Poyet speak on selection issues for the Capital One Cup final . Bringing the fun factor back: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet watches his team during training ahead of Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Manchester City . Lifting the gloom: Poyet took over with Sunderland in disarray but has taken them to the Capital Once Cup final and given the Black Cats hope they can stay in the Premier League . Silverware: Sunderland's Bobby Kerr lifts the FA Cup in 1973 after the Black Cats beat Leeds 1-0 - the last time the club won a major trophy . When his side face Manchester City in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday he is acutely aware of what a triumph against the odds will mean to the club and their success-starved fans. Poyet knew that his first job when he was appointed in October was to build bridges after the Di Canio regime had managed to create so many chasms. The Uruguayan became the first Sunderland manager for more than a decade actually to live in the city. He is constantly out and about and meeting the fans. Happy in their work again: Poyet, right, shares a joke with his players during Sunderland training . Emotions: There was never a dull moment on the touchline when Paolo Di Canio was in charge of Sunderland . At the club, he made it a priority to rebuild the links between the playing and backroom staff. He knows the name of every cleaner, chef and office worker. He shakes their hands, gives hugs, high fives and smiles. He was the same at Chelsea, Tottenham and Brighton. Poyet quickly set about unpicking some of the more troublesome Di Canio diktats. For instance, the Italian ordered his players to eat in specific groups but the only meal Poyet wanted his players to attend, with their partners, was in their first full week together. What happened in the Sunderland restaurant called Romanos stayed in Romanos but a decision was reached never to mention you-know-who again. And it’s the one name you will not hear uttered by the players this weekend. South coast stint: Poyet was manager of Championship side Brighton before he joined Sunderland . Capital gain: Poyet, seen here sharing a joke with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger in 2008, spent time as assistant coach at Spurs . Jack Colback, one of a handful not on international duty, remembers Poyet’s first day. ‘I was looking forward to his company,’ the midfielder said. ‘There was relief in the dressing room. ‘I remember playing against his Brighton team and we didn’t touch the ball for the first 20 minutes. ‘I knew that was the sort of manager he was and it wasn’t a style of football I’d been involved with before so I was looking forward to it. ‘Gus is very detailed in what he does. He looks for things and angles you might not have thought of. He’s serious when he needs to be but calm at other times and relaxed when he wants to be. ‘He brings a spirit and camaraderie into the squad and it’s a good mix. His staff are the same as well. He has got an angry side and rightly so at times. There have been times we’ve not played well and he lets us know about it. ‘When he first came in everyone wanted to impress and he just said “Relax”. He didn’t try to come in and change everything but he tried to change things slowly.’ Fan of the current boss: Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback, seen here challenging Arsenal's Jack Wilshere, likes the style of play Poyet wants the team to adopt . The drills emphasise  passing, the training-ground matches encourage passing, even shooting practice is based on passing. There are smiles and laughter in the sessions, but a hardworking environment. And, when Poyet wants a word, he takes the player for a little walk and a chat round the pitches. There is no shouting and screaming and no former pro in his forties, showing off his torso, or how it should be done. Players are treated like adults again. While Poyet’s influence has been remarkable, he would be the first to praise the initial work done by Under 21 coach and former captain Kevin Ball, who was called on by owner Ellis Short to step in after Di Canio departed with just one point from the first five league games. Caretaker: Sunderland initially turned to Kevin Ball when Di Canio was sacked . It was Ball’s job to repair the damage, install a more realistic code of conduct and restore some belief, fitness, confidence and even enjoyment on the training ground. Ball’s team, with Lee Cattermole at the heart of midfield, beat Peterborough 2-0 in the second round of the Capital One Cup. It followed the 4-2 first-round win over MK Dons, notable for a Jozy Altidore goal and being Di Canio’s only victory in six before he was sacked. Sensing this was his opportunity to stake a claim to manage a club close to his heart, Ball approached the job as if it was his already. Cattermole, like Phil Bardsley, was ostracised by Di Canio and while their recall and welcome back into the first-team dressing room was an obvious decision, it was still a significant one. Recalled: Poyet brought back Bardsley, left, and Cattermole into the first-team dressing room . Ball, who was in the last Sunderland team to reach a Wembley final in 1992, said at the time: ‘The players are professional and know we’re disciplined and work  hard and won’t tolerate things we feel are unacceptable, so there’s not a great deal of change. They’re all going to be treated as individuals and as men.’ Poyet had watched every Sunderland game after Di Canio’s departure. He saw a change in body language and commitment and was impressed by Ball’s obvious influence. His first meeting after being appointed was with his Under 21 coach. Ball’s disciplinary changes merely needed tweaking, leaving Poyet, coaches Mauricio Taricco, Charlie Oatway, goalkeeping coach Andy Beasley and fitness coach Antonio Pintus to concentrate on making a real difference on the training ground. Happy times are back: Poyet and his coaching staff celebrate Sunderland's third goal in the 3-0 win over Newcastle . One player who has benefited from Poyet’s calm hands-on approach is Adam Johnson, now back in the form of his life and on the fringe of the England squad. ‘It was just like having a chat with one of my friends talking about football,’ the winger said. ‘That’s the type of guy he is. That’s why we’re benefiting. ‘It was more just having a chat with me to see how I was. I don’t think it was really, “You’ve got to do this, you’ve got to do that”. He just wanted me to play with  freedom and confidence. Fans at every club I’ve been at have loved me. It’s more the managers having the trust in me playing. Back on form: Sunderland winger Adam Johnson has flourished under the guidance of Poyet and on the fringe of the England squad . Big scalp: Johnson and Sunderland team-mate Craig Gardner celebrate after beating Manchester United on penalties to reach the Capital One Cup final . ‘I just wanted to play and have a manager who had trust in me. The gaffer came in, tweaked the way we’re playing so I get the ball a bit more and it seems to work.’ The major achievement of Poyet’s reign at Sunderland was the dramatic penalty shootout victory over Manchester United in the semi-finals. Triumph over City on Sunday would elevate Poyet to the same status as Bob Stokoe — and end the club’s 41 years of hurt.","Poyet has been a breath of fresh air after Di Canio's reign .

Susan Leigh, 64, has also had hanging washing sprayed with waste and been forced to bleach her garden after it was sprayed on several occasions in Shotton, north Wales. Trains using the line between Wrexham and Bidson, on the Wirral, are too old to have sewage tanks so when passengers use the toilet the result is dumped onto the tracks and sprays into her garden. Susan Leigh said she can't let her great-grandchildren play outside her home in Shotton, north Wales . Mrs Leigh said: 'I had a new bedding set and I put it on the line and the baby clothes - when I came out it was covered everywhere. 'Luckily, . I had moved the wendy house and swings that I have at the bottom of my . garden to mow the lawn - if they were there they would have been . covered. 'I had to go out with a scarf around my face and plastic bags around my feet and bin the whole lot.'

Javier Hernandez appears to have taken a thinly-veiled dig at Robin van Persie. The Manchester United striker criticised David Moyes' side in the wake of their dismal 2-0 defeat at Olympiacos. And Hernandez posting a picture on Instagram claiming, 'Without your teammates you can't be somebody in football, always be thankful...' Van Persie's future at Old Trafford is shrouded in mystery. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Moyes: I take full responsibility for the defeat . Relaxed: Manchester United striker Robin van Persie was spotted enjoying a stroll in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, with wife Bouchra on Thursday . Still happy? Van Persie's future at United has been the subject of much speculation this season . Frustrated: Van Persie criticised his United team-mates and accused them of for playing in the areas he wants . Over the bar: Van Persie falls to the ground in anguish after missing a guilt-edged chance to pull a goal back . Even though it’s easy to see why he chose to let rip on Tuesday - the service to him was almost nonexistent - it won't serve to help his boss as they try and pick up the pieces of a rotten campaign. Sportsmail can reveal that goalkeeper David de Gea completed more passes to Van Persie than all but two of United’s attacking personnel. The . Spanish keeper delivered two balls to his Dutch colleague, and that was . one more than Michael Carrick, Ashley Young and Danny Welbeck managed. Tom Cleverley and Shinji Kagawa, meanwhile, failed to make a single pass to Van Persie. Following the Champions League humiliation the frustrated frontman gave an interview to Dutch TV channel NOS and made clear his opinions on why his form had dipped. When asked whether he was allowed deep to collect the ball, Van Persie said: 'Our fellow players are sometimes occupying the spaces I want to play in. 'And when I see that, it makes it difficult for me to come to those spaces as well. So that forces me to adjust my runs, based on the position of my fellow players. 'And, unfortunately, they are often playing in my zones. I think that's a shame.' Can't create the space? Van Persie enjoyed very few touches during the humiliating defeat in Greece . Any new ideas? Van Persie said that David Moyes was working hard to turn around their slump . Drawing a blank: Van Persie has only scored once in the Champions League this season . The striker's best chance of the night came in the second half when he fired over the crossbar having fashioned a yard inside the area. 'I rushed that shot [to make it 2-1 late in the game]', Van Persie admitted. 'That's a shame because I don't get a lot of chances, so when you get one, you have to score.' He also responded to criticism of Moyes, who has been under constant pressure during United's poor run of results in recent months. Holding him back: Van Persie seemed to suggest his team-mates are affecting his natural game but offered his support to under-fire boss Moyes . Van Persie said: 'He's working hard at it and so are we. Sometimes we play well but not all the time. We don't have luck on our side. It's easy to point the finger at someone but I'm not like that. We have to do better ourselves.

Saggy, wrinkly knees are, along with translucent, aged hands, are one of the biggest indicators of age, and one that even A-listers such as super-fit Catherine Zeta-Jones and Demi Moore fall prey to. Now a new procedure aims to turn back the march of time by firming up sagging skin and reducing fat, all in the space of your lunch hour. While previously the only sure-fire way . to lift skin that had lost its elasticity was through surgery, which can . be both painful and expensive, the new ‘knee raiser’ treatment aims to . offer similar results using a combination of infrared light and vacuum . therapy. Even super-fit stars such a Demi Moore, 51, right, and Catherine Zeta Jones, 44, left, can't avoid kninkles . The non-surgical procedure uses a combination of the infrared light, vacuum and bi-polar radio frequency to cause deep heating of the fat cells and the surrounding connective and underlying collagen fibres. This is designed to increase circulation, lymphatic drainage, cellular metabolism, resulting in skin firmness and a lifting effect. One of the major plus points of the Vela Shape procedure is that it usually takes . about an hour to an hour and a half, and requires little to no down time, . meaning you could even fit it into a long lunch break. No matter how healthy a person, the natural progression of time takes a toll on the appearance of the legs, with older knees (right) tending to have less elasticity than younger legs (left) Some surgeons say the only sure-fire way to lift skin that has lost its elasticity is through surgery, which can be both painful and expensive . And unlike many other non-surgical procedures that promise results with no negatives, the Vela Shape technique, which is available in clinics across the UK, has been favourably studied in peer reviewed medical journals. However, at £350 a treatment, with up to three treatments needed to banish severe sagging, this method of correction is not kind on the wallet. Additionally many plastic surgeons have reservations as to its efficacy. Speaking to the Mail Online, plastic surgeon and BAAPS member Bryan Mayou warns that the costly treatment may leave people expecting the same results as surgery but failing to deliver. 'If you want change your knees altered, liposuction can be quite effective and removing pockets of fat around them, and on very rare occasions, where there is a large amount of baggy skin, a skin excision can be performed to lift it. 'With these sort of treatments people shouldn't expect too much, and they . shouldn't be saving up for this for this kind of procedure.' Respected plastic surgeon Professor Kirwan says: 'The Vela Shape is a great machine for temporary skin tightening and smoothing but there is no evidence that I am aware of that it produces effects equivalent to surgical skin excision and lifting. 'Nor is it permanent. It is an expensive treatment that has to be repeated six times and is best combined with weight loss and exercise. Sadly the reality is never as convincing as the hype. 'Realistic expectations on the patient's part will produce a happy client. Unrealistic claims will end in disappointment.'","Treatment uses combination of infrared light, vacuum and radio frequency .

They are generally shy, but if you shine a torch you may catch their eyes staring back at you before they slink off into the darkness. They are intelligent and cunning, so much so that they are traditionally described as sly. They steal items left lying about – gardening gloves, a shoe, a piece of clothing – and then chew their swag for the apparent pleasure of destruction. And there’s very little, if anything, that you can do about them. These lines may sound like the beginning of a horror story – or a moral panic – but they are a description of that most familiar resident of our countryside and our towns – the fox. The fox has divided the country in those who worry about its welfare and those who see it as a pest . Most of us have known him for a long time. He was there in our childhood in Aesop’s Fables. Then he appeared as a hero in Roald Dahl’s Fantastic Mr Fox, where he outwits the farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. He was a hero, too, in The Animals Of Farthing Wood. But more often he is a villain. Is there any animal in this country which divides opinion like the fox? The supporters love him; the detractors want him somewhere else, or shot, starved out, gassed or hunted by packs of dogs. Both groups have an equal distaste for one another. Many of the fox’s enemies live in towns and cities. They object to their gardens being excavated. They dislike the smell he sometimes leaves behind when he marks his territory. They don’t like the way he scatters their rubbish in the course of his scavenging. They fear he may even bite them or their cats or babies. Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr Fox represents the fox as both cunning and charming . And, some might say, with good reason. In 2010, nine-month-old twins Lola and Isabella Koupparis were mauled in their cot by a fox in Hackney, east London. Last year, another London couple, Anthony Schofield and Tammy Chapple, both suffered bite wounds trying to rescue their cat from the jaws of a fox. Then there are the farmers. Foxes . eat their lambs and chickens, which, quite understandably, enrages . them. They believe he should be kept under control though hunting, and . they tend to resent the interference of townspeople in what they regard . as a country affair. For many the urban fox has become more than just a pest but a menace with several cases of children being mauled by the animal . A familiar scene: Urban foxes are known for ripping open bin bags when scavenging for food . This causes temperatures to rise perhaps more than any other issue in the politics of the countryside. The issue of fox-hunting has become . more than a simple animal welfare one. The argument has become . ideologically mixed up with the politics of class. Toffs go fox hunting, . argue some, let’s stop them. I . do not like fox-hunting and like many, I would not care to engage in . it, as I feel sympathy for the quarry, but this crude attitude shows a . real ignorance of how people live in the countryside, and is symptomatic . of a more widespread lack of understanding in urban Britain of country . life and the things it does. So much for Renard’s enemies; now for the friends. There is the vaguely approving householder who is tickled by the thought that there is a wild animal in his garden. Alexander McCall Smith says he disagrees with fox hunting . Then, going up the scale of admiration, one encounters the passionate friends of the fox. These are the people who are all for helping the fox in what they see as his struggle for survival. You can, if you wish, adopt a fox with one of the animal charities, for which you will receive a certificate of adoption and a stuffed toy in the shape of a fox. Then there are the people who are prepared to resort to disruption to protect him: the hunt saboteurs. I became interested in foxes when I realised we had one. Of course you never own a wild animal, but you may feel you do when you discover your garden is their territory. Our fox could be seen regularly parading about on the lawn or walking along the top of the garden wall, which he used as a sort of raised highway. He appeared by day or by night, but seemed to prefer the small hours of the morning. Alexander McCall Smith says his garden fox was never a nuisance for him . If he saw you watching him, he might pause and look back at you briefly before continuing with his journey. He did not seem particularly concerned about being spotted, although there was always a certain furtiveness about his movements. He travelled, I decided, in the style of one who knew that he was on somebody’s wanted list. He was never a nuisance – although he occasionally dug in flower-beds. His excavations, though, were small, and easily filled in. Sometimes he yowled in a blood-curdling way and rather human way, especially late at night, leading us to believe that somebody was being murdered nearby. My main concern was for our Tonkinese cat. I thought that if the cat met the fox, the fox, being a sort of dog, would go for him. In fact, as I discovered, it was quite the reverse. A fox might take a kitten, perhaps, but would be unlikely to attack a fully-grown cat. Cats have claws and teeth and can defend themselves very effectively against a fox. As far as foxes are concerned, cats are to be avoided. One night I saw exactly what happens when a cat meets a fox. The meeting happened on our garden wall, with the fox going in one direction and coming up against our cat going in the opposite direction. The result of this meeting was the most ear-shattering howling from the fox, who screamed blue murder over feline intransigence. The cat refused to give way, but stood his ground until the fox, after several minutes of outraged protest, turned tail and made off. Victory to my fearless Tonkinese. 'A fox might take a kitten, perhaps, but . would be unlikely to attack a fully-grown cat. As far as . foxes are concerned, cats are to be avoided.' If even my domestic cat can see off a fox, then why are they hated by so many? Yes, they can make a bit of a mess, but so do seagulls. Yes, they may be noisy, but that is only likely to be in a few months of the year when they are interested in breeding. Yes, they may take lambs and chickens, but it is not the urban fox that does that, but the rural fox - and that doesn’t explain the indiscriminate persecution of foxdom in general. In my Isabel Dalhousie novels, about a formidable lady philosopher living in Edinburgh, I have made one of the characters an urban fox. He frequents Isabel’s garden. He lurks under her rhododendron bushes. Every so often she sees him and he sees her, and there passes between them a moment if not of understanding, then of appraisal. She calls him Brother Fox and spends time wondering what goes on in his mind. For many the fox is a creature that needs protecting rather than exterminating . That, of course, is more than idle speculation. Trying to imagine what an animal thinks, or even just feels, is a valuable way of reminding ourselves of how we relate to nature. I remember being in Rwanda a few years ago and being taken into the mountains to see the great mountain gorillas. The gorillas walked right past us in the jungle, seemingly indifferent to our presence. Then, one turned and looked at me. For a short time I looked into the dark eyes of the gorilla – he held my gaze and I held his. And I wondered how he saw me. What was I to him? Look into the eyes of a fox and ask yourself the same question. What does he see? The answer may be unsettling.

Yes, while we were labouring under the impression that having exceptional academic aptitude, winning the right to vote and running a business were some of the wonders of being a modern woman, apparently we couldn’t be more wrong.

Put the kettle on: Tea (right) was voted the seventh 'modern wonder' by a UK survey, Seven Wonders of The Modern World, whilst hair straighteners (left) came third in the UK poll . Fancy a bite? Chocolate (left) was voted fourth by women as their favourite 'Modern Wonder' in a UK poll, whilst iPhones (right) were men's first choice . The results, compiled from a survey of 2,000 responses, contain everything from beauty items, food, gadgets and famous faces. Other ‘modern day wonders’ for women include chocolate and Sat Nav. Contactless payment, where you can pay for your purchase in a matter of seconds, and a steaming hot cup of tea also made it on to the list. 1. Sat Nav2. Facebook3. Hair straighteners4. Chocolate5. Contactless payment6. Parking sensors7. Cup of tea . Just outside the top seven were Coronation Street, push-up bras, David Beckham's six pack and control pants. By contrast, the same poll found that modern man's Seven Wonders includes the iPhone, Sky+ and Holly Willoughby’s breasts. The Xbox, Kelly Brook's curves, 3D movies and a cold pint of lager were also on the list for men. On the fringes of the men's top seven were Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, the 1998 movie Die Hard and electric shavers. 1. iPhone2. Sky+3. Holly Willoughby's boobs4. Kelly Brook's curves5. 3D Movies6. Cold pint of lager . Steve Kitson of Kia Motors UK, which carried out the poll, said: 'Parking sensors have made the troublesome parallel park a thing of the past, so we aren't surprised they've been listed as one of the average woman's Seven Wonders of the Modern World. ‘It’s clear women can’t go without a decent cup of tea and a bar of chocolate - so these things have definitely earned their Seven Wonder status.' Kiston went on to say that men are ‘more reliant on technology and gadgets’ with the iPhone, Sky+, 3D movies and Xbox all making their list. Back in the real world, the survey also found that well over half of the respondents said the real, ancient Seven Wonders of The World could do with modernising - and revealed that there was some confusion over the genuine articles. One quarter thought Niagara Falls was one of the ancient Seven Wonders and nearly half were under the impression that the Great Wall of China had been granted the special honour. Worryingly, clueless Brits also thought London Zoo, Stonehenge and the Empire State Building were on the list. 1. Great Pyramid of Giza . 2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon . 3.

Wen Li, a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, used brain imaging to reveal how anxiety or stress can rewire the brain, linking centres of emotion and smell-processing to make typically benign smells foul stenches. For the study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, subjects were made anxious by showing them disturbing pictures and text of subjects like car crashes and war. The study found that this transformed neutral odours to distasteful ones, which the scientists explained could fuel a feedback loop heightening distress and leading to clinical issues like anxiety and depression. ‘After anxiety induction, neutral smells become clearly negative,’ professor Li said. ‘People experiencing an increase in anxiety show a decrease in the perceived pleasantness of odours. It becomes more negative as anxiety increases.’ Stress transforms neutral odours into distasteful ones, which could fuel a feedback loop heightening distress and leading to depression . Using behavioural techniques and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Professor Li's team looked at the brains of 12 human subjects with induced anxiety as they processed known neutral odours. Before entering the fMRI scanner where participants were shown a series of disturbing pictures and text, subjects were exposed to and rated a panel of neutral smells. In the course of the experiment, the scientists observed that two distinct and typically independent circuits of the brain - one dedicated to olfactory processing, the other to emotion - become intimately intertwined under conditions of anxiety. After anxiety induction and the imaging process, subjects were asked again to rate the panel of neutral smells, and most assigned negative responses to smells they previously rated as neutral. Professor Li said: ‘In typical odour processing, it is usually just the olfactory system that gets activated, but when a person becomes anxious, the emotional system becomes part of the olfactory processing stream.’ The . old saying 'a problem shared is a problem halved' may have been based . on scientific fact, according to a study published in January. Researchers . from California have proved that the best way to beat stress is to . share your feelings - and sharing with someone in the same situation . yields the best results. This . is because sharing a threatening situation with a person in a similar . emotional state 'buffers individuals from experiencing the heightened . levels of stress that typically accompany threat', the study claims. A . total of 52 female undergraduates were paired up and asked to make a . speech while being taped by researchers from the University of Southern . California Marshall School of Business. Prior . to each speech, participants were encouraged to discuss how they felt . about public speaking with the researchers, and their fellow . participants. Other participants were told not to discuss their . feelings. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol were measured before, during and after each participant's speech. The . researchers found that stress levels were significantly reduced when . the participants were able to vocalise how they felt about the speeches. This was most noticeable when the discussion was had with a fellow participant, in which they shared a common fear. Although those two systems of the brain are right next to each other, under normal circumstances there is limited crosstalk between the two. However, under conditions of induced anxiety, the Wisconsin team observed the emergence of a unified network cutting across the two systems. The results could be used to uncover the biological mechanisms at play during periods of anxiety. Professor Li said: ‘We encounter anxiety and as a result we experience the world more negatively. ‘The environment smells bad in the context of anxiety. It can become a vicious cycle, making one more susceptible to a clinical state of anxiety as the effects accumulate. ‘It can potentially lead to a higher level of emotional disturbances with rising ambient sensory stress.’","Scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that the greater the stress, the larger the change in smell .

Corrie's mother Georgina, 47, was in the England team in the 1980s - aged 14 to 22 - and won medals in European competitions with her elegant routines. Her daughter Corrie, who started the sport at aged 10, reckons her mother gives pretty good advice. The 17-year-old said: 'When I found out I was so proud of myself and really excited thinking about the future in the team. 'It is quite good having your mum as a coach. She can be funny on the side of the pool and I'm like ""oh mum"". She is a strict coach, you could say.'

It weighed a stone and a half (10kg) Mr Yang developed a small tumour on his neck about ten years ago. It grew rapidly and was soon as big as an egg. In 2007, he went to hospital in Xi’an and the tumour was diagnosed as fibromatosis – a benign soft tissue tumour. Mr Yang and his father, Yang Jigao, considered surgery and were warned it was difficult and risky. As a result, his father, who had already lost his wife and daughter, decided not to take the risk. After leaving the hospital, Mr Yang’s tumour continued to grow. Mr Yang first developed a small tumour on his neck when he was a teenager but it grew rapidly . Mr Yang considered having surgery in 2007 but his father did not want him to as he was warned it was risky and he had already lost his wife and daughter so couldn't face losing his son as well . It was soon as large as half a football and more tumours had appeared on his back and collarbone. At the end of 2013 the father and son returned to hospital – this time they went to Xijing Hospital, in Xi’an. By this point the tumour on Mr Yang’s back measured 45cm from top to bottom and 30cm across. It was also 17cm thick and weighed a stone and a half. Surgeons informed Mr Yang that surgery would be risky but that he would have a good chance of recovery. Mr Yang's tumour was still growing so he eventually decided to have surgery and raised the money for an operation. He was warned it would be difficult but told he has a good chance of recovery . Mr Yang had the tumour removed on February 19 . They also explained that without surgery the tumours would probably grow fast. As a result, he and his father decided he should undergo surgery. People from his hometown have donated about £2,000, and his father borrowed £10,000, to pay for the operation. The surgery took place on February 19 - it took nine hours. Mr Yang is still being treated at the hospital. Fibromatosis refers to a group of benign soft tissue tumours.

But her fairytale turned sour when she attempted to blow-dry and straighten her new locks. The reason? Because the hairdresser who had fitted the extensions - which were meant to last for three months - had used wax bonds instead of glue to hold them in. Worse still, she had failed to tell Jodie, a 21-year-old actress, that if she applied heat to the wax bonds they would melt. Bad hair day: Jodie had long blonde hair extensions fitted using wax bonds, left, when they melted in the heat, she had to pull them out leaving her with bald patches, right . Painful: Jodie pulled her own hair out along with the extensions . Instead, Jodie found out the hard way when she attempted to use straighteners to spruce up her locks. 'It was great waking up feeling like Cinderella with long, blonde hair,' explains Jodie. 'But when I went to straighten my hair, the wax bonds started to melt. My hair started matting and sticking together.' Panicking and in pain from the melting wax on her head, Jodie tried to pull the extensions out but in doing so, ripped out much of her own hair. She recalled: 'I . had to pull my own hair out to remove the extensions. I could hear it . ripping, it was horrible. I was in total shock.' Brittle: Celebrity stylist Skyler McDonald was alarmed at the condition of Jodie's hair . Brave step: Jody had to let Skyler cut her hair right back to remove the damaged locks . Far from having the thick, bouncy mane she so wanted, Jodie was left with thin, brittle hair and bald patches where her hair had been pulled out. The situation left her terrified of returning to a hairdresser and low in self-esteem - both of which had a knock-on effect on her job as a singer and actress. She said: 'I've had to put my career on hold because I don't have the confidence to audition.' After countless home conditioning treatments failed to revive her locks, Jodie sought the help of celebrity stylist Skyler McDonald on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters. Skyler was alarmed by the state of Jodie's hair and told her only drastic action would help. She would need to have as much of the matted, brittle hair cut away as possible. Then she would need to add some more hair extensions to give it length - but this time she would use ones from made from real hair that would be attached with heat resistant glue. Revived barnet: Jodie was left with brittle, thin hair after her extensions disaster, left, but now has a sophisticated new look . To complete Jodie's make-over, she also used a softer blonder shade of dye on the naturally brown-haired actress, instead of her previous bleached blonde look that was also damaging her hair. Despite reservations about having her hair cut back and then having to wear extensions again, Jodie was delighted with her new look. She exclaimed: 'It's a major improvement I like it. The colour is so much better. I love the . cut it looks so much more healthy and is going to be easy to manage. She told Skyler: 'Thank you, you have pretty much saved me life.' For the benefit of those considering extensions, she warned: 'Always get a professional to do your hair.' Cool crop: The actress's confidence has been restored . Source: vixenandblush.com . One such professional is Sarah McKenna, a hair extensions expert and owner of Vixen and Blush salon in South London. 'Permanent hair extensions are a very safe way of adding instant length to your hair - when fitted at a professional salon with expertise in hair extensions,' she explains. 'Unfortunately there are cheap, poor-quality products available within the hair industry that some salons choose to use. When these cheap substitute products are used, clients invariably have issues.' And it seems Jodie isn't the only one to have endured a hair disaster caused by dodgy extensions. 'We have many clients who come to us seeking help with poor-quality hair extensions that they had fitted elsewhere,' adds Sarah. 'We advise that they never try to remove the hair extensions themselves, or return to the salon where they had them fitted for a removal. We remove their hair extensions very carefully and gently, usually taking several hours to do so. 'These clients usually do not lose any of their own hair and are relieved to have the waxy hair extensions removed. 'Many clients then choose to have good-quality micro ring hair extensions fitted. We offer to fit test hair extensions, using small micro rings, so clients can wear them at home and see that they are both safe and comfortable. 'Micro ring hair extensions are the safest type of permanent hair extensions method available. There is no glue used with this method and so the fitting and removal is very clean. Micro ring hair extensions last for three months and should be removed by a professional.'

LTE covers a wider range of frequencies than slower 2G and 3G networks, and uses an open protocol, making it more susceptible to hackers and viruses . Almost every phone launched at this week's Mobile World Congress was sold on the promise of having super-fast speeds thanks to built-in LTE technology. LTE, also known as 4G, officially launched in the UK last year, but it’s been growing in popularity globally for the past five years. The technology covers a wider range of frequencies and has the potential to be up to 100 hundred times faster than slower 2G and 3G networks, but a software and security expert has told the MailOnline this increased speed comes at a price - security. Both 2G and 3G networks were primarily designed for feature phones; for voice calls and texts, rather than data. However, 4G was designed especially for sending and receiving data, making it more equipped for the job. Leonid Burakovsky, senior director of strategic solutions at F5 told the MailOnline that while this makes it faster, the methods taken to achieve these speeds also make it more vulnerable. 'What the industry has done with 4G/LTE is taken a self-contained telephone network, secured primarily by virtue of being separate from the internet, and then bolted-on internet capabilities which were never designed to prevent eavesdropping,' said Burakovsky. Put simply, 3G networks use a protocol called SS7 to send signals, this protocol is notoriously difficult to penetrate. LTE networks, on the other hand, use systems such as Diameter, an open protocol that sends signals based on the IP addresses of networks. This makes it faster, and can handle more traffic than SS7. However, because this is an open protocol, it makes it easier to penetrate. It is also responsible for managing the data sent for billing and authentication. The majority of new handsets released worldwide have LTE technology built in that helps them connect to super-fast 4G networks, including the Samsung S5 unveiled on Monday, pictured. Experts have warned operators need to do more to protect users against attacks directed straight at these faster networks . Research . from F5 found security is among the top three features people use to . choose a mobile operator, after pricing and network coverage. Two thirds of respondents said security is more important to them than access to the latest devices. But . despite this, around half (49 per cent) admitted that they don’t know how to protect their phones from malicious . threats. Mobile . users are more than three times as likely to blame their mobile operators (35 per . cent) for security breaches, than the providers of services such as Facebook, Gmail or banking . apps (10 per cent)  or handset manufacturers (4 per cent). More than half of consumers said they'd switch providers after a major data breach. This means it’s easier to access, and . carries highly-sensitive and personal information such as passwords, . location data, network addresses and cryptographic keys. ‘LTE . networks are inherently less secure than their 3G and 2G predecessors,' said Burakovsky. 'This can open mobile networks up to a greater number of very real . threats, meaning the onus will be on mobile operators to increase their . efforts to protect users, network and applications.' ‘The main security problem with 4G networks is that user information can become easily available to hackers via, for instance, ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks, and hackers can compromise new services like mobile health or mobile commerce,’ continued Burakovsky. Attackers can place themselves either between two unsuspecting victims, or between the user and the app, or even between two machines. This gives the attackers full access to the data being sent over the network, and some hackers could even be able to control it. Burakovsky added that the main problem is there's no protection between the phone and the network it’s connected to, and the core network controlled by the operator. Networks do use secure systems, such as IPsec and TLS, to secure certain parts of the sensitive data, but F5 warned operators need to do more to protect users against attacks directed straight at the mobile network. 'There needs to be more understanding of the user, the network, the app, and what people are trying to do when using their mobile devices,' said Burakovsky. 'The message is clear: comprehensive multi-layer security . should be an integral part of any LTE to  deliver the level of security . consistent with the many advantages of 4G - like lightning fast video . downloads - that make up a great customer experience.'","Research has found security is among the top concerns for phone users .

Low-carbohydrate diets are all the rage, but one nutrition expert has claimed that they may not be as healthy as we think. According to Dr T Colin Campbell's new book The Low-Carb Fraud, giving up grains can mean putting yourself at a higher risk for heart disease, cancer and other regenerative diseases. He says that not only are low-carb diets lacking in nutritional value, but they're actually even worse than the standard American diet. Unhealthy diet craze? According to Dr T Colin Campbell's new book The Low-Carb Fraud, trendy low-carb diets can put you at a higher risk for heart disease, cancer and other regenerative diseases . The problem, says Dr Campbell, who has 40 years' experience in nutrition science, is that people who cut out carbs tend to load up on animal protein and fat, which heightens cholesterol levels, sometimes leading to disease. Even the standard American diet is too high in protein and fat, an imbalance that is merely worsened with a low-carb diet. Consuming more meat also leads to smaller consequences like headaches, rash, cramps and bad breath, also known as halitosis. Many low-carb diets require that you only consume 15 to 20per cent of your total calories from carbs, which often eliminates nutritionally rich plant-based and complex carbohydrate foods that prevent diseases and promote health. While the author admits that . following a low-carb diet can lead to quick weight loss - which is . likely the reason it is so trendy - he adds that in the long run, it can . lead to dire consequences. 'Low-carb, high-protein, high-fat . diets cause high cholesterol - a major indicator of heart disease and . cancer risks,' he told Elle.com. Bad balance: The problem, says Dr Campbell, is that people who cut out carbs tend to load up on animal protein and fat, which heightens cholesterol levels, sometimes leading to disease . The latest trend in this category is the Paleo diet, also known as the Caveman diet - which, as Dr Campbell points out, is merely a 'slightly tweaked' version of other . previous fads including South Beach, the Zone and Atkins. Not only does the Paleo diet cut out complex carbs that are good for you, but it also promotes the consumption of meat, something cavemen didn't even have easy access to, he explains. Instead of following a fad diet with no scientifically proven health benefits, Dr Campbell recommends the Whole Food, Plant-Based diet, or WFPB, which involves eating mostly intact vegetables, fruits and grains and limiting refined carbs and salt. He also suggest restricting your intake of added oils and fats, claiming that following these guidelines can rid you of autoimmune diseases and type 2 diabetes and even slow down the effects of cancer. 'The only redeeming factor of low-carb diets could be their removal of high-carbohydrate products like cookies, cakes, and soft drinks,' he conceded. 'But that's only true if it's emphasized that refined carbs, not all carbs, are the problem.'","Instead of following a fad diet with no scientifically proven health benefits, Dr T Colin Campbell recommends the Whole Food, Plant-Based diet, which consists of intact vegetables, fruits and grains limited refined carbs ."

Angelina Jolie had a double mastectomy last year after learning she had the BRCA gene mutation. Women with it should have their ovaries removed by the time they are 35, not 40, researchers claim . Women who have genetic mutations that put them at risk of ovarian cancer have less time to have their ovaries removed than previously thought. Women with the BRCA gene mutations are currently advised to make the decision as to whether to have the surgery by the time they are 40. Now, Canadian researchers say the decision should be made by the age of 35. They say that women with BRCA1 mutations who wait until after age 35 are five times more likely to develop ovarian cancer than those who have the surgery before 35. The research, which involved studying 5,783 women, also revealed they are four times more likely to die early than those who have the surgery before the age of 35. Overall, the surgery reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 80 per cent and the risk of premature death from any cause by 77 per cent, according to the study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. ‘For women with BRCA1 mutations, these results suggest that surgery should be performed as soon as it is practical,’ said Dr Don Dizon, a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. He added that the surgery ‘carries long-lasting benefits, substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk’. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are widely known as breast cancer genes, and women with a mutation in one or both often decide to have their breasts removed so they do not develop that disease. Last year actress Angelina Jolie went public with her decision to undergo a mastectomy after she tested positive for a BRCA mutation. Mutations in the same genes also increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Removing the ovaries is not only major surgery, like mastectomy, but also triggers menopause. And it makes conceiving children impossible. ‘Our strongest instincts are for survival and reproduction, and women facing this decision have to balance those,’ said Dr Noah Kauff, director of ovarian cancer screening and prevention at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York City who was not involved in the new study. The findings about the benefit of ovary removal by age 35 apply to women with mutations in the BRCA1 gene, not BRCA2. Current guidelines give women a few more years to make the difficult decision. Women are currently advised to have the surgery by the time they are 40. Angelina, pictured with partner Brad Pitt, was 37 when she had a mastectomy . The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that the one in 300 to 800 women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation be offered prophylactic ovary removal by age 40 or when childbearing is complete. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends an age of 35 to 40. Studies that support those recommendations found that surgery reduces the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. But the new research is the first to show a reduction in overall mortality. To me, waiting to have [the surgery] until after 35 is too much of a chance to take,’ said Dr Steven Narod of the University of Toronto, who led the study. ‘These data are so striking that we believe [ovary removal] by age 35 should become a universal standard for women with BRCA1 mutations.’ Other experts are not so sure. For one thing, the risk of ovarian cancer in BRCA1 women who waited until 40 to have their ovaries removed was still small at 1.5 per cent. Women with the BRCA gene who have their ovaries removed by the time they are 35 are five times less likely to develop ovarian cancer than those who wait until they are older. Image shows ovarian cancer on a CT scan . It was 3.8 per cent for women who had the operation in their 40s and 14.2 per cent in women who waited until 50. For women without a BRCA mutation, the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.4 per cent. ‘We've always known that the earlier [surgery] is performed, the greater the protection against both breast and ovarian cancer,’ said Dr Kauff. ‘But you don't fall off a cliff at age 35 or even 40.’ The study, he warned, may overestimate the benefits of early surgery. Women who had surgery before age 35 but nevertheless developed an aggressive cancer and died soon thereafter were unlikely to be among the 5,783 in the study, he pointed out since they had already died. The study was therefore blind to these women's bad outcome despite early surgey and as a result overestimated the benefit of pre-35 surgery. But even with that caveat, Dr Kauff said: ‘The risk of ovarian cancer probably rises one to two per cent for every year you wait beyond 40.’","Angelina Jolie, 38, had breasts removed after discovering BRCA 1 gene .

A new study into the science of the selfie has revealed how different cities take snaps of themselves. Researchers analysed 656,000 Instagram pics from New York, Moscow, Berlin, Bangkok, and Sao Paulo to come to their conclusions. Move the sliders below to find where each attribute is most popular . • Women take more selfies than men. • Women strike more extreme poses in selfies (especially in São Paulo). • The younger a person is, the more likely he or she is to take selfies. Selfie takers skew youngest in Bangkok (21), and oldest in New York City (25.3). • People are happiest in Bangkok and São Paulo, and more miserable in Moscow. Once they had their 656,000 Instagram photos from New York, Bangkok, Moscow, Sao Paolo, and Berlin taken between December 4 and December 12, 2013, the team fed the photos to workers hired through Amazon's Mechanical Turk marketplace. They identified which of these photos were selfies, and made best guesses as to the age and gender of the person who took them, before analysing the images. 'People take less selfies than often assumed,' the project's site claimed. 'Depending on the city, only 3-5% of images we analysed were actually selfies.' However, they found that everywhere in the world, it was females taking selfies. 'In every city we analyzed, there are significantly more women selfies than men selfies (from 1.3 times as many in Bangkok to 1.9 times more in Berlin). 'Moscow is a strong outlier - here, we have 4.6 times more female than male selfies!' Each city, the researchers say, has its own selfie style. Mood analysis revealed that you can find lots of smiling faces in Bangkok (0.68 average smile score) and Sao Paulo (0.64).

Artificial ‘yarn muscles’ 100 times stronger than humans’ could be used to create humanoid robots with Terminator-like strength . Humans are capable of capable of lifting vast weights, but scientists have now created artificial muscles that put our own to shame. Using just ordinary fishing line and sewing thread, a team of international scientists have found a way to turn them into artificial muscle 100 times stronger than our own. DIY muscle: Using just ordinary fishing line and sewing thread, a team of international scientists have found a way to turn them into artificial muscle 100 times stronger than our own. They come in a variety of widths (pictured) to suit different purposes from heavy lifting to enabling delicate movements . In the future, their innovation could be used to build strong humanoid robots, perhaps with the power of the Terminator, as well as prosthetic limbs and wearable exoskeletons to give humans near superhero powers. The artificial muscles can lift 100 times the weight and generate 100 times the mechanical power compared to a human muscle of the same length and weight. They can create 7.1 horsepower per kilogram, which the researchers said is about the same mechanical power as a jet engine. In the future, their innovation could be used to build strong humanoid robots, perhaps with the power of The Terminator (pictured) The scientists from the University of Texas at Dallas – as well as colleagues from universities in Australia, South Korea, Canada, Turkey and China – made the muscle by twisting and coiling high-strength polymer fishing line and sewing thread. The muscles are powered by temperature changes that can be produced electrically, by the absorption of light or by the chemical reaction of fuels, according to the study published in the journal Science. Twisting the polymer fibre converts it to a torsional (twisting) muscle that can spin a heavy rotor to more than 10,000 revolutions per minute. Subsequent twisting, so that the polymer fibre coils like a heavily twisted rubber band, produces a muscle that dramatically contracts along its length when heated and returns to its initial length when cooled. Compared to natural muscles, which contract by only about 20 per cent, these new muscles can contract by about 50 per cent of their length. The artificial muscles can contract and expand under heavy mechanical loads for millions of cycles. ‘The application opportunities for these polymer muscles are vast,’ said Dr Ray Baughman, the Robert A. Welch Distinguished Chair in Chemistry at the university. ‘Today’s most advanced humanoid robots, prosthetic limbs and wearable exoskeletons are limited by motors and hydraulic systems, whose size and weight restrict dexterity, force generation and work capability.’ Dr Baughman said the muscles could be used for applications in which superhuman strengths are sought, such as robots and exoskeletons. The muscles are powered by temperature changes that can be produced electrically. When the polymer fibre coils like a heavily twisted rubber band, it produces a muscle that dramatically contracts along its length when heated and returns to its initial length when cooled (pictured) The fishing line muscles could be used to create humanoids with terminator-like strength. They could be included in prosthetic limbs and wearable exoskeletons to give humans near superhero powers. Single coiled polymer muscles that are thinner than a human hair could also be used to bring facial expressions to humanoid companion robots for the elderly. Thin artificial muscles could also be used to produce dexterous capabilities for minimally invasive robotic microsurgery.

A mother-of-three facing a mastectomy has had a plaster cast made of her chest - so she can remember how her breasts looked. Tracey Stephenson, 50, was diagnosed with non-invasive breast cancer in September. This is cancer which remains within the milk ducts or lobules in the breast and does not invade normal tissues within or beyond the breast. Tracey Stephenson, 50, decided to have a plaster cast made of her chest before having a mastectomy . She had surgery to try and remove the cancerous tissue but it was unsuccessful, so she agreed to have a single . mastectomy and reconstruction surgery. Mrs Stephenson, a former business manager, knows she will never look or feel the same - but hopes the plaster cast of her breasts will be a comforting reminder of how she looked. She also plans to have a second cast done once her surgery is completed to show other women how they can look after reconstructive surgery. She said: ‘I'd quite like to keep the cast, not as a showpiece for my house, but something for just me to remind me that I'm still myself despite all the treatment. ‘They will look different after the reconstruction. I'll have to have surgery to try and make them look the same so it will be an on-going thing. Mrs Stephenson was diagnosed with breast cancer in September and had surgery to remove the cancerous tissue but it was unsuccessful. She now needs a mastectomy and then surgery to rebuild her chest . Mrs Stephenson hopes the cast will act as a comforting reminder of what she used to look like . ‘But it's important to deal with . this. I won't let it beat me. I've got to get through this. I'm not . going to leave my kids without a parent. ‘I found it hard to find out what they might look like after treatment and it was a worry. ‘I'm not looking forward to seeing what it looks like. That's the part that scares me the most.’ Mrs Stephenson said: 'I'd quite like to keep the cast, not as a showpiece for my house, but something for just me to remind me that I'm still myself despite all the treatment' Mrs Stephenson, from Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, lost her husband Mike six years ago when he died at the age of 49 from a pulmonary embolism – a blockage in the artery that transports blood to the lungs. She is a full-time carer for her father George, aged 88, and added: ‘I don't mind the surgery. ‘I'm not looking forward to the recovery as it will making being a carer quite difficult and I won't be able to drive for eight weeks.’ Keri Bird, 26, a plaster cast specialist and owner of Birds Body Casting, has made the cast. She is doing the casts for women affected by breast cancer for free as part of a campaign to raise awareness. Mrs Stephenson (pictured with plaster cast expert Keri Bird) says she intends to have another cast made after her surgery. She hopes this will show other women how they can look after reconstructive surgery . Mrs Stephenson says she is not scared about having the surgery but that she is worried about what she will look like after she has had it . They will be decorated by artists and then put up in the windows of businesses in Bury St Edmunds before being put up for auction to raise money for breast cancer research and care. Mrs Stephenson is planning on asking her family to bid on the cast of her breasts as a 50th birthday present to contribute to the fundraising for Suffolk Breakthrough Breast Cancer Group. Ms Bird, also from Bury St Edmunds, said: ‘I have not personally been affected by breast cancer but doing this job I come across amazing people who have been directly affected. ‘The idea is to raise awareness and to say “this is my body and it's beautiful” and to encourage people to keep checking their breasts.’ For more information or to donate, visit www.suffolkbreakthroughevents.co.uk .","Tracey Stephenson was diagnosed with breast cancer in September .

It might looks like just a pretty fragment of crystal, but this blue substance is scientifically significant because it is the oldest piece of Earth, scientists claim. The tiny piece of zircon crystal was extracted from a rock on a sheep ranch in Western Australia and is a staggering 4.4billion years old. Despite being microscopic, the crystal is helping scientists unravel how Earth became able to support life. A 4.4 billion-year-old zircon crystal (pictured) is now confirmed to be the oldest bit of the Earth's crust and is providing new insight into how the early Earth cooled from a ball of magma and formed continents just 160 million years after the formation of our solar system . The fragment is 4.4billion years old - the oldest known material of any kind that has formed on Earth. The study strengthens the theory of ‘a cool early Earth’ where  temperatures were low enough for liquid water, oceans and a hydrosphere not long after the planet's crust congealed from a sea of molten rock. The analysis of the zircon has helped portray how the Earth's crust formed during the first geologic eon of the planet. It could also help to shed light on how other habitable planets would form. By analysing the rock, geoscientists have confirmed that the Earth’s crust formed at least 4.4 billion years ago, just 160 million years after the formation of our solar system. Geoscience Professor John Valley at the University of Wisconsin-Madison has come to the conclusion that Earth was not as harsh a place as scientists previously thought. The crystal ‘confirms our view of how the Earth cooled and became habitable,’ he said. Scientists have previously found zircon fragments in sandstone rock, but have not revealed the exact type of rock where they found the 'new' sample. Professor Valley thinks that the study of the zircon crystal has helped portray how the Earth's crust formed during the first geologic eon of the planet. ‘This may also help us understand how other habitable planets would form,’ he added. The study, which was published in the journal Nature Geoscience, confirms that  microscopic zircon crystals from Western Australia's Jack Hills region crystallised 4.4 billion years ago. A few grains of zircon discovered in sandstone rock in Western Australia in the 1990s dated back between 4.2billion and 4.3billion years, so the 'new' crystal is at least 100,000 years older. This is a timeline of the history of the planet that places the formation of the Jack Hills zircon and a 'cool early Earth' at 4.4 billion years . The team of international scientists led by Professor Valley used lead isotopes to date the Australian zircons and identify them as the oldest bits of the Earth's crust, as well as the oldest known material of any kind formed on Earth. Professor Valley said that the study strengthens the theory of ‘a cool early Earth’ where  temperatures were low enough for liquid water, oceans and a hydrosphere not long after the planet's crust congealed from a sea of molten rock. ‘The study reinforces our conclusion that Earth had a hydrosphere before 4.3 billion years ago,’ and possibly life not long after, he said. The study was conducted using a new technique called atom-probe tomography that along with tried-and-tested ion mass spectrometry, which allowed the scientists to accurately establish the age and thermal history of the zircon by determining the mass of individual atoms of lead in the sample. Instead of being randomly distributed in the sample as predicted, lead atoms in the zircon were clumped together, like ‘raisins in a pudding,’ Professor Valley explained. The study confirms that zircon crystals from Western Australia's Jack Hills region (pictured) crystallised 4.4 billion years ago . Zircon is originally formed by crystallisation of magma and can be found in metamorphic rocks. The material is durable and resistant to chemical attack so that it is rarely destroyed, according to the American Museum of Natural History. Zircon can survive many geologic events, which can be recorded in rings of additional zircon that grow around the original crystal like tree rings. Like a tiny time capsule, the zircon records these events - each one of which may last hundreds of millions of years. However, the core of the zircon remains unchanged and preserves the chemical characteristics of the rock in which it originally crystallised. The clusters of lead atoms formed one billion years after crystallization of the zircon, by which time the radioactive decay of uranium had created the lead atoms, which then diffused into clusters during reheating. ‘The zircon formed 4.4 billion years ago, and at 3.4 billion years, all the lead that existed at that time was concentrated in these hotspots,’ Professor Valley said. ‘This allows us to read a new page of the thermal history recorded by these tiny zircon time capsules,’ he added. The formation, isotope ratio and size of the clumps, which are less than 50 atoms in diameter, can be read like a clock by scientists. The team of researchers measured oxygen isotope ratios, which give evidence of later cooling of the Earth. ‘The Earth was assembled from a lot of heterogeneous material from the solar system,’ said Professor Valley, who explained that in its infancy, Earth experienced intense bombardment by meteors, including a collision with a Mars-sized object about 4.5 billion years ago. He said that collision ‘formed our moon, and melted and homogenized the Earth. Our samples formed after the magma oceans cooled and prove that these events were very early.’ Professor Valley said that early Earth experienced intense bombardment by meteors, including a collision with a Mars-sized object about 4.5 billion years ago. He explained that the collision formed our moon (pictured) and melted the Earth.

But listening to sad but beautiful songs by the likes of Johnny Cash or Leonard Cohen really can help you beat the blues, scientists said. They found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music that triggers important memories. Heaven knows I'm miserable now: Psychologists have found that depressed or sad people prefer to listen to beautiful music buy artists like Radiohead (lead singer Thom Yorke is pictured) that triggers important memories rather than upbeat happy pop songs . Psychologists from the University of Kent . investigated the moods of people listening to ‘self-identified sad . music’ and asked them their reasons for picking the tracks. While there were a number of reasons a depressed person might select a particular piece of music, the researchers found that sometimes they didn’t necessarily want to pick happy tracks to cheer themselves up. The study, published in the Psychology of Music, found choosing music identified as ‘beautiful’ was the only way to stop people feeling glum. Previous studies showed that people choose to listen to sad music when they feel down. Two hundred and twenty people were asked to think of a sad event and psychologists looked at the music they listened to afterwards. Hallelujah: Listening to sad but beautiful songs by the likes of Johnny Cash (pictured right)  or Leonard Cohen (left) really can help you beat the blues, scientists said . They found that people prefer to listen . to beautiful music that triggers important memories and that convey a . particular message. Dr Annemieke van den Tol, a lecturer at the university said: ‘It was self-identified sad music, so it was music they chose themselves. Many of the people surveyed selected the beautiful tracks mainly because they had a memory about it . ‘Two common examples were Hurt by . Johnny Cash and Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley - the Leonard Cohen cover. Some people also chose Muse and Radiohead. ‘There . were some people who selected the music mainly because they had a . memory about it. It was often a memory of a person or of an event.’ Dr van den Tol explained that they were usually memories related to loved ones or sadness . ‘The sadness was often caused by love sickness or death. There were a lot of younger guys who had mentioned their dog dying too,’ she said. The researchers found that people’s music choice is linked to the individual’s own expectations for listening to music and its effects on them. Dr van den Tol  said: ‘The results showed that if an individual has intended to achieve mood enhancement through listening to sad music, this was in fact often achieved by first thinking about their situation or being distracted, rather than directly through listening to the music chosen. ‘Indeed, where respondents indicated they had chosen music with the intention of triggering memories, this had a negative impact on creating a better mood.’ She added: ‘The only selection strategy that was found to directly predict mood enhancement was where the music was perceived by the listener to have high aesthetic value.’ Scientists discovered last year that people going through a break-up are more likely to feel uplifted by listening to tear-jerking songs. Previous studies found that those who were feeling down countered that with uplifting experiences - upbeat songs or comedies. However the most recent research discovered that people are likely to gravitate towards experiences that echo their mood. According to Science Daily, music becomes a replacement that temporary fills the gap of a broken personal connection. Researchers from KAIST Business School in South Korea, the University of California in Berkeley and the FGV School of Administration said: 'Emotional experiences of aesthetic products are important to our happiness and well-being. 'Music, movies, paintings, or novels that are compatible with our current mood and feelings, akin to an empathic friend, are more appreciated when we experience broken or failing relationships.'","University of Kent psychologists .

The Navy showed off the Somerset's capabilities, having an Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and a SuperCobra attack helicopter land on the flight deck in the shadow of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. Saturday's ceremony will feature the ship's sponsor giving the traditional order to 'man our ship and bring her to life'. The Somerset will then sail to San Diego, its home port. It's the third ship to be named in honor of 9/11 victims and first responders. The others are the USS New York and USS Arlington. Among other references to Flight 93, a plaque on the Somerset says: 'The sailors and Marines of this warship will never forget', the mess is called 'Heroes Hall', a patch sewn into a tablecloth bears the legend 'Let's roll,' the famous rallying cry of Flight 93 passenger Todd Beamer. Hamilton Peterson, of Bethesda, Maryland, the son of Donald Peterson and Jean Peterson, who died aboard Flight 93, plans to attend the commissioning ceremony with his two sons. The Somerset 'represents that ethos of not lying down, of fighting back,' said Peterson, the former chairman of the Families of Flight 93 group. The vessel was christened in July 2012 at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Avondale, a New Orleans suburb.","The USS Somerset carries a series of poignant reminders of those who lost their lives on 9/11 .

Former Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has spoken of her fears that she would die after a 'pimple' on  her nose turned out to be a skin cancer. She has also described the agony she was in after surgery to remove the growth - and her fears that she would be left disfigured forever. Since the cancer was removed, she has also undergone reconstructive surgery. Scroll down for video . Worrying: Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry feared she would die after a persistent red mark on her nose was finally diagnosed as skin cancer . In January, the 34-year-old businesswoman announced she had been diagnosed with Basal Cell Carcinoma, the same condition Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman was diagnosed with late last year. Michelle told The Sunday Mirror: 'When I heard the ""C"" word I crumbled. It was really harrowing, I thought I was going to die.' Michelle had been worried about a 'persistent pimple' on her face, despite being told by staff at an NHS walk-centre more than a year before it was nothing to worry about. Agony: Michelle after surgery to remove the cancerous growth from her nose. She had been diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma and feared surgery would leave her disfigured forever . It was only when she met a plastic surgeon at a Christmas party - who said it looked serious - that she pushed for a biopsy - which revealed the horrifying truth. Within a fortnight, she had undergone emergency surgery to remove the tumour. As well as being in excruciating pain, she was left with a centimetre-deep crater on the left side of her nose, according to The Sunday Mirror. This has recently been treated by taking skin from her cheek to fill in the hole. She told the newspaper: 'I can’t even explain to you how much pain I was in after the op – I couldn’t eat or sleep because it hurt so much. She added: 'But . I also worried over what it meant for me and the rest of my life. I . felt so ugly. I had a hole cut out of my face and I was so . self-conscious about it I didn’t even want to leave the house.' Terrified: 'When I heard the ""C"" word I crumbled. It was really harrowing, I thought I was going to die,' Michelle said .

Speaking about her traumatic experience, the Sky Sunrise regular said she had feared for her life. She added that she was angry her concerns about her 'pimple' had been dismissed as nothing to worry about. Speaking about finally getting a diagnosis, the website entreprenuer urged fans to get checked if in doubt about their health, as she warned the condition can be extremely 'destructive' if it goes without being treated. She told MailOnline: 'I wanted to share this because it was a spot on my face, not a mole. It's a common misconception that it's moles that cause this. 'I had the pimple for a year and a half . before it was wrongly diagnosed at an NHS walk-in centre. If you have . something, go and get it checked out. 'I always said I was too busy but . thankfully for me, it's very easy to get it sorted. If it had gone . unchecked, then who knows what might have happened. It's better to be . safe than sorry. The condition is localised but destructive if goes . unchecked.' Scarred: Michelle (pictured before surgery) was left with a  centimetre-deep crater on the left side of her nose after an operation to remove the skin cancer . Basal cell carcinoma account for about 75 per cent of skin cancers. The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be linked to overexposure to UV light. The condition affects about 100,000 new patients in the UK every year. The chance of developing the cancer . is higher in people with a family history of the condition, in people . with pale skin and in those with lots of freckles. In most cases, cancerous lumps are red and firm while cancerous patches are flat and scaly. It is estimated that basal cell carcinoma will spread to other parts of the body in less than 0.5 per cent of cases. The risk is slightly higher in cases of squamous cell carcinoma - another type of skin cancer - which spreads to other parts of the body in about 4 per cent of cases. Treatment for basal cell carcinoma is completely successful in approximately 90 per cent of cases.

'If you don’t want to settle for anything less than perfect then the Secret Diamond Club is for you’, a sultry voiceover informs prospective customers in a video advertising a new controversial dating website. The Secret Diamond Club, which started in Demark and has spread across Europe and America has just launched here in the UK to a rather mixed response. While the club insists it is receiving growing levels of interest in Britain, opponents have branded the club – which pairs rich men with women rated purely on their looks- as an example of chauvinistic objectification. The Secret Diamond Club has spread across Europe and America has just launched here in the UK to a rather mixed response . Women who join up have to meet the strict looks criteria of a panel of twenty 'experts' and submit 3 photographs- including a full body shot- from which they are given a rating out of 100 . Started in 2010 in Denmark, the site was started by serial entrepreneur Gus Terkelsen, 33, whose aim was to introduce a new high-end dating concept. He believes the world’s richest men often don’t have the time to search for love, but nor do they want to lose control of the dating process and be match-made. And Gus has a rather controversial reason for his decision to launch in the UK, claiming rich British men can't find love as the women here are unattractive. He told MailOnline: 'Coming from a Scandinavian country we know Britain as a country of ugly women. ‘There are a lot of a wealthy men here but the women are not very attractive and it is difficult for the men to meet good looking women. Founder, Gus, left says British women are 'unattractive' so men with money can't find suitable dates here . Men are not submitted to any questions when they attempt to join the site, only to provide an email address and informed about pricing . ‘We already have over 30 millionaires members from Denmark and across Europe and we’re now signing up the UK’s most eligible and wealthy men. ‘These types of men may not have a lot of time on their hands, but they don’t want a control freak matchmaker telling them who and where to date. They want to feel free to make the perfect choice themselves.’ Costing up to $100,000 (£60,000) a year for men to join, the site already boasts a raft of millionaire businessmen, from ‘European tennis players to self-made millionaire internet entrepreneurs.’ Women can join the site for considerably less, however they do have to meet the strict looks criteria of a panel of twenty ‘experts’ and submit three photographs- including a full body shot. Male members can sort women how they wish, as well as filtering women so they only ever see women above a certain rating . Women pay up to £30 a year for one year’s membership to the site, depending on the rating they are given by the panel form 1-100 (100 being the best), which is calculated based on their photographs, but  adjusted according to their age and the other women at the club they join. Male members are able to buy memberships for multiple clubs, choosing from a single club ($10,000 or about £6,000 a year), a ‘region’ such as North America or Europe which gives access to all the clubs in that area ($50,000 or about £30,000 ) or global membership, which at a $100,000 (£60,000), gives a man free reign to look at and contact all the women signed up to any club in the world. Men can pay for various levels of membership, giving them access to the women in one to all of the clubs across the world . Women however can only sign up for one club. For example women living in France would sign up for the Secret Diamond Club France, and their rating is calculated in comparison to others signed up to that club. So in a club full of stunning women, your rating is likely to be lower. Women's rating also affects how much they pay for membership; the lower your rating, the more you pay. Any non-physical factors such as interests or level of education are not taken into account, and men can filter the women they view based on rating, with many opting not be visible to, or view themselves, any women who scored less than 90. Gus Terkelsen, 33, says that appearance is ultimately the most important thing to men . Gus says he was inspired to start the business because he saw a gap in the online dating market. ‘I noticed on another dating website that the men weren’t necessarily physically attractive and that those men who were standing in a suit were rated higher. ‘I concluded that women weren’t interested in looks and were instead interested in other factors- namely financial success. ‘Although other sites for millionaire men exist, they only charged £10 a month for membership so what I found is most of the men on there were not in fact rich and were often dubious or weirdos. I figured if a man really has a lot of money, he will be willing to pay.’ Unsurprisingly, this view of the world, where men are purely driven in their romantic endeavours by ascetic factors, and women’s affections motivated by money, has been challenged by many. ‘The site just mirrors society. It is a truth that men like good looking women, it is very very important to them,’ Gus says. ‘Ugly girls don’t like the site and poor guys don’t like it. They don’t want to admit that guys prefer beautiful women and women want rich successful men. ‘The ugly girls create this moral concept around the idea; attempt to moralise the website. But if you speak to any evolutionary psychologist they will tell you this is the way we evolved as a species. Gus admits a woman’s personality does come into play in romantic pairings, but only once a certain level of beauty had been satisfied. ‘It (appearance) is a very very important thing for men. Period. ‘It is a lower boundary, and then on top of this you need personality and compatibility. But looks are the first sorting mechanism, especially in internet dating.’ When asked if a man would ever date an ugly girl based on her good personality, Gus’s answer was resolute: ‘No. No I don’t think so.’","Secret Diamond Club has just launched in UK .

Police were last night looking into bizarre new claims that the SAS murdered Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed – amid speculation  that the inquiry into their deaths could  be reopened. Scotland Yard said officers from its Specialist Crime and Operations Command were ‘scoping’ the details and ‘assessing its relevance and credibility’, but stressed they had not reopened their investigation. It is believed the key information originated with an ex-soldier who told his former wife and her parents some time ago he could throw new light on the deaths in 1997, and suggested the SAS were involved.

The . development comes almost 16 years after Diana and Dodi were killed in a . fatal Paris car crash when their Mercedes limousine hit a pillar in the . Pont d’Alma underpass at around 80mph. An . inquest in 2008 found they were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross . negligence’ of their driver, Ritz Hotel security manager, Henri Paul, . who had been drinking.

He was informed of the new development last night by his PR adviser Michael Cole on the Fayed estate at Oxted, Surrey. Mr Cole said: ‘Mohamed has always believed his son and Diana were murdered and he has consistently stuck to that line. 'He has always believed that something will break and he is watching developments with interest.’ Met sources played down the significance of the claims, describing it as ‘just a nugget we have to check out’.","Diana, Dodi Al Fayed and chauffeur Henri Paul died in Paris crash in 1997 .

Jason Collins, has worn No.98 in memory of Matthew Shepard, the gay college student murdered in Wyoming in 1998 for the majority of his professional career. And on Thursday night, Brooklyn Nets Center Collins, who became the first openly gay player to appear in any of America’s major sporting leagues, met with the family of Shepard in Denver. The 35-year-old played in front of Shepherd's parents, Dennis and Judy during the Nets 112 - 89 victory over the Nuggets and said the chance to meet them was 'one of those cool treats in life'. Scroll down for video . Meeting: Brooklyn Nets center Jason Collins talks to reporters before the Nets faced the Denver Nuggets on Thursday - after which he was due to meet the parents of murdered college student Matthew Shepard . Indeed, for a guy who waited so long to get his chance to play basketball again, this was one game Jason Collins couldn't get through fast enough. Shepard was tortured and murdered because he was gay. Collins wears his No. 98 jersey in Shepard's honor. Matthew Shepard, a student at the University of Wyoming, was attacked near Laramie on the night of October 6, 1998. He was tied to a fence and left to die. He died six days later from head injuries at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins. Inspired: Jason Collins prepares to face the Denver Nuggers before Thursday evenings game after which he met the parents of murdered gay college student Matthew Shepard . Hero: Mathew Shepard was brutally beaten to death in 1998 in a crime which horrified the nation and Jason Collins has revealed he wears the No.98 in honor of the 21-year-old college student . 'I was in college at the time and when he was killed and of course it's a tragedy what happened and I just hope that it inspires others to move forward and again I'm looking forward to meeting his parents,' Collins said about 90 minutes before tipoff. On October 6, 1998, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney picked up 21-year-old Matthew Shepard from the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyoming by pretending to be gay.They offered him a ride home and grew enraged after Shepard made a sexual advance, they said, and took him to a desolate area in the outskirts of town, tied him to a fence and repeatedly struck him in the head with a handgun.Shepard, who was still alive but in a coma, was discovered 18 hours later by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a scarecrow.The first officer on the scene found Shepherd covered in blood but helped clear an airway and reported that he had been so brutally beaten his face was caked in blood, except where it had been washed clean by tears.Shepard suffered severe brain trauma during the beating and was close to death when he was discovered 18 hours later but he died in a Colorado hospital on October 12.Henderson and McKinney are serving two consecutive life terms for the crime.In the years following Shepard's death, his mother Judy Shepard has become a well-known advocate for LGBT rights and his murder has inspired Elton John and Lady Gaga to write songs for Matthew. 'I had the honor and pleasure of speaking with his mom last spring and she was a cool lady, a cool woman, and so I'm looking forward to meeting with both of them face to face,' Collins wore the No. 98 with both the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards for Shepard even before coming out last spring. The jersey has been a big seller on NBAStore.com, something Collins said honored Shepard and the Trevor Project, which was established in 1998 and aims to prevent suicide among LGBT youth. Collins said slipping on that jersey with the significance no longer a closely held secret meant a lot to him. 'Obviously, it started off my friends and family knew why I chose that number and it's just cool to see that so many people support it as evidenced by so many people buying the jersey,' he said. Collins was a free agent when he announced at the end of last season that he is gay and the 35-year-old center remained unsigned until the Nets needed another big man. He said he's been given no indication from the team that he'll get another 10-day deal but wants to stay with the Nets the rest of the season: 'Oh yeah, definitely. This is a great group of guys.' Collins played 10 scoreless minutes in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday night, then quietly played seven minutes after Nets coach Jason Kidd pulled his starters in the fourth quarter of a 44-point blowout loss at Portland on Wednesday night. Collins bristled when a reporter asked him before Thursday night's game if he could prove himself with such little court time over a 10-day deal. 'I don't think as a 12-year vet, going on my 13th year now, that I have much more to prove as far as I know I can help the team win,' Collins said. Brave: Dennis And Judy Shepard, the parents Matthew Shepard, attend the trial of his killers . Champion: President of the Matthew Shepard Foundation Judy Shepard has become a vocal proponent of gay rights in the United States in the years following her son's death . Regardless of how much he does on the court, Nuggets coach Brian Shaw called Collins a pioneer. 'The only thing that people should be concerned with is him as a basketball player and if he does things on the court for his team to win,' Shaw said. 'He does those things. And I think it's great that he's able to be himself and not have to hide who he really is and be comfortable in his own skin. 'And it's about time and because of his courage to do that, we'll start to see more athletes come out. So, he's a pioneer in terms of that. It's very courageous of him. It's great for him and it's great for the league to have a first and for it to be a class individual like Jason.' So far, Collins has played in Los Angeles, Portland and Denver, all cities with progressive populations, where he has been greeted with polite applause and no obvious catcalls. He said he doesn't ponder how he might be received in more conservative cities. 'I have no clue. I try not to be one of those people who speculate or answer hypothetical questions,' Collins said. 'But again, it goes back to conducting yourself in a professional manner on and off the court and control what I can control — and that's my reaction.'","Jason Collins met with the parents of Matthew Shepard on Thursday night in Denver .

We saw a passing master class from Toni Kroos in midweek for Bayern Munich, but Michael Carrick had one of his own on Saturday. He completed 135 passes against Palace, the most by any player this season. And, as his touch map shows, he dictated play from all over the pitch. All-action: Michael Carrick completed 135 passes against Crystal Palace, the most by any player this season . Spot the difference: Carrick's touch map (right) looks like that of Bayern's Toni Kroos against Arsenal .

P    W    D    L    Pts1   Chelsea    27    18    6    3    602   Arsenal     27    18    5    4    59 . Arsenal had a tough time against Bayern last week. They put in a great shift with 10 men but would have been disappointed to concede that late second goal. Their performance against Sunderland was the perfect response. They played with confidence and scored some excellent goals, particularly Tomas Rosicky. Arsenal are only a point behind Chelsea and that shows how far they have come in the space of a year. At this stage last season they were fifth, 21 points off the leaders. And don’t forget it was an away win in Munich that sent them on that fine run at the end of last season. Gunning for it: Tomas Rosicky (right) celebrates scoring with Olivier Giroud (centre) and Santi Cazorla . Kick-start: Giroud celebrates in Munich last season, setting the ball rolling for Arsenal's fine end of the season . Didier Drogba against Chelsea in the Champions League this week is a mouth-watering prospect and you can be sure that Jose Mourinho will be playing more mind games than ever. Mourinho will try to soften up his former striker, calling him the best there’s ever been and saying he wishes he was still at the club. He’ll be doing that to try to take the intensity out of Drogba, to tame the animal inside him and make him feel like he doesn’t want to score against his old manager and club. You can be sure that if the tie is close going into the second leg, Mourinho will wait around in the tunnel at Stamford Bridge and give him a little cuddle to try to soften him up. New colours: Didier Drogba, now at Galatasaray, is readying himself to face the club where he became a legend . Brothers in arms: And Jose Mourinho has been singing Drogba's praises ahead of Chelsea v Galatasaray . Jordan Henderson's transformation has been incredible and the player deserves all the credit. Brendan Rodgers didn’t seem to think he was ready for a starring role when he took over from Kenny Dalglish and often left him on the bench at the start of last season. But Henderson has turned it around. I’m told he’s one of the best trainers at the club and his attitude has helped him come through those tough times. After another two goals at Anfield, he deserves all the praise he gets. Very few people saw this coming. Dalglish got a lot of criticism for spending £16m on Henderson but it looks like money well spent now. Flying high: Jordan Henderson capped his fantastic season so far with a two-goal display against Swansea . In action: Henderson plays a pass under pressure from Jonathan de Guzman in the 4-3 thriller . Former Real Madrid sporting director Jorge Valdano said last week that Gareth Bale was under pressure at Real Madrid with the emergence of Spanish starlet Jese. He didn’t look that bothered as he fired home this brilliant goal on Saturday night. That was the best way to silence his doubters. Have some of that, Valdano. Settling in: Gareth Bale flies down the wing against Elche, with Edu Albacar failing to keep up . Watch out for Virgil van Dijk. He could be coming to a Premier League ground near you. I’m a big fan of Celtic and the way they play and, in the 22-year-old defender, they have a real star on their hands. He’s technically very good on the ball, is a brilliant defender and has a great stature about him. At £2.6m, he was a real bargain and a lot of top teams will be looking at him. Man United are looking for a Nemanja Vidic replacement and Man City need a regular partner for Vincent Kompany. Van Dijk would fit the bill for either team. Going to Celtic was a clever move for him because it’s a great club to prove your qualities — just ask Henrik Larsson. Celtic will know there will be plenty of suitors in the summer. If he does leave, though, it will certainly be for a lot more than £2.6m. Blonde ambition: Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, with girlfriend Rik Nooitgedagt, could step up to the Premier League . There was a lot of big business done in the transfer window but one of the deals that went a bit under the radar was Joseph Yobo moving on loan to Norwich. It was a great deal, particular when you look at the big money spent elsewhere on players. Yobo was fantastic at Everton and he already looks like he’s striking up a good relationship with Sebastien Bassong. Shoring it up: Joseph Yobo's loan deal to Norwich could prove crucial for the Canaries . When he moved to Fenerbahce he became a bit of a forgotten man but he’s a top player with plenty of Premier League experience. He has helped keep clean sheets against Man City and Tottenham now and it’s those kind of performances and results that could be the difference between Norwich staying up or going down. Chris Hughton has been under huge pressure recently, especially when the club released a list of his potential replacements. Let’s hope results like this stop them going to press again. After Saturday’s loss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer might be thinking: ‘What have I done here?’ Fulham have already had three managers in three months and, with Vincent Tan as chairman, you can’t rule out the same happening at Cardiff. Losing 4-0 to Hull is not a result that should be happening if you want to survive in the Premier League. Teetering: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could only wince and watch his Cardiff side lose 4-0 at home to Hull . That’s no disrespect to Hull. They . were magnificent, particularly Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic, who . already have a great understanding. But Cardiff are in trouble. It’s in Solskjaer’s nature to be attacking, but he went a bit far with his line-up. With . three wide men in a very attacking midfield they left themselves open.

Apple is set to introduce a new set top box that will allow users to download apps to their TV - and play games on it without having to buy a dedicated console. The box is expected to replace the current $99 Apple TV box, and experts claim it could be released in the first half of 2014. It is also believed to include similar software to the iPhone and iPad, potentially allowing specially adapted apps to be run on the big screen. An update to Apple's $99 TV box is expected to bring an app store to the device for the first time. Rumours of an Apple TV set have been floating around since the death of Steve Jobs. The Apple co-founder, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched. The firm is believed to be preparing a range of large screen TV sets, although has refused to reveal any details about the project. 'We’ve learned that Apple is making progress on its development of a successor to the current Apple TV and that the device is well into testing,' said blog 9to5mac. It also claims that motion control systems are also being tested, allowing users to change channel by simply waving their arm - but it is unclear whether these will be included in the update or saved for Apple's much-rumoured TV set. The firm recently spent $280million on an Israeli company called PrimeSense that created the motion sensing technology used in Microsoft's Kinect sensors. The PrimeSense technology can 'see' objects in 3D and Apple is believed to be wanting to buy the company to add this software to a gesture-controlled system for its TVs. 'Our sources previously indicated that Apple is experimenting with new input methods for TV-related products such as motion controls, but it is unclear if that Kinect-like interface is in the cards for this year’s Apple TV product,' said 9to5mac. Rumours claim the current box could also receive an update giving it access to the app store, and Apple has been working with developers to streamline the process of developing TV apps. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011, told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that he had 'cracked' the problem of television, although Isaacson did not reveal the plans as the product has not been launched.

Amazingly he does this twice a day, every day, and has never made a mistake - so far. Scroll down for video .

Burly Joachim, who began driving trucks aged just 19, has to do the perilous turn in the mountains of Eisenerz, near Styria. He said: 'I have done this so many years that it's second nature now. However, he added: 'I can understand why people find it scary.'

Halfway through the turn the rear carraige can be seen dangling as Held swings the front end around . Moving very carefully, the logger then swings the front part of the lorry around to face towards the right hand side of the picture, before pulling away. The images are reminiscent of the infamous Yungas Road in Bolivia, dubbed the world's most dangerous because of it's narrow, crumbling track which cars can barely pass on side by side. It is thought that between 200 and 300 travellers are killed crossing it every year, and the path is marked with crosses where vehicles have fallen.

When the Colorado River snaked its way through Arizona, it sliced its way through ancient canyons, at least one of which was 70 million years old. This is according to a new U.S. study which claims that while parts of the gorge are ancient, the river only carved the present form of the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago. The makes the world famous landmark relatively young in geological terms, and 65 million years younger than previously believed. Researchers divided the Grand Canyon into sections and analysed the rocks in each. They found that most of it was put in place just five to six million years ago.  Earlier studies had claimed the canyon was perhaps 70 million years old . The debate over the age of the Grand Canyon has raged for 150 years. Proponents of  'old canyon model' argue that the Grand Canyon was carved 70 million years ago in the same place and to nearly the same depth as the modern canyon. There is a group of researchers, however, that support the 'young canyon model', which claims the canyon was cut entirely in the last six million years. This new study refutes both of these models by arguing that some segments are very ancient, but says the full system - which makes up the majority of the Grand Canyon - is young. The study, however, will do little to settle the debate over the Grand Canyon's age. Much of the canyon's history has been eroded or carried away by the river. What . remains is open to interpretation, with some scientists suggesting the . gorge cannot be defined as the ‘Grand Canyon’ without  the Colorado . river running through it. Geologists used a technique called thermochronology which dates events by measuring temperature of rocks, revealing when those at the surface now replaced others that had been removed by erosion. The study, published in Nature Geoscience, found two parts are ancient, one being created between 50 and 70 million years ago and the other 15 to 25 million years old. But the remaining two were carved just five to six million years ago when the Grand Canyon became one giant thoroughfare when all the smaller segments became linked due to erosion from the Colorado River. The data found one segment known as Marble Canyon was beneath several kilometres of rock strata and so was not carved until the last six million years. Another called the eastern Grand Canyon, the area visited by five million tourists to the National Park a year, was about half carved to the level of the red cliffs between 25 and 15 million years ago. But the inner gorge was carved in the last six million years by the powerful Colorado River. Professor Karl Karlstrom, of the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, said the timing of the Grand Canyon's formation has been vigorously debated for almost 150 years. Geologists used a technique called thermochronology which dates events by measuring temperature of rocks, revealing when those at the surface now replaced others that had been removed by erosion . ‘In one view, most of the canyon was carved by the Colorado River relatively recently, in the past five to six million years,’ he said. ‘Alternatively, the Grand Canyon could have been cut by precursor rivers in the same location and to within about 200 metres of its modern depth as early as 70 to 55 million years ago.’ The study, however, will do little to settle the debate over the Grand Canyon's age which has raged for decades. Much of the canyon's history has been eroded or carried away by the river. What remains is open to interpretation, with some scientists suggesting the gorge cannot be defined as the ‘Grand Canyon’ without  the Colorado river running through it. ‘Two of the three middle segments, the Hurricane segment and the Eastern Grand Canyon, formed between 70 and 50 million years ago and between 25 and 15 million years ago, respectively,’ said Professor Karlstrom. ‘However, the two end segments, the Marble Canyon and the Westernmost Grand Canyon, are both young and were carved in the past five to six million years. ‘Thus, although parts of the canyon are old, we conclude the integration of the Colorado River through older palaeocanyons carved the Grand Canyon, beginning five to six million years ago.’ The data found one segment known as Marble Canyon (pictured) was beneath several kilometres of rock strata and so was not carved until the last six million years .","Geologists dated sections of canyon by measuring temperature of rocks .

Middle man: Newcastle's Cheick Tiote has tempted Manchester City into lining up a summer swoop . Familiar face: City midfielder Yaya Toure is a team-mate of Tiote on international duty with the Ivory Coast . He was particularly impressive in Newcastle's 2-0 defeat by City at St James' Park last month, when he was unfortunate to have a goal disallowed, and also caught the eye with a lung-busting performance against Manchester United at Old Trafford earlier in the season.

A former Army officer who once blamed his twin brother for a string of sexual assaults on young girls in Colorado has been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. Aaron Lucas, 32, was sentenced Friday in an El Paso court. He had been assigned to Fort Carson outside Colorado Springs. He said last year his twin was responsible the attacks but in November he changed his mind, dropping the 'evil twin' defense and pleading guilty. Same crimes: Decorated artillery officer Lt Aaron Lucas (left) and his twin brother Brian, who he initially tried to blame for his crimes, are both being held for underage sex crimes . Authorities say the twin, Brian Lucas, denied involvement, but in a bizarre twist, he has since been charged with sodomy and first-degree abuse of a child in Alabama, reports WHNT. Brian Lucas was arrested in Huntsville in late January. He is being held at Madison County jail and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on March 12. Investigators say DNA linked Aaron Lucas to the abduction of an eight-year-old girl in Colorado Springs and to cases in Alabama and Texas. Prosecutors dropped some of the Colorado charges and Lucas agreed to not fight extradition to Texas for a 2009 case. Alabama authorities agreed not to pursue charges for another case. During sentencing, parents of the victims gave impact statements, asking the judge to give the military man the maximum sentence for what he did to their children. 'War hero': Aaron Lucas is the recipient of the Bronze Star, the fourth highest military honor in the country . 'I don't know what to do . with her, seeing her and seeing the way she is,"" said the . Spanish-speaking parent of one young victims, who spoke to the judge by . phone. A translator interpreted her tearful testimony, reports the Colorado Springs . Gazette. 'We will never be alright again,' she said. Two . more parents, a mother and father both in the armed forces, told the . judge that their six-year-old daughter had been taught to trust people . in uniform, and that Lucas had preyed on that trust. During the attack, Lucas was wearing his Army uniform. 'Our . daughter was taught to trust the uniform,' the mother said, reports the . Gazette. 'She went to that uniform when he approached her.' Abuse: The brothers Aaron Lucas (left) and Brian Lucas (right) are being held in different states for their crimes . The . parents of the Lucas twins also spoke at the sentencing hearing, . telling the judge that Aaron Lucas had also been subjected to sex abuse . as a child and that the stress of combat in Afghanistan had resulted in . his actions. 'I'm brokenhearted that he's been fighting this demon,' said his mother, Marsha Lucas, reports the Gazette. Aaron . Lucas, who is married with two children, was arrested last year in . connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over . the summer. But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions. DNA . taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken . from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later. His . lawyers were given permission by a district court judge to pursue the . claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states . at the time of the attacks. But the attorney's office maintained that there was no evidence to back up that claim. Aaron Lucas' attorneys also claimed that an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults. But the army officer will serve 20 years to life for the assaults after his legal team reached a plea agreement with prosecutors which was approved by a judge. The Colorado Springs Gazette has . quoted Lucas' lawyer as saying that the mistaken identity claim was a . 'legal, tactical decision'. He added: 'He loves his family. He doesn't want to create problems for them.' El . Paso County prosecutors had said that the Colorado victims' ages ranged . from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado . Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex . with promises of money and ice cream.

The awkwardness was heaped atop earlier awkwardness when Mrs Merkel met her British counterpart David Cameron first thing this morning at Downing Street as she began her one-day visit. After the Prime Minister and the German Chancellor – the most powerful leader in Europe – posed grinning for the cameras outside the front door of No 10, David Cameron planted a firm kiss on Angela Merkel’s cheek.

Jay Leno would stay at the Tonight Show if he were not being replaced by Jimmy Fallon, he has revealed. 'If he wasn't here, would I still be here?' Leno said on the Today show on Monday as he appeared in his first joint interview with Fallon. 'Probably another year or so.' But he insisted that he was ready to leave what he called 'the greatest job in show business'. Leno, 63, will pass the show's torch to Fallon, 39, next month and in their interview, they insisted there was no animosity over the shake up. Scroll down for video . Heading out: Tonight Show host Jay Leno has said that he would probably stay at the show for a year if Jimmy Fallon wasn't taking over. He has appeared with Fallon in their first joint interview . 'Obviously I look up to Jay,' Fallon told Matt Lauer. 'I love his attention to detail. He roots for me.' When asked about the nature of their relationship, Leno was blunt, saying: 'I think it's a professional relationship. I really admire him as a comic. I admire his professionalism.' He praised Fallon's versatility and ability to work beside younger stars, such as Justin Timberlake - an attribute which he said made Fallon similar to Leno's predecessor, Johnny Carson.

Beleaguered heiress Kerry Kennedy has been quietly seeking comfort from sexy 90210 actor Trevor Donovan, who is 19 years her junior. 'Trevor and Kerry have been tight for a couple of years. They travel around the world together,' a Kennedy family member revealed to MailOnline. 'Kerry called Trevor shortly after the DUI accident', Michael Yanni, Trevor’s manager, told MailOnline. Closer: Hunky 90210 actor Trevor Donovan, 35, shares a special bond with Kerry Kennedy, 54, despite their 19-year age difference. They were introduced by his manager several years ago . Aprez-ski cuddle: Trevor and Kerry,  here in Park City, Utah in 2012, are avid skiers. Trevor has also joined the Kennedy clan at their Hyannis Port, Mass. retreat and he's considered an honorary member of the family . The niece of President John F. Kennedy was arrested by police in Westchester County, NY in July, 2012 after crashing into a truck during a wild ride down the interstate highway in her Lexus SUV while under the influence of Ambien. She was acquitted of DUI today by a jury in White Plains, New York. 'Trevor was supportive - he’d never seen her drunk or under the influence when he’s been out with her,' said Yanni, a human rights activist who introduced 54-year-old Kerry to Donovan several years ago. The 35-year-old actor became a poster boy for women - and men - when he won the role of Teddy Montgomery in 90210 in 2009. Donovan’s character morphed from a serial dater of women to an out-of-the-closet gay man in the series. Asked about being a straight man playing a gay character, Donovan said at the time: 'It’s been good for me. Girls want to challenge it. They kind of assume I’m gay in real life and want to change me back. Of course I let them.' Donovan famously did a steamy 'reverse cowgirl', straddling actress Sandra Echeverria in Oliver Stone’s 2012 drug dealer film, Savages. Party harty: Trevor has been to numerous events with Kerry but has never seen her get drunk or do drugs . Ripped: Trevor was hands on with British beauty Kelly Brook at a modeling shoot in California . 9021 OH: Life's a beach for the TV star. Trevor was always a fan fave--and is there any question why! Kennedy, 54, the seventh child of the late Robert F. Kennedy, runs the RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights and travels extensively as an advocate for children and women. The couple connected a few years ago when Donovan volunteered at the organization and have been close ever since. Donovan has been included in ski vacations with the family and has even been a guest at the exclusive Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. They have been photographed in public together several times— his arm placed lovingly around her. Donovan has called her his 'besty' and revealed that Kerry and her mother, 85-year-old Ethel, made him an 'honorary Kennedy'. While there's no suggestion they're anything other than very close friends - Donovan has been tweeting recently about going on a series of blind dates - Kennedy family members worry that Kerry’s relationship with Donavan could spark additional censure for the controversial family. 'Trevor and Kerry are extremely low . key and discreet. But there is great affection between them. They are . soul mates and have the same passions for social justice, outdoor sports . and animals', the family member told MailOnline. Kennedy . has three daughters with her ex-husband, New York State Governor Andrew . Cuomo, Michaela, 17, and twins Cara and Mariah, 19. Kennedy’s . marriage to Cuomo exploded in 2003, when it was revealed she was having . an affair with a handsome polo playing multi-millionaire named Bruce . Colley, then 50. Trying times: Kennedy was arrested for driving under the influence after she crashed her SUV in 2012. She was accompanied by sister Rory Kennedy, left, at the trial. Trevor has offered his full support of his ""besty"" Cuomo, who reportedly had himself been having a series of extra-marital affairs, promptly divorced the Kennedy heiress. Sources close to the families have revealed that the Cuomo/Kennedy union was basically an arranged marriage meant to unite the two powerful American political dynasties and revive the badly sagging Kennedy brand. Years of scandal - from posthumous revelations about JFK’s sexual exploits with movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe and mob molls like Judith Campbell Exner to Ted Kennedy’s drunken plunge into the sea where a female aide drowned - did little to bring back the glory days of Camelot. Even tragic John F. Kennedy Jr., who famously denounced his Kennedy cousins as 'poster boys for bad behavior', had a tumultuous marriage with a reportedly cocaine-addicted wife. Cheating & lies: Kerry Kennedy married now NY Governor Andrew Cuomo in Washington DC in 1990. But 13 years later they split after her scandalous affair with polo player Bruce Colley was revealed . Blind Date: Trevor has admitted that he's been dating. He was spotted lunching with a brunette at King's Road Cafe in Hollywood during the trial.  But the actor has tweeted how much he misses Kerry . Donovan has not been at Kennedy’s side at the New York trial, remaining in Los Angeles where he is working on several projects. On November 22, Trevor tweeted Kerry: 'Miss you friend'. Family sources believe that now the trial is over and Kerry can focus once again on her human rights work, they will pick up where they left off. Yanni says they are 'best friends'.","Trevor Donovan, 35, calls Kerry Kennedy his 'besty' and they've 'been tight for a couple of years'

The former French first lady put on a brave face as she beamed for the cameras outside the Christian Dior Womenswear show at Paris Fashion Week on Friday. However, with no presidential limousine to whisk her home afterwards, she decided to take the Metro instead, with some passengers seemingly unaware that the president’s former partner was on the platform.

Blending in: Two passengers were seemingly oblivious to the presence of the former first lady . Trierweiler told Paris Match magazine that when she found out that Hollande was ending their relationship it ‘was like I'd fallen from a skyscraper’. Hollande drew headlines and ridicule worldwide in January after a gossip magazine reported that he had zipped through Paris in a face-covering helmet on a motor scooter for a tryst with French actress Julie Gayet - unbeknownst to his first lady. Trierweiler added: ‘Clearly I had heard the rumours but you heard (rumours) about everyone. I hear them about myself too, all of the time. I paid no attention to them.’ In good spirits: Trierweiler was still smiling as she left the Dior show (left) and seemed in equally good cheer as she prepared to step on to a waiting Metro train (right) According to The Telegraph, Trierweiler, 48, says she has spoken to Hollande on the phone every day since he announced he was ending their 'shared life together.' Hollande apparently called her on the first day of her trip to Mumbai, where she launched a charity in defiance of Elysee staff, and again after a press conference yesterday when she stressed their relationship would not be rekindled. Trierweiler has also confirmed that she will not be returning to the 'cynicism' of political journalism following the split, and instead plans to launch a career as a humanitarian campaigner.
