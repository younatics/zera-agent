"He was one of the most infamous and feared gangsters of his time. But Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel's unsolved murder in June 1947 sparked decades of mystery. Now, the family of his former best friend, Moe Sedway, has told Los Angeles magazine that they know who was behind the brutal shooting - and why they did it. Siegel, an American mobster with the Luciano crime family, was shot dead in his girlfriend Virginia Hill's Beverly Hills home, just south of Sunset Boulevard, on the night of June 20, 1947. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel (pictured), an American mobster with the Luciano crime family, was shot dead in his girlfriend Virginia Hill's Beverly Hills home, just south of Sunset Boulevard, on June 20, 1947 . The 41-year-old was reading a newspaper in the living room when a gunman fired a .30-caliber military M1 carbine through the window, fatally striking him in the head and torso. Iconic black-and-white photos, later released by police, show the glamorous Hollywood gangster slumped backward on a sofa, his head drooped to the side and his left eye blown out. In subsequent decades, Siegel's murder became Beverly Hills Police Department's most famous unsolved case, leaving both historians and law officials perplexed. It sparked a series of rumors over the circumstances of his death, including  that Mob boss Meyer Lansky ordered his murder due to his overspending on the Flamingo Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Siegel, who named the hotel after his girlfriend's 'flamingo-like' legs, had spent up to six times his original $1million budget, including vast amounts of Lansky's money, on the venture. But in a new interview, Robbie Sedway, whose father, Moe, was Siegel's best friend for years, claims the famous gangster was not killed in a dispute over money. Killed: This iconic black-and-white photo shows Siegel's body on a morgue table, with a tag looped on his toe . Famous: 41-year-old Siegel was reading a newspaper in the living room when a gunman fired a .30-caliber military M1 carbine through the window, fatally striking him in the head and torso. Above, his gravestone . Instead, Siegel was apparently murdered for love. 'It's a love story,' said Robbie, revealing his mother, Bee Sedway, was at the center of the dispute. Bee, who lived her later years in a ranch house in Corona, California, gave a two-hour interview to documentary filmmakers in 1993, which was recently obtained by the magazine, . In the footage,the 75-year-old told of how she had been introduced to Siegel by her husband Moe, whom she met while working at The Paradise Cabaret in Manhattan and married in 1935. Plot: Siegel was murdered by his friend Bee Sedway's (left) lover, Mathew 'Moose' Pandza (right), on behalf of Bee's husband, Moe Sedway, it is claimed. Bee and Moose met at a Los Angeles club and later married . Family: When asked why he has finally decided to break his silence over Siegel's death, Robbie Sedway (right), who was the son of Moe (left) and Bee, replied: 'Everyone's been wondering for 67 years. I mean, why not?' Six weeks after they met, Moe reportedly told Bee: 'I want you to meet one of my best friends in all the world,' before introducing her to Siegel, whose 'beautiful blue' eyes 'fascinated' her. However, Siegel was apparently not as enamored with Moe's new woman, telling his friend: 'Moey, she's so pretty, but she's got that little hairline space between her teeth.' But in following years, the pair became close friends, with Siegel teaching Bee how to walk properly, introducing her to his fellow gangster friends and calling her his 'little lunatic'. In the footage, Bee confirmed  the star was not gunned down over money, saying he would 'never' have been killed for financial reasons. In trouble with the law: It was in a proposal for a book called Bugsy's Little Lunactic that Bee Sedway revealed what she claimed to be the truth behind Siegel's murder. Above, Siegel  (left) with his attorney Jerry Giesler . However, it was only in a proposal for a book called Bugsy's Little Lunactic - that was never published amid fears it was 'too dangerous' - that she revealed the 'truth' behind Siegel's murder. In the document, also seen by the magazine, Bee explained how Siegel had threatened the life of her husband, who was tasked with keeping track of the money Lanskey was fronting for the casino, which was poorly received when it first opened in December 1946. She said Siegel had declared he wanted Moe 'gone', saying: 'I'll have Moe shot, chop his body up, and feed it to the Flamingo Hotel's kitchen garbage disposal.' She revealed that she had then called up her lover - Mathew 'Moose' Pandza, a truck driver and crane operator - and asked him to help protect her husband from the gangster. Partner: Siegel's girlfriend, Virginia Hill, testifies before the Kefauver organized crime hearings in New York . Interview: Al Tannebaum (l-r), Abe 'Kid Twist' Reles and District Attorney Burton Fitts give evidence on Siegel . Bee had met  Moose, a 6ft 3in native Angeleno whom she described as a 'great cook', at a Los Angeles club at a time when Moe was seeing a mistress. The pair quickly fell in love. She later told her husband that she had met someone and wanted to get married, before he insisted on meeting Moose and agreed on a deal to 'share' his wife. Moe and Moose shortly became 'as close as two fingers on one hand,' according to Bee's book proposal. Threat: Shortly before his death, Siegel (pictured) appearnetly declared he wanted Moe Sedway 'gone', saying: 'I'll have Moe shot and chop his body up' It was this man - Bee's lover, Moe's trusted friend and a non-member of the crime family - who killed Siegel, according to Robbie. Robbie, who saw Moose as a 'fatherly figure' during his childhood years, revealed he had asked his mother aged 16 whether she knew who killed the gangster. 'She said, 'Moose.' And I'm like, 'Moose?' She said, 'Don't ever tell anybody', he said. Bee later told him that Moe had finally decided he could no longer live in fear of Siegel following his death threat, Robbie said. 'Moose, he's got to be gotten rid of,' Moe reportedly told Bee's lover. 'What other answer is there?' Robbie added that Lansky  gave his blessing to the murder - but insisted that no-one within the 'family' could be involved. In the following weeks, Moose reportedly practiced shooting targets in the sand dunes of El Monte, before monitoring police patrols on Linden Drive and waiting for the perfect moment to strike. He then stepped through Siegel's flowerbeds, rested his gun on Miss Hill's windowsill and fired at the mobster, is is alleged. He later covered his tracks and was never found out. When asked why he has finally decided to break his silence over Siegel's death, Robbie, who was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2007, replied: 'Everyone's been wondering for 67 years. I mean, why not?' Robbie passed away in July this year following the interview with Los Angeles magazine, which features in its October edition.","Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel was shot dead in his girlfriend's home in June 1947 .

"They say opposites attract, and psychologists agree. According to research, couples who are too similar to each other, both physically and in personality, are less likely to have a long lasting relationship than those with some distance between them. The theory matches many seemingly perfect Hollywood marriages which failed to last, from Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor to Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. Stormy relationship: Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor display their wedding rings, but their marriage failed to last . But research by personality experts suggests the secret is not being too close to each other but as close as makes you happy - even if that means being very different. Those annoying couples who seem to agree with each other all the time may find they are actually too close for comfort, said the study by Columbia University in the United States. Observers often noted that Burton and Taylor seemed so similar in fiery personality that they appeared to find it as hard to live together as they did to live apart. And Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston seemed so well matched they even seemed to look alike at one point, yet the relationship failed to last. Its public health department conducted three years of psychological profiles on 732 adult men and women for the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, . They were questioned on their relationships, levels of intimacy, overall satisfaction, closeness to their partner, how often they thought of breaking up, commitment and depression. Hollywood couple: Actress Jennifer Aniston and former husband Brad Pitt in 2004, but they too didn't last . How close they are to their partner was measured in a test commonly used by psychologists which is called 'Inclusion of Other in Self'. It looks at how much two people share personality traits, values, identity and points of view among other aspects of their life together. Added together, researchers claim they could use the information to compare the closeness of couples against their happiness and the strength of their relationship. The couples with the strongest relationships were those that were neither the closest nor the most distant but somewhere in between. Tellingly, these couples knew they were not as close as they could be but they were happier this way, said lead author Professor David Frost. He said: 'It's not how close you feel that matters most, it's whether you are as close as you want to be, even if that's really not close at all.' And he warned: 'People who yearn for a more intimate relationship and people who crave more distance are equally at risk of having a problematic relationship. 'If you want to experience your relationship as healthy and rewarding, it's important that you find a way to attain your idealised level of closeness with your partner.' Feeling either too close or not close enough will see a relationship weaken and eventually break up, he added. And the concept could be extended beyond romantic relationships and into those between parents and children, co-workers or simply friends, he said.",Study by Columbia University says couples who agree with each other all the time may find they are actually too close for comfort .
"Horrific: Lord Dalmeny has admitted his comment about the concentration camp, made at an event in London's Hurlingham Club, was 'horrific' A Tory-supporting peer has been forced to apologise after making a joke about Auschwitz at a glittering party function attended by David Cameron. Lord Dalmeny, chairman of auctioneers Sotheby’s UK, has now admitted his comment about the concentration camp was ‘horrific’. Guests at last week’s Black And White Party at the exclusive Hurlingham Club in London were said to be shocked by the  ill-judged remark. It came as Lord Dalmeny, whose wife Caroline was a Tory Cabinet aide, conducted a fundraising auction. Sweltering under the lights, he quipped: ‘Turn those horrible lights down – I feel like I am in Auschwitz.’ It was not Lord Dalmeny’s only politically incorrect joke of the evening. Pouring scorn on France’s socialist president Francois Hollande, he referred to the French as ‘frogs’. And when auctioning the original copy of Mr Cameron’s speech on the EU referendum last month, he said: ‘This is a Gideons Bible for people who do not trust foreigners very much.’ Lord Dalmeny last night apologised for his ‘horrific’ Auschwitz wisecrack. He said: ‘I’m sorry if anyone was offended. I meant to say “Colditz”. It  was a horrific slip of the tongue.’ The Black And White Party is the social highlight of the Tory calendar and one of the party’s main fundraising events. This year’s bash was attended by a raft of Cabinet Ministers, including party chairman Grant Shapps, who is Jewish. Exclusive: He made the comment during last week's Black and White Party at the exclusive Hurlingham Club in London . It is not the first time that Lord Dalmeny’s behaviour has hit the headlines. At an auction last October, attended by Princess Beatrice, he referred to the Tories as ‘c***s’. In 2011, he acted as auctioneer for an event to mark what would have been the late Freddie Mercury’s 65th birthday dressed in a sober grey suit, cut away at the back to reveal suspenders, PVC shorts and fishnet stockings. Although Lord Dalmeny has no formal role within the party, he has performed as a fundraising auctioneer for the Tories before. And his wife Caroline has worked as an advisor to Lord Strathclyde who left the Cabinet last month, and for Michael Portillo when he  was a senior party figure. Comments: Lord Dalweny, who is chairman of auctioneers Sotheby's UK, made other politically incorrect comments, referring to the French as 'frogs' Lord Dalmeny is the heir to the Earl of Rosebery, who lost his seat in the House of Lords in 1999 when most hereditary  peers were thrown out. Friends of Dalmeny defended him last night and pointed out that he had raised £120 million for charity by offering his services as an auctioneer free. Last week alone, he presided, unpaid, over four charity events. A Conservative Party spokesman last night said: ‘Lord Dalmeny has rightly apologised. His comments were utterly inappropriate and unacceptable.’ But Labour branded the remark ‘absolutely disgraceful’ and suggested the Tories should donate the proceeds of last week’s event to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust.","Lord Dalmeny made comment at exclusive Hurlingham Club in London .

"Death: Gavin Bedford died after pipework collapsed on top of him at the Gerber plant in Llantrisant . A drinks firm has been ordered to pay an £80,000 fine over errors which led to the death of a promising young engineer. Gavin Bedford, 24, from Porthcawl was killed at a factory where the popular Innocent smoothie brand was made in Llantrisant, South Wales after he was struck by falling pipework. The talented surfer and cyclist was employed as an electro-mechanical engineer by the Gerber Juice Company, now trading as Refresco Gerber UK Ltd, when his life was cut short by the accident. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said the company pleaded guilty to a breach of health and safety laws at Newport Crown Court. After the hearing, his mum Anna told of her heartbreak as she paid tribute to her 'perfect son.' She said: 'It was as if Gavin was put on this earth to do such wonderful things, to help anybody that needed him. 'He . touched everyone he knew and he had thousands of friends. I am so proud . to have been Gavin's mother. The world is a poorer place without him.' Mr Bedford had been tasked with dismantling machinery at the plant in Llantrisant Business Park before Gerber moved operations to their headquarters in Bridgwater, Somerset. But as he removed a large metal overhead pipe it fell and landed on his head, causing extensive skull fractures and brain injuries. His injuries were not discovered until a supervisor returned 40 minutes after the accident, having said he was going to find an adjustable spanner. Mr Bedford was taken away in an ambulance but died three days later in the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. Perfect son: His mum Anna told of her heartbreak as she paid tribute to her perfect son . His dad Nigel, who had become seriously ill in the aftermath of his son's death, said: 'This type of work was obviously dangerous and Gerber should have looked after Gavin properly.' The company was ordered to pay an £80,000 fine at Newport Crown Court yesterday after admitting health and safety breaches that contributed to his death. They also agreed to pay £75,000 in costs outside court following their guilty plea, which came after an earlier court appearance. Judge Patrick Curran QC said no risk assessment or detailed plans for removing the pipework had been produced after it was overlooked during initial work. On top of this the supervisor tasked with overseeing the final stages of the operation was unqualified for demolition projects and had never been given any health and safety training relevant to the task in hand. Factory: Mr Bedford had an accident at this factory where the  Innocent smoothie brand was made in Llantrisant . The large pipe should have been removed using scaffolding but despite an agreement that it would be put in place there was no formal instruction given. Instead, plans to pull down the pipe were made by removing bolts before pulling it away from its fixtures from below with ropes. Judge Curran said there had been a breakdown in communication and the lack of detailed plans for the work meant Gavin, as a keen, hard-working employee, took it upon himself to take down the last heavy metal pipe by himself. He added: 'That is why you plan.' But he recognised the firm had an otherwise untarnished health and safety record. Outside court the Health and Safety Executive's inspector Liam Osborne said there was a basic failure to plan, manage and monitor. He said: 'Any demolition or dismantling work must be set down in writing and strictly monitored, as the law requires. It is also basic common sense. 'If Gerber had given enough time at the beginning to think through what needed to be done, and how it should be done, then Gavin would still be here today.'","Gavin Bedford, 24, died when he was struck by falling pipework .

"The man used a giant wave to take care of a serious eye condition known as pterygium, in which fibrous tissue grows over the outer layer of the eye. The ailment, popularly known as 'surfer's eye,' is is common in people who spend a lot of time outdoors in sunny climates. Normally, pterygium requires surgery to treat. However, the 61-year-old surfer took a more radical route. The surfer's eye three days after he stuck his head in the water to remove excess tissue from his eye though he did suffer mild inflammation as a result . He dipped his head in cascading water while riding a huge 30-foot wave in Waimea Bay, a popular surfing spot known for big waves off the coast of Oahu, according to research published recently in the journal BMJ Case Reports. 'He momentarily dipped his face into the water while travelling at top speed, but was able to recover his balance and continue surfing the wave,' Dr. Thomas Campbell, a medical officer at Princess Alexandra Hospital in Queensland, Australia wrote in the journal article late last month. 'This impressive maneuver resulted in the pterygium being ripped off his eye surface,' he added. The surfer (top left) while surfing a 30-foot wave at Waimea Bay off of the Hawaiian island of Oahu . Although the surfer's eye was inflamed following his nontraditional medical treatment, his vision did return to normal.. The pterygium is not easy to remove, even with scalpels and scissors, Dr. Mark Fromer, an opthamologist at New York City's Lenox Hill hospital told LiveScience. Fromer said it's likely the force of the water from the wave ripped his conjunctiva, a membrane on the eye's surface, that would have provided a blood supply to the pterygium. Although big wave surfers can reach speeds of 30 or 40 miles per hour, it's not easy for the blunt force of water to rip off a pterygium. This vascular tissue is even difficult to remove with scalpels and scissors,said Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. 'But it would take a heck of shot of water to do that,' he added. 'Pretty unlikely this is going to happen to anyone else.'

"A shade of YSL lipstick is virtually no longer available after viewers of a hit Korean TV show believed it was the one worn by the lead actress. According to The Korea Herald, fans of the fantasy romance, My Love From Another Star, 'mistakenly heard' that the female protagonist, Jeon Ji-Hyun, wore YSL's Rouge Pur Couture No 52. Now the coral color is no longer available on dozens of cosmetics websites and there is an 'unspecified' waitlist on YSL's own e-store. On eBay sticks of the $35 lippy are currently going for up to $95 - and that's with 29 days still left on the clock. Confusion: A global shortage of YSL lipstick has come about after viewers of the hit Korean TV show, My Love From Another Star, mistakenly thought the lead actress, Jeon Ji-Hyun, used it . Elle Australia reported that one . shopper at Melbourne airport tried to buy 52 tubes of the rouge but walked away empty-handed. And during Fashion Weeks in Europe earlier this year editors were hunting high and low for the YSL hue but had no joy. A representative for the Paris-head quartered cosmetics brand confirmed to NYmag.com that the . sellout is as a result of My Love From Another Star. Phones have apparently been ringing off the hook with customers trying to identify the shade 32-year-old Ms Ji-hyan wears on screen.

Flying off the shelves: Now the coral color is no longer available on dozens of cosmetics websites and there is an 'unspecified' waitlist on YSL's own e-store . An industry source told the publication: 'The color of her lips [during the show] cannot be produced by a single product. 'The make-up artist mixed a number of different [products], and YSL was not one of them.' Ms Ji-hyan reportedly used products made by AmorePacific, Korea’s largest beauty company, which was an official sponsor of My Love from The Star, not YSL.

"Yvonne Fletcher, 25, was shot dead the day after British spies intercepted a Libyan order to 'cover the streets of London in blood', it was alleged today . Spies at GCHQ intercepted a message from Colonel Gaddafi to 'cover the streets of London with blood' the night before WPc Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead but failed to pass it on in time, it was alleged today. Mike Arnold, 56, who worked as a technology officer at the British intelligence agency at the time, said he was speaking out now because Miss Fletcher's relatives deserved to know 'the truth'. The 25-year-old policewoman was fatally shot as she covered an anti-Gaddafi protest outside the Libyan embassy in central London on 17 April 1984. Mr Arnold alleges that a communications worker at GCHQ in Cheltenham walked into his officer the day Miss Fletcher died holding two telex messages, which he said had been missed by night staff the evening before. One message detailed three possible ways of handling the expected protest against the Libyan leader the next day. Mr Arnold told The Times the message contained details of a conversation between the London embassy, known as the People's Bureau, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tripoli. He said: '[The supervisor] stood in front of me holding the telex paper in his hand and he read the three options to me.... 'The options were to clash directly with the demonstrators from outside the bureau, to fire on them from inside the bureau, or to prevent the demonstration by diplomatic pressure.' He said the supervisor then read the reply from the Libyan Foreign Ministry which gave the order to follow the second option and 'cover the streets of London with blood'. Mr Arnold, who says he voiced his . concerns in private to politicians over the past decade, said the . telexes had already been de-encrypted and translated before they . arrived, suggesting they had been passed on by the US National Security . Agency. He said GCHQ night . staff often slept in the office when they were meant to be working, and . would wake up just before the end of their shift and leave a pile of . telexes that had come in overnight for the day staff to sort through. Police hats left where they fell after PC Yvonne Fletcher was fatally shot outside the Libyan embassy in London . Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi - the British policewoman was shot at a protest against him . Flowers laid at PC Fletcher's grave in St James' Square, central London, where she was shot in April 1984 . While the existence of the two messages is acknowledged, it was previously understood that security staff did not know about them until after the demonstration, by which time the policewoman had been shot. As a result of GCHQ's failure an . internal investigation was launched, resulting in changes to the way . British spies handled terror intelligence. Previously, it is said that British spies concentrated 24-hour watches on the threat from Moscow, but after the Libyan murder, intelligence staff turned their attention onto the terror threat, too. Today . a colleague and friend of Miss Fletcher, who knelt beside her as she . died, said that if the message had been passed on, the demonstration . would not have been allowed to happen. The former Libyan embassy in St James' Square, London, where Miss Fletcher was shot by machine-gun fire . The British ambassador to Libya in 1984, Oliver Miles, received a midnight warning before Miss Fletcher was shot . John Murray, 58, said he was planning legal action against the Government over the 'disgraceful' allegations. Last week it was revealed that Libyan officials twice warned Britain of impending violence hours before Miss Fletcher was shot, but the veiled threats were regarded as 'standard Libyan line'. One of the warnings was made by two Libyan officials who took the ‘unusual’ step of going in person at midnight to the Foreign Office in London, secret Government files released this month said. The other, also delivered around midnight, was to the British Ambassador to Libya, Oliver Miles – who was so unimpressed he ‘made a bet’ that ‘no such demonstration will take place’. The protest was allowed to go ahead by Special Branch – despite intelligence reports that weapons and ‘assassins’ were being assembled at the embassy. Miss Fletcher's mother said today that no revelation would change what happened. Speaking from her home near Shaftesbury, Wiltshire, Queenie Fletcher, 80, said: 'When something is resolved, every year something else happens or is said. 'People keep asking us the same questions - what do we think about this or that - but it will never go away, whatever happens. 'For us, it does not matter - it will never go away.'

"Race row: Jeffrey Tucker said plans to combine services of Havering and Newham councils would be like throwing an African football team and an English team together and expecting it to work . A councillor has sparked a race row by claiming that white council officers would not be able to work with their black colleagues. Jeffrey Tucker, who represents Rainham on Havering Council, said it would be like throwing an African football team and an English team together and expecting it to work. He slammed proposals to combine the back office services of Havering and Newham councils in east London in a bid to save cash. Mr Tucker said white staff would find it 'awkward and uncomfortable' to work with black workers. The shopkeeper's incendiary comments were last night branded 'dangerous' and 'extraordinarily offensive' by a top London Assembly member. Mr Tucker, who leads the Independent Residents' Group that includes Havering's only black councillor, also stuck the boot in to neighbouring Newham by labelling it 'filthy'. The married dad said he's been losing sleep over the staff merger because he's so worried by it. Mr Tucker, who's owned Rainham Goldmine jewellery shop for 23 years, said: 'I think it's a terrible idea. I can't see the two councils being able to work together. We've got 95 per cent white English workers in Havering Council and Newham Council is 95 per cent not white English.' The local councillor added: 'It would be like putting two football teams together - an African team and an English team - and saying: ""Get on and work together"".' Mr Tucker said that working with Newham authority officers would be like being 'pushed in at the deep end' for Havering's workforce. But Andrew Boff, London Assembly's Conservative group leader, said he was 'dumbstruck' by the attack. Mr Boff, 55, said: 'There's an inference that people of African origin can't get on with people who are ethnically white. That's deeply offensive. I can't understand why, in 2013, this councillor seems to think that an attitude that separates people because of race is OK.' The leading London Tory added: 'Havering is getting more diverse and he needs to buck up his ideas. 'His comments must be terribly offensive to people in his ward with African heritage.' Mr Boff, who lives in nearby Barking, has now called for Havering Council to step in and offer Cllr Tucker some urgent 'diversity awareness training'. 'Filthy': In a separate outburst, Cllr Tucker told a council meeting Newham was much dirtier than Havering . Mr Tucker has held Rainham and Wennington since 2002 and won his seat by the biggest majority in Havering in 2010. The . ward's population is 16 per cent non-white, according to statistics . from the 2011 census, which makes it one of the most diverse in the . borough. Newham is one of the most ethnically diverse boroughs in the UK. The 2011 census showed that just 29 per cent of its population is white with about 43 per cent Asian and almost 20 per cent black. In a separate outburst, Cllr Tucker told a council meeting this week that Newham was much dirtier than Havering. He told shocked councillors: 'You walk round the streets of Havering and we have clean streets, good shops, good housing stock and a well-run council. 'But Newham's streets aren't clean like our streets. Their shops are open all hours with no control. 'Dumbstruck': Top Tory Andrew Boff labelled Mr Tucker's comments 'dangerous' and 'extraordinarily offensive'. Mr Boff has called for Havering Council to offer Cllr Tucker some urgent 'diversity awareness training' 'Our residents understand we have to take our curtains down and wash our windows.But go around Newham and look at some of their curtains and they're stuck to the windows. 'You look at the streets and they are filthy.You look at the shops and they aren't clean like our shops.' Roger Reid, 43, of Newham, said the councillor should be sacked immediately. He said: 'How can someone who is meant to be in a position of responsibility have such outdated views? 'This man needs more than diversity training, he needs to start looking at how the world has progressed over the past 100 years. 'We are not living in the 19th century, which is where this man belongs.' Councillor Clarence Barrett, leader of the Havering Residents' Association, added: 'I totally condemn the reprehensible comments of Cllr Tucker. They are bigoted, shameful and a downright disgrace. 'He has offended the people of Newham and Havering in equal measure and is no longer fit to be a councillor in Havering. 'May I make it absolutely clear that Cllr Tucker and his Independent Residents group have no connection whatsoever with the Residents Association group on Havering Council.'","Jeffrey Tucker represents Rainham on Havering Council, East London .

"A hotel has been forced to cover up a building site hoarding after complaints that it is sexist. Malmaison, in Manchester, had put up a risque 7ft image of a scantily clad woman holding a power tool to hide ongoing construction work. But author and Manchester University Professor Jeanette Winterson likened the image to 'soft porn'. Malmaison in Manchester has been forced to cover up a building site hoarding after complaints it is sexist . She said: 'Plenty of women on business stay at the Malmaison. 'To get to their hotel room at the end of a long day they must take in, or blank out, the message that women at work are really soft-porn babes. 'The hard-hat babes send out a message that aligns with male fantasy not female reality. 'And that's a problem. 'Suppose you are a girl who wants to go into the manual trades.

"Skimpy bedwear: Women in the south are more likely to put on sexy nightie for bed, while northern ladies prefer to cover up . While Northern girls may be famed for the skimpy outfits they wear on a night out, it seems it is their Southern counterparts who are more relaxed when it comes to bedroom attire. According to new research, girls down South wear far skimpier clothes in bed at night, with 73 per cent of females in London sleeping in just their underwear or the nude. And the further north you go, the more likely you'll find women covering up in flannel pyjama bottoms and long-sleeved tops, something researchers put down to the colder weather. Sharon Webb, head of lingerie buying and . design at Debenhams, who carried out the survey, said: 'From . barely-there sleepwear to bananas-in-pyjamas attire, there is a strong . connection between what you wear to bed and where you live. 'Sleepwear is likely to be bought on impulse, but buying behaviour suggests that the further south you go, less is worn to bed. 'Pyjama . parties in the south may be a little bit more revealing than those in . the north, with the sauciest sleepers living in the South West.' In the South West - especially Devon, . which has the second highest number of over 50s in England - short, thin-strapped, loose-fitting nightgowns and skimpy sleepwear . are the most popular choices. In the north, 87 per cent of women . said they preferred a comfy set of flannel pyjama and soft slippers while ladies of the Midlands favour shorts and vest combos. In Wales, imitations of men's shirts remain popular with 77 per cent of those questioned favouring them while women in Ireland favour classic . knee-length nighties and sweeping nightdresses and dressing . gowns are popular in Scotland. Professor Karen Pine - a psychologist from Hertfordshire University, who analysed the results for the department store - said: 'Our clothes are a means of self-expression, and this extends to our sleepwear too. 'What you wear to bed can say a lot about your lifestyle, your relationship and your personality. Paying attention to what you wear to bed is just as important as carefully choosing your day wardrobe. Cosy and warm: Northern women prefer comfort over style when it comes to nightwear . 'The . right sleepwear not only tells others a lot about you, it can also . boost your feelings of self-esteem, sensuality and security.' NORTH: Flannel . pyjamas and slippers - The most traditional style of nightwear which . reflects a conventional personality. This style suggests a person who . prefers comfort and warmth to unbridled passion. MIDLANDS: . Shorts and vests - Not trying hard to seduce or impress, playful and . comfortable with who they are. Not quite bold enough to go fully nude, . preferring to tease rather than reveal. SOUTH: . Undies or nothing - The uninhibited sleeper who slips under the sheets . in just their undies, or nothing at all, is not afraid of their . passionate side. Bedtime may be more about sensuality and intimacy than . it is about sleep. IRELAND: Classic . nightie - A classic nightie is the safe choice of someone always . concerned about other people. She worries about what the postman might . think if she has to make a quick dash for the door in the morning. SCOTLAND: . Long nightdresses and dressing gowns - Indicates a person who sleeps . alone, or who really feels the cold. Getting a good night's sleep is . their priority and their nightwear has to cosset and protect them, as . the arms of a sleeping partner might do for others. WALES: Sleep . shirt - A less conventional choice - some might say an indecisive one, . covering mainly the top half. The say an indecisive one - covering . mainly the top half. The sleepshirt wearer has a thoughtful personality, . is a careful decision-maker and it may take time to really get to know . them.","Women in the South of the UK more likely to wear nothing to bed .

"The pastor of a Florida megachurch with a congregation in excess of 20,000 has resigned over a 'moral failing.' Church elders announced to an estimated 7,500 parishioners attending a special Sunday meeting of the Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale that Pastor Bob Coy, 58, had resigned. In a statement released Sunday, church elders said Coy, of Coral Springs, resigned Thursday as senior pastor of the 20,000-member Calvary Church 'after confessing to a moral failing in his life which disqualifies him from continuing his leadership role.' Scroll down for video . Moral failure: Bob Coy's bright white smile apparently masked multiple sins . Mega: Coy's church has 20,000 congregants and assets valued at $135 million . Coy's Active Word ministry on radio, television and digital media has also been suspended, the church said. Shocked: Congregants were taken aback at the announcement that Bob Coy stood down . 'Most people were shocked,' congregant Robert Milne told the Sun-Sentinel. 'A lot of people were hurt, a lot of people are disappointed.' Outreach Magazine listed Calvary Chapel as the 14th-largest church in America and one of the fastest-growing last year. The church has assets valued at $135 million, according to the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability. Blogger Michael Newnham wrote 'We have confirmed that Coy has admitted to at least two affairs in the past year alone and has had a long standing “problem with pornography,' though the church has not elaborated on what Coy's moral failings were. Coy founded Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale in 1985 with his wife Diane. The couple have two children. Coy's . social media accounts make no mention of the revelations, although . interestingly, the only person he follows on Facebook is a buxom Zumba . instructor named Gigi. 'Who Jesus is ought to determine what we do. Our actions and Christ's example ought to harmonize. If they don't, then we're no longer following Jesus in the truest practical sense. We are disciples in word - but not in deed,' he posted on Facebook just days ago. Sins of the father: Coy, seen here with his wife and family, has resigned his position from the church he founded . 'Pastor Bob will be focusing his full attention on his personal relationship with God and with his family,' the church's statement reads.

"Before taking on a life of service, aspiring nun Mary Beth Baker is seeking a helping hand. The 28-year-old has been accepted to a Tennessee convent, but can only enter once she's paid off her remaining student loan. The Washington D.C. resident has until mid-August to find the $25,000 or forfeit her place with the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecelia in Nashville. 'You’re taken care of (at the convent) but you’re definitely not making money,' Baker told ABCNews.com. Deadline: Mary Beth Baker, 28, can only join the convent in mid-August if she clears her remaining $25,000 student debt . Crowdfunding: Mary Beth Baker (pictured left and right) has turned to FUNDLY to raise money to cover her debt . Baker racked up a hefty debt while studying philosophy at Christendom College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Front Royal, Virginia. While her Alma mater has forgiven some of her debt, she has been left with a significant sum to pay off in a short time. Not one to sit on her hands, the young woman has turned to crowdfunding website FUNDLY, netting more than $5,900 in donations so far. From today, she has 57 days to raise the rest. 'I have two months to get there. Please also consider spreading the word,' she wrote. 'More than anything else, though, please keep me and the other young women who will be entering with me in your prayers. God bless you!' It's no surprise that Baker has sought help online, following reports in 2012 that aspiring nun Nicole Ferko waited 10 years to join a convent while she paid off her $60,000 student loan. New life: Baker will have to tie up her financial loose ends before she is allowed to enter the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecelia in Nashville (pictured) Starting over: Baker, 28, will quit her pubic relations job in Washington D.C. and sell her belongings before entering the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecelia convent (pictured) Baker decided to become a nun last year, concluding that a life of prayer, poverty and 5am wake up calls suited her better than her PR job in Washington D.C. She currently works as a senior staff writer at The Pinkston Group, and before that was an associate op-ed editor at The Washington Times. The talented writer said she hit a low point in 2013 when work and dating no longer satisfied her, and began to pray about it. 'After . a certain point I started meeting regularly with a priest who was . getting to know me, and then he put me in touch with the sisters,' she told ABCNews.com. 'On my second visit, I was able to sit down and say, ‘This is my . story and I’d really like to enter'.' Pay off: Before joining the convent, Baker has to settle the remaining $25,000 of college debt she racked up while studying philosophy at Christendom College, a Catholic liberal arts school in Front Royal, Virginia (pictured) After going through the application process, which included a . physical and psychological evaluation, she received an invitation . last week to join the convent. 'It’s . a life of poverty and that’s the beauty of it. You embrace it,' she . said. 'I’m incredibly blessed. Everyone has been very, very . supportive.'

"Lingerie brand Victoria's Secret has come under fire for an 'irresponsible' advert for their new 'push up denim range of bras. Featuring Angels Behati Prinsloo, Lily Aldridge and the face of the brands new perfume Jasmine Tookes, the ad looks much like the many others released by the brand over the years, with the three  sculpted abs, gazelle like legs and perfect white teeth smiling out at us. But what has upset many is the wording used across the poster, which states simply 'The Perfect Body'. The advert features (l-r) Angels Behati Prinsloo, Lily Aldridge and the face of the brands new perfume Jasmine Tookes, with the words 'The perfect body' emblazoned across their taught stomachs . It is this implication that the nigh un-achievable figures of the models, who often tower over 5ft 10in, is the ultimate shape for women that has prompted outrage. So strong in fact is the strength of feeling about the wording of the advert that a petition has been launched urging the lingerie brand to take it down. The campaign on change.org was set up by three students Gabriella Kountourides,Laura Ferris and Frances Black, who spotted the advert in a shopping centre in Leeds. Already having garnered over 1,900 signatures already the campaign has also prompted an avalanche of reaction on Twitter . Calling on Victoria's Secret to 'apologise for, and amend the irresponsible marketing of your new bra range 'Body'' the campaign states that the ad sends out an 'unhealthy and damaging message  about women’s bodies and how they should be judged'. Already having garnered over 1,900 signatures already the campaign has also prompted an avalanche of reaction on Twitter, with many criticizing the popular brand for the message it is sending through the advert, which is both on its website and at stores across the UK. In the impassioned but eloquent post on the petition site the three students state: . 'Every day women are bombarded with advertisements aimed at making them feel insecure about their bodies, in the hope that they will spend money on products that will supposedly make them happier and more beautiful. The petition has garnered huge support, with many echoing the message that the advert promotes an unrealistic body image for girls (sometimes by posting photos demonstrating their displeasure on social media) 'All this does is perpetuate low self-esteem among women who are made to feel that their bodies are inadequate and unattractive because they do not fit into a narrow standard of beauty. It contributes to a culture that encourages serious health problems such as negative body image and eating disorders. 'Victoria’s Secret’s new advertisements play on women's insecurities, and send out a damaging message by positioning the words 'The Perfect Body' across models who have exactly the same, very slim body type.' And many of  those choosing to sign the petition are echoing these sentiments in the comment section. Hannah Welby writes: 'Body shaming is irresponsible and damaging. As is setting a specific standard of beauty and perfection. As women we need to be encouraged and celebrated in all our appearances and not pigeonholed. For male campaigns this can also be an issue that needs adressing.' A previous employee of the brand, Amanda Synder agrees, writing: 'Society needs to change the way they view a woman's appearance. As a former Victoria's Secret employee, I know that the company was developed to design lingerie to make women feel better about themselves. The marketing team apparently didn't get the memo.' The MailOnline contacted Victoria's Secret for a comment but at the time of publication they had not responded.","Victoria's Secret has come under fire for an 'irresponsible' advert .

"Once a humble wellington boot brand loved by country bumpkins, Hunter has risen to become the footwear of choice for A-listers - and it's all thanks to one man. Alasdhair Willis, better known to some as Mr Stella McCartney, took the helm as creative director 18 months ago and since then he has given the brand a huge overhaul, introduced trend-led outerwear and ensured his show is one of fashion week's hottest tickets. As Hunter celebrates the official opening of its first global flagship store at 83 Regent Street in London today, FEMAIL caught up with the brains behind the brand. Scroll down for video . The main man: Alasdhair Willis, pictured at Buckingham Palace with his wife and fashion designer Stella McCartney, has given Hunter a huge revamp and chatted to FEMAIL about his plans for the British brand . 'The opening of the Hunter Flagship Store is a massive statement for the brand,' explained Willis, 44. 'It demonstrates our commitment to growing the business and maximising the incredible opportunity this great British brand has.' And Willis certainly made a statement with the opening event, which saw 28 dancers take over the London street to perform Singin' In The Rain. Paying tribute to the British capital, the performers arrived in one of the city's iconic red buses - all sporting coats and boots from the latest Hunter Original collection. Country in the city: The Regent Street store has been designed to resemble a barn and aims to pays homage to the British countryside within an urban setting . Dramatic scenes: The opening event saw 28 dancers take over the iconic London shopping street with a production inspired by Singin’ in the Rain . Just to ensure all eyes were definitely on the store, a free-runner scaled down the side before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto Regent Street. Inside, the store - which looks a little like a souped-up hay barn - the decor pays homage to the British countryside. Seating areas resemble the traditional farmhouse boot room, with boots displayed against a backdrop of box hedging and green tiles. Willis, like his wife a fan of all things high-tech, also oversaw the installation of a five-metre LED screen that cuts through both floors and plays fashion shows and ad campaigns on a loop. How fitting: The event was inspired by Gene Kelly's famous performance and Hunter's heritage of protecting from the weather and all terrains . Making a scene: A freerunner scaled the side of the new store before the production climaxed with a torrent of water spraying down onto Regent Street . The grass is greener: Seating areas resemble the traditional boot room and the collection is displayed against a backdrop of box hedging . 'The design of the store references some classic architectural features and materials that you might traditionally associate with the countryside or the outdoors, but they have been reinvented into an urban context,' he explained. Fresh from an evening spent having dinner with George Clooney and his new wife, Amal Alamuddin, the 44-year-old told of his plans to ensure that city shoppers get a truly rural shopping experience. 'The result of this is that you really experience the merging of the countryside and the city under one roof;' he enthuses. 'It is these two worlds coming together that represent what the new Hunter brand is all about.' Branching out: It's not just about the traditional boot anymore as Hunter expands its offering with outerwear, knitwear and accessories . The new store is an extension of the successful relaunch of the brand, which last appeared on the catwalk in front of a front row that included Rita Ora, Anna Wintour and Sir Paul McCartney. Among the highlights were striking khaki coats  with vibrant yellow and turquoise pockets and super-cool colour block outerwear. 'Hunter as a brand experience has always been about much more than just the Wellington boot,' explained the man behind the re-brand. 'Hunter has always represented emotion, fun, adventure and ultimately memorable experiences. The introduction of the new categories such as outerwear is an obvious and next step for the brand to express the much-loved brand spirit.' Top designer he might be, but Willis is, at heart, a family man, as the presence of Nancy Shevell, Sir Paul McCartney, and wife Stella McCartney on the sidelines of the SS/15 show made plain. 'The show was a great success for many reasons,' he mused. 'It demonstrated clearly that Hunter can be just as relevant as a spring / summer brand as it is for the winter months. 'It also clearly expressed the spirit of the brand in an authentic and highly memorable way and lastly it was very well recieved by both the press and the buyers, which is of course key. 'The support of friends and family is always important - it makes what is a very stressful event much more enjoyable.' What a crowd:  (L to R) Stella McCartney, Nancy Shevell, Sir Paul McCartney, Chrissie Hynde, Rita Ora and Jamie Campbell Bower attend the Hunter Original SS15 show . Speaking about the future, he added: 'The brand has undergone a massive transformation in the last 20 months and the ambitions for 2015 are no different. 'One of the key events in 2015 will be the launch of Hunter Field, which will be the brand’s more technical outdoor collection. 'Hunter Field will offer footwear and outwear to the guy and girl who wants to look amazing in the wilds of the great outdoors, but also need the assurance that the product will perform at the highest level in this environment.' Founded in 1856, Hunter is a British heritage brand that holds two Royal Warrants of Appointment to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Nevertheless, Willis has another queen in mind - the Queen of London's fashion scene to be precise - when it comes to pinpointing the ultimate Hunter woman. 'It would have to be the queen of the Wellington boot, Kate Moss,' said Willis. 'I can’t think of anyone that wears it better.' Fashionable pair: He says the support of friends and family is always important and makes what is a very stressful event much more enjoyable .","Alasdhair Willis became Hunter creative director last year .

"Janice Dickinson stepped out on Wednesday after going public with claims Bill Cosby drugged and raped her. The former supermodel turned reality TV star looked somber while hiding beneath a hat and dark sunglasses in Los Angeles. The 59-year-old kept her hand in front of her face as she dashed to her waiting car. Scroll down for video . Janice Dickinson stepped out in LA on Wednesday after going public with claims Bill Cosby drugged and raped her . The former model covered up in black tights, a black dress and leather jacket, teamed with pointy heels. Dickinson donned a large animal print hat worn low over her face and shielded her eyes with large sunglasses. She appeared in no mood to engage with the camera, and sported a serious expression as she got into the backseat of her car. Covering up: Dickinson wore black opaque stocking paired with a black dress and pointy shoes . Going incognito: The former model hid her face with an animal print hat worn low and large sunglasses . Out of the way, please: She appeared in no mood to engage with the camera, and sported a serious expression as she got into the backseat of her car . Dickinson gave a TV interview on Tuesday in which she alleged Cosby invited her to dinner to discuss a role on The Cosby Show, offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps. That is one of the last things she remembers of the evening. 'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' she told Entertainment Tonight. 'I remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs.' Shocking claim: Supermodel Janice Dickinson (above) has come forward to say she was drugged and rapped by Bill Cosby in 1982 . Bad guy: Dickinson says after Cosby allegedly gave her the pill, the next thing she remembers is 'waking up with her pajamas off and semen between her legs' Dickinson says her last memory of the night was of Cosby taking off his robe and climbing on top of her, and that the next morning she remembers 'a lot of pain.' The supermodel claims the incident occurred in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. However, Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, branded the allegation a 'complete lie.' She also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel, but that Cosby and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details. But Singer also flatly rejected this claim, saying: 'You can confirm with Harper Collins that she never claimed that Mr Cosby raped her, that no attorney representing Bill Cosby tried to kill the story... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about Bill Cosby in her book.' In a statement, reported by NBC News, he added: 'There is documentary proof that Janice Dickinson is fabricating and lying about Bill Cosby.' Cosby answered the door in nothing but a white towel. He was fresh from the shower, too; his black skin was glistening. He hugged me, a little too enthusiastically; told me how much he'd missed me, and how nice it was to see me. I believed him. Liquor does that to a girl. 'God, you're beautiful.' He kissed me, full on the lips, then went off to dress and we went downstairs, to dinner, where Cosby spent the next two hours talking about himself. It was An Evening with Bill Cosby. A Tribute to Bill Cosby. And suddenly I remembered something Andy Warhol once told me. It was his definition of an actor. He said, 'An actor is a person whose eyes glaze over when the conversation is no longer about them.' And I thought, Well, then, Bill Cosby is an actor's actor. After dinner he asked me back to his room, and I went. But I stopped myself at the door. 'I'm exhausted,' I said, begging off. His eyebrows went a little funny. 'Exhausted?' he asked, and it was clear he was trying hard to keep his temper in check. 'After all I've done for you, that's what I get? I'm exhausted.' 'Well, gee, Bill,' I stammered. 'If I had known it was going to be like this—' He waved both hands in front of my face, silencing me. Then he gave me the dirtiest, meanest look in the world, stepped into his suite, and slammed the door in my face. Janice detailed the events again of that evening in Lake Tahoe back in 1982 . Janice says she is coming forward now because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do' Dickinson did, however, detail some of her evening in Lake Tahoe with Cosby in the book, though telling a very different story. She said she was drinking with Cosby at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired, at which point he slammed his door in her face. The aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story. She says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do.' As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words. 'How dare you,' she says. 'Go f*ck yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.' Bombshell: At the time of the alleged rape, Dickinson (pictured in the 1980s) was one of the biggest models in the world . This comes as a third women, Joan Tarshis, came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by Cosby in Los Angeles back in 1969. She called him a 'very, very sick man who needs help.' Another of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, told MailOnline she was just 17 when he 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.' Cosby, who refuses to comment on the allegations, did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior. His lawyer John P. Schmitt has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.'","She claims in a new interview that she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby .

"A staggering 57 per cent of men and women in the UK admit to fantasising about someone other than their partner when they're having sex with them. Women are the biggest culprits with 45 per cent admitting to indulging in their fantasy figure during a romp with their other half. More than a third of all couples (35 per cent) say the most common time they do this is just after they've had an argument with their significant other. Women are the biggest culprits with 45 per cent admitting to indulging in their fantasy figure during a romp . Lovers . aged 35-44 are most likely to fantasise about someone else, and the most . common fantasies are about someone they know in real life rather than a sexy . celebrity. Welsh . lovers are most likely to fantasise about someone inappropriate (40 per . cent), while people from the East Midlands are more likely to have sexy . thoughts about a celebrity during sex (35 per cent). Yorkshire . residents like to sexually dream about someone they know -  yet the . Scottish prefer to fantasise about their partner and . no one else. But rather than worry your relationship is doomed when you let your mind wonder during sex, it's actually perfectly healthy. Celebrity sexpert Dr Pam Spurr, a psychologist, self-help expert and . broadcaster, was enlisted to explain the results. 'Fantasising provides an escape route which helps climax,' she says. 'The . fact that women do this more often could be that they feel more shy or . inhibited to ask their partner to try a different technique - at least . with fantasies, they give women what they need to reach a mind blowing . climax without having to ask!' Welsh lovers are most likely to fantasise about someone inappropriate (40 per cent) When asked what their sexual 'guilty pleasure fantasy' was, 40 per cent of Brits admitted it was sex with an ex. Other high-scoring results included role play, bondage, watching porn - and a threesome. For women, their top sexual fantasy was role play - and for men, sex with an ex topped the list. Dr Pam says: 'I'm not surprised the top fantasy for women is about role play. 'Many women secretly want to 'sex-periment' in the bedroom, so fantasy role play is perfect for trying exciting scenarios. 'Although . the common preconception is that male fantasies are always dirty, . adventurous or kinky - the fact the majority fantasise about sex with an . ex shows they like to revisit this well-travelled sexual territory. 'This type of been there, done that sexual imagery can help boost a man's sexual confidence in the here-and-now. 'The . crucial difference revealed between men's and women's fantasy is about . adventurousness. Where the top male fantasy of ex-sex is about keeping . it easy and relaxed, women want to let go and do things they don't . normally dare to.' Ann Summers have conducted a nationwide Great British Pleasure Survey . Ann Summers delved into Britain's pleasure zone and asked 3,000 Brits what turns them on. The . results were eye opening and offer a fascinating insight into the . nation's guilty pleasure, desires and ultimate sexual fantasies. Nearly . half of Britons (45 per cent) admit to doing something 'pleasurable' on . a weekly basis - with lovers in East Anglia being the biggest pleasure . seekers, with 11 per cent claiming they have sex every day, followed . closely by the Welsh (10 per cent) and Yorkshire (8 per cent). Couples from the North East have the least amount of sex; with 5 per cent claiming they only do the deed once a year. For women, their top sexual fantasy was role play - and for men, sex with an ex topped the list . And it seems that Britons are quite the pleasure seekers when it comes to getting frisky in places other than the bedroom. Although 42 per cent claim they keep their lovemaking in the boudoir, 25 per cent regularly get hot and steamy in the shower. A further 15 per cent have got it on in the workplace, 9 per cent in public place, 7 per cent in the gym and 2 per cent admit to having got away with having a sneaky romp in a church. Londoners are most likely to get jiggy at the gym, Scottish find their thrills in a park, Yorkshire lovers are most likely to get it on at work and those in the East Midlands like to have sex in the cinema. The . nationwide survey also delved in Britons' porn habits and discovered . that 40 per cent of couples watch porn together on a weekly basis. Over . half (55 per cent) of women admit to watching porn on their own at . least once a month with a further 40 per cent admitting to switching it . (solo) on a weekly basis. More surprisingly perhaps, 9 per cent of women . say they watch it daily. Of those who confessed to watching porn with their partner, 58 per cent claimed it had a positive effect on their relationship. When asked what their sexual 'guilty pleasure fantasy' was, 40 per cent of Brits admitted it was sex with an ex . Dr Pam says: 'The traditional view that watching porn is a man's prerogative isn't always a fact, as there is a sea of change in sexual attitudes when it comes to porn viewing among the sexes, particularly in women. There are more female-friendly porn options available and women are actively switching on more regularly than ever before.' 'It is completely normal to fantasise about someone else during sex because the human mind is incredibly creative. With fantasies, you can roam into erotic territory involving anyone from a celebrity to a neighbour. 'Many confide that the best fantasies involve having sex with their partner but with someone else – whether that be a celebrity or neighbour - joining them for supercharged three-way sex.It's a reality in life that sometimes sex becomes routine. However, by injecting your fantasy into your sex life, it can boost libido levels and revive the excitement and lust with your partner.'

The pioneering British sex toy brand has observed that more men than ever are now admitting to having tried a sex toy on themselves at some point in their lives. The brand has sold over 10,000 units in the first six months and this shows no signs of slowing. The world's first Guybrator PULSE utilises the latest medical technology . To highlight the evolution, the creative team at Hot Octopuss designed a tongue-in-cheek video taking you through the journey of male pleasure over the years.

She said she came on the scene shortly after the shooting, before police and ambulances had arrived. But she knew right away Dr. Corporan and Mr. Underwood were already in heaven. 'I know they are in heaven together,' she said. Mrs. Corporan said Dr. Corporan got selected to take Mr. Underwood to the community center for a theater tryout since she was busy with another son at lacrosse and her mother was busy with cousins. 'I want to let you know how much Reat loved school...loved signing and acting,' Mrs. Corporan said. Victim: Corporan, pictured left, and Underwood, right, were Christians attending a singing contest at the center . At . one point, she apologized for not knowing about another person killed . as part of the gunman's rampage at the Village Shalom senior living . facility several blocks away. However, she asked the crowd to pray for . that victim, a female, and her family. Her name is not yet been released. Mrs. Corporan also said that despite the tragedy that has struck her family, she will go on living. 'I want you all to know that we are going to have more life and I want you all to have more life,' she said. Mrs. Corporan (in red sweatshirt) said that she came upon the scene before police and paramedics arrived, but already knew her son and father were in heaven together . The . Sunday shooting is believed to be fueled by anti-Semitism. However. Dr. Corporan and Mr. Underwood were Christian, not Jewish. Close: The doctor practiced family medicine in Marlow and Duncan Oklahoma, retiring in 2003. He and his wife of 49 years moved to the Kansas City area to be closer to their grandchildren . Police . arrested 73-year-old Frazier Glenn Cross. He was booked on a charge of . first degree murder, according to the Johnson County, Kansas, Sheriff's . Office. The suspect appears to have a long history of KKK involvement . and anti-Semitism under the name Frazier Glenn Miller. Authorities . said they don't think he knew the victims. They have declined to say if . they think the attack was motivated by anti-Semitism but they are . investigating the possibility it was a hate crime. Led away: The shooter, later identified as Frazier Glenn Cross,  is taken away from the scene after being apprehended in an elementary school in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon . Miller is not from Kansas City and was carrying a handgun when he was . arrested, though he used a shotgun in the rampage. He also reportedly . had possession of an assault weapon. Corporan had taken Reat to the community center to audition for KC Superstars, which was being held at the center's theater. The . doctor practiced family medicine in Marlow and Duncan Oklahoma, . retiring in 2003. He and his wife of 49 years moved to the Kansas City . area to be closer to their grandchildren. The statement described Corporon as a devoted family man who cherished his family more than anything. The . teen was a freshman at Blue Valley High School who enjoyed debating, . theatre, and had a beautiful voice, the family statement reads. He was . also an Eagle Scout. The boy and his grandfather regularly went camping and hunting together. The . identities of the victims were released just hours after Miller was . accosted by police and reportedly screamed out 'Heil Hilter' as he . was led away. He was taken into custody outside Valley Park Elementary . at 2:45 p.m. The Aurora, . Missouri, man in the 1980s was the 'grand dragon' of the Carolina .

"The next time someone offers you a glass of wine, be grateful – it could save you from the agony of arthritis. Women who indulge in moderate drinking halve the risk of certain forms of the illness, researchers have found. Swedish academics found that women who drank at least three medium-sized glasses of wine a week - or the equivalent in beer or spirits - were up to 52 per cent less likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis. Drink up: Women who drink three glasses of wine a week could be halving their risk of arthritis . Around 400,000 Britons are affected by this type of arthritis and the majority are women, aged 40 to 70. It causes pain and swelling in the hands, wrists and feet and can make everyday tasks almost impossible. Currently doctors are unable to prevent or cure the illness and they can only offer treatment to alleviate pain. The illness is caused by the body’s own immune system - which normally fights infection - attacking the cells lining the joints. Scientists believe that alcohol can counter this process because it lowers the body’s immune response. But they have not been able to establish whether drinking more alcohol reduces the risk even further. The illness is caused by the body's own immune system - which normally fights infection - attacking the cells lining the joints . In this latest study, scientist from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm studied 34,100 women aged 39 to 84. They had all filled in surveys on how often they had drunk wine, spirits or beer over the course of a year . Those who drank at least three 150 ml glasses of wine, one pint of beer or two measures of spirits over a week were 52 per cent less at risk from rheumatoid arthritis. Daniela Di Guiseppe, a PhD student who contributed to the research said: ‘The results of this study indicate that moderate consumption of alcohol may reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis among women.’ ‘These results are in accordance with the inverse association between moderate alcohol consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease and add to the evidence that moderate alcohol consumption is not harmful and can be protective against such a chronic disease as rheumatoid arthritis. ‘However, the effect of higher doses of alcohol on the risk of rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown.’ Professor Alan Silman, medical research director of Arthritis Research UK said: ‘Small amounts of alcohol are also known to be beneficial in reducing the risk of other conditions such as heart disease, also an inflammatory disease, so the study is also telling us something about the mechanism of inflammation. ‘However, it’s important to stress that the paper isn’t saying that excessive amounts of alcohol are good for you. ‘And it must be remembered that drinking alcohol in excess can be especially dangerous in rheumatoid arthritis patients who are taking some anti-rheumatoid drugs that may cause liver damage, and anti-inflammatory painkillers which can lead to gastro-intestinal problems, which can be exacerbated by alcohol.’ This latest study will add to the debate over whether alcohol is healthy - and if so, how much we should drink. For years scientists have claimed that drinking small amounts every day may help prevent heart attacks and strokes. But recently Oxford academics cast doubt on this evidence by urging the public not to drink any more than three glasses of wine a week.","Around 400,000 Britons are affected by rheumatoid arthritis and the majority are women, aged 40 to 70 ."
"It is globally recognised as the safe option for any weary traveler who fears the local cuisine may unravel their sensitive stomach. But it transpires that McDonald's restaurants are not all as similar as once thought. The cosmic outlet in Roswell, New Mexico - appropriately designed to look like a spaceship - is world's apart from the one in India that sells local delicacies from a restaurant embossed in Bollywood posters. More conservative eaters will be comforted by the presence of a Big Mac on every menu but there are also chances to experiment with watered-down versions of regional favourites. It would be difficult to bring in 68 million daily customers in 119 countries, across 35,000 outlets and an annual revenue stream of over £18billion without considering cultural differences - and stereotypes. So you can ski up to a warm looking lodge for your McNuggets in Lindvallen, Sweden or enjoy a lakeside view under the mystic hills of Yangshuo in China.

"For Tina Yates, a pensioner from Hertfordshire, a single visit to a nudist party with her husband Mark was all it took to convince her to embrace the lifestyle for herself. 'I had a bad body image. I’d had an operation and I’ve got what I think is a huge  scar and a disfiguring scar, and Mark took me along to a nature swim,' she remembers. 'And, you know, I don’t notice it anymore. It gives you lots of confidence. You know I am who I am, and you can see my life on my face but you can also see the life on my body.' Naked ambition: Tina, third from left, says that becoming a nudist has made her feel happier with her physique . Tina is one of a growing number of British people to embrace a nudist - or naturist - lifestyle and now lives in the UK's second biggest naked community, Spielplatz. Located close to St Albans in the village of Bricket Wood, the 12 acre 'community' was founded in 1929 by Charles Macaskie and his wife Dorothy in a stretch of woodland as a retreat for themselves and their friends. Among them was Ross Nichols, a Cambridge academic and founder of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, a neo-pagan group, and his friend, Gerald Gardner, the father of modern Wicca who established his first coven at the Bricket Wood site. While Wicca plays little part in modern life at Spielplatz, nudity and a communal lifestyle most certainly does. Friendly: Tina and her husband live at Spielplatz, a naturist community located just outside St Albans . 'It's basically a normal life,' explains Tina. 'My neighbours are lots of different ages and some were even born here. 'It's just a small . community and very much a community where everybody gets to know everyone else.' So established is the community, even delivery drivers dropping off Ocado or ASOS deliveries have become a regular part of life at Spielplatz. 'Everybody delivers to us,' adds Tina. 'Our . deliverymen are usually the same ones so there's never a problem. Quite often we ask them to take . their clothes off at the gate!' For Tina herself, her journey to life at Spielplatz when her husband, a naturist himself, came up with a drastic solution to her body image woes. Miserable about a huge scar left on her torso following an operation, her husband Mark decided to cheer her up by taking her along to a naturist event. Amazingly, she agreed to go and says she hasn't looked back since. 'I had had surgery and wasn't confident,' she remembers. Rural: The beautiful Hertfordshire countryside is home to Spielplatz which appears in a new documentary . Lifestyle: Presenter Darren McMullen goes nude at Spielplatz after meeting Tina and her friends . 'I . didn't like undressing in front of him or anyone else so we decided to . do something about it. In the end, it proved very quick and easy way to cure it and no therapy needed.' Now the couple call Spielplatz home and regularly go naked, although as Tina points out, being a naturist doesn't necessarily mean being nude all the time. 'Naturists or nudists generally prefer to be without . clothes if it's warm enough,' she explains. 'If it's cold, we put clothes on, although I'd still call myself a naturist. 'If a cricketer goes on a gay pride march in . London, is he still a cricketer? Of course he is, so it's the same thing for me.' Unlike more extreme members of the community, Tina also says she puts on clothes when doing things like gardening in order to avoid ending up with scratches in delicate areas. 'I put trousers on if I'm gardening,' she laughs. 'If I'm digging a hole, I'll put my wellies on! If I'm doing a barbie, I'll put an apron on!' She also laughs off the idea of people becoming aroused in a naturist environment, saying it rarely happens at Spielplatz. 'It [unscheduled arousal] very rarely happens,' she explains. 'Clothes are . more erotic. If you're naked, it's not particularly arousing. 'The naked body doesn't seem to be as . arousing as one in a bikini or negligee. If someone does get an erection, they're usually very . discreet about it. Most people carry a towel to sit on, so they just wrap that round their waist.' The odd embarrassing moment notwithstanding, Tina says Spielplatz is her little haven and says anyone who thinks naturism is weird should come and give it a try. '[Critics] can think what they like - for us, this is normal,' she reveals. 'They should come and give it a go or just come and visit to see what it's . like. 'It really is a little haven. It's quiet and calm, although we do like the odd party just like anyone . else.' She's also come to accept her body for what it is and says she's happier than ever. '[Naturism] made me realise that I look the same as everyone else  - just a different shape,' she explains. 'I'm here [at Spielplatz] because I'm comfortable, happy and right now, this is where I belong.'

"Ricky Jackson, pictured, is expected to be freed Friday, November 21, 2014, after a witness confessed he lied as a boy when he told jurors he saw the deadly attack . An Ohio man who spent nearly four decades in prison after being convicted of murder will likely be freed Friday after a witness confessed he lied as a boy when he told jurors he saw the deadly attack. Ricky Jackson had been seeking a new trial and sobbed loudly with his face in his hands as prosecutors dismissed his case Tuesday, The Plain Dealer reported. 'I can't believe this is over,' Jackson, 57, said, thanking his supporters and his attorneys from the Ohio Innocence Project, according to the newspaper. Jackson was serving a life sentence for aggravated murder and other charges, according to state prison records. He is expected to be released as soon as the paperwork is finished, the newspaper reported. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said the case fell apart after witness Eddie Vernon recanted, The Plain Dealer reported, saying that Vernon said he had been fed details of the crime by police and kept quiet about his lies because investigators had threatened to imprison his parents. Vernon was 12 when he accused Jackson and two brothers in the May 1975 killing of a money-order collector who authorities said was beaten, shot and attacked with acid as he walked near a grocery store, and no evidence connected the defendants to the crime, but all three were convicted by juries, the newspaper reported. Case: Vernon was 12 when he accused Jackson and two brothers in the May 1975 killing of a money-order collector who authorities said was beaten, shot and attacked with acid as he walked near a grocery store . A lengthy investigative piece from Cleveland Scene in 2011, called 'What the Boy Saw,' looked into Vernon's earlier testimony, the paper noted. Vernon told the judge he was trying to please others when he provided a false story based on information from a friend and police who fed him details, creating lies that helped convict the three men, and he said he gave authorities the names of the three men because he thought he was doing the right thing.The Plain Dealer reported . 'All the information was fed to me,' said Vernon, who presented himself to change his story after speaking with a pastor, the news outlet reported. 'I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime.' He also said he had been nearby on a bus when he heard two pops, but couldn't see what occurred - though others who were on the bus had testified that Vernon wasn't in position to see the slaying. No evidence connected Jackson and his two fellow defendants to the crime, but all three were convicted by juries . Prosecutors had been doubtful of Vernon but acknowledged after the hearing that the case didn't hold up, the newspaper reported, with Judge Richard McMonagle telling McGinty, 'You made the right choice.' Attorneys for the two convicted brothers, Wiley and Ronnie Bridgeman, also sought a new trial based on Vernon's information and are expected to ask prosecutors to drop that case, too. Ronnie Bridgeman spent more than 25 years in prison, and his brother remains incarcerated.","Ricky Jackson will likely be freed Friday after almost four decades in jail .

"Internet shopping giant Amazon is tackling a spiralling security scandal in Germany after it is claimed the company employed security with neo-Nazi links to intimidate its foreign workers. German documentary makers have filmed black-clad guards with military haircuts from the ominous-sounding HESS security, employed to keep Amazon’s over 5,000 foreign employees in check. The film, broadcast on Germany’s ARD television channel, investigate the treatment of workers brought in as temporary staff at the company’s centres in Bad Hersfeld, Konstanz and Augsburg and unveiled a culture of threats and bullying. Backlash: Amazon was criticised for using HESS security, whose staff 'threatened' foreign workers dressed in 'neo-Nazi uniform', a documentary claims . The staff come from across Europe for temporary work at packing and distribution centres and stay in budget hotels and youth hostels where the HESS Security guards patrol. The boot-wearing guards dress in uniforms from designer brand Thor Steinar, a label which carries strong neo-Nazi connotations, The Independent reports. The brand has been banned by both the German parliament and the Bundesliga football association and Amazon themselves stopped selling it in 2009 due to its symbolic far-right message. The ARD documentary show the security guards searching bedrooms and kitchen at the foreign workers’ accommodation, allegedly frisking them for bread rolls when they leave breakfast in the morning. ‘They tell us they are the police here,’ a Spanish woman said. Accused: Amazon allegedly employ the guards to patrol the hostels and budget hotels where their foreign workers stay near Bad Hersfeld, Germany . Another woman, named as Maria, claims she was thrown out of the accommodation she shared with five others for drying her clothes on a wall heater. A black-clad, tattooed guard ordered her to leave and watched her as she packed and ‘shone car headlights at her’. The documentary makers went undercover at one of the budget hotels used by Amazon for their staff and witnessed the brutal ways of HESS Security first hand. When they were discovered with their cameras, the uniformed men demanded they handed over their footage and detained the journalists for nearly an hour when they refused. ARD made further accusations against HESS Security, claiming its name is a reference to prolific Nazi Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler’s right-hand man, alleging that its director is associated with convicted neo-Nazis and football hooligans. The conditions of Amazon’s workers were exposed further in the documentary, revealing that many walk over ten miles a day to get to their workplace. Due to their temporary status, workers can be fired at will and many are paid less than they were promised. ‘They don’t see any way of complaining,’Heiner Reimann, a spokesman for the United Services Union (Ver.di) told ARD. ‘They are all too frightened of being sent home without a job.’ The security firm has not responded to the allegations and Amazon claim they were not contracted by them. ‘The security firm was not contracted by Amazon we are, of course, currently examining the allegations concerning the behaviour of security guards and will take the appropriate measures immediately,’ the company said in a statement. ‘We do not tolerate discrimination or intimidation.’","Amazon employed HESS Security to 'intimidate foreign workers'

"Development: A loving family helps a child's brain to grow and makes them more intelligent, research suggests . A loving family helps a child's brain to grow and increases their intelligence and mental abilities, a study suggests. Researchers found that children in care have less grey and white matter - the two components of the central nervous system - than those brought up in a typical home environment. Children in foster families have normal levels of white matter, which relays messages in the brain, but less of the grey matter which contains nerve cells and controls muscles, memory, emotions and speech. Scientists believe the findings could explain why children who spend time in care are statistically more likely to develop issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mental health problems. People who have been in care also have, on average, lower IQ and language skills than those who grew up in loving homes. The differences in levels of grey and white matter is most likely to be due to varying levels of stimulation required for normal brain development, researchers said. Many children in care have been exposed to deprivation and neglect, which could be linked to their lower levels of grey and white matter. The improvement among those who were moved to foster families, however, indicates that it is possible to recover in terms of white matter, which affects learning ability. The study team, led by researchers from Harvard University and Boston Children's Hospital, examined MRI scans from Romanian orphans aged between eight and 11, some of whom had been transferred to quality foster care homes. Upbringing: Researchers made the findings after examining MRI scans from Romanian orphans aged between eight and 11 . It has published almost 50 research papers since the project began. Reporting their latest findings in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the reesearchers wrote: 'In most forms of institutional rearing, the ratio of caregivers to children is low, care is highly regimented and caregiver investment in children is low. 'One of the most likely explanations for the wide range of developmental problems observed among children exposed to institutional rearing is that the deprived environment of an institution does not provide adequate experience on which to scaffold normal brain development.' One of the study's authors, Dr Charles Nelson, a developmental neuroscientist in Boston, said the findings suggested that there was a sensitive period in the first two years of a child's life, when foster care has the greatest impact on their progress. 'The younger a child is when placed in foster care, the better,' he added.","Children in care have less grey and white matter than those brought up in a typical home environment .

"Thought you’d waved goodbye to spots in your teens? Think again. Adult acne is on the rise, with one recent study revealing that more than a quarter of women in their 40s and 15 per cent of women in their 50s suffer from embarrassing and painful break-outs. Acne is caused when an excess of the skin’s natural oil (sebum) combines with dead skin cells to block the pores. These blocked pores can then become infected by bacteria that feeds on sebum. In just the same way that hormones wreak havoc on our skin during the teenage years so, too, are they the main culprit as we hit middle age. This is because testosterone triggers higher sebum production, and as we get older, we produce less oestrogen to balance our body’s production of testosterone. Cue unsightly blemishes. Scroll down for video . Adult acne is on the rise, with one recent study revealing that more than a quarter of women in their 40s and 15 per cent of women in their 50s suffer from embarrassing and painful break-outs . Indeed, leading dermatologist and acne specialist Dr Stefanie Williams says: ‘Adult acne is at epidemic levels. Increased stress caused by the pace of work and modern life, can all cause or aggravate acne.’ But there are also many other, lesser known, triggers that help unwelcome spots to appear. Here, Leah Hardy unmasks the hidden skin saboteurs. BUGS ON YOGA MATS . PROBLEM: Your workout is great for your body, but could be terrible for your skin, especially on your back, chest and shoulders. This is because of ‘Acne Mechanica’ or ‘friction acne’ as it’s otherwise known, which occurs when tight clothing or straps hold sweat against the skin. The irritation increases sebum production in pores, which leads to whiteheads, blackheads and pimples. ‘Acne Mechanica’ or ‘friction acne’ as it’s otherwise known occurs when tight clothing or straps hold sweat against the skin. Put a clean towel over your gym or yoga mat when you work out . So the helmet you’ve worn while you’re cycling; your sports bra strap or even your tight gym top could all be making your skin break out. Also watch out for your yoga mat. Bacteria from the floor, feet and sweat can accumulate and transfer to your face. In a 2012 study from the New York University School of Medicine, gym surfaces were found to be infected with a bacterium that can cause acne, boils and folliculitis. Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles which causes a nasty acne-like attack of red spots. In a 2012 study from the New York University School of Medicine, gym surfaces were found to be infected with a bacterium that can cause acne, boils and folliculitis . SOLUTION: First, put a clean towel over your gym or yoga mat when you work out. Wipe down equipment before use. Ensure your gym kit is clean and made of breathable ‘wickable’ materials that hold moisture away from your body such as Nike’s Dri-Fit or Adidas Climacool. If you prefer natural fabrics, look for bamboo and cotton mixes which do the same. Make sure nothing’s too tight so sweat doesn’t get trapped and the skin isn’t irritated. Have several sports bras of different styles and use a different one each time so you don’t get rubbing in the same place. Afterwards, always shower to remove sweat and bacteria, and put on clean clothes. If your acne is painful, see your GP. If it is itchy, ask for anti-fungal treatments and use an anti-dandruff shampoo as a body wash in the shower. OILY SHAMPOOS . Acne caused by oily shampoos, conditioners and styling products is so common, it has its own name: ‘pomade acne’ PROBLEM: Acne caused by oily shampoos, conditioners and styling products is so common, it has its own name: ‘pomade acne’. Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Rachael Eckel says: ‘As they are rinsed out in the shower, oily, rich shampoos and conditioners drip over the forehead, shoulders and back, causing acne. ‘They can also cause folliculitis, the itchy, acne-like outbreak of spots, on the upper back.’ Greasy hair-styling products can do the same as they tend to transfer from the hair to the skin, especially around the hairline, blocking pores and irritating skin. This is even more likely if you have a fringe, perhaps cut to cover spots in the first place. SOLUTION: Wash and condition your hair at the beginning of your shower and rinse immediately. Then tie your hair up and wash your face and body to remove any oil left behind. ‘I encourage patients who are breaking out in new areas, like the forehead or temples, to double-check their haircare products for oily and pore-clogging ingredients like coconut oil, and eliminate them,’ says cosmetic surgeon Dr Sam Bunting. Avoid hair oils completely if you are acne-prone. Try a light, oil-free shampoo such as Neutrogena T/Gel shampoo (from £4.99). For the body, try Neutrogena Body Clear Wash (£8.95). ANTI-AGEING CREAMS . PROBLEM: The pressure to stay looking young means skincare creams can be too intensive, too rich or too unsuited to many women’s skin. ‘Women today are much more concerned about anti-ageing,’ says Dr Williams. ‘However, often these creams are far too heavy for their skin type and end up blocking pores and causing acne.’ SOLUTION: If you have oily skin or acne, avoid putting anything with oil on your face, especially almond oil, apricot kernel oil and oleic acid — a fatty acid found in olive and grape seed oil. Beware of heavy, pore-blocking — and, therefore, acne-causing —ingredients such as lanolin and cocoa butter particularly if they’re one of the main ingredients. And beware of the moisturising agent Isopropyl isostearate and Isopropyl myristate, which makes cosmetics feel creamy. Try lotions which tackle both ageing and acne such as Triacneal by Avene (£23) and Effaclar Duo+ by La Roche Posay (£15.50). DRINKING SKIMMED MILK . If you ave swapped full-fat milk for skimmed, you could be damaging your skin . PROBLEM: If you eat a lot of bread and pasta and have swapped full-fat milk for skimmed, you could be damaging your skin. ‘As you hit your 40s and 50s, you can become insulin-resistant, which means your body is less able to metabolise sugar,’ says Dr Williams. ‘Starchy foods such as bread and pasta are broken down in the body so they are indistinguishable from liquid sugar. High blood sugar stimulates insulin which can worsen inflamed acne.’ Milk may also be troublesome. While all types of milk are linked with increased acne, a 2007 study found skimmed is the worst. Women who drank the equivalent of two or more glasses of skimmed milk per day were 22 per cent more likely to develop ordinary acne, and 44 per more likely to develop cystic acne, which causes painful, large and deep spots that don’t come to a head. Why? Nobody is sure, but it is likely to be because milk contains hormones which can cause an imbalance in human hormones. The key culprit may be insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, a natural hormone which seems to increase skin cell growth in the lining of the pores, which then become blocked. It’s thought that processing milk by removing fat may remove the hormone oestrogen which is stored in fat and protects against the male hormones that cause acne. SOLUTION: Stick to a low GI diet — which is rich in high-fibre foods which release sugar slowly into the blood stream, thereby keeping blood glucose levels steady. Also switch to unsweetened almond milk which does not contain hormones. ‘I recommend cutting out sugar and all starchy, grain-based foods, including bread, pasta, and breakfast cereals. Instead, eat unprocessed protein such as fish, meat and eggs, lots of vegetables and fruit in moderation,’ says Dr Williams. The natural process of fermentation in yoghurt breaks down IGF-1, so full-fat yoghurt is less likely to trigger acne. WASHING YOUR FACE TOO MUCH . When prone to break-outs, many women try to desperately scrub away oil and sebum build-up. But this can make matters worse . PROBLEM: When prone to break-outs, many women try to desperately scrub away oil and sebum build-up. But this can make matters worse. Cosmetic doctor Mervyn Patterson says the wrong cleansers will dry the skin, causing acne. This is because healthy skin is protected by the ‘acid mantle’, a fine, slightly acidic film on the surface. Acne-causing bacteria cannot thrive in an acid environment, but if the skin surface is disrupted by excessive cleansing, the skin becomes alkaline, allowing the bacteria to flourish. This is a particular problem for older women because collagen loss makes their skin thinner, more fragile and naturally less acidic. ‘Alkaline soaps and harsh cleansers can easily disturb older skin’s natural barrier,’ explains Dr Patterson. ‘Frequent exfoliation either with abrasive scrubs or harsh acid peels are also damaging and make skin inflamed and sensitive.’ This means that the kind of acne treatments teenagers use to banish their blemishes may simply cause inflammation, redness and soreness in older women. SOLUTION: Avoid soap and foaming cleansers containing sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, ingredients that break down oil, but can also damage the skin barrier. Instead, use a gentle wash off cleanser such as La Roche Posay Physiological Cleansing Gel (£12). Cosmetic dermatologist Dr Rachael Eckel recommends: ‘Wash your face no more than twice daily for about 40 to 60 seconds, which is enough time to ensure it is clean without stripping it. ‘Cleanse at the end of your usual shower as the warmth and moisture will help soften dead skin cells so they exfoliate easily.’","Adult acne is on the rise .

"The mastermind of a £2.5 million fraud has gone on the run, fleeing with his passport just days before he was due to be sentenced. Maxwell Parsons, 48, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud at a trial at Manchester Crown Court, and was convicted in his absence. He was due to appear at the court for his sentencing, but is now being hunted by the police after he failed to show up. Computer expert Maxwell Parsons who is the mastermind of a £2.5m fraud bugging cash machines but has gone on the run after he was allowed to keep his passport and sit outside the dock throughout his trial . Parsons also found a way to reverse transactions, and used it to carry out a sophisticated money generation scam using a bureau de change . Parsons was found to be the brains of a . sophisticated fraud operation based in Greater Manchester, which cost . the banking industry more than £2 million. Parsons' scheme managed to rake in £5,000 a day before he was caught . Despite . being convicted of the conspiracy, he was considered low-risk enough to . sit outside the dock throughout the four-week trial, as well as not . having to surrender his passport. Parsons is a self-taught computer fraudster, who found a way to manipulate banking . systems so payments were automatically reversed - meaning money could be . spent again and again. Most of the transactions were carried out . at bureau de changes in Greater Manchester, so purchased cash could be . converted back into sterling. Previously, Parsons was jailed for bugging cash machines using MP3 players to clone people's debit and credit card details. An HM Courts and Tribunals Service spokeswoman confirmed Parsons had not been asked to hand over his passport as a part of his bail conditions. Parsons goes by a number of aliases, and has already proved his skills in defrauding, so may prove hard for authorities to track down. He faces up to 10 years in jail if he is brought back before a judge. Parsons carried out the scam between December 2008 and June 2009, and at its peak, the scheme raked in £50,000-a-day before being stopped by Greater Manchester Police in 2010. Three of Parsons' collaborators in the fraud, who are all from the Stockport and south Manchester areas, have previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud. Takhliq Khaliq, 47, of Boddens Hill Road, Heaton Mersey, his brother Zaki Khaliq, 44, of Carwood Road, Bramhall, and Muhammed Khan, 43, of Alexandra Road South, Whalley Range, are set to be sentenced along with Parsons.

"This extraordinary artwork gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'my body is a temple'. Body paint artist Trina Merry spent around nine hours painstakingly painting the 17 naked models and forming them into a living, breathing temple. The work was released by Trina to promote her partnership with charity Beyond the Four Walls - an organisation that works with young women in Nepal to help improve their lives. 'Body art is the most traditional art form - it's the most ancient art form known to man and pre-dates even cave paintings,' the 34-year-old said. 'I enjoy the human-to-human intimate connection.' Scroll down for video . The models take their final position ready to be photographed for Trina Merry's human temple work .

Trina began making body art in 2006 and . took it up full time in 2011 - her temple structure was displayed at . WORKS gallery in San Jose, America in March. Despite being posed up for only 20 minutes, some of the models found being a naked human canvass a little intimidating. 'Some people are uncomfortable when they are first nude in front of others,' added Trina. 'I try to be gentle and talk through things with each person and work with their levels of comfort so they feel safe. 'But when you're in a room full of 16 other nude people you get over your fears pretty quickly. 'It becomes more normal to be the nude person than the one with their clothes still on, so peer pressure works in my favor in those instances.'

"Killed: Michael Brown was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson in August, prompting a firestorm of protests in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb. Supporters of the white cop who shot dead a black teenager in Missouri have published a slick video attacking Barack Obama for failing to back the officer’s family. The seven-minute clip says that the President should have got in touch with Darren Wilson’s relatives to give them his support in the wake of the August 9 killing in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis. The video says that Wilson’s life was ‘turned upside down’ and that Mr Obama aligned himself with Michael Brown, the 18-year-old who was killed. The unabashed footage is upbeat in tone and is set to two songs: ‘Don’t Stop Believin’ by rock band Journey and ‘We’re not gunna take it any more’ by Twisted Sister. It makes clear the strength of feeling among some in St Louis that Wilson, 28, is the victim and not just Brown. The footage also uses inflammatory language to attack Brown and calls him a ‘thug criminal’ who carried out a robbery shortly before he was killed. Provocative: The video accuses President Obama of failing to support officer Darren Wilson, labelling the dead teenager  'a thug criminal' In the spotlight: Officer Wilson is awaiting the decision of a grand jury convened in the wake of his shooting to death of Michael Brown. The video claims that protesters were denying him a part in the debate over the killing . It calls his friend Dorian Johnson, who was with Brown the night he died, ‘one lying witness / accomplice (who) forever changed the fate of Ferguson’. The video emerged as the Grand Jury continue to deliberate whether to indict Wilson, who has been in hiding for the past three months. It has so far been watched 5,000 times on YouTube and is called: ‘WE ARE DARREN WILSON - DON'T STOP BELIEVING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT!’ The seven minute clip goes through the story of how Wilson’s supporters felt that his voice had to be heard and so set about organising themselves. In a series of stills with text over the top they say that some used the story of Brown’s death ‘as an excuse to commit crimes’, though many of the protests were peaceful and the organisers discouraged violence. Civil rights campaigners the Rev Al Sharpton, the Rev Jesse Jackson and Attorney General Eric Holder are described as being ‘antagonistic friends’. Along with Missouri Governor Jay Nixon they turned the story into a ‘race war’ in order to ‘rob officer Darren Wilson of justice’, the video claims. It then shows a series of photos which have been sent in of supporters - many in law enforcement - with the caption: ‘I am Darren Wilson’. The video says: ‘Not once did the President send condolences to Darren Wilson for his life being turned upside down while defending himself against a thug criminal’. President Obama did however release a statement to Brown’s family which read: ‘The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time’. Attack: From left Rev Jesse Jackson, Rev Al Sharpton and Eric Holder, the attorney-general, are accused of giving succor to anti-police protesters in the video. All three men went to Ferguson in the wake of the killing . Damage: The video equates protesters with the looters who rioted after the death and suggests the facts support Darren Wilson . Wilson’s supporters have carried out a number of rallies around St Louis and set up the ‘I support officer Wilson’ Facebook page which now has 78,000 likes. The ‘Support Darren Wilson’ community has 81,000 likes. One of the latest comments from user Pete Palella reads: ‘Cant wait for that ""not guilty"" verdict to be announced!’ Wilson’s supporters first made themselves heard in their first rally held a week after Brown was shot dead. During the protest in the Clayton area of St Louis they wore specially printed $7 T-shirts with a police shield on them and the words: ‘I stand by Darren Wilson’. Instead of a badge number it read 8.9.14, which is day he shot dead Brown. Division: While supporters of Darren Wilson have released their new video, opponents want to see a criminal trial for first-degree murder - and a finding of guilt. This demonstrator made her point last night in front of Ferguson's police department in the St Louis suburb . Tension: Ferguson and surrounding areas are on a knife-edge as the grand jury deliberations on whether to indict officer Darren Wilson over the killing of Michael Brown are expected to conclude. Wilson’s supporters say he is the one who is being slandered and some have even claimed that he should get compensation for the way he has been treated. According to Twisted Sister’s singer Dee Snider, ‘We’re not gunna take it’ was intended to be played ‘any time that the team is down by two, or somebody had a bad day at the office’. It was used by 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan until Snider asked him not too - as he was going to vote for President Obama. By LAURA COLLINS FOR MAILONLINE IN FERGUSON, MISSOURI . A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson's whereabouts, MailOnline can reveal. Officer Wilson, 28, has been in hiding on paid leave ever since he gunned down unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18, on 9 August. Now, in one of a series of incendiary tweets the RbG Black Rebels have stated, 'We are paying $5k cash for location of Ofc. Darren Wilson. Real $, no joke, no crime we just wana get his photo an ask him a few questions.' And though the RbG Black Rebels insist this is not a bounty on the officer's head, the chilling offer is set in the context of a stream of violent online posts boasting of 'combat experience', 'stockpiling' ammunition, cleaning out gun stores and being #WarReady. The incendiary tweet from the group: part of a twitter feed which includes references to 'war ready' which is likely to increase tensions in Ferguson ahead of the expected grand jury verdict on the shooting of Michael Brown by police office Darren Wilson . The 'Black Rebels' have used their Twitter feed to claim the police are preparing for 'war' when the grand just verdict is announced . Pointed: The feed includes a reference to ammunition which will 'solve a lot of problems'. The FBI has already warned that extremist violence is 'likely'. Typical of the reponse elicited by the offer is one follower's demand, '@BlackRebels_Stl@OpFerguson Yank that bastard off the street. He is a murderer running free still.' Governor Jay Nixon has already declared a State of Emergency and called in the National Guard in anticipation of the violence that FBI agents have described as 'inevitable' when the Grand Jury charged with deciding the fate of Officer Wilson, 28, delivers their verdict. Having promised that a decision would be reached 'by late November' it now seems likely that the Grand Jury will return that decision this week. A series of Grand Jury leaks, and Missouri law which allows officers to use lethal force if they believe their life to be in danger, have led many to believe that Wilson will not be indicted on murder charges as Brown's family and supporters hope. It is three months since Wilson pumped six bullets into the teenager as he walked down the middle of the road with a friend. In the wake of the shooting which ignited racial tension in the Missouri town rioters took to the streets armed with Molotov cocktails and chanting the slogan 'Hands Up Don't Shoot' - a reference to some witness accounts that the teenager had his hands up in surrender when Wilson fired off his fatal volley of shots. RbG Black Rebel's disturbing offer and tweets show the seething anger and hunger for violence among some agitators. They have no faith in the judicial system and seem intent on ignoring official calls for peaceful protest and calm. As reported by MailOnline that chatter has extended to St Louis own police officers. Writing on the forum St Louis Cop Talk one user writing under the username 'A Concerned Cop' advised residents, 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family.' In what appeared to be a direct strike at Governor Nixon's decision to activate the National Guard rather than entrusting St Louis's own force with policing the streets of Ferguson, the user continued, 'It will be your responsibility to protect them. Our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us. 'I'm serious, get a gun, get more than one, and keep one with you at all times.'","Seven-minute YouTube video by 'friends of Darren Wilson' attacks President for not supporting the officer .

"The United States has plummeted 13 places on a global index of 'personal freedom' since President Barack Obama's second year in office, according to a London-based think tank, landing behind 20 other countries. The Legatum Prosperity Index surveys people worldwide on their perceptions of a wide range of factors including health and education. The U.S. placed first globally in the health category, but Americans' view of how their personal liberties are treated put the nation in 21st place. Four years ago, America ranked ninth in that category, based on polling conducted during 2009 – President Barack Obama's first year in office. Residents of France, Costa Rica and the UK now believe they enjoy greater freedom than what Americans perceive they have themselves. CONFIDENCE KILLER? Edward Snowden's revelation of a massive electronic surveillance program in the U.S. may be one reason Americans are discouraged about their levels of personal freedom . BIG BROTHER OBAMA? Washington, D.C. protesters insisted in January that the U.S. government's surveillance programs have gone too far . Gallup ran the polling for Legatum, asking Americans how satisfied they are with how the United States handles civil liberties, freedom of choice, tolerance of ethnic minorities, and tolerance of immigrants, according to the Washington Examiner. 'This is not a good report for Obama,” Legatum Institute spokeswoman Cristina Odone told the newspaper. The organization found that since 2009 Americans' approval of how the U.S. helps secure their civil liberties and protects their freedom of choice has declined by 22 per cent. The 2014 Legatum Prosperity Index puts the United States below France and other Western European nations in terms of how its citizens believe their government supports individual freedoms. Since the person freedom category encompasses everything from people's opinions about their physical safety to their freedom of speech and information security, it's difficult to attribute the loss of confidence to any single event or trend. But the Obama years have seen growing concerns about the growth of government surveillance by the National Security Agency and other government offices, first exposed by the whistle-blower Edward Snowden. The advent of the Affordable Care Act, too, has eroded certain freedoms, mandating for the first time that Americans buy a product – medical insurance – or face a penalty.

"Reducing the amount of salt in our diets could save nearly 20,000 lives in the UK every year, according to researchers. Doctors say deaths from heart disease would fall dramatically if consumers paid attention to food labels. Yet most Britons have no idea how much salt they consume or what the maximum recommended levels are. Don't add salt: Our diets are already salt-heavy with 80% coming from processed foods . The recommended maximum daily intake for adults is 6g in the UK, although just last month the World Health Organisation revised this down to 5g. Yet according to figures from the British Heart Foundation, men consume around 9.7g a day, while women have 7.7g. Now researchers at three universities, including Harvard Medical School, have revealed the dramatic effect reducing salt could have on death rates by using computer models. They estimated that reducing salt intake to 6g (or 2,300mg of sodium) would save 500,000 to 850,000 lives in the U.S over the next decade. 'No matter how we look at it, the story is the same – there will be huge benefits in reducing sodium,' said study author Dr Pam Coxson, from UCSF. The British consumer group Consensus Action on Salt & Health said reducing the UK's daily intake to 6g could save around 17,500 deaths from heart attacks and strokes a year. If food labels only contain sodium levels, multiply this number by 2.5 to get the salt content . British GP Ian Campbell, medical director of charity Weight Concern, told Mail Online: 'Salt is a big problem in the UK too. It's a silent killer. Over time consuming too much of it increases the risk of high blood blood pressure, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. 'About 80 per cent of our salt intake comes from processed foods, so it can be difficult to avoid. 'Many people are unaware of where salt is hidden, such as bread, soups, ready meals, even breakfast cereals and mayonnaise. 'The Government approach has been to encourage food manufacturers to modify the amount of salt in their products. There has been a reduction but it is taking too long. The Food Standards Agency should consider setting mandatory maximum levels for salt.' Victoria Taylor, Senior Dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, added: 'Eating too much salt may raise your blood pressure and having high blood pressure increases your risk of developing coronary heart disease. 'The Government has worked with the food industry to reduce the amount of salt in our food and make labels clearer. But there is still work to be done by everyone because the majority of Brits are still consuming more salt than they should be.'","Too much salt increases risk of high blood pressure, which can lead to heart attacks and stroke .
Adults should consume no more than 6g a day, but on average UK men have 9.7g and women have 7.7g ."
"Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar? Now share your opinion . In the end the parties on the ocean front at Avenue Beira Mar would go on through the night. Brazil wouldn’t have it any other way. David Luiz made sure of that after his spectacular second half free-kick, straight out of Zico’s handbook, confirmed their place in the last four. The whole place was rocking, with thumping samba music celebrating the country’s place in a World Cup semi-final against Germany. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brazil and Colombia fans before their World Cup showdown . Strike: David Luiz doubles Brazil's advantage over Colombia to give them the edge to make the semi-final . Passion: Luiz scored Brazil's second goal through a fantastic free-kick . Expecting: Brazil fans are looking for their team to add a sixth star to the chest at the World Cup . Passionate: Brazil supporters made sure Colombia knew where they were ahead of the match . Columbia were crushed before kick-off, unable to cope with a wall of noise. The atmosphere in this city was truly remarkable. Their players were woken up yesterday morning by a loudspeaker repeatedly playing Hino Nacional Brasileiro outside their beachfront hotel in Fortaleza. The noise, the colour, the drama and the build-up was incredible. Two miles down the road, in the Marina Park, thousands of street kids wearing Brazil kits were waiting outside the team hotel to wish them on their way. It was there that Luiz Felipe Scolari paid a short visit to the small chapel in the grounds before they left for the game, turning to religion in his 90 minutes of need. Football is the opium of the masses here, an obsession that takes them away from the hum of ordinary life and unites a nation of nearly 200m people for 90 steamy minutes. Speak to them about the achievement of winning the World Cup and they will respond by saying 'e os outtos catorze' ('yes, but what of the other 14?'). They really believe they should win this tournament every time. Eager: Brazil supporters try to get a glimpse of their heroes arriving at the stadium for the Colombia match . Loud and proud: Castelao in Fortaleza was rocking with yellow shirts for Brazil's showdown with Colombia . Golden boy: The crowd responded every time their talisman Neymar got near the ball . Celebrate: The Brazil team together after Thiago Silva gave the host nation the lead against Colombia . 6 - James Rodriguez (Colombia) 4 - Thomas Muller (Germany), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Neymar (Brazil) 3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Robin van Persie (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland) Those in italic are out of the World Cup. On Friday it was almost impossible to contain their fans as they pressed their faces against the fencing for a glimpse of Neymar, David Luiz or Thiago Silva when they walked out of the team hotel. They had arrived the night before, when two Black Hawk helicopters buzzed the team bus with a searchlight and guided it through Fortaleza’s sweeping streets towards their lodgings. It felt like showtime and the stadium, packed to the rafters with yellow shirts and those damned five stars, was absolutely rocking. There was noise like you cannot imagine, a piercing sense of anticipation every time Neymar and the rest of these golden boys are anywhere near the ball. They coped magnificently. The World Cup is not just about the best individual players or the squad with most ability, it’s about coping with the changing situations and demands of tournament football. The early goal helped them. The captain Thiago Silva was under pressure, scrutinised like never before after opting out when it came to the penalty shootout against Chile in the second round. He closed his eyes when he belted out the national anthem and all his dreams came true when he converted Neymar’s corner in the seventh minute. It would be impossible to do justice to the noise inside the stadium and the celebrations that followed down by the corner flag. It was electrifying. In: Silva gives Brazil the lead against Colombia as they got on their way to the World Cup's last four . Strike: Silva was under pressure, scrutinised like never before after opting out of taking a penalty . Thankful: Silva closed his eyes when he belted out the national anthem and was pivotal on the pitch . There was a constant buzz around the stadium, a unique blend of anticipation and fear that you get when your exam results arrive. Just what if Colombia got their act together?  They couldn't cope. James Rodriguez, the star of the tournament with six goals now, was kicked out of it in the first half. He was fouled four times before the break and Juan Cuadrado, Colombia’s other danger-man, three. Brazil’s hatchet men had done a number on him. Fernandinho nailed him early and then it was a carousel of Brazil players waiting to have a crack at the Colombia forward. It was a difficult evening for Rodriguez, particularly after his name was booed by Brazil’s supporters when his name was read out before the game. This was Brazil showing their teeth, crashing into tackles to make sure they made it to the semi-final in Belo Horizonte. Until then, this place is one big party.

According to the news site, when Ms Bhuiyan arrived at the meeting, Mr Mohrer said: 'There you are…I was tracking you.' However, Ms Bhuiyan had never granted permission for Mr Mohrer  to follow her using the tool. Two months earlier, Ms Bhuiyan had asked about  competitor Lyft, and Mr Mohrer had emailed her logs of some of her Uber trips. While Uber would not comment on the allegation, it is understood that the company is now investigating Mr Mohrer. Shocking: Emil Michael (pictured), Uber's senior vice president, reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while in the presence of a BuzzFeed editor at a private dinner in  New York . 'Our data privacy policy applies to all employees: access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes,' a spokesperson for Uber told MailOnline. 'Data security specialists monitor and audit that access on an ongoing basis. Violations of this policy do result in disciplinary action, including the possibility of termination and legal action.' The news follows another incident this week in which a senior executive at Uber made a grovelling apology after suggesting putting a team together to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise his company. Emil Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. Target: He was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France . The scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public. A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Mr Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologise to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed . Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber . Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company. Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber. 'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued. And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Ms Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. Mr Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said. Mr Michael was especially focused on Ms Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.' Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington. Uber consultant: The dinner was hosted by Ian Osborne (pictured), ex-adviser to British PM David Cameron . The event on Friday evening was attended by  actor Ed Norton (left) and publisher Arianna Huffington (right) Response: On Monday, Ms Lacy responded to BuzzFeed's article on her site (pictured), saying: 'Companies shouldn't be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters' It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case. In court on Monday, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general, who represents the Nevada Taxicab Authority and Nevada Transportation Authority. 'I think you're jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling,' he said. The state regulators want to put an end to Uber, which launched its ride-sharing services in Las Vegas, Reno and Carson City on October 24. Hours after the service was launched, the state hastily sought orders to halt the company's business in all three cities. The attorney general later filed a complaint and motions in Washoe County. On Monday, Uber asked the state Supreme Court to put a halt to the  case. The company expects a decision in several days.","Josh Mohrer, the New York manager, allegedly tracked Johana Bhuiyan .

"Post-menopausal women who breastfed had lower BMI on average . Many mothers have long believed that breastfeeding helps them to get their figure back after giving birth. Now scientists have found  it can help them to stay slim  for decades. They discovered that women who breastfed their babies even for a few months after the birth were less likely to be obese 30 years later. New research indicates that breastfeeding may help mothers to avoid obesity later in life (posed by model) The Oxford University researchers worked out that for every six months a woman gives her baby breast milk, she loses around 2lb – depending on her initial weight and height. Although this may not sound much, the academics claim that it could help prevent thousands of deaths from cancer, heart problems and other illnesses related to obesity. Doctors and midwives are growing increasingly concerned that many women are becoming obese by gaining weight during pregnancy, which they never manage to shift after the birth. Oxford University researchers worked . out that for every six months a woman gives her baby breast milk, she . loses around 2lb – depending on her initial weight and height . If they go on to have several children, they will become progressively fatter with every pregnancy. The latest study – involving more than 740,000 women – provides compelling evidence that breastfeeding could help reverse this weight gain, and then help women keep the weight off for good. Breastfeeding uses up large amounts of energy and experts have previously calculated it burns 500 calories a day – the same as a typical gym session. Now academics have worked out that for every six months a woman breastfeeds her baby, her body mass index – the measurement of obesity – falls by 1 per cent. An average woman who is 5ft 6ins tall and weighs 11st 1lb would have a BMI measurement of 25, which is classified as overweight. But if her BMI was to fall by 1 per cent it would be about 24.75 – which is deemed ‘healthy’ – and she would weigh 10st 13lb. The lead author of the paper, Dr Kirsty Bobrow, from Oxford University, said: ‘We already know breastfeeding is best for babies, and this study adds to a growing body of evidence that the benefits extend to the mother as well – even 30 years after she’s given birth. Breastfeeding uses up large amounts of energy and experts have previously calculated it burns 500 calories a day, the same as a typical gym session . ‘Pregnant women should be made aware of these benefits to help them make an informed choice about infant feeding.’ The researchers also point out that breastfeeding may help prevent thousands of deaths related to obesity from cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Professor Dame Valerie Beral, director of the Cancer Epidemiology Unit at Oxford University, who was also involved in the study, said: ‘Our research suggests that just six months of breastfeeding by UK women could reduce their risk of obesity in later life. ‘A 1 per cent reduction in BMI may seem small, but spread across the population of the UK that could mean about 10,000 fewer premature deaths per decade from obesity-related conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.’ The study, published in the International Journal of Obesity, surveyed 740,600 women whose average age was 57. They had all answered questions about how many children they had and the total number of months they had spent breastfeeding. The research also found that women were more likely to be obese if they had several children. This backs up the concerns of health professionals that many gain weight during pregnancy which they don’t lose after the birth of their babies. According to the latest figures from the Department of Health, almost three quarters of new  mothers start their babies off on breast milk. This is far higher than the six in ten who breastfed in the 1990s and the rise follows numerous ‘breast is best’ campaigns. The World Health Organisation recommends that women breastfeed their babies for at least six months but many give up because they find it uncomfortable or are worried that their babies are struggling to get enough milk.[ .",Post-menopausal women who breastfed had lower BMI on average .
"Andrea Casiraghi and Tatiana Santo Domingo have finally introduced their adorable son Sacha to the world, a year and a half after he was born. The couple, who recently announced that they are expecting their second child together, and their 19-month-old son attended Monaco's National Day celebrations at the Palais Princier de Monaco alongside the rest of the royal family, including Prince Albert of Monaco and his pregnant wife Charlene. But all of the excitement of the day seemed to prove too much for the little boy, who spent much of his time on the royal balcony cuddling his father and mother, while gazing down at the crowd with a rather bemused - and slightly grumpy - expression. Scroll down for video . Give us a smile! Young Sacha made his first public appearance earlier today - but didn't seem too happy about the whole experience . Baby's first appearance: Sacha and his parents, Tatiana (L) and Andrea (R),  enjoy the festivities from the comfort of the royal balcony . The youngster and his parents were joined on the balcony by Pierre Casiraghi, Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Andrea's mother, Sacha's grandmother Princess Caroline. Despite spending much of the day with a frown on his face, Sacha was otherwise incredibly well behaved throughout the official event and seemed more than content to be passed around from family member to family member as the festivities continued. Dressed in a fetching pair of green velveteen dungarees, smart white shirt and grey knee-high socks, Sacha received kisses and cuddles from his grandmother and his aunt, Princess Alexandra. It is not the first time that Sacha has attended such a prestigious event; according to reports, the young boy was present when his parents, Andrea, 30, and New York-born designer Tatiana, celebrated their nuptials with a private party earlier this year. Having already tied the knot in August 2013, just five months after Tatiana gave birth to Sacha, the couple hosted a second celebration in Gstaad, Switzerland on February 1, where they exchanged their vows in a candlelit Roman Catholic service. In addition to their son, the ceremony was attended by a number of their close family and friends, including Princess Caroline, Prince Albert and the groom's siblings, Pierre, Charlotte and Alexandra. Strike a pose: The youngster spent the day being doted on by his relatives, including his grandmother Princess Caroline . Not amused: Despite all of the attention that he received both from the crowd and his family members, Sacha spent much of the day frowning . The young boy's first public debut comes as Monaco celebrated its 158th national day, which takes place on the anniversary of Prince Rainier III's and Prince Albert II's coronations in 1949 and 2005. Last night, locals enjoyed a spectacular firework display over the harbor before a mass in the Cathedral this morning. Representatives of the Knights of Malta were among guests at the event, as were ambassadors to the principality and local dignitaries. Following the mass, crowds gathered at the Place St. Nicholas before making their way to the Palais Princier to catch a glimpse of the royal family. Style icon: Sacha was dressed in a fetching pair of green velveteen dungarees, smart white shirt, grey knee-high socks and beige coat . Happy families: (L-R) Princess Caroline of Hanover, Princess Alexandra of Hanover, Sacha Casiraghi, Andrea Casiraghi and Princess Stephanie of Monaco greet the crowd . While he is currently the baby of the family, young Sacha will soon have company in the form of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene's twins. The royal couple announced they were expecting in May but the news that Princess Charlene was carrying twins was unofficially broken on Twitter a week later by a friend of the princess' father. South African TV presenter Derek Watts, a friend of Mike Wittstock, tweeted: 'My old Bulawayo schoolmate Mike Wittstock has phoned to say his daughter is pregnant with twins. Congrats Princess Charlene and Albert!' The official announcement of the twins was only made last month, with the Palace releasing a statement that read: 'The Prince and Princess of Monaco are happy to confirm they are expecting twins at the end of the year.'","One-year-old Sacha and his parents attended Monaco's National Day celebrations alongside the rest of the royal family .

The Duchess, 32, arrived for the reception at the Queen's Gallery at 6.20pm, leaving her son, Prince George, with his father and nanny next door, and was introduced to Place2Be Chief Executive Benita Refson. Writing in the  event programme, she described the awards as recognition for the 'wonderful' work in children's emotional health. She wrote: 'The commitment, dedication and hard work that is going in across the schools involved with Place2Be is truly humbling, and to recognise that feels incredibly important.' She presented the Child Champion Award to 11-year-old Bailey Dunne, from Highfield Community Primary School in Sunderland. Having a ball: The Duchess shares a joke with some of the guests . Guests of honour: Kate meets some of the children celebrated on the awards night . Accepting the prize, Bailey said the schools-based mental health charity helped him gain confidence and friends.

Sara Loveday, from Stewards Academy in Harlow, Essex, won the School-Based Clinician award, while Hermoine Alvey, mother of nominee Georgina, from Cotsford School, was recognised in the Parent or Carers Champion category. Kate and William moved into Kensington Palace a year ago, spending £4.5 million of taxpayers' money on renovations on Apartment 1A, Princess Margaret's former home. Although guests did not get to see their private home, the State Apartments for public events and entertaining are just a stone's throw from the apartment, meaning the Duchess didn't have far to go for her engagement. Deserved: Kate gives the Child Champion Award to 11-year-old Bailey Dunne .

The Duchess, who has been Patron of Place2Be since 2013, was scheduled to meet all 20 awards finalists, including Bailey, who has gone from being a quiet boy to one who shows confidence and determination. His nominator said: 'Bailey has taught his peers that it is okay to be individual and that you don't always need to follow the crowd to be successful and popular.' The Duchess also spent time chatting with Bailey's Head Teacher Simon Marshall, who has been working to integrate Place2Be into schools over 14 years and whose inspirational leadership has enthused other Sunderland schools to invest in mental health. Place2Be Chief Executive Benita Refson said: 'This is a wonderful, exciting opportunity to honour our young people and schools in such a wonderful setting. The Duchess' total and utter belief in what we do and her commitment to children's mental health is incredible.' Refson asked Murano glassblowing company Seguso to create the awards, which featured a small glass egg learning against a large glass egg, representing the provision of support to children and young people by the charity. Each award was hand blown in the Seguso furnace on Murano, before being flown to London for the evening where Giampaolo Seguso attended the awards and met with the Duchess of Cambridge, before she presented them. Making a difference: Kate hears how the charity has helped numerous people . In total, the charity supports 90,000 children in 230 primary and secondary schools in England, Scotland and Wales - some of whom joined the Duchess at Kensington Palace. Elizabeth Day, head teacher of Oldfield Primary School in Ealing, west London, and nominee in the School Leader category, said: 'Our work has been about intervention and engaging with other members of the community so that everybody can spot where support might be needed. 'The Duchess is a mother, of course, and I think she really understands the need to help children.' Georgina Alvey, 11, from Cotsford School in County Durham, was nominated for her work in helping other children benefit from support services. She said: 'I was going through a difficult time and someone suggested Place2Be. 'Their help was really important to me. We've now made a DVD about it and taken it in to other schools. I met Kate tonight - she's so beautiful.' Kate, who is the patron of several charities working to improve the lot of children, has been working with Place2Be since 2013. Other patronages include SportsAid, which saw her step out at a workshop aimed at boosting the chances of young athletes last week.

"Sex is the top topic on voyeuristic site Pencourage.com, where subscribers post anonymous diary entries online . New anti-social network Pencourage, which allows users to publish anonymous diaries online, reveals a salacious peek into the country's private lives. On subscribing, users input their postcode, which is kept private to voyeurs but has allowed the site to conduct extremely revealing research. The research found that Londoners’ journals on the female dominated site are three times more likely to focus on . sex than those living outside the capital. Londoners were also nearly three times more likely to have a career . that’s disruptive to their relationship and were over four times more likely to have an . affair because of a career or with someone within the same company. But despite certain differences, the most popular tag by the site’s 5,000 users whether they lived in or outside of London was ‘sex’. Uploaded journals - which allow users to anonymously post 200 words about their lives each day alongside music, videos or photos - were twice as likely to discuss sex over ‘career’ and close to three times more likely to focus on sex over ‘love’ (where not relating to sex). Sex made up 15% of all entries, half of which showed an emphasis on infidelity. New relationships were the second most popular subject matter and careers was third, appearing in just under 8% of posts. Pencourage founder Peter Clayton explains, 'We conducted experiments using key word search on several batches of users that had known postcodes, so they could be separated into ""in London"" and ""out of London"". 'Whilst the subjects were the same: sex, relationships, career and love, the way each was discussed starkly differed. 'The biggest trend was that out of London, the top subjects were treated as quite separate items. If they talked about relationships it was about a relationship and nothing else. In London, journals of relationships included heavy references to career and sex. 'In London, sex was more often linked to infidelity, usually through work, quite often with someone from work and explained by the pressures of work.' On Pencourage.com subscribers post their most private thoughts online but their identity remains unknown . According to Dr. Michael Sinclair, consultant psychologist and clinical director of London-based City Psychology Group (www.citypsychology.com), 'These results confirm that women focus on sex despite the socially constructed belief that they don't as much as men. 'It is perhaps the anonymity of this site that provides them with a safe place without judgement to do so. 'It is unsurprising that those living high-pressured lives will often link other seemingly unrelated aspects with their career and job challenges. 'Given the amount of hours that people spend at work these days especially in the capital, it’s understandable that sex and romantic relationships are increasingly occurring in occupational contexts and often affecting or being affected by work. 'Furthermore, the fast paced, competitive and instant gratification culture that exists in cities coupled with more people, available options and choice clearly impact the sexual behaviour of people living and working there.'

"Locked up: Britain is spending £35million jailing Polish nationals so the country has time to build new prisons (library image) Britain is spending £35million every year locking up Poles who should be in jail in their own country – because its prisons are full. There are almost 900 Polish convicts in our packed prisons – the largest foreign contingent, according to the Ministry of Justice. But under a deal agreed by the last Labour government, none will have to serve their sentences back home until at least December 2016 to give Poland time to build new jails. The deal is one of a string of similar arrangements between Britain and the rest of the EU for so-called compulsory prisoner transfer agreements. These allow criminals convicted of crimes in the UK, who have at least six months to serve, to be forcibly removed to serve their sentences overseas. Similar deals are in place with Libya, Albania and Rwanda. A total of 1,064 inmates are eligible to be transferred. But by the end of last year, only 16 had been sent to prisons in Belgium, Latvia, Malta and the Netherlands. At the end of 2012, none had been sent home at all. Ministers insist the situation will improve as the agreements bed in. With prison places costing around £40,000 a year, the Government is desperate to save money by making greater use of the transfer deals. It would also create more room in Britain’s own packed prisons, which have only 2,000 spare places. Last night Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘With so much crime committed by British people who we can’t simply deport, sending foreign criminals home should be an  easy decision. Instead, one in eight prisoners are foreign nationals. ‘These figures show an improvement upon Labour’s poor record, but far more needs to be done. Making foreign criminals face justice in their own countries would free up about 11,000 prison places for serious repeat offenders who are getting off with community service or a suspended sentence.’ The number of Polish inmates has rocketed since the country joined the EU in 2004. In the last 12 months, Poland has overtaken Ireland as the nation with the most citizens in British jails. Of the 876 Poles behind bars, 320 are eligible for the prisoner transfer deal. They will begin being sent to serve their time in Poland in December 2016 when it should have more cells. Expenditure: A prison place costs £40,000 - an expense the government want to cut (library image) Britain has no prisoner transfer arrangement with Ireland, which has a permanent opt-out. Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘The 1,064 figure of foreign national prisoners potentially eligible for compulsory transfer to their home countries includes around 700 who can’t yet be returned because we’re waiting for implementation of the agreement from their home countries or because we’re waiting for them to improve prison capacity. ‘Of the remaining 300, we are processing over 100 and the remaining 200 will be dealt with this year. Prior to 2013, not one prisoner had left the country under a compulsory transfer agreement. We expect more than a hundred to go in 2014.’ David Cameron has personally pledged to increase the number of foreign criminals sent home. Last year, the Prime Minister said: ‘When people are sent to prison we should do everything to make sure that if they’re foreign, they are sent back to their country to serve their sentence. ‘It is not good enough, the situation we have in Britain today.’ No one from the Polish Embassy was available for comment last night.

Poles Mariusz Krezolek and Magdelena Luczak are serving life behind bars for the savage murder of her four-year-old son Daniel Pelka in Coventry. The couple, who moved to Britain from Poland, tortured and killed Daniel in a campaign of cruelty that culminated in his death from a head injury in March 2012. He died completely emaciated, locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress. In horrific court testimony, it was revealed that Luczak, 28, and her 34-year-old partner Krezolek starved Daniel, force-fed him salt and held the child under water. Sadistic Krezolek had already been jailed in this country three times and arrested at least six times for offences including assault and burglary. But despite his serial offending, he was never put on a plane back to Poland – leaving him free to kill Daniel. In August last year, the couple were both sentenced to a minimum of 30 years, and are eligible for the compulsory prisoner transfer agreement. Luczak’s term is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in Britain, the same as child-killer Beverley Allitt and exceeded by only Rose West and Myra Hindley. The cost of keeping Krezolek and Luczak locked up in a British jail is around £80,000 a year. If both serve their entire sentence here, the bill to the taxpayer will be a minimum of £2.4million. Yesterday, it emerged they had been refused leave to appeal. Lawyers say they plan to continue their legal fight.","Polish are the largest foreign contingent in our prisons, the MOJ said .

"Uniformed Secret Service agents arrested an Iowa man outside the White House on Wednesday after he behaved erratically, and later found a hunting rifle and at least 30 rounds of ammunition in the trunk of a car he had parked nearby. The man had driven all the way from Iowa and approached a Secret Service guard shack when he arrived. Scroll down for video . Uniformed Secret Service agents have increased their presence outside the White House since a knife-carrying fence jumper breached both the perimeter and the building on September 19 . 'DEVASTATING': Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that procedures are now in place to ensure that a recent spate of presidential security lapses are not repeated . Renae Kapheim told officers that 'someone had told him that he should come to the White House,' a law enforcement official told The New York Times. 'The officers interviewed him there and realized that there needed to be further investigating because something wasn't right.' The arrest comes on the heels of a congressional hearing Wednesday morning in which Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy apologized for 'devastating' lapses in security that may have put President Barack Obama and his family in physical danger. In one September 19 incident, a man armed with a pocketknife scaled the White House's outer perimeter fence and sprinted into the mansion through an unlocked door – and was eventually tackled by an off-duty agent. And the Secret Service acknowledged this year that a shooter fired at the White House in 2011, and admitted that it wasn't aware of it until staffers in the building found broken glass and damage from a bullet. Since then, the service has increased the number of uniformed agents who patrol the grounds and the pedestrian mall outside. No shots were fired, and Kapheim surrendered his gun to law enforcement . A 30-30 rifle like this one, recovered from a 1998 school shooting  which was recovered after a school shooting in Wisconsin, was found in Kapheim's trunk . Kapheim is a 41-year-old resident of Davenport, Iowa. Police impounded his 2013 Volkswagen and charged him with possession of an illegal firearm, a crime that can bring a 2-10 year prison sentence. News reports described the weapon as a 30-30 hunting rifle. Washington, D.C. residents and visitors must register guns with local police before bringing them into the city, despite the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment which forbids the infringement of gun ownership. Omar Gonzalez, 42, made it all the way to the East Room of the first floor of the White House on Sept. 19 after he got past five rings of security and sprinted across the 70-yard front lawn – only being apprehended because an off-duty Secret Service agent was present .","Renae Kapheim parked a few blocks from the White House with a rifle and ammunition in his trunk .

"Jason Collins, the first openly gay man to play in the NBA, announced  his retirement from the league on Wednesday. The 35-year-old Collins made the announcement in a first-person story for Sports Illustrated magazine. It's the same forum he used in April, 2013, to publicly reveal his sexuality and become the first openly gay man in any of the four major North American professional leagues. Scroll down for video . Jason Collins become the first openly gay man in any of the four major North American professional leagues . Collins made both announcements in first-person articles for Sports Illustrated magazine . He joined the Brooklyn Nets in February and played 22 games for the team, but was not on the roster this season. 'It feels wonderful to have been part of these milestones for sports and for gay rights, and to have been embraced by the public, the coaches, the players, the league and history,' Collins wrote. Collins started his career with the New Jersey Nets in 2001 and rejoined the franchise in Brooklyn. Nets spokesman Aaron Harris said Collins was expected to make an official announcement at the Barclays Center  before the Nets game with the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks coach Jason Kidd was Brooklyn's coach last year, and Collins singled him out for the 'courage' he showed in bringing him on board. 'It had been argued that no team would want to take on a player who was likely to attract a media circus from the outset and whose sexuality would be a distraction,' he wrote. 'I'm happy to have helped put those canards to rest.' Collins wore No 98 during his final seasons in the league - 1998 was year that Matthew Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming - was killed. Collins said his most poignant moment came during his third game back last season, when he met Shepard's family in Denver. Following Collins revelation, Missouri defensive end Michael Sam came out in February and was drafted by the St Louis Rams in the NFL. He was later cut by the Rams and was released from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad last month. In April, University of Massachusetts guard Derrick Gordon became the first openly gay player in Division I men's basketball. But Collins stressed that there are still no openly gay players in the NFL, NHL or major league baseball. He said: 'When we get to the point where he's not compelled to hide his true self and is able to live an authentic life,' being a gay athlete won't be a big deal. 'But we're not there yet.'

"A Houston woman who goes by the name Teddy Bear Paradise was sentenced on Tuesday to 21 months in prison for threatening to assassinate President Barack Obama, prosecutors said. The woman, formerly known as Denise O’Neal, had told a federal court she sent a letter in November 2013 threatening to murder the president and told two Secret Service agents about a month later of her intention to assassinate Obama. She pleaded guilty in August and had faced up to five years in prison. A lawyer for the woman was not immediately available for comment. Teddy Bear Paradise, a 56-year-old woman formerly known as Denise O’Neal, pleaded guilty to sending a letter in November 2013 threatening to murder the president. Today she received 21 months in prison for the bad act . The White House is seen at dusk here today. As O'Neal was was being sentenced today for making threats against the president, the interim Secret Service Director was on Capitol Hill apologizing for a series of other threats on the presidents life that were mishandled by the security agency . It was the second time she had been charged with threatening to assassinate a sitting president. According to court documents, O’Neal, 56, pleaded guilty to sending letters in 2008 threatening to kill then-President George W. Bush. She previously pleaded guilty to sending threatening letters in 2005 in California, documents showed. Prosecutors in the recent case said O'Neal's letter to Obama included a threat to come to Washington, D.C. and kill him. She later told Secret Service that she would hire someone to murder the president if she was unable to do it herself. According to KETK, Paradise will now be transferred to a yet to be determined U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility. The news of O'Neal's sentencing came today as acting Secret Service Director James Clancy testified on Capitol Hill about the agency's recent failures to properly protect the president from threats to his life. Clancy, who took the temporary job at the behest of the president after former Secret Service head Julia Pierson resigned amid political pressure, apologized for the 'unacceptable' security lapses saying the agency had 'fallen short.' Under Pierson's direction, the White House underwent a shooting that the Secret Service was unaware of and a series of fence-jumping breaches, the most high-profile of which involved a knife-wielding military veteran who made it inside of the president's home. The president was also allowed to ride in an elevator with an armed security guard who had not been vetted by the government's security agency. The interim Secret Service head said today he is 'conducting a comprehensive, bottom-to-top assessment to determine the root cause' of the 'mishaps' so that he can make sure the president's life is never put in danger like that again.","The woman, formerly known as Denise O’Neal, told a federal court she sent a letter in November 2013 threatening to murder the president .

"Thanks to MRI scanners, doctors can see how our bodies work in unprecedented ways. But while they’re predominantly used to diagnose brain disorders, or discover what’s causing a persistent cough, for example, experts are also using them to learn more about more intimate movements. Now a video has compiled the most insightful and interesting ways doctors have used these scanners to reveal what happens inside our mouths when we kiss, as well as the inner workings of  of sex. Scroll down for video . The kissing video, entitled ‘The anatomy of kissing and love in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner’ (grab pictured) was uploaded by YouTube user Randomhero - but the original source is not listed. The clip reveals the movement of the tongues as they enter the other person’s mouth, as well as their heart rates . The kissing video, entitled ‘The anatomy of kissing and love in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner’ was uploaded by YouTube user Randomhero - but the original source is not listed. The clip reveals what the video’s describes as the first time a French kiss has been captured in an MRI scanner. It was recorded using a tesla field strength of three - a scale that determines how strong the magnets in the scanner are, ranging from 0.2 to seven. The clip reveals the movement of the tongues as they enter the other person’s mouth, as well as the heart rates of both members increasing throughout. In a separate clip, the Vox video also reveals what sex looks like through an MRI scanner, using a couple filmed in the missionary position. Video courtesy of Improbable Research . This video was actually recorded during the 1960s by Dutch doctor Pek Van Andel in a hospital in Groningen. Both the kissing and the sex video were created using hundreds of still MRI images stitched together to form a time-lapse. Dr Van Andel, alongside gynaecology Professor Willibrord Weijmar Schultz, anthropologist Ida Sabelis and radiologist, Eduard Mooyaart, used the images  as the basis of a scientific paper in 1999 called Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Male and Female Genitals During Coitus and Female Sexual Arousal. The purpose of the study was to discover whether imaging of the male and female genitals during coitus was feasible. They also wanted to find out whether ‘former and current ideas about the anatomy during sexual intercourse and during female sexual arousal were based on assumptions or on facts’. In particular, they wanted to address claims made by Robert Latou Dickinson in 1933 that the penis formed an S shape when inside a female during sex. They also studied the claims that the volume of the uterus increases during sexual arousal, as proposed by William Master and Virginia Johnson in 1964. During a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, (scanner pictured) subjects lie in a strong magnetic field with radio-frequency waves directed at their body. Signals received by protons moving around the person's body can be combined to create a detailed image of inner organs . During a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, subjects lie in a strong magnetic field with radio-frequency waves directed at their body. The field strength of MRI scanners is measured in tesla. Typically, scanners operate at 1.5, but systems range from 0.2 to seven. The body is made up of water molecules, which consist of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. At the centre of each hydrogen atom are protons that act like tiny magnets, and are sensitive to magnetic fields. When a person lies under the scanners magnets, the protons in their body line up in the same direction. Short bursts of radio waves are sent to certain areas of the body, knocking the protons out of alignment. When the radio waves are turned off, the protons realign and, in doing so, send out radio signals, which are picked up by receivers. These signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body. They also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body, because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals. These signals are combined to create a detailed image of inner organs. Source: NHS Choices . As a result of their research, the team concluded: ‘What started as artistic and scientific curiosity has now been realised. ‘We have shown that magnetic resonance images of the female sexual response and the male and female genitals during coitus are feasible and beautiful; that the penis during intercourse in the ‘missionary position’ has the shape of a boomerang and not of an S as drawn by Dickinson; and that, in contrast to the findings of Masters and Johnson, there was no evidence of an increase in the volume of the uterus during sexual arousal.’ A year later, the team won an Ig Nobel Prize. Other everyday human functions revealed in the Vox video include swallowing, talking in different languages, playing the trumpet, and defecating.","The MRI scanner footage was compiled by news site Vox .

"Bizarre CCTV footage has emerged of a horseman riding into a train station in Berkshire and racially abusing a staff member. Detectives today launched a manhunt to find the man who brazenly rode into Windsor and Eton Riverside Station with a riding crop - and threatened to whip an employee. During the incident on January 4, bemused staff confronted the culprit as he trotted into the booking hall at the station in Berkshire - a short distance from Windsor Palace. Horseman: The British Transport Police released this CCTV image of a man who rode into a train station on a horse and racially abused a staff member . The incident turned nasty when the rider racially abused one of the staff members on duty and threatened to whip them. Police rushed to the station after the shocked station employee raised the alarm but the rider had already fled by the time they arrived. Detective Constable Rod Harbron who is leading the investigation said the man - who wore a black jacket and blue jeans - arrived at around 3pm and made his way towards the platforms. He added: 'When challenged by a member of station staff, he racially abused them and threatened to assault them with a riding crop.' 'A busy railway station is no place for horses and rail operators have every right to refuse access to people with animals under the railway bylaws. 'The member of staff was just doing their job and racial abuse and threats will not be tolerated. Who is the man on the pony? If you recognise him, please get in touch.' Scene of the crime: A manhunt is now underway for the man who rode into Windsor and Eton Riverside Station (pictured) and threatened to whip an employee with his riding crop . A spokesman for the South West Trains - Network Rail Alliance - said the abusive and threatening behaviour towards its staff will not be tolerated. 'We will not tolerate this type of behaviour against our staff and will work with British Transport Police to identify those responsible,' he added.","The horseman rode into Windsor and Eton Riverside Station on January 4 .

Her remains were spotted by a dog walker in woods on farmland near Anmer, about a mile from the main gate to Sandringham House. Following forensic tests, police identified the victim, who went missing from her home in August. Alisa's family said they were 'devastated' at the news. Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry, senior investigating officer in the case, said: 'Family Liaison Officers have been sent to meet with close family this morning to provide the update. 'I shall now be liaising with officers from Cambridgeshire who have been working on trying to locate Alisa in recent months as a missing person. 'The information they provide will give me and the team an extra focus to the inquiry. 'I should also add we are still trying to establish any activity which took place on or around the site during the timeframe of the end of August to the end of September 2011. 'We would like to identify people who may have worked in that area or were involved in organising or running any specific events that may have taken place'.

"The FBI has now joined the search for missing Aisha Khan, the 19-year-old Kansas college student who disappeared shortly after leaving a frantic phone message saying an intoxicated stranger had assaulted her. Local police have put in over 400 man hours since she disappeared midday Friday, and her family spoke out publicly about their despair at a police press conference yesterday. Aisha got married in July and her . husband Waseem was also at the press conference, making his first public . appearance since his teen bride disappeared. He maintained that they . had a happy marriage and the police chief said there is 'no reason to believe that he is a suspect'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Frantic: In her voicemail, Aisha said she had never been so scared in her life after a stranger assaulter her shortly before she disappeared from a University of Kansas campus . Missing: Aisha Khan called her sister saying she had been assaulted by a man but was able to run away, but she was gone when her sister went to look . ‘She was my wife, so I know her better, more than somebody else,’ Waseem said. ‘She’s happy with me.’ Aisha's mother Fozia also appeared, begging for her teenage daughter's safe return. ‘Whoever has my daughter, would please just bring her safe back home,’ said Aisha’s mother Fozia Khan. 'We'll forgive him we just want her safe back home,' she continued, assuming that she was kidnapped by a man though no suspect has been officially identified. Husband: Waseem Khan said that he and Aisha had a happy marriage, and they postponed their honeymoon until after her exams . Aisha, who is studying for her finals at the University of Kansas, disappeared late Friday morning after she was allegedly assaulted on a secluded picnic table at the Edwards Campus in Overland Park . After running away from the man, she called her older sister Faiza and left a harrowing voicemail. When her sister went to get her shortly after, all she found were her books and cell phone on Aisha’s favourite bench. 'My heart is like pounding.  I've never got this scared in my life.  Pick up your phones. I am freaking freaked out right now!' 'Oh my gosh it was so scary,' Aisha said in the message to Faiza. Faiza listened to the message just minutes after it was left, and she tried calling Aisha back but she did not pick up her phone. In the message, Aisha made it clear that she had slapped the man and run away. Reports differ as to whether she thought he smelt like alcohol or marijuana, but she was clear that he seemed intoxicated. That did not provide much hope for Faiza after she drove to the spot where Aisha was studying at the Kansas University Edwards campus to find her sister's books and phone sitting on the table unattended. Police have few new clues, but said that three construction workers saw a woman matching Aisha’s description walking off the campus by herself, but they could not confirm that it was her. Desperate parents: Amanat and Fozia Khan were at the police press conference and were visibly upset as they asked for prayers from supporters . ‘There's so much we don't know about the case,’ said Overland Park police chief John Douglass. Frantic: In her voicemail, Aisha said she had never been so scared in her life . ‘What we’re going to do is we’re going to act on this as if it were an abduction. We’re putting resources into it to deal with it accordingly. If it turns out otherwise, then so be it,’ Mr Douglass continued. Four FBI agents have joined the 10 police detectives, 50 police officers, and University of Kansas  security guards are all looking for the teen. The Kansas University campus does not have surveillance cameras, so that has not been helpful for police, but they have been canvassing the surrounding areas extensively. Police on horseback have looked in nearby wooded areas, volunteers are passing out thousands of flyers, and investigators are looking over security footage of a gas station right next to the campus. Aisha and Waseem live in the nearby . neighborhood Olathe, and police have targeted Overland Park Municipal . Golf Course, Quivira Park, and Stohl Memorial Park in their search. 'We . have looked at videotapes of all the intersections. To date, we have . seen absolutely nothing in that area,' Mr Douglass said. A . devout Muslim, Aisha’s disappearance has sparked an outpouring of . support from Aisha’s family, friends, and the local Muslim community. Her father Amanat also appeared and briefly spoke to press but was overwhelmed by emotion. ‘Please keep praying for us, we need help,’ he said fighting off tears. Her devastated family is offering a $10,000 reward for clues of her whereabouts. ‘She's 19 years old, but not much more than a child. One of our own is missing and we need to find her,’ Mr Douglass said.

"A university has banned its cricket team from playing after a squad member wore a shirt with his nickname, 'Casual Rape', printed on the back. The cricketers at Aberystwyth University caused outrage by wearing pink polo tops with 'tasteless' names during a night out. As a result, the club has been stripped of its funding and has been banned from representing the university in future tournaments. Offensive: The unidentified player wore the shirt with his 'nickname' printed above the squad number while at a pub with teammates . The players had a range of names on their . clothing but one, 'Casual Rape', was . deemed to be unacceptable by the university's disciplinary panel. Union activities officer Liv Prewett, said: 'Sexual harassment is not tolerated by Aberystwyth student union. Disgusted: Union activities officer Liv Prewett said the club's behaviour had brought the Student Union into disrepute . 'All affiliated sports clubs and societies should understand the severity of this case and any further incidents of the kind will be dealt with in the same manner. 'I am deeply disappointed and have openly expressed my disgust.' The disciplinary panel heard the cricketers thought the 'Casual Rape' shirt would be taken as a joke. The hearing was told how one cricketer said: 'People joked about it so we thought they may be seeing the funny side of it.' But the Student Union ruled the shirt was 'distasteful and completely unacceptable'. They found the cricket team had breached their code of conduct and brought the club and the student union into disrepute. They banned the team from competing in the British Universities and Colleges Sport’s indoor cricket tournament. And they withdrew grant funding which pays for the club’s equipment and travel expenses to play matches against other universities. A spokesman for the university cricket club said: 'We understand the severity of the situation and steps are being undertaken to ensure no further offence is caused. 'Nothing of this nature will happen again - any reference to rape in that manner is completely unacceptable and is not, nor will it be, condoned in the future.' The polo shirt, printed by a local company in Aberystwyth, was handed over to union leaders to ensure it will not be worn again. The incident comes a week after students at Oxford University were disciplined for telling members of their college rugby teams they could pick a 'fresher of their choice' and spike their drink during a night out.

"A three-month-old baby boy was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother, an inquest heard. Mother-of-four Angela Williams brought the infant into her bed because she 'wanted to be with him', after separating from his father. She found three-month-old Bobby Blakemore unresponsive the next morning and despite attempts at resuscitation he was declared dead at the scene. Three-month-old Bobby Blakemore was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother, an inquest in Bolton heard . The Bolton hearing was told Bobby was born prematurely at 34 weeks and had weighed 5lbs 3 oz, but had been feeding well and there had been no medical concerns. Miss Williams of Clifton, near Swinton, Greater Manchester, told the hearing her son had a routine in which he would wake up in the morning at around 7am. The company team leader said: 'I would wake up about 12 and then 3am, he always struggled to get back to sleep after the 3 o'clock feed.' On October 19 last year Bobby's father Liam Blakemore, an insurance worker, took him out before returning before 1pm. The youngster slept until 2.45pm before waking for a feed and was a 'bit sick.' After that he was said to be fine. Bobby had another feed at 6.30pm before being placed in his pram where he fell asleep. That evening Miss Williams was joined at her home by a work colleague and she had a glass of wine before going to bed - leaving her friend to sleep on her sofa. The inquest was told that Bobby did have a Moses basket but Miss Williams said: 'He didn't like sleeping in it, he had a crib in our room. 'That night I put him in our bed instead of putting him in the crib. I wanted to be with him. I was playing songs he liked listening to.' Little Bobby ,pictured with his father Liam Blakemore, had been perfectly healthy before he died . She said she lay on her back and put herself between Bobby and the adjacent bedroom wall and covered them both with the duvet. She woke at around 6am to find Bobby unresponsive . Despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation attempts and instructions from a 999 operator, Bobby was pronounced dead at the scene. When asked by the coroner Alan Walsh if she had been aware of any overlying Miss Williams replied 'no.' She said that when she woke Bobby was in the same position in which she had left him. The NHS advise that the safest place for a baby to sleep in its first six months is in a cot in its parents room. They advise against sharing a bed if either parent is a smoker, has recently drunk alcohol, taken medication or drugs that make them sleep more heavily or are tired. They say the risks of sharing a bed with an infant are also increased if they were born premature or were of a low birth weight. The NHS say there is also a risk parents could role over in their sleep and suffocate their baby. Or the child could get caught between the wall and the bed, or roll out of an adult bed and be injured. She also said that he hadn't cried in the night. The pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination was unable to ascertain a cause of death for the child. Recording a narrative cause of death Mr Walsh said: 'It's accepted in some case that prematurity is a factor in sudden unexpected death. 'Although born prematurely Bobby did grow and thrive and that's largely due to the good care he was given by his parents. 'He was obviously well fed and cared for and well looked after by parents that cared and helped him to overcome the immediate dangers of prematurity. 'He was placed in bed with Angela because she wanted to be close to him that day. 'He usually slept in a crib, sadly he didn't disturb his mother that night and she found him in the morning unresponsive. 'It's important that some of the factors that arise in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are given as a warning, there is nothing to suggest that is the cause of death. 'Prematurity is one of the factors, co-sleeping is another factor as well as overheating and smoking. I'm satisfied there was no smoking in the house. It is not right to reach any conclusion that these factors caused the SIDS. I make no comment other than that they exist and people should be aware of this.'","Bobby Blakemore found dead after sharing double bed with his mother .

"A publican has slammed police after he was questioned on suspicion of committing a public order offence over a comment he wrote on his pub blackboard about the 1958 Munich air disaster. Former magistrate Kevin Banks, 55, wrote 'Munich' in capitals before using the word as an acronym to spell out the message: 'Manchester United Never Intended Coming Home.' The controversial comment was one of Mr . Banks' regular 'thought for the week' comments he writes on the . blackboard in the tap room to get punters talking. Outraged: Publican Kevin Banks, pictured with denim Jacket that he wore for matches filled with Manchester United Badges, accused police of overreacting to a complaint from a customer . But . police were called in by customer who noticed the message alongside . routine announcements written by Mr Banks including use of electronic . cigarettes at his pub and prices of lager. Today, Mr Banks accused officers of cracking down on free speech over the way they handled a complaint. An officer went to speak to the father-of-six and gave him 'words of advice' before the landlord agreed to let him rub out the message. No further action will be taken against him. Manchester United fan Mr Banks, who is the landlord of the Sweet Green Tavern in Bolton, Greater Manchester, defended his post about the 1958 crash in which 23 people lost their lives. He claimed he was simply repeating a statement made by former United player Wyn Davies about the tragedy. Tragedy: The Munich air disaster killed 23 of the 44 passengers onboard the British European Airways plane which was bringing home members of the Manchester United football team from a European Cup match . Mr Banks said: 'I can't believe police haven't got better things to do than speak to me about a message which I wrote to get people talking. It's another example of a crack down on free speech. 'If someone is offended by it then I'm afraid that's tough on them. People die everywhere and I don't see why this is distasteful. 'I put it up on the blackboard, there is nothing disrespectful about it. People are edging round death all the time, this is the real world, get on with it. 'I am a Manchester United supporter and went to 500 consecutive matches. I don't find it disrespectful - whoever does needs to get a reality check. 'To me it is something thought-provoking to make people stop and think. Last week, I had a message up about planet earth celebrating its 13.82 billion birthday.' Complaint: A customer at Kevin Banks's pub, The Sweet Green Tavern, Bolton, complained to police about his 'thought for the day' message about the 1958 crash in which 23 people lost their lives . The incident occurred after Mr Banks who has been landlord at the pub for ten years raised eyebrows by writing the message and in yellow and white chalk. He said: 'I was not saying anything derogatory about Manchester United or the air disaster. It was purely an acronym and if I thought it was offensive I never would have written it. 'Munich was an awful accident and my heart goes out to the people who died and their families and the people who were in the crash. It raised eyebrows at first and whilst the reaction rocketed no one could explained why it is offensive - maybe they are seeing something I'm not. 'I know Wyn Davies quite well and we talked about the air disaster. He said of all the airports it could have happened it was Munich, he said you don't suppose it means Manchester United Never Intended Coming Home. 'I'd never thought or heard of that before and I thought that was very clever. I wrote on the blackboard, 'just had a conversation with Win Davies and he points out that the air disaster happened at Munich and he thinks it stands for this. Underneath I put that he was a clever man. Backlash: Mr Banks, pictured outside his pub, insists he meant no offence when he wrote the acronym about the Munich air disaster on a blackboard . 'I thought to myself is this offensive but I couldn't see that it was. What is offensive is opposing fans chanting 'Munich Munich Munich' at Manchester United fans. 'I was off work on the Friday and the barmaid said there was a woman in who she'd never seen before who said it was extremely offensive and it should be taken down. I explained how I'd got the remark. 'The next thing I knew was the police were at the pub and they wanted to arrest me. The policeman said he was here to see me about the offensive remarks and I asked him why it was offensive. 'I told him he was telling me it was offensive but why. I said if he could tell me why then I would take it down. He said it was a public order offence. I said that I used to be a Manchester United fan and a former player had told me it. 'I intially said I was not giving him permission to wipe it off the board but he wiped it off anyway because he said he didn't want to arrest me. I just couldn't believe the over reaction.' 'In future under my messages I'll write: 'however if you find offence with the above statements feel free to use your democratic sights to go and drink elsewhere'. One customer, said: 'There are normally little quips on the blackboard, but this upset me. 'A lot of people died in that crash and it was horrific. I find it offensive. If someone chanted this at a football match they would probably be prosecuted and I think it was right police spoke to the landlord. 'What he wrote was disrespectful to the people who died.' Dale O'Donnell, from the Manchester United online fanzine Stretty News, said: 'If I saw that message on a pub wall, I would walk out. It's a disgusting thing to write. 'I can understand the landlord's general point that people are too sensitive towards death, but this is not the way to go about proving a point.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We had a call about a blackboard message about the Munich Air Disaster that was deemed to be offensive. 'We sent an officer and the landlord offered to resolve the complaint by removing the message. He denied that the message was offensive but was happy to remove it.'","Kevin Banks was accused of a public order offence over his message .

"Coffee and sandwich chain Pret A Manger has withdrawn its 'Virgin Mary' brand of crisps after a flurry of religious complaints. The coffee-shop made the costly decision to pull the brand after campaigners on the Protect the Pope website pointed out the offensive crisps branding to its members. Responding to the complaints, the religious website says Pret a Manger has 'apologised for any unintentional offence they have caused and have indicted that they will give any unsold crisps to the homeless'. Apology: The sandwich chain withdrew the Virgin Mary crisps from the market within a week of launching them as they caused offence to some . Posting on the website, Deacon Nick Donnelly, says: 'Clive Schlee (Pret CEO) has admitted to a reader of Protect the Pope that taking this brand of crisps off their shelves will cost them quite a bit of money but ""good businesses listen and react quickly"". Mr Donnelly includes grabs of two Tweets from Pret, that confirm the company is has decided to remove the crisps from the market with immediate effect. The first Tweet say: 'We're sorry the name offended you. It wasn't our intention. Our CEO has decided to remove them with effect from today.' The second, one minute later, adds: 'We'll donate the unsold crisps to homeless charities. Thanks for tweeting. We do listen and we've tried to react quickly.' Keith Beech, a spokesman for Pret, confirmed to the mailonline that CEO Clive Schlee spoke with an organiser of the the Catholic charity group, apologised for any offence, and agreed to withdraw the brand of spicy tomato crisps. Although he could not put a figure on the number of complaints received, Mr Beech said the launch and subsequent withdrawal of the brand happened all within a week. 'The decision was made Friday morning as it became clear the crisps weren't popular,' he said. 'They were launched last week, so it was within a week of launch,' he added. He said the brand was only launched in London. News of Pret's reaction comes as the company faces accusations of a regime of 'enforced happiness' of for staff at the chain. Mystery shoppers check for moodiness, which is said to be discouraged at the chain. The Catholic website goes on to post a number of replies received from Pret following the anti-Virgin Mary brand of crisps. A message from Pret CEO Clive Schlee to a reader of Protect the Pope says: 'You will be glad to hear I have taken your advice. We have now had a lot of calls and emails from our customers and we have decided to stop selling the crisps with effect from today. 'This is costing us quite a bit of money but good businesses listen and react quickly. We will be giving the unsold crisps to charity.’ One Protect the Pope member, named Mel, says: 'I just got a voice message of the CEO Clive Schlee saying they are removing the Virgin Mary after listening to customers, I rang him earlier after reading the comments on here. If Clive keeps his words, then indeed this is a victory for the Church Militant. All thanks and praise to Jesus.' Pret CEO Clive Schlee took the decision himself to pull the Virgin Mary brand from the shelves, to avoid further complaints of offence . The catholic website was set up in the run up to Pope Benedict’s state visit to the UK in September 2010 'as a direct response to the unprecedented level of hostility, ridicule and ill-will from certain public figures, sections of the press and blogs against the Holy Father and the Catholic Church,' it says on the site. In response to the Pret reaction, its comment reads: 'Clive Schlee and Pret A Manger deserve our unreserved thanks for listening to our concerns as Catholics and for acting so quickly to remove the brand of crisps. 'It seems fitting that Pret A Manger are planning to give any unsold crisps to the homeless. 'Thanks also to the readers of Protect the Pope for contacting Pret A Manger to express their concerns. God bless you all for your passion and desire to stand up for our Catholic faith. 'I’d like to express my special thanks to the reader of Protect the Pope who first brought this news to our attention, but wants to remain anonymous.' The comment goes on to question what this incident says about how they defend their faith in the future. 'We’ve been passive for too long in the face of mockery of our faith and discrimination against us as Catholics. We can change things!' The announcement on the Protect the Pope website has ignited an online debate on the issue, particularly about whether the crisps should have caused offence. One supporter, named Alan G says: 'I am glad that the Pret company has taken on board the feelings of Christians and reacted accordingly.' Meanwhile, another contributor, named timmyconspiracy, says: 'Sterling work guys. Jesus sandals next please, we can’t have our imaginary friends too closely associated with 70s fashion or people might think we’re out of touch with the zeitgeist.'","Protect the Pope campaign group says Pret apologised for any offence from the brand .

"Homeowners and shopkeepers are to be given the right to protect themselves against burglars and robbers. They will now be allowed to use reasonable force if they perceive a threat to their property. Previously they could act only when they feared for their lives. The surprise proposal is a response to public outrage over cases such as that of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer who shot a burglar dead, and Munir Hussain, who chased and beat a man who had held his family at knifepoint. The proposal comes after criticism over cases like those of Tony Martin, left, and Munir Hussain . It is one of a series of reforms . unveiled by David Cameron in a sharp turn to the right on law and order. As well as more life sentences there will be tougher punishments for . knife crime. Liberal Democrats were quick to . condemn the package, especially the pledge for mandatory life sentences . for those committing very serious offences twice. The Prime Minister finally scrapped controversial proposals to halve jail terms for offenders who enter early guilty pleas. Making a point: Prime Minister David Cameron proposed a raft of new measures at a press conference yesterday . Grilling: The Prime Minister was repeatedly asked about the U-turn on sentence reduction . Other measures include: . Mr Cameron and Justice Secretary . Kenneth Clarke attempted to deny they were making a U-turn, insisting . previous Coalition policies had merely been 'proposals'. Slapped down: Justice Secretary Ken Clarke, leaving the cabinet meeting, saw his plans scrapped . But in reality, yesterday's package marked not only a rowing back on sentence discounts following a public outcry, but a complete shift of tone and a bid to restore the Tories' reputation on law and order. The Prime Minister's intervention was a crushing blow for both Mr Clarke and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who chaired a Cabinet committee that signed off the reforms. The father of murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor welcomed the about-turn, but called for the Justice Secretary to be sacked. Richard Taylor said: 'Ken Clarke does not know what is going on in the streets, he does not know what criminality is about.' The Justice Secretary now has to find £130million a year in extra savings, with deeper cuts likely for the probation services and courts. After a series of policy U-turns, the Prime Minister claimed abandoning 50 per cent sentencing discounts was a sign of confidence, showing the Government was prepared to listen. The 'weak thing to do', he claimed, was to keep 'ploughing on' even when it became clear there was a better way of doing things. 'Being strong is about being prepared to admit you didn't get everything right the first time, you are going to improve it and make it better,' Mr Cameron said. 'My mission is to make sure that families can feel safe in their homes and they can walk the streets freely and without fear. The public need to know that dangerous criminals will be locked up for a very long time. 'We . want prisons to be places of punishment with a purpose, instead of . prisoners setting in their cells. We will require them to work hard and . reform themselves.' The self-defence clause is likely be added to the sentencing bill over the next few months. Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke's proposed cuts to the legal aid budget will have a greater impact than feared after his department admitted making an error in its impact assessment. Mr Clarke's plans to cut the £2.2billion-a-year budget by £350 million are now expected to cost 66,200 legal representations a year, almost 50% more than the original estimate of 45,000, the Ministry of Justice confirmed. The proposals, which will also cost 500,000 instances of legal assistance, have been met with widespread opposition, with actress Joanna Lumley adding her voice to the calls for Mr Clarke to think again. Richard Miller, head of legal aid at the Law Society, said: ‘It's surprising that on a matter as important as how many people will be denied help in the future, the Ministry should make such a mistake. ‘Clearly the fact that over 66,000 people who have been helped with complex legal proceedings would get no help under the Government's plans is an issue of major importance.’ The error was made in a calculation and an updated impact assessment will be published alongside the justice bill. Guidance to police, prosecutors and the courts will be revised to give clarity about when it is sensible to prosecute. They have previously had to decide what constitutes excessive force by using legal precedent. Amending the law in the way Mr . Cameron suggests would make it clear that using force to defend . property, as well as the person, is reasonable. Exactly what constitutes . 'reasonable force' remains to be clarified. With 23,000 violent crimes against householders every year, campaigners say the case for a change to legislation is growing ever stronger. The tough sentencing rules would mean predatory violent and sexual attackers who carry out a second serious offence will face a mandatory life term. The 'two strikes and you're out' policy, first proposed by Michael Howard in 1997, will mean the most dangerous criminals automatically receiving a life term after a second offence. Senior Liberal Democrats expressed their unease. Lord Thomas of Gresford, co-chairman of their parliamentary home affairs committee, said it would be a 'very strange thing' for mandatory life sentences to be imposed in cases other than murder. And Lib Dem justice minister Lord McNally said: 'The longer I have been in this job the more convinced I have been we should rely on the discretion of a well-informed judge rather than Parliament trying to second-guess the judiciary.' Mr Clegg yesterday claimed he had never supported the shorter sentences policy and appeared to blame Mr Clarke for the fiasco. He called the original plans 'arbitrary' and sources close to him insisted they had been 'badly sold' to voters. Yesterday's announcement that those who use 'reasonable force' to protect their families will not be prosecuted follows growing resentment of a justice system that is seen as favouring burglars over victims. There have been several notable cases of homeowners being jailed for defending themselves against intruders. The most recent high profile one is that of  millionaire businessman Munir Hussain, 54, who in December 2009 was sentenced to two and a half years in jail for attacking a knife-wielding burglar who threatened to kill his wife and family at their Buckinghamshire home. Both businessman Munir Hussain, left, and farmer Tony Martin provoked public outcry when they were jailed . His case provoked nationwide fury when he and his brother were imprisoned for injuring career criminal Walid Salem, while the convicted burglar was allowed to walk free. But a month after being send down, Britain's top judge released Mr Hussein from HMP Bullingdon after changing his term to a suspended sentence. Lord Judge said his decision came because of the exceptional nature of the case and the public outrage it has provoked. However, the most famous case to date is that of Tony Martin, a Norfolk farmer, who in 1999 shot two burglars in the back - killing one - after allegedly having his property raided on ten previous occasions. He was first convicted of murder and later manslaughter following an appeal. Nevertheless, he became a cause célèbre for the homeowner rights movement and helped galvanise support for a change to the law . He was released from jail for good behaviour in 2003.","People CAN use 'reasonable force' to defend themselves .

"The richest woman in the world warned her fellow countrymen they are becoming too expensive to employ. Mining tycoon Gina Rinehart said it is becoming too costly for multinational companies who could hire workers for two dollars a day in Africa. The 58-year-old said in a video address yesterday that businesses are forced to look to other nations as the price for Australian labour is too high, something which was immediately criticised by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Speaking from the hart: Gina Rinehart served up some harsh critique of the Australian government in her ten-minute long video address to the Sydney Mining Club . In her ten-minute long video for the Sydney Mining Club, Gina Rinehart said Australia must become more competitive. Ms Rinehart, head of resources giant . Hancock Prospecting, blamed the government's mining and carbon taxes, . red tape and high wages for the economy's 'sluggish' performance. ‘The evidence is unarguable, Australia is indeed becoming too expensive and too uncompetitive to . do export-oriented business,’ she said. ‘Furthermore, Africans want to work, . and its workers are willing to work for less than $2 per day. Such . statistics make me worry for this country's future.’ Too expensive: Ms Rinehart said she was concerned about Australian jobs when African workers were available at a much cheaper cost . Richest in the world: Gina pictured in 1982 with her father Lang Hancock whose empire she inherited, making her the richest woman in the world . Gina Rinehart is not averse to . controversial statements.

Retort: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard hit back at Ms Rinehart's comments . Her comments on Wednesday drew immediate criticism from Prime Minister Julia Gillard. ‘It's not the Australian way to toss people $2, to toss them a gold coin, and then ask them to work for a day. ‘We support proper Australian wages and decent working conditions.’ Ms Rinehart also attacked the . Australian government, accusing them of not being competitive enough on . the international markets, and added: ‘If we competed at the Olympic . Games as sluggishly as we compete economically there would be an . outcry.’ Her outburst came a day after iron ore . giant Fortescue announced it would defer planned developments. Last month . BHP Billiton shelved its multi-billion dollar expansion of . the Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine. Australian mining projects have faced . headwinds from depressed conditions in Europe and the United States, . softening growth in China and increased competition from other producers . as well as falling commodity prices. The price of iron ore, a crucial . ingredient in steelmaking, has fallen dramatically in the past two . months as the Chinese economy slows, while the price of coal, another . major Australian export, has also dropped sharply. Prime Minister Gillard insisted that Australia would continue to be competitive in mining. 'We're going to compete on our great . mineral deposits, our application of technology and high skills to the . task. We mine differently than in other countries,' she said.

"Students today backed a petition calling on their university union to cancel a ‘sexist’ comedian’s gig. Self-described ‘proper lad’ Dapper Laughs - real name Daniel O’Reilly - is due to bring his Socially Unacceptable tour to the Cardiff University Students’ Union, Y Plas (The Place), in February. However, a petition demanding the union cancel the Londoner’s gig because of his ‘trivialisation of rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women’ has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days. 'Proper lad': Comedian Dapper Laughs, real name Daniel O’Reilly, is currently on his Socially Unacceptable tour . On the street: Dapper Laughs came to fame for his online videos where he gives ‘lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer’. This still is from a Vine video entitled 'compliments are key' It states ‘misogynistic humour should not be supported by an organisation that stands for equality’. Petition organiser Vicky Chandler, 21, a final-year journalism student,  said: ‘Dapper Laughs is that bloke that every woman knows who dresses up sexism as banter.’ ‘His jokes are so disrespectful to women and giving him a TV show and letting him perform at the university is normalising inappropriate behaviour.’ Dapper Laughs, who hails from Clapham, south-west London, came to fame for his online videos where he gives ‘lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer’. He now has his own programme on ITV2 called On The Pull and has been accused of being a misogynist and encouraging men to harass women in public. Future date: The London comedian is due to perform at Cardiff University Students’ Union, Y Plas (The Place) 'Lad': This still is from a Vine video showing Dapper Laughs handing a beer to a London Marathon runner . In his videos, which are peppered with very explicit language, he can be seen yelling sexual comments at women on the street or from his car as he drives past. Last year, Cardiff University Students’ Union voted to implement an ‘anti-lad culture policy’ to stamp out behaviour that encouraged ‘gender, sexuality and rape-based humour’. And Miss Chandler said: ‘I think it is massively hypocritical for the students’ union to allow him to come and play here when he embodies everything that is wrong about lad culture. ‘Every time I go on a night out someone shouts at me or touches me. We need to do more to change the sexist culture at university. We need to make the university a safe place for women.’ Comments posted on the petition include one from Andy Williams, saying: ‘This guy would be a joke himself if his stuff wasn’t so insidious and damaging. It’s not OK to victimise women like this, and it’s massively exploitative to make a living out of rape jokes and sexism. It’s not innocent “banter”, it’s just offensive.’ Making a stand: A petition demanding the union cancel the Londoner’s gig because of his 'trivialisation of rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women' has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days . Dapper Laughs is one of the most successful comedians on mobile video app Vine, which distributes six-second clips playing on a loop. After starting out as a performer on cruise ships, he now has more than 500,000 followers on Vine and over a million Facebook fans, as well as his own show on ITV2 and a popular live tour. However, critics have repeatedly accused Dapper Laughs of sexism, arguing that his 'laddish' humour relies on treating women as objects who should only be seen as sexual conquests. One reviewer of his TV show described his style of comedy as 'unpleasant sexism dressed up as banter', pointing to a scene in which he tells men they should not make friends with women because it reduces their chance of a one-night stand with them. His short videos repeatedly revolve around him advising men how to get no-strings sex, or feature him accosting women in the streets. However, defenders saying that Dapper Laughs is nothing more than a comic persona for Daniel O'Reilly, claiming that any sexism in his jokes is intended to be ironic. Caroline Hodges added: ‘I cannot believe that an SU [students' union] that is so concerned about not encouraging lad culture that it completely rebranded one of its club nights would allow such a disgusting misogynist act to perform in it. ‘Dapper Laughs trivialises rape, objectifies women and encourages other men to do the same. We should not be providing him with a platform on which to express his warped views.’ Students’ Union president Elliot Howells said Dapper Laughs had been booked to play their Y Plas venue by an external promoter and had not been vetted by the organisation. He added: ‘We didn’t choose to have this person come to our venue and this situation has highlighted a gap in our policies - and as a result we will be reviewing them to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again. ‘We are also looking into options to address the petition. We operate an anti-lad culture policy at our events and are committed to making the university a safe place for all students.’ Dapper Laughs is also visiting Manchester, London, Newcastle, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham and Oxford before performing in Cardiff on February 22. Following that gig he will also play in Bristol, Bournemouth, Leicester and Nottingham. However, none of his other forthcoming dates are at university or union venues. A spokesman for Dapper Laughs did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline.","'Proper lad' Dapper Laughs due in Cardiff on Socially Unacceptable tour .

"Childrenswear retailer Babies 'R' Us is refusing to remove a range of Kardashian Kids clothing from its stores - despite an intensive campaign from a group of mothers who insist the designs are too 'sexualized' for their children. Kansas-based mother Amie Logan started an online petition earlier this week asking the retailer to remove the 'damaging' garments after seeing the new collection, which is designed for baby girls aged zero to 24 months, on shelves and online. But despite the overwhelming amount of support that the petition has received - it currently has more than 2,500 signatures - the retailer revealed to MailOnline that it will not be removing any of the offending clothing from any of its stores. Leading the charge: Kansas mother Amie Logan started the campaign to remove the inappropriate designs . Fashion faux pas: Many parents are outraged by the 'sexualized' nature of the designs . Appropriate? The Kardashian Kids collection includes this $23 pleather mini skirt . A spokesperson for Babies 'R' Us said: 'We have no plans to stop selling this collection.' The news will no doubt come as a blow to Amie and her supporters, many of whom have promised to boycott the retailer until they agree to take action. The campaign comes just one week after Babies 'R' Us' sister store Toys 'R' Us agreed to stop selling a line of Breaking Bad action figures, after parents accused the retailer of promoting drug use through the sale of the toys. 'I don't want my child to grow up to be a Sex Tape star,' Amie wrote at the top of her petition, which is posted on Change.org. 'You pulled the Breaking Bad toys because they promoted Drug use. You should pull this clothing line because it promotes bad behavior as well. 'The madness has to stop. If the toys are damaging so is the clothing.' The collection, which is an extension of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney's globally-successful Kardashian Kollection for adults, includes a $25 leatherette mini skirt - with 'attached diaper cover' - a $33 fur faux animal print vest and a $23 leatherette skirt. Motherly instincts: Both Kim, 34, and Kourtney, 35, have young daughters of their own . 'Damaging': The designs, such as this pair of gold lurex pants, have been deemed completely inappropriate for young children . 'Disgusting': The collection includes a number of short skirts and tight-fitting lurex trousers . Each of the designs, while not necessarily the personal handiwork of Kim, 34, Khloe, 30 and Kourtney, 35, have all been given the seal of approval by the sisters which is perhaps all the more disturbing given that Kim and Kourtney both have young daughters of their own. Kourtney welcomed her daughter Penelope, her second child with long-term partner Scott Disick, in July 2012, while Kim and Kanye West's daughter North was born on June 15 last year. At the time of writing, the petition, which is just a few days old, has already been signed more than 2,000 times by eager supporters, many of whom wholeheartedly agree with Amie's thoughts about the offending clothing designs. Kardashian controversy: While Khloe, Kim and Kourtney did not design each of the garments themselves, each item of clothing has been given their seal of approval . Car crash clothing: While the Kardashians' clothing collections have proved incredibly popular with adults, they seem to have missed the mark with their unsuitable childrenswear designs . 'I would never spend my money on it': The petition has now been signed by more than 2,000 people, many of whom have children and grandchildren of their own . Monique Smith from Greensboro, North Carolina, wrote: 'Babies don't need to look like porn stars' while Liz Thomas from Gainesville, Florida added: 'Breaking Bad toys are nowhere near as damaging to a young psyche as sexualization at such a young age. 'These people should be ashamed.' The campaign has also convinced some people to boycott the store entirely, with one mother commenting on the petition: 'Disgusting. I had no clue. I was just looking at starting my baby registry at Babies R Us last night. I am so glad I saw this first. 'Babies are innocent': One mother claimed that she will not shop at Babies R Us until the offending garments are removed . Gilded garments: These gold lurex trousers retail for $33 . Stop the madness: Kansas-based mother Amie Logan is demanding that the Kardashian's 'damaging' baby clothes be removed from all Babies 'R' Us stores . 'S****s and babies just do not go together. Babies are innocent, Kim is a s***k, any questions?' And it's not just parents who have taken offence at the inappropriate clothing collection. Jenny Chavez, a grandmother from Chula Vista, California, said of the designs: 'I am a grandmother and shop at Babys R Us. 'I find the Kardiashian kids clothing line completely inappropriate and would never spend my money on any Kardashian merchandise that promotes their stardom from a sex tape.'","Kansas mom Amie Logan began a campaign to force the retailer to remove all offending garments which are designed for baby girls aged 0 to 24 months .

"A formerly straight woman who woke up with another female in her bed after a big night out has penned a book about the exploration of her sexuality. Titled Lesbian For A Year, author Brooke Hemphill said despite the expected criticism surrounding the title and subject matter, the book's aim is to open up a dialogue about tolerance and acceptance of different sexualities. 'As predicted from the outset people who've not read the book and just seen the title and have an emotional reaction to it can't get past that,' Brooke told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Brooke Hemphill is the author of Lesbian For A Year, which details her experiences with other women . 'But it wasn't a social experiment. It was a series of events that sort of led to this period of time in my life', she added. The book is an exploration of her own sexuality but also aims to open dialogue about tolerance . The real kicker came after a big night when the author woke up with a serious hangover and an unexpected guest in her home. 'I was out one night in Sydney at a gay bar on Oxford Street with some friends ... I had a few drinks and woke up and low and behold there was a naked woman beside me in my bed,' she revealed. From there an unrelated offer to work with a director on a pilot for a show about a group of lesbian women in Sydney led Brooke to the next step of her journey. Shortly after filming, she began a relationship with one of the ladies, dubbed by friends as 'Claire the converter'. 'She was known to turn straight girls over to her team' Brooke said. However some in the LGBT community have been offended by the book's title, suggesting it simplifies the often complex issue of sexuality by implying it's a choice. To this, Brooke said it was not her intention to upset and did not want to detract from other's sexual experiences, but instead hoped it would open up the discussion about the fluidity of sexuality. 'I understand that by putting the word (lesbian) on the cover of the book there are people out there, they kinda own that word and they would feel I guess challenged and get a sense that I don't really have a right to use that.' Brooke said she understands why people might be upset by the title but hopes they can instead relate to her experience . 'I don't want to offend anyone but it's a pretty catchy title', Brooke added. On where she now stands in relation to her own sexuality, the Sydney woman said she didn't think it needed to be labelled. 'Everyone is very keen for me to put a label on it - if you have to put a label on it I guess I would say that would be bisexuality,' Brooke said. The Sydney woman suggested that if more people shared intimacy with those of the same sex, there would be greater understanding and less homophobia . She suggested that many others may relate to her story and that if more people shared intimacy with those of the same sex, there would be greater understanding and less homophobia. 'If you have the luxury of having a fluid sexuality then you're in an enviable position where you can choose your partner based on factors such as personality and not just gender,' Brooke said. 'Maybe in 10-15 years I might be with a woman again... but my mother did tell me on the weekend she wouldn't be very happy about that,' she laughed. Lesbian for a Year by Brooke Hemphill is available now through Affirm Press for $29.99.","Brooke Hemphill wrote Lesbian For A Year about her sexual experiences .

"Suspended: Chris Joannides has been accused of Islamophobia after a controversial Facebook post . A local councillor has been suspended for posting a comment on Facebook comparing Muslim children wearing burkas to bin bags. Chris Joannides also messaged friends during meetings with his constituents asking for updates on football scores and complaining about missing his favourite television programmes. The Conservative councillor for Enfield, in north London, has denied being Islamophobic and defended his comments as 'blokeish banter'. Mr Joannides posted a photo showing a woman and child dressed in burkas standing next to two bin bags. He wrote underneath: 'I saw her standing there and I told her she had three beautiful children. She didn't have to get all p***ed off and threaten me. It was an honest mistake!' In a Facebook message sent to friends during meetings with local residents, he complained about having to spend time with constituents instead of watching football on the TV. 'Please inbox the latest scores,' he wrote to one friend. 'I'll be surfing on fb during the resident's meeting.' Another post read: 'So far I've missed the football and Dallas listening to Labour councillors rant on tonight and losing the will to live.' Last month, he wrote: 'It's Friday night and I've just finished attending a resident's meeting... I expect to be rewarded at the ballot box for my service to the community which is eating my social life.' Mr Joannides, who is of Greek-Cypriot heritage, insisted he took his duties seriously despite the 'blokeish banter' written on his Facebook page. Post: Enfield councillor Mr Joannides put this photo and caption on Facebook, later describing them as 'banter' 'I am not, never have been and never will be Islamophobic,' he said this week. 'I am from an ethnic minority myself and I fully appreciate the prejudices people can get exposed to. 'The comments I made were against Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism including the demonisation of women, something the whole world is concerned about in the light of terrorist attacks on the West since September 11. 'I always do my best for all residents of Enfield irrespective of their political leanings, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or cultural background.' The relevant posts have all now been deleted from Facebook, but Mr Joannides could face disciplinary action from the council after officials were shown a print-out of the comments. He has also been suspended from the local Conservative group, while a complaint about the posts was made to the Metropolitan Police. Michael Lavender, Tory leader on Enfield council, said: 'As soon as I was made aware of the complaint I closely examined the materials. 'Following an immediate discussion between members of the executive, the decision was made to suspend the whip from Chris Joannides. 'At the first available meeting of the Conservative group upon receipt of the letter, the group re-affirmed the decision to suspend the councillor. 'A special meeting of the group will be called where the member will be invited to attend to make representations for his case.' Local resident Samantha Cox said: 'His comments might seem harmless, but they are incredibly offensive. 'He is comparing bin bags to Muslim children and that cannot be right, ""blokeish banter"" or not.'","Enfield councillor Chris Joannides suspended by Conservatives in Enfield .

Reporter as the largest expense of the holiday trip, which will cost . more than $4million in total. The U.S. Air Force calculates it costs $181,757 per flight hour to operate Air Force One. Travel time direct from Washington D.C. to Hawaii is about nine hours, which gives a total of $3,271,611 there and back.

President Obama has been told of the North Korean leader's death but is also locked in a payroll taxes showdown with Republicans. He has called close friend President Lee Myung-Bak of South Korea to discuss any potential implications of the death, reported AFP. Extending the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits have been a keystone of President Obama's effort to spur a revival of the flaccid economy.

"An African singer behind a skin-bleaching cream called 'Whitenicious' has tried to justify the name of her product in a TV interview, saying: 'white means pure.' Asked what the product's name meant to her, Nigerian and Cameroonian singer Dancia appeared to contradict herself by saying: 'White means pure, not necessarily skin, but in general.' She insisted that the cream is only for covering blemishes, despite an advertising campaign showing her entire body appearing lighter, adding: 'Some people they don't feel confident, they don't feel pure, they don't feel clean with dark spots.'

In an interview with Channel 4, Dancia was asked whether she thought the message behind the product was that being white looked better than being black. She replied: 'I was not selling that message, the media are selling that message. I didn't say, buy the cream and look like Dancia. 'I said seven day, fast acting dark spot remover. It's called reading comprehension. If people missed that class then it's not my fault. 'If they think that their whole body is a dark spot then fine, because that's not how I feel.' Among Dancia's critics is oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o who spoke out against racism in beauty and fashion and warned young black girls not to use bleaching products. Nyong'o, star of 12 Years A Slave, admitted that when she was younger she wanted to wake up 'just a little bit lighter', because she was ashamed of her dark skin. Critics have branded the cream an 'abomination' saying it will make 'girls of colour' ashamed of having dark skin . When asked whether she accepted the point made by Nyong'o, Dancia responded: 'I don't accept that. I don't care about her story. I don't know her. 'I'm an adult and if I lighten my skin then that's my choice, the same as bleaching my hair.' Skin bleaching is a growing trend in Dencia's native West Africa, and critics are angered that it appears she is promoting it with her product. Specifically, the pop star has been criticised for using her own changing skin tone as a marketing technique. Pictures of Dencia taken in 2011 show her with much darker pigmentation compared to the Whitenicious campaign where she appears several shades lighter. In another attempt at justification, Dencia explains that 50 per cent of her customers are African-Americans, not Africans, adding: 'I have girls calling me up and crying, thanking me for Whitenicious.' Dencia insists that skin-bleaching should be a free choice for adults, and is no different to bleaching hair . However, Phinniah Ikeji, from Black Role Models UK, said: 'This is about the young girls.They see you, they love your music, they love you as a person and they have seen that you were darker before and now you're much lighter, what's the message going to be to them? 'They're going to think, OK I want to be like her as well and then that affects their self esteem.' Commenting on the video on YouTube, user AC MC said: Indians and Africans and people of colour need to stop trying to be white and be happy with themselves. This woman needs mental help.' Another user, tpl89 added: 'Fake accent, fake hair, fake skin colour. It's so sad, she must really hate her African heritage.﻿'","African pop singer Dencia has created a beauty cream called Whitenicious .

"The first time really is important. The quality of your first sexual experience colours your sex life for years to come, researchers say. Specifically, those who felt loved and respected by their partner found later encounters more emotionally satisfying. The study, Gone But Not Forgotten, is one of the first to look at whether the circumstances in which someone loses their virginity have lasting consequences. Lasting consequences: The quality of your first sexual encounter colours your sex life for years to come, a new study shows . The U.S. researchers asked 331 young men and women about how they lost their virginity, including whether they felt scared, pressured, guilty or regretful. They were also asked about how connected they felt to their partner, including whether they felt respected and loved, and how they felt afterwards. The volunteers, who answered the . questions anonymously, were then asked to fill in an online diary . detailing any sexual experiences they had over the next fortnight. They were also asked how they would rate their sexual relationships overall. In more than two-thirds of cases, the volunteers said they were in a relationship when they lost their virginity. Analysis . of their answers showed that those who were most emotionally satisfied . the first time still found their sex lives the most fulfilling. The same was true of physical satisfaction. A . better first time also tended to lead to fewer feelings of . disappointment, the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy . is to report. Fulfilment: Researchers claim a person's first time has implications for their sexual wellbeing years later . Researcher Carrie Smith, of the University of . Mississippi, said: ‘These results suggest that one’s first-time sexual . experience is more than just a milestone in development. ‘Rather, it appears to have implications for their sexual well-being years later.’ Co-researcher . Matthew Shaffer, of the University of Tennessee, said that while the . study doesn’t prove that a better first time makes for a better sex life . in general, a person’s experience of losing their virginity may set the . pattern for years to come. 'The happier the experience initially, on the whole, the happier in future' Sex Academy author Dr Pam Spurr . ‘In essence, first-time sexual experience . may create a general pattern of thought and behaviour that we use to . guide us in new sexual experiences and a framework for our . understanding, perception or interpretation of new information . concerning sexuality.’ Those taking part in the study were . relatively young but the researchers said it is ‘highly plausible’ that . the same would be true decades later, with someone’s sex life in their . 40s reflecting their experiences in their teens. Dr Pam Spurr, an agony aunt and author of Sex Academy, said their theory rings true. ‘The happier the experience initially, on the whole, the happier in future. It just kind of sets you up for good experiences. ‘I . also find that when people who had first-time experiences they felt . unhappy about, perhaps they felt pressurised, or too young, or felt used . because they thought the person was in love with them too but the . feeling wasn’t reciprocated, it sets a pattern for feeling they are more . likely to make bad choices in future. ‘Losing your virginity is such . an important aspect of our development as people, that if your first . time is poor, rather than learning from it, a lot of people harbour the . negative feelings.’ Previous studies have concluded that most people . have sex for the first time between the ages of 15 and 17, with men . more likely to enjoy the experience than women. In one study, only . around a quarter of females said they were ‘considerably’ or ‘extremely’ satisfied physically - the response given by around two-thirds of the . men. Men also found the experience more psychologically satisfying, although the gap between the sexes was smaller.","Researchers in the U.S. asked hundreds of young men and women about how they lost their virginity .

"Indian abortion Doctors are feeding female foetuses to dogs to cover up rampant infanticide by parents who prefer boys, it has been revealed. The sickening practice was exposed in the town of Beed, in Maharashtra -  the state with the worst child sex ratio in the country. So-called gender genocide was blamed for last year's appalling census figures, which showed that just 801 girls were being born for every 1,000 boys. Beauty with a dark secret: A stunning temple in the town of Beed, where doctors keep dogs to avoid disposing of foetuses they have aborted because the child is a girl - a practice that has long been illegal . By keeping dogs, doctors can get rid of bodies without having to dispose of them through official channels. It means that the true extent of illegal sex-selection abortion in the town - and elsewhere in India - is being hidden . The shocking revelation was made by Varsha Deshpande of Lek Ladki Abhiyan, a charity working against the practice. She claimed her organisation had conducted a sting operation Dr Sudam Munde in 2010, in which he openly talked about how he was aborting female foetuses and feeding them to his five dogs. Killer decision: Although sex-selective abortion and ultrasound scans (like above) that are soley carried out to determine a baby's gender are illegal in India, the practice continues in some clinics . It was then that the police had arrested him, but he was released soon and continued with his activities. 'A person even saw a foetus being fed to the animals,' Deshpande said. Admission: Health minister Suresh Shetty revealed he's heard of Beed  doctors feeding foetuses to dogs . Suresh Shetty, the public health minister for Maharashtra - India - second most populous state - also admitted he had heard of foetuses thrown to the dogs in Beed. Deshpande added: 'This is known to everyone in Beed, but the police are not taking action as  Munde  influential.' Last Friday, Vijaymala Patekar, 28,, was admitted to Dr Munde's abortion clinic in Beed when she was six months pregnant. She had four daughters and did not want another. But while her pregnancy was being terminated, she died. The police have arrested Munde and his wife, but Deshpande said the couple were held earlier too for the same offence and will go scot-free again because of their money power and influence. 'We don't want this case to be tried in Beed or Marathwada. Let the case be tried somewhere outside as they wield too much influence for the trial to be fair,' she said. Health minister Shetty said: 'I have heard of the practice but have no evidence.' He added that since the local police seemed to be under a lot of 'pressure', he had decided to ask the crime branch to investigate the latest case. Substantiating Deshpande's account of the kind of clout enjoyed by Munde, Shetty said: 'Our civil surgeon who had gone to investigate Munde's hospital was locked up in a room by some goons. Location: The town of Beed , in Maharashtra - the state with the worst sex ratio in India . 'They even abused her and asked her to go away.' The minister said the surgeon while trying to take action against such doctors had been facing threats for more than a year. 'We have asked the home department to provide security for our staff,' he said.","Sickening practice exposed in Bede, Maharashtra - Indian state with worst child sex ratio of 801 girls for every 1,000 boys being born .

"A meditation technique made famous by the Beatles could boost brain power and even improve exam grades, scientists have claimed. A study of high school students found graduation rates were up to 25 per cent better for those who Chanting ‘om’ or a similar meditation mantra for 20 minutes twice a day. The relaxation technique, known as Transcendental Meditation, involves a particular sound being repeated over and over again with the eyes closed. New research suggests that Transcendental Meditation, taught to The Beatles by Indian Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967 (pictured), can boost brain function and improve exam grades by up to 25 per cent . It has also been shown to reduce the risk of death from heart attack and strokes and soothe stress and anxiety. It became fashionable among ‘flower power’ hippies of the Sixties after John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr visited India and were taught it by the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Professor Robert Colbert, from the University of Connecticut, said improved graduation rates benefit society as a whole, as well as improving prospects for the individual. He added that dropping out can result in loss of income, along with more risk of turning to crime and ending up in jail, or becoming dependent on state benefit. In the study, analysis of the records of 235 students at an urban school on the east coast of the U.S. showed a 15 per cent higher graduation rate for those put on a transcendental mediation program compared to a control group. When only the lowest academically performing participants in both groups were considered, passes rose by 25 per cent in the meditators. The meditating students were also less likely to drop out from school, or enter prison, and were more likely to be accepted to further education. As well as exam grades improving by at least 15 per cent, students who meditated were also less likely to . drop out from school, or enter prison, and were more likely to be accepted to further education . Prof Colbert said: 'While there are bright spots in public education today, urban schools on the whole tend to suffer from a range of factors which contribute to poor student academic performance and low graduation rates. 'Students need to be provided with value added educational programs that can provide opportunities for school success. 'Our study investigated one such program, Transcendental Meditation, which appears to hold tremendous promise for enriching the lives of our nation’s students.' In a 2009 interview, Ringo Starr said of Transcendental Meditation: 'Over . 40 years ago, we ended up in Rishikesh. That is where we hung out with . Maharishi. We had met him a few months before in Wales. Since then, . sometimes a lot, sometimes a little, I have meditated. It is a gift he . gave me.’ Paul McCartney added: 'It is one of the . few things anyone has ever given to me that means so much to me. For us, . it came at a time when we were looking for something to stabilise us at . the end of the crazy Sixties.' The research is published in the journal Education.","The technique, known as Transcendental Meditation, involves a particular sound being repeated over and over again with the eyes closed .

"Tests for prostate cancer may be  incorrectly giving the all-clear to up to 50 per cent of men who have the disease, according to a study. Experts believe thousands of patients with the disease could be missed every year because the standard biopsy techniques used at most NHS hospitals are flawed. And thousands more perfectly healthy people could be wrongly diagnosed with the disease and undergoing needless radiotherapy or surgery, according to a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and University College London. Experts say MRI and ultrasound scans give more accurate diagnoses of prostate cancer . Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, affecting 40,000 British men a year and killing 10,000. Most NHS hospitals automatically use biopsies for men with suspected prostate cancer, removing and examining tissue in an attempt to establish whether the disease is present. More than 100,000 of these ‘blind’ biopsies are carried out every year – but experts say the procedures are inaccurate and risky. They are instead calling for less invasive – but far more expensive – MRI and ultrasound scans to be used first, which they say could immediately and reliably give the all-clear to men without the disease, and allow doctors to carry out more accurate biopsies by pinpointing the area where a tumour is suspected. Professor Mark Emberton, of the University College London, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘There is no other organ of the body where we carry out random “blind” biopsies without knowing where we are looking. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, affecting 40,000 British men a year and killing 10,000 (file photo) ‘At UCLH we have been using MRI, followed by a guided biopsy for several years, but there are only a handful of hospitals in this country which do this, and that needs to change.’ The health economists who carried out the Wellcome Trust-funded study calculated that using the alternative procedure could mean a quarter of patients are given the all-clear without having a biopsy. For every 1,000 men with suspected cancer, 250 men could have been reassured after a scan. Of 500 of the cases in which significant disease was present, just 50 per cent were detected during the traditional biopsy, compared with 68 per cent using the MRI-guided technique. One in 20 of those undergoing the traditional biopsy were wrongly found to have significant disease levels. Using the MRI-guided technique, around half as many men were given a wrong diagnosis. Sarah Willis, a health economist from London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ‘These findings suggest that the use of MRI and ultrasound not only detects far more cases, but leads to fewer false positives, in which significant disease is wrongly diagnosed.’ Dr Kate Holmes, head of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘This early data suggests that giving men an MRI scan before a biopsy may put clinicians in a better position to tailor investigations and treatments further down the line. 'However, further research is necessary before we will know the true value of this method.’","Thousands of sufferers could be missed every year due to 'flawed' biopsies .

"There are fears that a group of nine young North Korean defectors have been executed after they were sent back to the pariah state after they tried to claim asylum in Laos. The young escapees - aged 15 to 23 - were deported back to their homeland after a long and difficult trek to freedom that had, for some, taken as long as four years. The UN has condemned the decision, while the South Korean missionaries who tried to help the defectors make their escape say they are furious at their own government's response. Betrayed: Authorities in Laos sent these young . North Korean defectors back to their homeland after they tried to claim . asylum in the hopes they could make it to a new life of freedom in South Korea or America . Frostbite: Many of the young defectors suffered appalling injuries from extreme cold, and some were suffering from skin diseases . Those missionaries made video recordings of the youngsters' ordeal, which happened in 2009 but has only just come to light in a CNN report. The young defectors had hoped to claim asylum in Laos - first step towards a new life in South Korea or the U.S. - after making a long and hazardous journey through Chinese territory. Most North Korean defectors first cross their country's northern border, but they cannot stop there as authorities in China - North Korea's only ally - would send them straight back. Ordeal: The children had frostbite on their hands, toes and noses from living in an old abandoned building in minus 30C conditions . The upsetting images were captured by missionaries in 2009, but have only just come to light . Brutal: Many of the injuries the children had sustained were doled out by guards who caught them stealing food in an effort to survive . South Korea's foreign ministry said it prioritises the lives and safety of North Korean defectors and is 'inspecting the problems revealed from this incident' The South Korean missionaries, who preferred to remain anonymous since they often help defectors from the North, helped to sneak them across the border from China to Laos. When they met the defectors in December 2009, many were badly malnourished and frostbitten after living as fugitives in China, spending their days evading authorities and nights sleeping rough. One missionary told CNN: 'They look for fish bones and rice to mix together to make into porridge. Then they eat toothpaste to help them digest it.' Tired, frightened and hungry: When the missionaries met the . defectors, many were badly malnourished and frostbitten . after living as fugitives in China, spending their days evading . authorities and nights sleeping rough . Most were suffering from a skin disease and an unlucky few had injuries they said were inflicted by beatings from border guards who had caught them stealing food. 'All of them seemed to have suffered from tuberculosis,' the missionary said. 'And as they were malnourished their growth had been stunted.' He hoped that after getting the defectors out of China they would be able to claim asylum with Laotian authorities. But this time things did not go according to plan. The teenagers were told they were going to South Korea and their applications were being processed, but no one from Seoul ever visited them . After giving themselves up the defectors and their helpers were held for two weeks, while calls to South Korea's embassy simply said the youngsters' applications were being processed. No diplomat came to visit them in their detention. Then, on May 27, the youngsters were told to pack their bags to go to South Korea. But as the missionaries tried to follow their charges into the immigration office the door was shut in their face. According to the United Nations all nine youngsters were deported back to North Korea via China. On show: After their recapture, the youngsters were paraded on North Korean state television, where they said they had been tricked into leaving the country and thanked Kim Jong Un for allowing them home . M.J. and his wife fear for the nine youngsters, as those who try to escape North Korea are often imprisoned or executed . They were last seen on North Korean state television, where they said they had been tricked into leaving the country and thanked Kim Jong Un for welcoming them back. Human rights groups told CNN that defectors caught and sent back to North Korea are sometimes tortured, or even executed. Contemplating the fate of the youngsters they tried to help, one of the missionaries broke down in tears. 'It's unbearable that these children were taken away from us,' she said. 'But what makes me really angry is the response from South Korea.' South Korea's foreign ministry told CNN it prioritises the life and safety of North Korean defectors and is 'inspecting the problems revealed from this incident'.","Missionaries who helped them furious at South Korea's response .

"Former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington has called for British people to inform security services if they suspect their neighbours maybe extremists . The former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington has called for British people to inform security services if they suspect their neighbours maybe extremists. Dame Stella, who supports the Government’s controversial ‘snoopers’ charter’, said people need to be more alert because it is impossible for security services to spot every threat.She called for a wartime vigilance and for people to be the Government’s ‘eyes and ears’ following the killing of Lee Rigby.The 78-year-old, who was MI5’s first female Director General, said: ‘The community has the responsibility to act as the eyes and ears, as they did during the war … where there were all these posters up saying the walls have ears and the enemy is everywhere.‘There have often been indications in the community, whether it’s Muslim or anywhere else, that people are becoming extremists and spouting hate phrases.’ Dame Stella said security services had to prioritise the most dangerous threats because ‘thousands’ of people were being radicalised in Britain.She said further terror attacks on the UK were inevitable unless the country became a ‘police state’. Her comments, made at the Hay Festival, were prompted following the killing of 25-year-old soldier Lee Rigby by alleged Islamist fanatics Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, in Woolwich last Wednesday. Radicalised: Michael Adebolajo brandishing bloodied knives after the murder of Lee Rigby last week . Arrested: In 2010 Michael Adebolajo, second from right, was among nine suspected members of the Al-Shabaab movement captured by Kenyan police . Dame Stella said the Woolwich killing was classified as a ‘terrorist attack’ because of the ideology behind the attack. It has now emerged that Adebolajo made a second attempt to travel to Somalia to join extremist groups after failing in 2010. The killing has raised questions about MI5 after it also emerged the two suspects were known to them. Adebolajo was detained in Kenya in 2010 after trying to join a terrorist group. An investigation by parliamentary intelligence is being carried out to determine whether there were intelligence failings.","Dame Stella Rimington said members of the public have to be the Government's 'eyes and ears'

"The Essex accent has long attracted ridicule and disapproval. But primary school teachers say it also has a damaging effect on children’s spelling and grammar.So they have introduced elocution lessons in an effort to improve pupils’ written work. The children are learning to say ‘computer’ instead of ‘computa’ and ‘aren’t’ in place of ‘ain’t’ as well as being told to stop ending sentences with ‘yeah?’. Plumb in the mouth: Cherry Tree Primary School in Basildon is one of the first in the country to offer its pupils elocution lessons. Pictured are pupils Lucy Stapleton and Callum Cowan being taught by Francesca Gordon-Smith . Up to 200 seven to 11-year-olds  are having weekly lessons with a private tutor at the Cherry Tree Primary School in Basildon, Essex. Teachers say there has been great progress in their spelling and writing since the lessons were introduced a year ago. Some parents are even being corrected on their pronunciation at home by their children. 'Reem': Billy Faiers filming the new series of TOWIE today. The programme has brought Essex speak to a wider audience . The spotlight has been turned on the Essex accent following the huge success of the reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. Terri Chudleigh, the school’s literacy co-ordinator, insisted: ‘This is not about being ashamed of the Essex accent – it’s about helping the children to speak properly so they can improve their reading and writing. 'They weren’t saying words correctly and were therefore misspelling them. ‘We had lots of youngsters writing ‘sbort’ instead of ‘sport’ and ‘wellw’ instead of ‘well’. 'They now have half-hourly sessions where they get taken through exercises and learn to use the ""posh voices"" in their heads. 'They really enjoy the sessions. The feedback we’ve had from parents has been very positive. We’ve had them tell us their children are going home and correcting them on their speech!' Former TOWIE star Maria Fowler said of the concept: 'I think elocution lessons in schools are a good idea. 'Even if they're not a priority across the whole country,  it's good to see this school doing this.' However, Billie Faiers, who currently appears in the show, today criticised the school for introducing the lessons. She said: ‘I think it is ridiculous that kids so young are being forced to act a certain way. 'Both me and my sister have never had any sort of elocution lessons and it did not do us any harm. 'I worked at a recruitment agency before TOWIE and my sister worked in a bank and neither of us had any problems with our regional accent. 'I think kids should be kids, and let creative ideas come from individuality. If everybody spoke in the same way, we'd soon all get bored of speaking like one another.' During the sessions, children run through speech exercises and are encouraged to use ‘posh voices’. Francesca Gordon-Smith, who runs the classes through her business Positive Voice, said: ‘When they’re writing, the children have their elocution voice in their head. Speaking clearly: Teachers at the school say they have seen a vast improvement in their pupils' spelling and writing since the lessons were introduced . Extra lessons: Rising numbers of schools are teaching elocution. At Cherry Tree Primary School in Essex, 11-year-olds are having weekly lessons with a private tutor (pictured) ‘They speak clearer, they’re pronouncing their Ts and generally finishing sentences.’ The classes have also improved pupils’ grammar, for example by telling them to use ‘we were’ instead of ‘we was’.

"Outburst: Patrick Mercer branded Mr Cameron a 'despicable creature' A senior Tory MP was last night accused of launching a tirade of abuse against David Cameron in which he allegedly described the Prime Minister as an 'a**e'. Former Army colonel Patrick Mercer was also claimed to have witheringly dismissed Mr Cameron as 'a despicable creature' and 'the worst politician in British history since William Gladstone'. The extraordinary remarks were allegedly recorded at a party in Central London last week. Mr Mercer, a former homeland security . spokesman for the Tories, denied making the comments even though The . Mail on Sunday understands that the tape-recording has been played back . to him. However, the politician, 55, . did admit suggesting that Home Secretary Theresa May would probably . have to resign in the wake of the row over border agency controls being . relaxed. In the recording, obtained by the Sunday People, he claimed the Prime Minister would be ousted by next year. Asked if backbenchers would launch a leadership coup, Mr Mercer replied: 'He'll go in the spring. He'll resign in the spring.' According to reports last night, the Newark MP was taped as he attended the annual autumn party of The London Magazine. He gave an address at the event after writing an article he titled: 'Rioting: A Very British Business.' Criticism: Mr Cameron, pictured this week, was allegedly branded 'the worst politician since Gladstone' Former BBC reporter Mr Mercer was joined at the event by the corporation's Middle East correspondent Jeremy Bowen. Mr Mercer, an adviser to the literary magazine, was allegedly recorded saying: . Flattering comparison? The 19th century Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone . • 'Cameron was an a**e. That's a matter of fact, not politics.' • 'I would take a beggar off the streets... rather than have Cameron.' • 'He is the worst politician in British history since William Gladstone.' • He wished Mr Cameron was never born . But in a statement last night, Mr Mercer said: 'I did not make those remarks.' He told the Sunday People he had a 'friendly conversation' and talked about a lot of subjects. The row comes four years after Mr Mercer was forced to resign as the Tories' homeland security spokesman when he made comments on race in the Army which Mr Cameron condemned as 'unacceptable'. Mr Mercer had said that he had met 'a lot' of 'idle and useless' ethnic  minority soldiers who used racism as a 'cover'. The former Sherwood Foresters colonel also appeared to say that being called a 'black b******” was a normal part of Army life. At the time of his remarks the MP, who served in Northern Ireland and was commended for gallantry in 1990, said he 'deeply' regretted any offence he had caused. The outspoken politician, who went on to be a security adviser to Labour . Prime Minister Gordon Brown, was among backbenchers who rebelled last . month over a referendum on European Union membership. Mr Cameron put out an immediate statement about that incident apologising for Mr Mercer's comments, adding: 'We should not tolerate racism in the Army or in any walk of life. Patrick Mercer is no longer a shadow Minister.'","Patrick Mercer brands David Cameron 'a despicable creature' at party .

Chairman Diler Gharib said: 'We had just finished our prayers and were discussing how to thank our neighbours for the support they have shown us over the past few days when we heard a bang and saw fire coming under the door. 'I grabbed a fire extinguisher and put . it out and then two more petrol bombs hit the fire escape and the bin . so I had to put those out too. 'Luckily . the police have been monitoring the mosque since the last attack and . they were able to arrest two people almost straight away. 'We . have all been feeling on edge and now this has happened. It’s not just . the people at the mosque we are worried about, it’s our wives, daughters . and children who are out in the community. 'People . need to realise that the people who committed the murder in Woolwich . are criminals and it had nothing to do with the Muslim faith.' A . 33-year-old man and a 37-year-old man were arrested following the . attack and were tonight in police custody at Grimsby Police Station. Attack: This scorched door to the Grimsby Mosque shows the damage caused by the firebomb attack last night . Scene: Police and firefighters attend the blaze started by troublemakers at a Grimsby mosque on Sunday . Following a separate attack on the mosque last Thursday, six of the 11 people arrested have been released without charge. Four boys, aged 16 and 15, have been released on bail until the end of June. Chief Supt Tony Forbes said today: 'I would like to remind people that these are serious offences which are being investigated and those who are responsible will be brought to justice. 'It is important to remember that those people who have committed these offences are a very small minority and they do not reflect the vast majority of people who live in North East Lincolnshire. 'The people who want to engage themselves in this type of criminal activity will be dealt with using all appropriate police resources and powers. 'I have spoken to community leaders and what is clear to me is the attacks will not be allowed to undermine the very good community relations in North East Lincolnshire. My officers will continue to work with all of our communities to protect them and ensure their safety.' Problems: Hoards of police were forced to break up the walk in Bristol because of disorder . Trouble: Riot officers were called to halt a Bristol walk in support of Help for Heroes after they feared it would stoke up 'community tensions' - this led to 19 arrests . Meanwhile an English Defence League activist who threatened to burn down a mosque in retaliation for Lee Rigby's murder has been told he faces jail. Adam Rodgers took to Facebook following the murder and called on his fellow EDL members to meet him at a mosque in Hastings, Sussex. The 28-year-old posted various 'inflammatory' remarks on the social networking site in the hours following the drummer's death including 'the mosque needs burning down'. Lead magistrate Paul Brown, told him: 'The harm you could have created was potentially huge due to the circumstances. You made threats to burn down a mosque and mobilise people at a time when feelings are running very high due to a tragic incident. All options will remain open, including prison.' Meanwhile, hate cleric Anjem Choudary has told how Muslims have been shaking his hand in the street in support of his views on Islam, as Theresa May takes steps to ban extremist preachers from our screens. Choudary said that his rants were to do with foreign policy and the oppression of Muslims, and said he had never encouraged any terrorism. He said many people were now scared of speaking - but he had been congratulated for his stance on the issue. Figurehead: Anjem Choudary says Muslims have been praising his views on Islam and British foreign policy . He said: 'People are coming up to me and shaking my hand. There has been a lot of support for me, on the internet, on social networks and on the streets. 'At the end of the day what we say needs context. Nobody is saying go out and do something like that, stab someone in the street, but if you don't talk about the foreign policy you have to think about the implications.' He also spoke against calls to ban 'hate' sermons. He said: 'I would say that the question is should Muslims have love or hatred towards the British foreign policy? 'If Theresa May is now saying that Muslims must love what is taking place in Iraq and in Afghanistan then I'm afraid that the vast majority of Muslims around the world have nothing but contempt for the occupation of Muslim lands and the murder of innocent women and children.' He added: 'Over the last 15 or 20 years we have organised hundreds of demonstrations, we have held classes, lectures and conferences with thousands of Muslims. 'Nobody has even carried out any terrorist activities. What people do when they leave we cannot be held accountable for. 'Most of the demonstrations have been organised with the full consent of the police and the council. They have been aware of our activities for so long. 'At the demonstration with Michael [Adebolajo, who was pictured with Choudary at a 2007 rally], there were no arrests. 'If it was so bad, why was he not stopped then?'","Help for Heroes rejects money raised for it by English Defence League .

"Migrants have forced tens of thousands of Britons out of the workplace, a landmark report warned yesterday. An independent panel of advisers found that, between 2005 and 2010, 160,000 people had been ‘displaced’, or left jobless, by a huge influx of foreign workers. For every four migrant workers who come to the country from outside the EU, one British job is lost, the experts said. An increase of 100 foreign-born working-age migrants in the UK was linked to a reduction of 23 Britons in employment between 1995 and 2010, the Migration Advisory Committee said . The Migration Advisory Committee also criticised the way ministers have used the potential impact on Gross Domestic Product, or GDP – the total size of the economy – to decide whether large-scale immigration was desirable. Professor David Metcalf, chairman of  the MAC, said it had led ‘inexorably’ to ‘pro-immigration’ policies because more migrants will logically expand the economy. He called on ministers instead to consider the impact on schools, hospitals, congestion, crime rates and house prices. Romanians outside the British Embassy in Bucharest seeking a visa which will give them entry to the UK . Referring to the current system, Professor Metcalf said: ‘The main gainer is the migrant. It’s not the British resident. The focus should be on the British resident.’ Tory ministers were last night urged to seize on the findings of the report to impose far stricter border controls. To date, the Liberal Democrats have been undermining attempts to crack down on economic migration. But, in the first study of its kind, the MAC – set up by the last Labour government, and independent of Whitehall – said large-scale immigration was having a significant impact on the job prospects of the ‘native’ population. The report, which follows years of controversy over whether immigration leads to fewer jobs for British workers, showed that every increase of 100 foreign-born working-age migrants in the UK was linked to a reduction of 23 Britons in employment between 1995 and 2010. Between 2005 and 2010 alone, the number of working-age migrants in employment rose by 700,000 and displaced 160,000 British-born workers, it said. Average wages remain the same, the MAC said, but the highest wages get higher and the lower wages get lower. Asked if there would be 160,000 extra jobs for British workers if there had been no immigration, Professor Metcalf said: ‘Yes, that would be a reasonable way of putting it.’ It follows a contrasting report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research which said the number of immigrants coming to the UK had little or no impact on the number of unemployed. The MAC report found that house prices and rents are being pushed up by the number of migrants coming to the UK. It added that migrants will inevitably contribute to the demand for public services, commit crime and generate congestion in the same way any increase in the UK-born population would. However, the report concluded that migrants from inside the EU, including Eastern Europe, have ‘little or no impact on the native employment rate’. Professor Metcalf said: ‘It may well be that the EU migrants are disproportionately less skilled and it may be that the labour market can adjust.’It is likely that hard-working migrants from countries such as Poland are doing jobs which British workers are unwilling to take. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch, said: ‘This is a thoroughly professional report.‘The committee have had the courage to say straight out that immigration can add to unemployment, especially during a recession. ‘They are also right to draw attention to impacts that are harder to quantify such as housing and congestion.’ On Monday, MigrationWatch said it would be a ‘remarkable coincidence’ if there were no link between a 600,000 rise since May 2004 in the number of eastern European migrants working in the UK and a 450,000 rise in youth unemployment in the same period. Immigration Minister Damian Green said: ‘Controlled immigration can bring benefits to the UK, but uncontrolled immigration can put pressure on public services, on infrastructure and on community relations. ‘This report makes clear that it can also put pressure on the local labour market. We thank the MAC for its work and will now consider the report more fully as we work to regain control over our immigration system.’ Research . from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research has . contradicted claims by campaigners that foreign workers . are crowding the jobs market. Instead, the institute's study found that there was 'no association' between higher immigration and joblessness. Researchers . even suggested the opposite might be the case and immigration acts as . an economic stimulus, pushing total employment levels higher and dole . claimant numbers lower than they would otherwise have been. Research from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that there was 'no association' between higher immigration and joblessness . The . report said: 'Perhaps surprisingly, the interaction between migrant . inflows and GDP emerges as positive, indicating that during periods of . lower growth, migrant inflows are associated with ... slower [dole] . claimant growth than would otherwise have occurred.' The . researchers did concede that the stimulating effects of migration on . the overall labour market at a time of recession are likely to be small. It . follows claims made yesterday by immigration pressure group . MigrationWatch that rising immigration from Eastern and Central Europe . since European Union enlargement in 2004 had contributed to a surge in . youth unemployment in Britain, which is now above one million. Migrants are 'pushing up house prices' The Mac report also showed that house . prices and rents are being pushed up by the number of migrants coming to the . UK. Migrants . will add 8 per cent to the demand for housing, which ultimately leads to an increase in . housing costs, especially in London, the south and certain parts of Scotland, it found. The report added . that migrants will inevitably contribute to the demand for public services, . commit crime and generate congestion in the same way any increase in the . UK-born population would. Estimates . showed migrants cost schools £2,216 per person per year, a third more than the . £1,662 cost for non-migrants, perhaps because migrants tend to be both young . and fertile, the Mac said. But health . services for migrants were likely to cost £2,450 per person per year, compared . with £2,765 for non-migrants, possibly because migrants tend to be young and . healthy. The report . also showed that more than 70 per cent of households headed by skilled migrant workers . initially rented, with only 20 per cent owning and living in their own home, compared . with 68 per cent of all households in England. The Mac . added that non-EU migrants were more likely to live in larger metropolitan areas . than the average UK national, due to greater employment opportunities and more . developed transport systems. It also revealed that migrants were likely to make use of public transport, walking, . car-sharing or cycling rather than driving in the years immediately following . their arrival in the UK. Migrants . have a negative impact on the UK road system through the use of their cars, . although it is not as great as the impact made by the average UK-born . individual as they tend to make less non-work journeys. But crime . rates were likely to go down as a result of migration because migrants were . less likely to commit crime, the report said. Migrant . groups were also found to have more trust in British political institutions, . and to express a higher sense of belonging to Britain than the average UK-born . individual without any migrant heritage.","23 fewer jobs for British workers for every 100 migrants from outside EU, says report .

"Tory MP Kris Hopkins claimed Muslim men were fundamentally sexist towards women . A Tory MP has sparked controversy after claiming ‘gangs of Muslim men are going round and raping white kids at this moment in time’. Kris Hopkins, MP for Keighley, said the extraordinary claim was a ‘fact’ and urged government agencies to tackle the problem. But he has been criticised by Muslim leaders in his constituency, who said he overstepped the mark during a Commons debate. Mr Hopkins, a former leader of Bradford city council, also claimed Muslim men were ‘fundamentally’ sexist towards women, and politicians had to challenge behaviour and culture. Speaking in a parliamentary debate on child sexual exploitation, Mr Hopkins claimed mainstream parties had failed by not speaking out about the racial and cultural aspect to some abuse cases and extremists groups had filled the vacuum. He told MPs: ‘The British National Party will use grooming as a key element of its campaign in the Rotherham election campaign, which will start soon. ‘Not all British Pakistani men are abusing white kids. There is a minority, though. The media coverage gives long lists of notorious abusers - including vicars, priests and celebrities - who are all white and non-Muslim.’ The ‘vast majority’ of child abusers in this country are white, he added.‘But we should not get away from the fact that gangs of Muslim men are going round and raping white kids at this moment in time. ‘That is an horrendous thing to say, but it is the fact of what is happening. I want to explore some of the state’s agencies’ behaviour towards that, and some of the community’s associated behaviour and culture.’ Mr Hopkins conceded that his friends in the Commons and ‘back home’ would not like what he was saying, but he felt it had to be said. ‘Fundamentally, there is a sexist behaviour by Muslim men towards women,’ he said. ‘We talk about institutions and commissions and all the rest of it. Fundamentally, as leaders, we need to challenge the behaviour that is going on. ‘We need to do that from a point, though, of not being racist. We are friends who want those people to be successful in our society. They are part of British society, but there is behaviour that is unacceptable.’ Bradford Council for Mosques said Mr Hopkins had overstepped the mark. A spokesman said: ‘All of us, Muslim or non-Muslim, are equally appalled by the activities of criminals amidst our society. ‘To suggest that the Muslim community does not care is grossly libellous. Kris Hopkins is right to draw the attention to the activities of the criminals and the plight of the victims but he has overstepped his remit,’ he told the Bradford Telegraph and Argus. ‘He has the right to be angry but, equally, a man of his position should be more discerning in what he says and how he says it. He should not overlook the fact that he went around pleading for votes from the same Muslim faith institutions that he so arrogantly dismissive of.’","Keighley MP uses Commons debate to demand government agencies do more to tackle the problem .

"For years, kopeck-pinching Soviets sat down in a cheap restaurant in a former mansion of the nobility for plain meals, unaware of the treasure secreted nearby. Workers restoring the building, in St Petersburg, this week finally found it, unexpectedly, in a storage space hidden between two floors - more than 1,000 pieces of jewellery, silver service sets stamped with the name of one of Russia’s most prominent noble families, mirrors and brushes in silver frames. Many of them were wrapped in newspapers dated from the early months of 1917, as Russia careened toward the Bolshevik Revolution that ended life as the nobles had known it. Among the hoard are silver service sets stamped with the name of one of Russia's most prominent noble families, the Naryshkins . More than 1,000 pieces of jewellery have been found in a former 18th century mansion in St Petersburg . Many of the items were wrapped in newspapers dated from the early months of 1917, as Russia careened toward the Bolshevik Revolution that ended life as the nobles had known it . Yesterday's announcement of the find by the Intarsia company, which is performing the restoration work, has sparked arguments over who can claim the valuables. The find is so new that experts haven’t had time to inspect the goods and estimate their value. The treasure tale touches on two of Russia’s most renowned and romantic figures: 17th century tsar Peter the Great and renowned 19th century author Alexander Pushkin.

"Missing: Gavin Smith, 57, a top 20th Century Fox executive, vanished without a trace six weeks ago . Los Angeles homicide detectives believe that the 20th Century Fox executive who went missing six weeks ago may have been murdered by a jealous boyfriend of one of his many lovers. Gavin Smith, the muscular, 57-year-old former basketball player for UCLA, had recently separated from his wife, Lisa, the mother of his three children. ‘He had several affairs,’ a source close to the investigation told The Daily. ‘The guy was a player. He was a big flirt. He was a ladies’ man.’ Smith worked out of a Fox office in Calabasas, California, handling the distribution of movies in Oklahoma and Texas. On May 1, the 57-year-old disappeared along with his black 2000 Mercedes E420 after leaving the house of a friend in Oak Park, where he was ‘couch surfing.’ He was reported missing the following day when he failed to pick up his son to take him to school. ‘It’s hard for a six-foot-six guy to go missing. It’s even harder for a car to disappear,’ a law enforcement source said. ‘That’s why they think it is murder.’ His distraught family launched a . media campaign, hoping that someone would come forward . with news of his whereabouts. Last Friday, Sheriff’s detectives accompanied by a SWAT team and armed with a search warrant raided a house in the San Fernando Valley and left after five hours with boxes, a computer and a black Audi SUV. The house on the 8600 block of Santa Susana Place belongs to John and Chandrika Creech, whose lawyer, Daniel Teola, told the Los Angeles Times it was the second time this month that deputies had searched the premises. Around the time of the search, Smith's wife and three sons announced that a $20,000 reward is being offered for information on his whereabouts. Two weeks prior, Smith was spotted having dinner in California with a woman, it was claimed. A . fellow diner at Taco Temple in Morro Bay, David Brill said he saw the . missing exec on May 7 in the restaurant but didn't realise who it was . until the next day. He . said: 'I noticed on the Yahoo main page that there was a news link to a . missing Hollywood executive,' Brill told news station NBC LA. 'I happened to click on the link, saw the photo, and said, ""Oh boy, that's the guy I saw in the restaurant the previous night"".' SWAT cars arrive at a home in a San Fernando Valley cul-de-sac . A woman and her two children emerged from within the house on the 8600 block of Santa Susana Place, and neighbours confirmed that a family of four live there . A waitress at the restaurant confirmed Brill's account saying she served the quiet couple who said they were from 'down south'. Sergent John O’Brien said police have received hundreds of calls about . Smith since his disappearance, but the leads were 'obviously not him'. The . married father of three . was last seen leaving a friend's house after returning from a business . trip. 'He was still . watching TV downstairs when our friend went to bed, and he was going to . be going up to bed shortly,' Lisa Smith told ABC News. He . was spotted driving away from the friend's home in Oak Park, north of . Los Angeles at around 10pm in his black Mercedes sedan. Family: Gavin Smith with his wife Lisa who is desperately searching for him since his disappearance more than a month ago . Family man: Gavin Smith (left) and wife Lisa with their three sons Dlyan, Evan and Austin . The . first alarm bells went off when he failed to pick up his youngest son . to drive him to school on Wednesday morning, and then never went to work . or call the office that same day- two things that his wife said had . never happened before in the past 21 years. Gavin Smith, 57, a top 20th Century Fox executive was spotted with a woman in California a week after he went missing . At the time, Mrs Smith was taking care of her mother who has cancer. In an interview with ABC, Mrs Smith made an impassioned plea, hoping that he may be watching. 'We want you to come home, baby, we love you! Our world is not right without you! Be safe,' she said, fighting back tears. Family . members have since been unable to 'ping' the missing man's cellphone, . which appears to be off and that his credit cards have not been used . since Tuesday night. 'We're . just doing our best to get as many people looking as possible,' his son . Evan Smith, a forward for the University of Southern California . basketball team, said in an interview. 'We're trying to find my dad. We need our father.' Athleticism runs in the family, as Mr Smith gained notoriety in Los Angeles for being a part of UCLA's 1975 national championship basketball team under legendary coach John Wooden. Evan said that friends first became concerned when his father failed to turn up at the film studio, a job he loves. 'My dad's a good guy, a very responsible man, and it all really took hold for us when he didn't show up for work,' he said. Earlier glories: In his youth, Mr Smith dabbled in acting (left) and was a member of the UCLA national championship basketball team (right) Mr Smith has worked as a film distribution executive at the Calabasas-based company for nearly 18 years. 'We are extremely worried about our friend and colleague Gavin Smith and are actively doing what we can to assist the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department in their search for him,' Chris Aronson, vice president of domestic distribution for Fox, said in a statement. Police have said that Gavin Smith, who stands tall at 6 foot 6 inches, was last seen wearing purple pants and black and gray shoes and has gray hair and has a goatee. Never giving up: Mr Smith's son Evan has made repeated pleas for his father to come home . Last seen: Mr Smith's black Mercedes was spotted driving away from Oak Park in California where he had been visiting a long-time female friend . His sons take the fact that Mr Smith was wearing one of their pairs of purple workout pants as a sign that he was clearly not planning on meeting anyone. 'That's what he was wearing, you know? It doesn't sound like he was going anywhere,' Evan said. The Sheriff's Department asks that anyone with information contact its Homicide Bureau, Missing Person's detail.","Gavin Smith, 57, disappeared along with his Mercedes E420 on May 1 .

"Unhappy: Sir Jonathan Miller says he is 'ashamed' to be helping his grandchildren through private education . Socialist Sir Jonathan Miller has admitted being 'ashamed' that he is supporting his grandchildren through private school. In a war of words with his own son William, the renowned theatre director said the decision was made to ensure they got a good education. Sir Jonathan added he was furious about 'belonging to a society which makes such as sharp distinction' between Britain's rich and poor. There was 'something deeply malignant about a structure which makes it necessary to make these invidious choices,' he said. He sent his own children to state schools but his son William called the decision a 'cavalier social experiment'. William has sent his own children into private education, which Sir Jonathan says he is contributing towards. 'I do give them a little bit just to ensure there is some sort of . security, but I feel rather ashamed of it and I feel ashamed of . belonging to a society which makes such a sharp distinction between the . prosperous and the assured, whose future is guaranteed, and those who . are not,' Sir Jonathan told the Sunday Times this week. 'It all ought to be state education. It’s part and parcel of . this profound and malignant separation of the prosperous from the poor. 'People who have huge amounts of can afford to wrap their children in . all sorts of protective educational devices which guarantee that they . will become like their parents.' Education: Sir Jonathan went to the prestigious St Paul's School and then Cambridge University, pictured . William Miller claims that he and his . two siblings would have fared better had they been sent to public . schools and Oxbridge, like their parents, but instead they were sent to . state schools to appease the couple's socialist principals. Wrong: Son of Sir Jonathan Miller, William, said his parents put him through state school as some sort of 'social experiment' 'It . turned out to be a cavalier social experiment that saw all three of his . children fail to gain a single qualification. He is right to feel . guilty: it was a wholly avoidable disaster,' he wrote in 2009. Miller grew up near London's Regent's Park where his parents' neighbours were intellectuals including Alan Bennett, George Melly, Shirley Conran and AJ Ayer. He started school at Primrose Hill state primary in 1969 and went on to Pimlico comprehensive in 1975. He says: 'If you were to ask me what I remember about learning, I think I could just about recall that the Romans long baths and hated the Scots.' But Sir Jonathan himself went to the prestigious St Paul's School in London and then on to Cambridge University. 'One wants to have freedom of choice – it is a very important thing – but there is something deeply malignant about a structure which makes it necessary to make these invidious choices to guarantee your children are enveloped in protected devices,' he said.","The theatre director went to the prestigious St Paul's School but sent his own children into state education .

"Overhaul call: BOA chairman chairman Lord Moynihan said it was 'unacceptable' that more than half of Team GB medallists at the 2008 Beijing Olympics came from private schools . The high proportion of privately-educated Team GB medallists is ‘unacceptable’, the chairman of the British Olympic Association said yesterday. Just 7 per cent of the population go to independent schools – but more than half of Britain’s golds in the 2008 Beijing Games were won by former private school pupils. So far, Team GB has nine gold medallists in the 2012 Games. Four were privately educated, and a fifth went to school in Germany. BOA chief Lord Moynihan, himself a former public schoolboy, called for an overhaul of school sport policy to provide more chances for state pupils. ‘It’s one of the worst statistics in British sport,’ he claimed. ‘It is wholly unacceptable that over 50 per cent of our medallists in Beijing came from the private sector. ‘It tells you that 50 per cent of the medals came from 7 per cent of the population. ‘There is so much talent out there in the 93 per cent that should be identified and developed. That has got to be a priority for future sports policy. ‘I have spoken about it many times and I will continue to speak about it until there is not breath left in me.’ The Conservative peer continued: ‘The balance of professional football is that around 7 per cent of players come from the private sector, which is an absolute mirror image of society. ‘That should be the case in every single sport, and that should be the priority in each and every sport, and that is something that every government should strive for.’ At the previous Olympics, a third of Team GB went to independent schools. They included multiple gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy, who attended George Watson’s College in Edinburgh, and every equestrian medallist. Non-state schools can afford to devote more time to sport. They usually have better facilities and often boast top-class coaches. Champion: Multiple gold medal cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, pictured with his wife Sarra after winning the men's team sprint yesterday, was provately educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh . Pledge: David Cameron, pictured here watching the sprint cycling at the Velodrome with Prince William, said billions would be spent on state school sport over the next five years . The discrepancy is especially noticeable in sports whose basic entry costs are high, such as equestrian events and sailing. Rowing . has already taken action to address the imbalance, with Mo Sbihi, who . won bronze in the men’s eight on Wednesday, among the beneficiaries. The . Start programme, launched more than a decade ago, has encouraged rowing . coaches to visit comprehensive schools and scout teenagers with the . necessary physique to become elite rowers. As a result, half of Team . GB’s rowers at the London Games are from state schools. When . asked if too many medals were being won by former public school pupils, . David Cameron said: ‘We need to spend on state school sport and we are . spending a billion pounds over the next five years. ‘We need to make sure people have those opportunities. Frankly, one of the best things will be the Olympics and the legacy and the inspiration for young people to take part.’ Tory MP Charlotte Leslie  said the statistics were ‘really, really worrying’. She told BBC Radio 4’s PM  programme that state schools were often reluctant to promote competition. ‘There’s a massive problem with sports and facilities in our schools, but it’s also a much deeper problem,’ she said. ‘I wonder if it’s a problem to do with culture. The reason the private sector does well in education is that it’s very unapologetic about competition – there are winners and there are losers – and this is certainly not the case for all state schools.’","Just 7% of the UK population are educated at independent institutions .

"A man whose grandfather was a Second World War soldier has hit out at his daughter's school after she was banned from wearing her poppy wristband because of health and safety fears. Maggy Lane, 13, was ordered to remove the Poppy Appeal band - a symbol of remembrance sold by the Royal British Legion - by teachers at Shepshed High School in Leicestershire. The teenager was told the wristband was forbidden because it breached the school's uniform code and it was feared the rubber bangle could get caught on something during a lesson. Outrage: Myles Lane, seen left holding his grandfather's collection of war medals, has hit out after his daughter Maggy, right, was banned from wearing a poppy wristband at school because of health and safety fears . The schoolgirl's father Myles Lane, 39, questioned why the rubber bands were banned because of the potential safety risk when students are allowed to wear poppies secured to their uniform by a pin. 'I feel quite passionate about it,' said Mr Lane, who added that his grandfather Arthur Witherbed, who died last year at the age of 90, was part of the Royal Leicester Regiment which fought in Norway in 1940. 'I have always drummed into my daughter the importance of Poppy Day and she had bought the band out of her own money. Remembrance: The schoolgirl's great-grandfather Arthur Witherbed (centre) served with the Royal Leicester Regiment in WWII . 'They told me it was a health and safety risk, but they are okay to wear a poppy with a pin on it. 'I can appreciate the school has health and safety issues with bracelets but I think they should be able to make an allowance with a poppy band,' said Mr Lane, a draughtsman. 'Perhaps they could ask students to remove them in potentially hazardous situations like for P.E. and in cookery lessons, then let them wear the bands at other times.' Mr Lane, from Shepshed, said Remembrance Day held extra significance for his family since his grandfather's death last year. When the Germans invaded Norway in 1940 Mr Witherbed escaped by walking to neighbouring Sweden. From there he made his way back to England, and he was stationed with the military police at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire. Adrian Stephenson, joint head teacher at the school, said: 'We don’t allow children to wear wrist bands at school. It is as simple as that. 'We have to stick to the uniform code,' he said. 'When governors put the dress code together, health and safety is part of the issue of wearing jewellery. 'It is important to stress we want the children to understand all about remembrance and it is a central part of what we do, but at the same time, if you want to run a good school you have a set of rules and you have to stick to them,' Mr Stephenson added. Health and safety: Maggy's school told her to remove the poppy wristband because it did not fit in with the uniform code . His co-head Stewart Goacher said the wristband was forbidden under the same rules that prevent pupils from wearing bracelets. Mr . Goacher added that the school sells lapel poppies, holds an annual . remembrance assembly and supports the charity Help for Heroes. David . Hobday, chair of the Loughborough British Legion, said: 'In theory, I . am upset because it is a promotional time particularly for us, but if it . is school policy and they have been asked to take them off then that is . the school’s prerogative.'","Maggy Lane was ordered to remove her Poppy Appeal wristband by Shepshed High School in Leicestershire .

"A young deli worker who became pregnant with her third child was allegedly told she would lose her job unless she got an abortion.

"Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to have halved his department's running costs by 2015-16 . Michael Gove will shed 1,000 jobs from the Department for Education as he tries to set an example to the rest of Whitehall. The Education Secretary has pledged to do 'more with less' by halving the £580million running costs of his department by 2016. He won the approval of Cabinet colleagues to conduct a radical 'zero base' review of his department, as though it were being set up from scratch. But his plans have drawn the ire of unions, who warned they were balloting members on the reforms. Mr Gove said poor performers will be 'speedily managed out' of their jobs and higher standards will be expected of those remaining. Many back-office roles will also go as management consultants warned their costs were too high. Work that is not a ministerial priority is also likely to stop. Children's services are likely to be hit, with resources diverted to supporting academies and free schools – which will account for one in four schools by 2015. Staff will also be forced out of their expensive Westminster headquarters, which include a 'contemplation suite' and a massage room, to a cheaper building. Real estate costs for the DfE have soared to £40million – £6million of which is spent on vacant buildings. Unions criticised the job cuts as an 'ideological attack on the civil service as a whole' and accused Mr Gove of 'playing politics' with people's livelihoods. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'Michael Gove appears to want to run his department as some kind of nightmarish Right-wing experiment, playing politics with people's livelihoods and putting at risk the very important services DfE civil servants provide to schools, teachers and the public. 'Staff in the DfE will not sit back and allow their jobs and the vital work they do supporting the education and development of our children to be used as some kind of ideological testing ground.' A review document drawn up by the department's permanent secretary, Chris Wormald, said: 'While there is no formal headcount target, this is likely to mean that by 2015 the department will have fewer than 3,000 posts, around 1,000 fewer than we have now.' Mr Wormald added: 'We will be smaller and will operate from fewer sites. We will focus on our duties to the taxpayer with renewed vigour, investing where we need to but always remembering that every pound we spend on ourselves must be justified to the citizens who pay for us.' Cost-cutting will mean leaving the ministry's HQ in Great Smith Street in Westminster . Most Whitehall departments have been . asked to save a third of their costs by Chancellor George Osborne as . part of the austerity measures to reduce the country's deficit. But Mr Gove's target was to cut . administrative costs by 42 per cent by 2015, which he has extended to a . goal of 50 per cent by 2016. Stephen Twigg, Labour's shadow . education secretary, said: 'While Labour support efficiency savings in . the civil service, this document says certain work that isn't a . ministerial priority will stop, raising the prospect that programmes and . services will be axed. Michael Gove needs to explain to parents how . this will affect them.' When Ed Balls was in charge of the department he oversaw a £3million refurbishment which included the installation of a massage room . However, the Institute for Government . think-tank said the plans were ambitious and could be a blueprint for a . department that 'people will want to work in'. Director Peter Thomas said: 'Change . on this scale is inevitably unsettling for staff, but because this . report confronts the implications of this, and the next spending review, . leaders can create greater certainty for staff that they are building a . department fit for the future. 'Importantly, this plan has learned lessons from other less successful efforts to transform departments in Whitehall.' A department spokesman said: 'The . review found that the department has committed and hard-working staff . producing high-quality work, but that we can and should work more . effectively and efficiently.'","Education Secretary wants to go further in cutting costs, with 1,000 staff out of a total of 4,000 to be axed .

"Parents have renamed a Christian primary school the 'Scrooge Academy' after it banned Christmas from the timetable. Oasis Academy has decided there will be no nativity play for its pupils because of its poor academic performance. The school in Nunsthorpe, near Grimsby, whose students are aged four to 11, says the festivities would interrupt pupil learning as it strives to improve achievements in maths and  English. Stolen Christmas: Oasis Academy has axed its nativity play because it wants children in class because it wants to improve academic performance (file picture) Parents believe the children are being deliberately punished because the move came just days after the school, prior to its academy conversion, was ranked last out of 44 in North East Lincolnshire in Department of Education Key Stage 2 rankings in Department of Education Key Stage 2 rankings. Amanda Markey, whose child attends the school, said: 'They have stolen Christmas from the children.It should be called the Scrooge Academy. Where is the fun? 'They can take children out of class for assemblies but they can't find the time to organise a play? To say they cannot have Christmas until their grades improve is really unfair. 'Surely getting the students to learn a script for a festive play would aid learning, and the performance would build confidence. How can that not be of benefit to their education? The children are really disappointed; it has really affected them. 'Why can't they have a bit of fun on the last days of school?' Helen Merriman-Sellars, 38, whose daughter Bethanie, 6, attends the school, said Christmas could have been incorporated into the children's lessons. She said: 'While I agree that the school needs to focus on education, with a bit of planning they could easily have incorporated things like a nativity into lessons. It's educational for the children to learn about things like that and it's also an important part of their childhood. 'They are not at secondary school level, they are just primary school children.There's also been a lot of bad feeling because the school left it so late in the day to tell us. If they were going to do this, they should have communicated it earlier to save as much upset.' A spokesperson from Oasis Academy Nunsthorpe said: 'The academy realises that some parents are disappointed that we're not putting on a Christmas play this year. 'This is because such plays take many weeks of rehearsal time and, given the current context at Oasis Academy Nunsthorpe with very low standards of attainment , the academy needs to prioritise and focus rigorously on raising standards in English and maths for all our students. 'To do this, our students need to focus on their school work throughout the term. However, this far from means that we're not having any other Christmas activities and celebrations at the academy and these include a visiting theatre company, special Christmas assemblies, a Christmas fair, carols around the tree and a Christmas dinner for students and their parents to attend. 'In the future, when education standards have been notably raised at the academy, there will be an opportunity to re-introduce termly music and drama productions without compromising the students' entitlement to success and progress in key areas such and reading, writing and maths.' And a spokesperson from the Oasis group, which runs the academy, said: 'There is a certain irony to the situation, in that people would think a Christian organisation would try to cancel Christmas. 'Christmas has not been cancelled and there have been other festive events put on instead of a nativity play.We understand that might upset some parents but we are trying to do what is best for the students.'","Oasis Academy staff believe weeks of rehearsals would be better used as lessons .

"A Santa Claus has been sacked from a garden centre grotto after he allegedly told children, 'I'm not real, it's your mum and dad'. The Father Christmas also told the three siblings about the US school massacre - before they burst into tears. Their mother, Wendy Kennett, said what was supposed to be a fun festive day out turned into the 'worst day of her life' as her children lost their faith in Santa. Bad Santa: Santa, pictured, told 10-year-old Ryan that Father Christmas was not real. Ryan is pictured with his sisters Amy, 7, centre, and Katie, 6, right, who were there at the time . Mrs Kennett, 33, and her . husband Steven took their children Ryan, 10, Amy, seven, and Katie, . six, to visit Santa on Saturday at  Notcutts garden centre in Nuneham Courtenay, near Abingdon, Oxon. The excited youngsters sat on Santa's knee and promised him they had been good boys and girls this year. But during their conversation the Santa started telling the schoolchildren about the US school massacre in which a gunman shot dead 20 innocent children and six adults who tried to stop him in a school in Newtown, Connecticut. He said: 'Well there are bad people in the world and bad things happen, like what happened to those children in America.' Mrs Kennett said he had just started telling the children more about what happened in the US, and assuming he was talking about the Sandy Hook school shooting, Mr Kennett interrupted. She said the Santa then asked the two girls to leave so he could 'have a word with their brother'. After whispering something to Ryan, which his parents could not hear, the 10-year-old ran out crying before telling her: 'Santa told me he is not real, it's just you and dad.' The two girls were stood next to their parents listening at the time. Mrs Kennett, who paid £5.99 per child, said: 'I was totally furious. I now had three children in tears.' A spokesman for the garden centre said the Santa was under the impression the boy was playing along for his siblings and wanted to thank him. Notcutts spokesman Jim Hawker said: 'We have accepted the customers’ version of events and have dismissed the Santa, apologised and refunded the family. Upset: Mother Wendy Kennett with her children Katie, 6, left, and Amy, 7, right, who went to visit Santa to be told he was not real . 'Clearly the family were upset and the Santa who we have had for over 10 years and never had a complaint has been dismissed and a new Santa has replaced him. 'Notcutts certainly feel this was an error of judgment on behalf of the individual.' He added the firm had also bought them tickets to Winter Wonderland in London. Mrs Kennett said she went to the manager to ask that the Santa be sacked on the spot, but he was kept on for the rest of the day. Mr Hawker added: 'There was a massive queue of children waiting to see Santa and we did not want to disappoint them.' To make matters worse, after hours of trying to restore their children's faith in Santa, Mr and Mrs Kennett took them to a restaurant in Kennington, Oxfordshire for a meal. But Mrs Kennett said a children’s . entertainer at the Tandem Hungry Horse restaurant told the children Santa did not waste his . time reading their letters.

She said when the children told the balloon artist they had written to Santa, he said: 'That was a waste of time. 'Santa is my best friend, we went skiing last weekend and he told me that he doesn’t bother reading letters because he has got better things to do.' By this point, Mrs Kennett said the children were so shaken up they did not feel like eating and the family left the restaurant and went back home to Abingdon. A spokesman for the Hungry Horse said: 'Hungry Horse is saddened and disappointed . to hear our young diners had been upset by a hired entertainer, . especially so close to Christmas.' The family were offered a complimentary meal. Mrs Kennett said the family were today trying to reignite the spark back into Christmas and had travelled to Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland for the day. Mrs Kennett said: 'The girls are really emotional - they've been all up and down since it happened. We're trying to get them excited about Christmas again.

"Education Secretary Michael Gove’s flagship free school programme was rejected as ‘problematic’ by the Catholic Church yesterday. Greg Pope, deputy director of the Catholic Education Service (CES) for England and Wales, said there was a ‘perverse disincentive’ for the church to launch free schools. Free schools are state schools  set up by parents, teachers, charities, faith groups and other organisations. Rejected: The flagship free school programme of Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured left, was called 'problematic' by the Catholic Education Service deputy director Greg Pope, right . A Department for Education document for . groups applying to open free schools with a religious character says . that admission on the basis of faith must be limited to 50 per cent of . the yearly intake when oversubscribed. Mr Pope said this 50 per cent issue ‘works against there being a huge number of Catholic free schools’. At the moment there is only one Catholic free school, St Michael’s Catholic School in Truro, Cornwall. Mr Pope said: ‘When I discussed this with the Secretary of State earlier in the summer, the point I made to Mr Gove was we would be unlikely to open a new school unless there was demand for a new school. ‘If there was demand for a new 1,000-pupil Catholic school, why would we open a free school if we had to turn away pupils on the grounds that they are Catholic while accepting others on the grounds that they are not Catholic? That’s a perverse disincentive to me.’ Mr Pope said he was not against the idea of free schools and it was an option they would explore further if this ‘barrier’ was not in the way. He said the Catholic Church does have the option of opening up voluntary aided (VA) schools – state schools run by a foundation or trust, quite often a faith group. But if they wanted a new school to be an academy – which has more freedom than local council-run schools – they would have to open a VA school and convert. His comments came as the CES published its annual census looking at the make-up of its schools. It found that 70.4 per cent of pupils at Catholic schools in England and Wales belong to the Catholic faith, along with 55 per cent of teachers. It also found that some 33.5 per cent of pupils at Catholic primary schools are from an ethnic minority, along with 28.7 per cent of those at Catholic secondary schools.","The Catholic Education Service for England and Wales said there was no incentive for church to start up free schools .

"Riches: The Vatican, headed by Pope Benedict XVI, controls a property portfolio worth £570 million, including several expensive properties in London . The Catholic Church owns a number of luxurious London properties as part of a property empire originally funded by fascist dictator Mussolini, it has been claimed. The Vatican has used an offshore company structure to build up its portfolio of expensive properties now worth around £560 million. Investment in international property was initiated by the church when Mussolini afforded it a huge windfall in 1929 in return for papal recognition of his fascist regime. Included in the Church's London-based portfolio is 30 St. James's Square, which was purchased for £15 million in 2006 and houses investment bank Altium Capitol. The portfolio also includes the premises of upmarket jewellers Bulgari in New Bond Street. Also included in the valuable collection are properties in Coventry, Paris and Switzerland. The St. James's Square block was bought by the company British Grolux Investments Ltd, according to a report in the Guardian. The company's true ownership is not disclosed in records at Company's House, but Reading-based accountant John Jenkins, who is the company's secretary, said that it was owned by a trust. Mr Jenkins however said that he was not 'authorised' by his client to provide further information. British Grolux Investments Ltd's two nominee shareholders are listed as John Varley, former chief executive of Barclays Bank and Robin Herbert, another prominent Catholic banker. Luxury: The Vatican's portfolio includes 169 New Bond Street, a building that houses luxury jeweller Bulgari . Block: 30 St. James's Square, seen on the left of this block, is also within the portfolio. The property, which houses investment bank Altium Capital, was bought by the church for £15 million in 2006 . According to the report, British Grolux Investments inherited the property portfolio from two corporate predecessors, British Grolux Ltd and Cheylesmore Estates, after a company reorganisation in 1999. Shares in these companies were traced to a Swiss company known as Profima SA, the Vatican's own holding company. Historic files form Britain's Ministry of Economic Warfare confirmed the company's attachment to the Vatican, accusing it of 'engaging in activities contrary to Allied interests' during the Second World War. Windfall: Italian dictator Benito Mussolini gifted the Catholic Church a huge windfall in 1929 for papal recognition of his fascist regime. The money was then used to secure property across Europe . The British previously considered blacklisting the company at the end of World War II and described Bernardino Nogaro, the Pope's financier, as engaging in 'shady activities'. Nogaro was accused by officials of trying to transfer shares from two Vatican-owned properties in France to the Swiss company, as well as earlier trying to move Italian bank shares to Profima SA. Records from 1932 reportedly show that Nogaro founded an offshore company to hold assets that he was buying. According to one expert, the Mussolini investment was crucial to the Church. Cambridge historian John Pollard said: 'The papacy was now financially secure. It would never be poor again.' A Council of Europe report analysing the Vatican's financial controls last year found that Paolo Mennini, a papal official, controls a special unit, the APSA, which oversees assets exceeding £570 million. The Vatican's London representative, archbishop Antonio Mennini, refused to comment. The Catholic Church owns approximately 1,100 properties in total, including shopping centres and residential properties, worth around nine billion Euros. Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti is planning to demand that the Vatican pays taxes on non-religious properties this year, saying the rules will comply with European law. Currently, church-owned properties are exempt from tax if any part of the building is used for non-commercial purposes, such as the inclusion of a small chapel. Some 130,000 people signed an online petition for the church's exemption status to be overturned. The annual cost could of the additional tax could be to 720 million euros (£598m), according to municipal government bodies. Tax: Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said that the Catholic Church will be forced to pay tax on non-religious buildings in the country this year, potentially raising £598 million in additional tax . In 2010 the EU opened an investigation into whether tax breaks enjoyed by some Church properties in Italy could be classed as illegal state aid. Moneyval, the Council of Europe’s monitoring body for money laundering and terrorism financing, said last year that the Vatican is making progress in complying with international standards on financial transparency. But the body, whose recommendations are used to decide whether a nation should be included on the white list of countries complying with international standards on financial transparency, said the vatican needs to do done . The report recommended that the Vatican bank IOR should be independently supervised. The IOR has been at the center of several financial scandals in recent years. Paolo Cipriani, director general of the bank, and its former head, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, were placed under investigation by Italian prosecutors in 2010 for allegedly omitting data in wire transfers from an Italian account. Prosecutors seized 23 million euros from a Rome bank account registered to the IOR amid suspicion of money-laundering violations, as part of the probe. The Italian investigation triggered calls to bring the city-state in line with European Union financial rules and become more transparent.","Vatican paid £15 million for one St. James's Square property in 2006 .

When a beam crosses between the two materials the wavelength of the light changes. As light is made up of several colors, when it is refracted these colors can bend at different amounts and become individually visible. The Pink Floyd cover shows a triangular glass prism with a beam of light moving through the two sides causing the different colors to bend and break out in a rainbow. Water in the air acts as tiny prisms so when light enters the raindrop, it reflects off the sides of the drop and is broken into a spectrum. Another example of refraction would be a drinking . straw in glass of water. When viewed from the side the straw appears to . be broken at the point it enters the water due to the difference in the . densities of water and air. The stunning illusions are created when a low sun shines behind someone looking down into fog from a ridge. The heads of the figures are often surrounded by rings of coloured light, an effect caused by the diffraction of visible light. To add to the frightening effect, the ghostly figures can sometimes appear to move, often very suddenly, due to the drifting of the clouds. Photographer Mikhail, 61, a university chemistry lecturer, trekked up to 1,200 metres above the cloud levels to get a glimpse of the phenomenon. He said: 'I love being out taking pictures and even when it gets down to . some freezing temperatures around -15 degrees I'm still out climbing the . mountains looking for the perfect image. 'As . a scientist, I know the physics behind why this shape happens but . because that day I saw this a few times it was as if I was being chased . by a ghost. 'The beginning of the day was so cloudy that I just presumed that I wouldn't be able to capture anything. 'We . were tempted to turn back at 900 metres because it was so cloudy but . I'm really glad we persevered and carried on heading up as at around . 1,200 metres the fog started to clear otherwise I'd never have been able . to see this.' The Brocken spectre got its name because of early sightings on the Brocken, the highest peak of Germany's Harz Mountains. It . can appear on any misty mountainside or cloud bank, or even on some . occasions, from an aeroplane so long as the conditions are right. Although it may look like the arrival of a spook this is in fact an example of the Brocken Spectre phenomenon . The extraordinary sight is created by the light behind a climber casting their shadow often in an odd triangular shape . The heads of the figures are often surrounded by rings of coloured light, an effect caused by the diffraction of visible light . Amazingly, . the ghostly figures can sometimes appear to move rapidly when the cloud . layer moves or there are variations in its density. German . scientist Johann Silberschlag first observed the phenomenon in 1780 but . since then they have been seen and recorded many times in the region. The extraordinary sight involves the light behind a climber casting their shadow often in an odd triangular shape. The shadow can also fall on water droplets of varying differences from the observer's eye causing confused depth perception. The clever illusions are created when low sun shines behind someone looking down into fog from a ridge . Photographer Mikhail Baevsky was part of a trekking group who were left stunned when they came across the unusual spectacle at Chatyr- Dag mountain region, in Crimea, Southern Ukraine . Among . mountain climbers though there is a superstition that whoever sees a . Brocken Spectre will die in the mountains the very next day. The team also headed up Angar-Buran and Eklizi-Burun mountains in search of a sighting. The region is famous for the stunning landscapes and breath-taking wonders which attract people from all over the world.","Brocken Spectre is actually a person's shadow cast onto low-lying clouds .

"One in four adults has the maths skills of a nine-year-old or worse and struggles with the most basic everyday sums. According to a shock report, more than eight million adults in England are considered to lack even basic numeracy. The figures in the Skills For Life survey reveal that this quarter of the population has difficulty in understanding price labels and the sums involved in paying household bills. One in four adults has the maths skills of a nine-year-old or worse and struggles with the most basic sums . Their abilities are on a par with those expected of pupils at primary school aged between seven to nine. In an even more disturbing development, the number of adults in this group is nearly a million more than it was a decade ago. This is despite a stream of costly initiatives in recent years designed to improve adult numeracy. A further nine million adults have the maths skills expected of a child aged nine to 11. Those in this group are likely to struggle in calculating change, using train timetables or working out deductions on their pay slip. The Skills For Life survey revealed that altogether 49 per cent of working-age adults in England – about 17million in total – have the maths skills of a child at primary school. Numbers had risen from 15million in 2003, when a similar survey was conducted. The report also revealed that fewer than one in five 16 to 18-year-olds can demonstrate skills equivalent to a grade A* to C pass in maths at GCSE. This is despite the A* to C pass rate for the GCSE exam now being 60 per cent. Chris Humphries, chairman of the charity National Numeracy, said: ‘This discrepancy is both puzzling and worrying for everyone involved in education and merits further investigation. ‘Too many adults are struggling with everyday maths.’ The survey, which questioned 7,200 people aged 16 to 65, also revealed that more than five million adults – 15 per cent of the working population – struggle with simple reading and writing. The Department for Business, which released the 400-page report, admitted that English and maths skills had ‘a long way to go’. Ministers said improving basic skills was vital to a ‘thriving economy’. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said maths and English are vital for getting a job and playing a 'full part in society' Labour launched a major campaign in 2000 to boost the basic skills of adults but it is said to have mainly benefited literacy, where performance has improved since 2003. Ministers said that tough new English Baccalaureate Certificates to replace GCSEs from 2017 in core subjects would help to boost standards in both English and maths. From September of next year, new study programmes will require pupils to keep working towards GCSEs in maths and English if they failed to achieve them by the age of 16. Free maths and English GCSE courses are now available for adults, and other qualifications for those with lower skills levels. The survey, which questioned adults for whom English is their first language, found that literacy skills were worst in London and the North-East. Numeracy skills were worst in the North-East, followed by London and the East Midlands. Skills minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘Good English and maths are vital for getting a job and playing a full part in society. ‘We have doubled the funding for adult English and maths because they are so important. ‘I would urge anyone who is struggling to take advantage of the provision that is on offer, which now includes maths and English GCSEs for adults who missed out the first time round. ‘These essential skills are the building blocks of a productive society and a thriving economy. I am determined that everyone should have the chance to achieve their very best.’","Quarter of the population has difficulty understanding price labels and household bills .

"A multi-million-pound scheme to increase massively the number  of elite teachers parachuted into Britain’s toughest schools will be announced by the Government tomorrow. The funding will help train 2,000 top graduates a year to teach in schools in inner cities and other deprived parts of the country. The money, to be unveiled by Education Secretary Michael Gove, is the latest tranche granted by the Government to the charity Teach First, which was set up to woo high-flyers to swap lucrative City jobs for the classroom. Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured, will unveil the new funding on Monday to train 2,000 top graduates . The Government said tens of thousands of children from disadvantaged backgrounds would benefit because the charity operates only in schools where at least half the pupils come from the poorest third of families in England. Mr Gove said: ‘The quality of teachers has a greater influence on children’s achievement than any other aspect of their education. Every pupil, regardless of their background, deserves high-quality teaching in order to succeed in life. Teach First helps get some of our brightest graduates into some of our most challenging classrooms. We are committed to supporting the charity in its efforts to reach more schools.’ Founded by former City business consultant Brett Wigdortz in 2002, Teach First takes on only high-calibre graduates who have a  2:1 degree or above and trainees must go through a rigorous assessment process and intensive two-year training programme. The government said that tens of thousands of children from disadvantaged backgrounds would benefit from the latest tranche of funding, which was granted to the charity Teach First . Teach First is already the biggest recruiter from Oxford University, pictured, and Cambridge University . So selective is the screening that many of the would-be teachers  are weeded out and Teach First approves only about 12 per cent of applicants. The organisation already takes on more than 1,000 graduates a year who want to avoid the traditional teacher-training path, and the new money, expected to be about £7 million, will almost double the numbers. Already the biggest recruiter from Oxford and Cambridge, the charity will next year become Britain’s biggest graduate recruitment organisation. Trainees are required to stay in the classroom for only two years, and many sign up to hone skills, such as communication, that they believe will serve them well in future careers. But more than half stay in teaching and the most inspirational are fast-tracked into senior roles. Mr Wigdortz welcomed the new Government funding and said: ‘This support is vital to help us achieve our ambitious aim to ensure that no child’s educational success is limited by their socio-economic background.’ The charity already has more than 1,000 graduates a year who want to avoid the traditional teacher-training route . Though it began in London and spread to other cities, including Manchester, the charity is now expanding into coastal and rural schools suffering from disadvantages. The new grant, which takes Government support for Teach First to nearly £40 million, is part of Mr Gove’s plans to boost  education standards by attracting the brightest students into teaching. In addition to the Teach First scheme, graduates with first-class degrees who specialise in subjects in which there is a shortage of teachers, such as maths and science, can be given financial incentives of up to £20,000 to train on conventional courses, and former soldiers are also being encouraged to sign up. Meanwhile, the Government has said it will no longer fund the training of graduates who have obtained only a third-class degree. New figures show that more than seven out of ten new trainees now have at least a 2:1 – the highest proportion ever recorded. The figures also show the quality of trainee teachers has improved in the core subjects where there have traditionally been shortages, including maths, physics, chemistry and modern foreign languages.","New funding will be unveiled by Education Secretary Michael Gove on Monday to help train up top graduates for the classroom .

"Faith minister Baroness Warsi warned that the 'underlying, unfounded mistrust' of Muslims is fuelling extremism . Fewer than one in four British voters believes Islam is compatible with the British way of life, the UK's first Muslim woman Cabinet Minister reveals today. Baroness Warsi will quote private police figures which show that more than half of race hate attacks in Britain are against Muslims as she condemns critics of Islam for peddling 'hate'. Lady Warsi sparked huge controversy two years ago when she said Britain's approach to Muslims has made Islamophobia acceptable at middle class dinner parties. But in a new speech today she accuses critics of Islam of being 'un-British' themselves by grouping ordinary Muslims with extremists. The Minister for Faith and Communities reveals stark polling conducted by YouGov which found that just 24 per cent of voters think Islam is compatible with being British, while more than half disagree. Only 23 per cent say Islam is not a threat to Western civilisation. An unrepentant Lady Warsi, whose parents emigrated from Pakistan, said that she was right to speak out before and will use the new evidence to warn that the 'underlying, unfounded mistrust' of Muslims is fuelling extremism. In her speech to a group called Measuring Anti-Muslim Attacks, which monitors violence against Muslims, Lady Warsi condemned politicians and the media for failing to do enough to combat negative views of Muslims. 'When I said that Islamophobia had ""passed the dinner table test"", I meant anti-Muslim sentiment had become so socially acceptable, it could be found even in the most civilised of settings. 'I got a fair amount of stick for making that statement. There were those who denied the problem existed. There were those who said talking about it was dangerous. 'But let me tell you what's really dangerous. It's when people are treated differently because they hold a different religious belief. It's when a country turns a blind eye towards that discrimination. 'And it's when we allow a perception of a people to become so entrenched that extremists are able to capitalise on it. Because any form of prejudice, bigotry or discrimination is wrong. It's unBritish.' Lady Warsi will quote new figures from the Association of Chief Police Officers showing that between 50 to 60 per cent of all religious hate crimes reported to police are now against Muslims. The police have never previously broken down hate crimes by individual religions. And she will reveal the polling information for the first time to back up her case. It was commissioned by Dr Matthew Goodwin of Nottingham University - an expert in extremism. Two years ago Lady Warsi was condemned for dismissing what many people saw as legitimate criticism of Islamist extremism . Two years ago Lady Warsi was condemned for dismissing what many people saw as legitimate criticism of Islamist extremism. But she will said that it is her critics, not her, who are to blame for boosting extremists. 'My fear is that seeing one community as the ""other"" is a slippery slope that will enable extremists to advance their twisted interests unchecked,' she said. 'I don't have to remind anyone what happens when an unfounded suspicion of one people can escalate into unspeakable horror.' Baroness Warsi said more should be done to promote Muslim role models such as Olympic hero Mo Farah. 'To those who say that there is a conflict of being loyal to Britain and a Muslim, you have to look no further than Mohamed Farah,' she said. 'Our national hero is a practising Muslim. The double gold medallist saw no conflict between crossing the finish line in the Union Flag and dropping to the ground in prayer. In fact, he showed how seamlessly religion and patriotism can go together.' She will conclude by condemning those who say Muslims are unpatriotic, citing research among Muslims that showed 83 per were proud to be British, compared to 79 per cent of Britons overall. And she said that both her grandfathers fought for Britain during the Second World War. 'I will not take lessons on loyalty from those on the extreme right who demonstrate the ideology of intolerance - the very fascism that my grandparents fought all those years ago.'","Baroness Warsi accuses critics of Islam of being 'un-British'

"Clueless teenagers believe Delia Smith, Jerry Hall and Camilla Duchess of Cornwall were among Henry VIII's wives, new research has revealed. The shocking lack of knowledge emerged in a study carried out among 2,000 11 to 16 year olds, which also found many are unaware of the Gunpowder Plot or which countries were involved in WWII. Other clangers included thinking TV builder Nick Knowles built the pyramids and William Shakespeare was the chairman of the BBC. Bizarre: Teenagers surveyed thought television chef Delia Smith, left, was one of the six wives of Tudor monarch Henry VIII, right . The survey by hotel chain Premier Inn also found one in ten thought Arsenal's Emirates stadium was built before the likes of Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral. Students surveyed offered incorrect answers to history questions that ranged from the bizarre to the ridiculous: . Q. Who built the pyramids? A. Nick Knowles . Q. Who was Anne Frank? A. An American chat show host . Q. Who was Emmeline Pankhurst? A. An X Factor finalist . Q. Name a World War II prime minister . A. Alan Sugar . Q. Name one of Henry VIII's six wives . A. Delia Smith . And even more alarmingly, Bruce Forsyth, Rod Stewart and Alan Sugar were all named as Second World War Prime Ministers. A spokesman for Premier Inn said: 'We are a bit surprised by the fact youngsters don't know their Shakespeare from Sir Alan or where many of the major historical events took place in the UK. 'However it's something that can be rectified by visiting all the fantastic landmarks and places of interest the UK has to offer. 'A third of the school kids questioned said they love learning about history in school and with so much culture on our doorstep it's important to get kids out and about to experience things first hand. 'It's not surprising with families under financial pressure that days out and trips away may have suffered.' The study showed some teenagers thought Anne Frank was an American chat show host, while others and identified the plague, which killed tens of thousands of people in 1665, as a heavy metal band. When asked to explain who Suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst was, teenagers polled gave answers including the founder of the Body Shop, an X factor finalist and the owner of high street fashion chain Miss Selfridge. The poll also touched on aspects of geography and teenagers didn't fare any better - a third did not know that the city of London was in the South-East. And a quarter didn't realise Arsenal was a London football club. Fortunately 91 per cent were aware that last year's Olympics were held in the capital, although a confused one in twenty thought Paris were the hosts. Blunders: School pupils also named Jerry Hall, left, as a former wife of Henry VIII, while others thought Lord Sugar, right, was a Prime Minister during the Second World War .

"A Wisconsin woman recently convicted of killing her daughter more than 50 years ago is an ‘evil monster’ who deserves to die in prison, said her adult son, who claims he suffered years of horrific abuse at his mother's hands. Ruby C. Klokow, 76, of Sheboygan, pleaded no contest in February to second-degree murder in the 1957 death of her 6-month-old daughter, Jeaneen. But as part of a plea agreement, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence of 45 days in jail and 10 years' probation, citing her age and medical issues. Scroll down to watch interview . Brother's heartbreak: James Klokow Jr. (left) says he wants his mother, Ruby Klokow (right) sentenced to 20 years for the killing of his toddler sister . Emotional: Mr Klokow wept as he talked about the slaying of his sister, calling their mother an 'evil monster' for harming a defenseless child . That's unacceptable, said her son, James Klokow Jr. He wants his mother sentenced to 20 years, certain that she won't live long enough to serve the entire term. ‘Anybody that kills a little child that can't defend themselves is an evil monster and don't deserve to have freedom,’ the 57-year-old told The Associated Press on Monday, a few hours before his mother was originally scheduled to be sentenced. The sentencing hearing was later delayed to May 1. A message left with her attorney was not immediately returned. Ruby Klokow initially told investigators Jeaneen had rolled off a couch and bumped her head, and investigators ruled the baby's death an accident. But the case was reopened in 2008, after James Klokow reported stories of abuse. After a lengthy investigation, Ruby Klokow eventually conceded she may have roughly thrown the baby on the couch, causing her to bounce to the floor. ‘I think she didn't want us to be born,’ James Klokow said. Ruby Klokow's criminal case has been delayed several times since she was charged in 2011. Her mental health status was in question, but a judge ultimately decided she was competent to assist in her defense. The baby's death forever haunted James Klokow. He said his mother blamed him, telling him it was his misbehavior that distracted her and led to Jeaneen's death. He also told police that his mother regularly beat him, and that she had choked him and broke his arm and nose. He also described his mother covering the head of his mentally challenged younger brother and striking the wailing boy's toes one by one with a hammer. Angel: When 6-month-old Jeaneen Klowkow died in 1957, her mother told police that the baby had fallen off a sofa; an autopsy found the baby had suffered two brain hemorrhages and a partially collapsed lung . ‘Before I went to junior high school my mom would grab me by the neck, bounce my head ... off the wall, punched me as hard as she could with her fist in the stomach,’ he said. ‘She would take her fist and hit my across the ears. ... Believe me, I was hurting so bad that when I went to school, all I would do is stare.’ District attorney Joe DeCecco acknowledged that a 45-day sentence was light but said the plea agreement was in the best interest of the state. He said it would have been difficult to convince a jury that the grandmotherly woman before them was once a very angry young woman who didn't want to be a mother and who lied to police. Besides Jeaneen and James, Klokow had another child, Scott, who died as a baby. His body was disinterred as police investigated but his death could not be considered suspicious, DeCecco said . Mrs Klokow was charged with second-degree murder in the 1957 death of her 6-month-old daughter, Jeaneen, only after her son came forward in 2008 with horrific stories of childhood abuse. District Attorney De Cecco cited Klokow's advanced age and health as factors in the plea agreement approved by Sheboygan County District Judge Angela Sutkiewicz. De Cecco said if Klokow had been tried, she might have been acquitted altogether and walked free. A jury could no longer have convicted her of a lesser charge, such as manslaughter, because of the statute of limitations. No charges were filed after Jeaneen's . death in 1957. Ruby Klokow told the police that the baby had fallen off . a sofa while she was tending to a crying James. An autopsy found that Jeaneen had suffered two brain hemorrhages, a partially collapsed lung and three scalp bruises. Bargain: Ruby Klokow, left, leaves court with attorney Kirk Obear on Monday following a hearing in which she pleaded no contest to second-degree murder as part of a plea deal reached with prosecutors . Plea: Klokow's attorney, Kirk Obear, said he thought the case against  was unfair. 'There were witnesses that could have been interviewed that have long since died,' he said . At a preliminary hearing five decades . later, a forensic pathologist who reviewed documents in the case . testified that the severity of the injuries didn't match Klokow's . explanation. According to a criminal complaint, Klokow admitted causing her daughter's death. Klokow had been free pending trial and . will remain free until formal sentencing April 15. After the plea . hearing, she told reporters, 'It's not over until it's over.' Her attorney, Kirk Obear, said he . thought the case against Klokow was unfair. 'There were witnesses that . could have been interviewed that have long since died,' he said. Scott . Klokow, another of Ruby Klokow's children, was found dead in his crib . seven years after Jeaneen died. No charges have been filed in his death. Obear . noted that Jeaneen and Scott were exhumed but that nothing was . discovered at odds with the initial accidental death rulings. DeCecco's . announcement last week of a plea agreement came as a relief to James . Klokow, now 57. He said he had feared his mother 'turning and . questioning (him) on the stand.' Horror stories: James Klokow came forward in 2008, revealing how his mother regularly beat and choked him, punched him and broke his arm and nose . In an interview with The Associated Press, he said his mother had regularly beaten and choked him. The . case was delayed several times after Klokow was charged in 2011, . including for mental tests to see if she was competent to stand trial. Klokow . was arrested at her home in February 2011 following a two-year . investigation that uncovered a catalog of abuse suffered by her other . children. In 2009, Klokow's son James went to . police with his long-held suspicion that his mother had killed Jeaneen . at their home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He . said the family had suffered years of abuse when their mother had been . drinking and believed his sister's death wasn't accidental. Police reviewed their decades-old reports and searched for hospital and social service records as part of their investigation. Infant grave: Klokow told detectives she grabbed the 6-month-old child and threw her toward the couch. The baby, she said, let out a 'different kind of cry' and her eyes looked strange, according to a criminal complaint . The . body of the newborn was also exhumed and a new examination ordered. Another of her children, Scott, who died in 1964, was also exhumed and . examined for abuse. Two . pathologists who reviewed the autopsy results agreed that Klokow's claim . of a 16-inch fall from a sofa could hardly have caused the girl's . injuries. After Klokow was interviewed by detectives she admitted she had been 'mean' to her daughter and her son Scott. According to a criminal complaint Klokow admitted she was frustrated that both Jeaneen and James  were crying at the same time. She told detectives she grabbed .

"France plunged back into recession last night exactly a year after Francois Hollande took office, piling more misery on the beleaguered socialist president. Figures showed the single currency’s second largest economy shrank by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year. As it shrank by the same amount in the final three months of 2012, it means France has experienced a double-dip recession – after the economy contracted in 2009 when the banking crisis sparked the deepest global slump since the Second World War. The most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic: France has fallen into recession on the year anniversary of Francois Hollande, pictured with his partner Valerie Trierweiler, coming to power . A new damning book highlights the privileged background of Francois Hollande, pictured celebrating with his companion Valerie Trierweiler (who graduated from Pantheon-Sorbonne listed by The Times as one of the top 100 universities for its reputation) - after winning the presidential second round . It means that nine of the 17 eurozone countries are now in recession. Mr Hollande is the most unpopular . president in French history, according to opinion polls. He has often . been criticised for his handling of the economy, ridiculed for . attempting and failing to introduce a 75 per cent tax on the wealthiest, . and lampooned for his personal life and his relationship with partner . Valerie Trierweiler. Under the tenure of the tax-and-spend . Left-winger, the country has seen unemployment soar and business . confidence drop. Unemployment in France has reached 3.22 million, or . 10.6 per cent, the worst since 1997. Youth unemployment is  25.4 per . cent. Under Mr Hollande, the French economy . has failed to grow at all. In contrast, the UK avoided re-entering . recession – two consecutive quarters of decline. Our economy grew by 0.3 . per cent between January and March.

Manuel Barroso urged Mr Hollande to proceed faster with economic reforms . in return for being granted two more years to bring its budget deficit . below the EU limit. France had to make up for 20 years of lost competitiveness and reduce ‘the exorbitant weight of debt’ on its economy, he said. French finance minister Pierre . Moscovici blamed the decline on the moribund economies of the countries . around it. He said: ‘We are in Europe, the eurozone countries are our . main clients and our main suppliers, and when the environment around us . is depressed, well, that’s the main factor in the slowing of the French . economy.’ Breaking the mold: Former French Justice Minister Rachida Dati rose to high government from relatively humble origins as the second of 12 children born to a Moroccan father and an Algerian mother .

"Comes after after investigation in Shanghai, Changsha,  Zhengzhou . Britain's biggest drug firm was at the centre of a major corruption investigation in China yesterday amid allegations hospitals and doctors were given cash and free travel to boost sales and prices. Executives of GlaxoSmithKline in China have confessed to charges of bribery and tax law violations, the country’s security ministry said. Bribes are also alleged to have been offered to Chinese government officials and medical associations. An unnamed British executive is said to be among those being questioned as part of the wide ranging inquiry. Executives at pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline in China have confessed to charges of bribery and tax law violations . ‘The case involves many people, the . duration of time is long, the amount of money involved is huge and the . criminal activities are malicious,’ the Chinese ministry of public . security said. Officials said the investigation was being conducted by . police in three of the country’s biggest cities – Changsha, Shanghai and . Zhengzhou – but did not give details on the number of executives . questioned, their identities or when the questioning took place. Employees are accused of paying ‘large bribes’ laundered through travel . agencies to doctors, hospitals and others ‘to open new sales channels . and increase drug revenues,’ the ministry added. A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed it was providing consular . assistance to a Briton, adding: ‘We are in contact with GlaxoSmithKline . and we are in the process of seeking further information from the . Chinese authorities.’ Among the treatments said to be under investigation in China is the . prescribing of Botox, which the drug maker sells in the country under an . agreement with the patent-holder, Allergan. The company is responsible . for therapeutic sales of Botox in China – to treat facial spasms – . rather than its use as a cosmetic treatment to remove wrinkles. The British pharmaceuticals giant is also suspected of using fake . receipts in breach of Chinese tax laws, according to the ministry. Employees are accused of paying 'large bribes' laundered through travel agencies to doctors, hospitals and others 'to open new sales channels and increase drug revenues,' according to china's police ministry . GlaxoSmithKline, which employs 5,000 people in China, insisted it had . found no evidence of bribery or corruption there. ‘We are willing to . co-operate with the authorities in this inquiry,’ the company said in a . statement, adding that it had only just received official word of the . ‘specific nature’ of the investigation. ‘We take all allegations of bribery and corruption seriously,’ the statement said. ‘We continuously monitor our businesses to ensure they meet our strict . compliance procedures – we have done this in China and found no evidence . of bribery or corruption of doctors or government officials. However, . if evidence of such activity is provided, we will act swiftly on it.’ Police in the central city of Changsha announced two weeks ago that . company employees had been detained for questioning about unspecified . ‘economic crimes’. GlaxoSmithKline said in June that it had investigated an accusation that . its salespeople in China bribed doctors and found no evidence of . wrongdoing. The company has said the police investigation might be based . on information from the same anonymous source. GlaxoSmithKline is headquartered in Britain but has a presence in the . United States, which could make it liable to penalties under US . anti-bribery laws. This is not the first time that its executives have been linked to accusations of bribery.

"George Osborne today ordered the massive expansion of controversial shale gas exploration in Britain – known as fracking – despite fears it could cause earthquakes and contaminate water. To the fury of environmentalists, the Chancellor wants to encourage more companies to use the technique, which involves creating explosions deep underground to release valuable gas. Mr Osborne unveiled his 'generous new tax regime' in the Autumn Statement this afternoon to encourage fracking exploration and unlock shale gas reserves that could be worth £1.5trillion to Britain's economy. The UK's only fracking operation in Blackpool caused two tremors from its drilling last year and is waiting to hear if it can start again. Controversial: Drilling in the Blackpool area last year caused a small earthquake but the Government wants to expand the use of fracking in Britain . Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of injecting liquid . deep underground to fracture shale rock and release gas contained in it. The Government is consulting on tax breaks for the unconventional fossil fuel extraction, which has been widely exploited in the US, leading to falling gas prices. But there are also fears that widespread use of shale gas wells will harm the look of the UK countryside, damage tourism and reduce house prices. Opposition to fracking is intensifying in Britain as the jury is still out on whether the controversial gas extraction process will poison drinking water and cause major environmental damage. In Blackpool last year, fracking was found to be the 'highly probable' cause of earth tremors. One tremor of magnitude 2.3 on the Richter scale hit the area on April 1 followed by a second of magnitude 1.4 on May 27, prompting locals and environmental campaigners to blame the fracking technique being used locally by oil and gas firm Cuadrilla. Energy companies have said the process is safe but environment groups warn it could pose human health risks. Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla, has said the process does not pose a threat to UK groundwater. But horror stories have emerged from the US, where fracking is common, including reports of tap water igniting when a match is lit and claims of contaminated water making people ill. Such concerns have led to bans or moratoria on fracking in some places. France has banned fracking from shale rock and New York state has introduced a moratorium. Environmental groups in the UK have been calling for a moratorium at least until environmental and safety impacts have been addressed. In Australia, ground water and soil contamination fears have led farmers and green groups to form an unlikely alliance against fracking. Concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to Bath’s world-famous hot springs. Bath and North East Somerset Council said in September that two resource companies have applied for planning permission to test- drill for gas but the council fears that, if allowed to go ahead, it could harm the springs. Despite this the Chancellor today told MPs: 'We must ensure we make the best use of lower cost gas power, including new sources of gas under the land. 'We don’t want British families and businesses to be left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic. 'We are consulting on new tax incentives for shale gas and announcing the creation of a single office so that regulation is safe but simple.' The Chancellor is desperate to boost domestic gas exploration as a way of reducing Britain’s dependence on foreign gas supplies. The sharp decline in North Sea gas finds makes Britain more reliant on energy supplies from Qatar, Russia and the US. But . environmentalists attacked the move for undermining investment and jobs . which could be created in clean technology, as well as pushing up . energy costs for consumers as the UK would remain tied to increasingly . expensive fossil fuels. The . Office for Unconventional Gas and Oil will join up responsibilities . across government departments to provide a single point of contact for . investors and streamline the regulatory process. Even if ten per cent of the gas in unpopulated areas is extracted, it would still be worth £150billion. Nick Molho, head of energy policy at . WWF-UK, said: 'The UK’s over-reliance on gas is, environmentally and . economically, highly risky. Greenpeace . political director Joss Garman said: 'The Chancellor is misleading . people to position shale gas as the answer to UK’s energy woes.' The . consultation on tax breaks for shale gas in the UK was welcomed by . Cuadrilla, the company seeking to exploit shale resources near Blackpool . whose work was suspended last year after fracking triggered two tremors . in the area. The . Department of Energy and Climate Change is due to make an announcement . next week on whether Cuadrilla’s operations can restart. The company . wants to drill, fracture and test a small of wells in 2013. Francis . Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, said: 'Exploration is necessary to . have a better understanding about how shale gas can be developed safely . and sensibly from the Bowland Basin. 'Costs in a technology industry such as ours will be higher at the outset, but will reduce over time as the industry grows.' Anger: A demonstrator wears a George Osborne mask as part of protests against fracking but the Chancellor is offering huge incentives for companies to use the technique in Britain . But environmentalists have pledged to fight it. Marion Seed from Central Lancashire Friends of the Earth, said: 'Local . people are extremely alarmed by George Osborne’s fracking plans - they . could pollute our clean water and air, threaten house prices and destroy . our vital farming and tourism sectors. 'We will fight any plans that could turn a beautiful part of the Lancashire countryside into a wasteland.' Anger: Demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the Houses of Parliament .","Companies offered huge tax breaks to mine Britain's underground gasfields .

"The first anniversary of the bloody Marikana mine massacre was marked today by the victims' families as a police officer involved in shootings admitted he had no regrets about the killings. Police opened fire on thousands of strikers at platinum producer Lonmin's mine northwest of Johannesburg, killing 34 and injuring 78 people. The August shooting was described as the worst police brutality since the end of apartheid two decades ago. Scroll down for video . Painful memories: Mine workers sit on a hill where a year ago, police opened fire on fellow workers killing 34 and injuring 78, during a memorial service . Horrifying: The killings happened after days of clashes with mine security and police. The miners were demanding better salaries, working, housing and living conditions . Commemorations: Miners gesture as they pray during the one-year anniversary commemorations . A policeman who took part in the killings insisted he did not do anything wrong. The officer who did not want his identity to be revealed for fear of reprisals told Sky News: 'What we did was not wrong,' he said. 'We . were protecting our lives and we were trying to effect arrest because . those people were illegally gathered and they were instructed to get . away, go to their homes. 'I . am not feeling sorry for what I did but I feel sorry for those people . who passed away. My overall feeling is that I think we were right . because these people, they were dangerous, also to our lives.' South Africa's ANC government pulled . out at the last minute from the memorial ceremony marking the . anniversary of the nation's bloodiest post-apartheid labor violence, . drawing attention to the dominant party's loss of support among many . mineworkers. President . Jacob Zuma's government had planned a unifying day of prayer and . reflection to commemorate the killings. Shocking: It was deadliest incident of its kind since the 1994 end of white-minority rule, it shocked South Africans and the world . Tension: A police officer attempts to stop mine workers from marching towards the mine before a memorial service . But just hours before the planned commemoration went ahead at the mine northeast . of Johannesburg, a government spokeswoman said no one from Zuma's . government would appear. A request by miners taking part in the Farlam Commission of Inquiry for help in paying their legal fess has been refused by Lonmin. A July 25 letter refusing the request was sent to the Hola Bon Renaissance Foundation, reports iolnews. It reads: 'We certainly support you in the belief that it is right that all interested parties continue to have a voice at the commission. However, given the conflict inherent in Lonmin providing financial assistance to a party with whom it may be in opposition and the negative perceptions this could raise, we cannot accede to your requests.' A meeting has now been set up between Lonmin  and the foundation project manager Lebogang Moima. More than a dozen seats for cabinet ministers on the main stage were empty when ceremonies started. Zuma, who faces an election next year, has come under fire from critics . over the government's clumsy handling of what has come to be known as . the 'Marikana massacre', including questions over alleged police . brutality. The Marikana killings were among 60 deaths during a wave of illegal strikes and labor violence in the country's mines that started last year and spilled over into this year. The violence helped trigger credit downgrades for Africa's biggest economy and dented the image of the ANC government. Zuma's ruling ANC said it would not participate in Friday's memorial because the event was being organized by a Marikana support group, which includes the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU). 'We are not participating in this activity,' ANC spokesman Ishmael Mnisi told Reuters. 'People are taking advantage of a tragedy for their own political benefit.' Anger: Mine workers chase police vehicle away before the memorial service . Mine workers dance before the memorial service began . Respect: Religious leaders attend the memorial service in Marikana . The labor union ally of Zuma's ANC, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which has been displaced by the more hardline AMCU as the dominant union among miners in the area, said it was also staying away, for safety reasons. 'It's important that we commemorate those who lost their lives, but it is not necessary that we go and commemorate only to lose more lives. The possibility of losing further lives is great,' NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said. The more radical AMCU accuses the ANC government and its NUM union allies of siding with mining bosses over the interests of workers fighting for better pay and conditions. The two unions have been involved in a deadly war for members among South Africa's mineworkers, accusing each other of being behind killings of members over the past few months. At Marikana, thousands of people, many of them wearing green AMCU T-shirts, gathered on and around the rocky outcrop dubbed by media the 'Hill of Horror' where the strikers were killed last year, most falling in a hail of police gunfire. Footage shot at the scene clearly shows officers firing live ammunition from automatic weapons and handguns . Farewell: . Mourners sing and raise their fists in salute as they surround the . coffin of Mpuzeni Ngxande, one of the 34 striking miners killed by . police last year (file photo) Marikana worker Paulos Mpahlela, 60, expressed anger at the government and ANC's decision to stay away. 'We are hurt, the government should be here. They should have taken the trouble to come and be here because they're the leaders,' he said. ' The decision by the ruling party and government to stay away highlights the alienation of many of South Africa's poorest workers from the ANC, Nelson Mandela's liberation movement which has dominated South Africa since the end of apartheid. The ANC is still expected to win elections easily next year, but increasingly suffers from accusations that it has become the party of the rich and powerful. Aftermath: South African protesters lie motionless on the ground as heavily armed police officers check them at the Lonmin Platinum Mine near Rustenburg, South Africa . Gun battle: In the heat of the incident, dust flies and police take cover. Water cannon and tear gas had been fired at miners before police opened fire . 'What it shows is that the ANC, the NUM and the government have lost their legitimacy in that region which has become enemy territory. It is a unique situation when the NUM and ANC cannot appear somewhere,' Cape Town-based political analyst Nic Borain told Reuters. AMCU denies that its aggressive recruitment tactics are behind the unrest in South Africa's mines, which has injected added tension into the latest round of wage bargaining currently underway between mining companies and unions. Attending the Marikana commemoration, AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa called it a 'sad day' that should not be used for political 'electioneering'. The threat of an immediate fresh strike at Marikana was eased this week when Lonmin, the world's No. 3 platinum producer, signed a deal with AMCU recognizing it as the majority union at its mine, although labor tension remains high. A government commission of inquiry was due to conclude its investigation into the Marikana shootings by last December but proceedings stalled and lately were suspended because of lack of funding for lawyers representing the victims. Rights group Amnesty International urged the government to ensure that inquiry was fully completed. 'There seems to be a critical lack of political will to ensure that the police and those responsible for the police fully account for their actions,' Amnesty's Deputy Programme Director for Africa Noel Kututwa said in a statement.","Police opened fire at Lonmin's mine northwest of Johannesburg .

"Let down: Four in ten children who were high-fliers at seven achieved only average grades in national tests aged 11 . Almost 50,000 of the brightest children have been failed at primary school despite a rise in headline pass rates, official league tables revealed yesterday. Four in ten who were high-fliers at the age of seven failed to reach their potential and achieved only average grades in national tests at 11. School-by-school tables for more than 15,000 primaries show that national results in English and maths SATs tests were markedly up on last year. In 2011, 67 per cent of pupils achieved level four – the expected standard for their age – in reading, writing and maths, but this year it was 75 per cent. However, concerns are being raised over provision for the brightest in some primaries after it emerged that 49,678 of the 125,800 pupils who were the top performers at seven did not continue on the same trajectory over the next four years. They failed to achieve the level five in English and maths tests at the age of 11 that had been predicted by their results at seven. The Department for Education said it was ‘unacceptable’ that children who made bright starts to their school careers had ‘fallen back into the pack’. The tables are based on results in national tests in English and maths taken by more than 540,000 11-year-olds in England in the spring. They show that a quarter of youngsters left primary school without a basic mastery of reading, writing and maths – down from a third last year. This means they failed to reach the expected level four in all three subjects. Failed: The Department for Education said it was 'unacceptable' that so many bright starters had 'fallen back into the pack' The figures also show that two-thirds of pupils who were slow starters in the three Rs failed to catch up and reach the expected standard by the end of primary school. But there were 59 schools where every pupil in the lowest-achieving group at seven had been pulled up to expected levels at the age of 11. The number of schools failing to meet basic targets for performance fell by more than half, from 1,310 to 521. Of these 521, 45 have already shut down or been turned into academies under the control of outside sponsors. Many of the rest now face closure or takeover. Faith schools were more likely to achieve good results than other primaries, it emerged. Some 62 per cent of the 896 primaries which brought all pupils up to expected levels in English and maths were faith schools, despite them making up only a third of primaries nationally. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the results were ‘excellent news’, adding: ‘It shows the hard work that’s going on in the system and has been going on for some years.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Every child must be challenged to achieve their best. These results show that some children who were struggling at seven have made real progress by 11 and are now performing as well, or even better, than we expect. ‘However, there are still too many cases where the opposite is true. It is unacceptable that children who made such bright starts to their school career have fallen back into the pack. ‘The difference between success and failure is so often great teaching. Our reforms are raising standards by improving the quality of teaching and delivering discipline in the classroom.’ Schools must ensure at least 60 per cent of 11-year-olds reach the standard expected for their age in English and maths (posed by models)","49,678 top performers at age seven did not continue on same trajectory .

"Things are going from bad to worse for Anthony Weiner after his spokeswoman went off on an expletive-laden rant about a former campaign intern after she wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering New York mayoral campaign. Barbara Morgan was so incensed by Olivia Nuzzi's actions that she lost her cool - apparently unaware that she was talking on the record - when she was being interviewed by politics website Talking Points Memo about another matter. Weiner's communication director called the former intern a 'fame hungry b**** who sucked at her job,' she also called Nuzzi a ‘s***bag,’ ‘t***,’ and ‘c***' and threatened to sue her. Scroll down for video . Weiner spokesperson Barbara Morgan, right, went off on an expletive-laden rant about former intern Olivia Nuzzi, left, after she had an article published which painted a very unflattering picture of his mayoral campaign . The over the top outburst was prompted by Nuzzi penning an article, published in Tuesday’s New York Daily News, in which she was highly critical of how Weiner's campaign was run. She claimed many interns had only joined to get closer to Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, in the hope of landing a role in any potential presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton in 2016. She claimed that one campaign staffer had left because he had only been paid one-third of what he was promised and that Weiner incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 'Monica.' Morgan released a statement on Tuesday night apologizing for her outburst. Need a break? New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner's campaign is in meltdown after a former intern revealed what it was like to work for him and his comms director lost her cool in a very public manner . ‘In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off the record conversation,’ she said. ‘It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologize.’ In the controversial article Nuzzi said ‘a lot’ of Weiner’s staff had ‘short résumés,’ including Morgan, who Nuzzi had mocked because she ‘last worked as the press secretary for the New Jersey state education commissioner.’ ‘I’m dealing with like stupid f**king interns who make it on to the cover of the Daily News even though they signed NDAs and/or they proceeded to trash me,’ Morgan told TPM, referring to a non-disclosure agreement that Nuzzi would have signed. ‘And by the way, I tried to fire her, but she begged to come back and I gave her a second chance.’ Not how we roll: In a slick new ad, pictured, Weiner states: 'I know that there are newspaper editors and other politicians that say, ""Boy, I wish that guy Weiner would quit""' Morgan went on to suggest in her conversation to TPM that . Nuzzi would be unable to ever get another job in New York politics as . a result of her actions. 'F****** s***bag. Nice f**king glamour shot on the cover of the Daily News. Man, see if you ever get a job in this town again,' said Morgan. She also described Nuzzi’s allegation as . ‘b*******.’ Nuzzi is believed to have stopped interning for the campaign four weeks ago . and worked on the campaign for about a month. Morgan said Nuzzi’s initially showed some enthusiasm for working for Weiner, but claimed that her ability left much to be desired. ‘She sucked. She like wasn’t good at setting up events. She was clearly there because she wanted to be seen. Like it was, like, terrible and I had to like - she would like, she would just not show up for work,’ said Morgan. ‘For the four weeks she worked there - she didn’t work weekends, so twenty days total. Of those twenty days, she missed probably five because she would just like not show up and not tell me she wasn’t going to be there.

Beleaguered: A glum Weiner looks distracted as he listens to responses at the forum in Inwood . Also . on Tuesday Weiner declared in a new ad that he would not quit the . mayoral race because quitting 'isn't the way we roll in New York' despite looking exhausted and miserable at a public appearance just . hours earlier. In the . advert, posted on his campaign website, Weiner stares straight at the . camera and says: 'I know that there are newspaper editors and other . politicians that say, ""Boy, I wish that guy Weiner would quit.""' But the prolific sexter insists he owes it to New Yorkers to stay in the race. 'This . isn't about me. This is about helping New Yorkers. Because they . understand that this is about them. This campaign has reminded me about . it again and again–in all kinds of ways.' The ad was posted on Weiner's campaign website just hours after photographs showed him rubbing his eyes and sitting glumly in Manhattan, suggesting his latest sexting scandal was finally taking its toll. End of the road? The former Congressman has dropped to fourth in the polls and it looks like it is taking its toll . He . hit out at the media claiming: 'They don't know New York. They . certainly don't know me. ""Quit"" isn't the way we roll in New York City.' In . the video, Weiner talks directly to the camera about the circus-like . scandal dominating news headlines and how it has made him even more keen . to serve New Yorkers. 'You . know, if someone wants to come out with something embarrassing about you . in your private life, you got to talk about that for a little while,' he said. 'But it's also . reminded me that–citizens, when they come up to you, and they want to . talk about a situation on their block, or at their child's school or . something going on at their job site–that that's what this campaign is . all about,' he added.

"Doctors trained in some of the world’s poorest countries where medical qualifications are far less rigorous than in the UK are being recruited by the NHS. While some of Britain’s brightest students are unable to get on medical courses at home, the Health Service is hiring a third of its doctors from abroad. Among them are medics from 143 different nations including poverty-stricken states such as Liberia, Belize and the Congo. Some have studied in countries whose universities have few computers or medical textbooks and trainees are taught from blackboards in cramped classrooms where they are forced to sit on the floor. Critics said it was ‘bonkers’ that British straight-A students desperate to become doctors were being turned away from medical courses due to government quotas while the NHS recruited staff from remote parts of the world with poor medical training. The revelation comes amid fears the health service is becoming too dependent on foreign medics.One senior doctor recently warned that many of them had ‘little or no knowledge and experience of British culture or of our Health Service’. Professor J Meirion Thomas, a senior cancer specialist who works at the Marsden Hospital in London, wrote in the Spectator magazine: ‘Importing doctors from abroad on a regular and ongoing basis might not be a bad thing if there were any guarantee that the entry criteria to all foreign medical schools were as rigorous and as discriminating as our own. ‘Also, that the quality of teaching and training was always as comprehensive as ours. But too often, it isn’t.’ Foreign doctors are four times more likely to be struck off or suspended than those who trained in this country, while a quarter of all doctors barred from the register qualified abroad – the highest number were from India. Those who trained outside the EU have to sit an exam on basic medical competence and score 7 out of 7 on an English language test before being allowed on the register. Doctors who have trained outside the EU are required to pass a language test before they practice in the UK . They must also have gained their medical qualifications in a university ‘approved’ by the General Medical Council. But the watchdog has only blacklisted eight institutions from the thousands around the world including one in Liberia, one in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, and one in Belize. Doctors who qualify within the EU are exempt from such checks due to strict ‘freedom of movement’ rules and they are allowed on the register automatically. There is widespread concern that . European doctors are being allowed to work in Britain even if they can . barely speak English or have rusty medical skills. The . flaw was tragically exposed in 2008 when a German GP, Dr Daniel Ubani, . killed pensioner David Gray by giving him a huge dose of morphine on his . first shift as an out-of-hours GP. Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘One of the main complaints we hear from patients is the language problems. ‘Often . these doctors speak better English than patients but they cannot . understand regional dialects and due to their intonation, patients . cannot understand them. ‘There are also problems with doctors getting to grips with all the NHS’s policy and guidelines. ‘They are thrown in at the deep end, and they just don’t know what they are doing.’ The . Government plans to appoint senior consultants and GPs to supervise EU . doctors and ensure they are up to scratch – on the language and medical . skills. The system is due to come into force next year but doctors say they will not have time to carry out the checks and warn that locums – who do not have a permanent workplace – will slip through the net. Gill Beer, of the think-tank 2020 health, said the health service needed to ‘tighten up considerably’ on foreign medics. She added: ‘Where you’ve got night locums, it’s very difficult to get them up to speed and often they are employed when there are less senior staff around.’ GMC figures show that there were 252,553 doctors who trained oversees on the register last year, a rise of 3 per cent from 2011. India provides the most doctors, with 25,336, while 8,998 are from Pakistan, 5,695 from South Africa, 4,010 from Ireland and 3,936 from Nigeria – where medical training has been heavily criticised. Another 727 are from Libya – where there are few computers and students learn from blackboards – 383 from Ghana and 123 from Colombia. The General Medical Council has only blocked eight institutions from supplying doctors to the UK. Foreign doctors are four times more likely to be struck off or suspended than those with British training . Some experts pointed out that the NHS depends on overseas doctors particularly in unpopular specialisms such as A&E and care of the elderly which struggle to recruit staff. A spokesman for the British Medical Association said: ‘Overseas doctors have for many years made a valuable and important contribution to the NHS, especially in key services where there has been a historic shortage of UK-trained doctors. ‘This includes consultant posts in emergency care, haematology [blood disorders] and old age psychiatry. Without the support of these doctors many NHS services would struggle to provide effective care to their patients.’","Health Service is hiring one third of its doctors from 143 different nations .

"A German court has ruled that a young Muslim girl must attend mixed swimming lessons at her school wearing a 'burkini' - a full-bodied costume which includes a head-covering. The ruling is an important one for the country which has over 5million Muslims, most of them Turks, in the population. The girl had complained that she felt 'uncomfortable' going swimming with 'bare chested' boys near her and either wanted to be allowed to skip the lessons or be given special instruction on her own. A 13-year-old Muslim girl has been ordered by a German court to wear a bukini to take part in swimming lessons. Bukinis, modelled above in a London shop, allow Muslim women to swim and still cover up . But the Federal Administrative Court in the eastern city of Leipzig has ruled that 'social reality of life in Germany came above her religious beliefs'. They said the coverall swimsuit was the best solution for the girl, 13, and noted that several of her friends at the school in Frankfurt already donned burkinis to swim. The girl, whose family come from Morroco, was represented by a lawyer in Wednesday's hearing who said that according to the Koran, she was not only forbidden from showing herself to boys but also from seeing the topless boys. But the court said: 'The plaintiff has not made sufficiently clear that taking part in co-educational swimming lessons with a burkini breaches Muslim rules on clothing,' rejecting her appeal against earlier decisions by two courts in the western state of Hesse. A judge at the Federal Administrative Law Court, in Leipzig, Germany, has set a precedent by ordering a teenage Muslim girl to take part in swimming lessons wearing a burkini . Judge Werner Neumann said an education system in a pluralistic society could not accommodate every religious concern, and the burkini would accommodate the girl’s Muslim beliefs. 'The result would be the widespread disintegration of lessons otherwise,' he added.","13-year-old Muslim girl felt uncomfortable being close to bare-chested boys .

"Teachers banned an exotic animal expert from a school after fears were raised over health and safety. Reptile specialist Rob Louth was due to present a workshop to a group of children during half-term at St George’s Academy in Sleaford, Lincolnshire. But he was stunned when panicking staff rang him five minutes before his presentation began and ordered him to remove the creatures from the school premises. Mr Louth, who recently won an award for his nationwide animal talks, was forced to quickly show the . devastated children the exotic creatures in their travel boxes before taking . them out of the school. Reptile expert Rob Louth (pictured with his wife Susan) was banned from showing animals to school children . The 35-year-old had planned to show a tarantula, lizard, snakes, meerkats and skunks to the excited young carers in his 90 minute workshop on October 23. A carer’s organisation had booked the school buildings to give the youngsters - who care for their disabled or seriously ill parents - a well-deserved treat. Mr Louth said: 'It’s health and safety gone mad. I’ve done displays in schools, shopping centres and parks, more or less anywhere. St George's Academy in Sleaford which banned Mr Louth from giving an exotic animals demonstration . 'I did a national tour of shopping centres with Skoda on a promotional tour with my animals and you can’t get much more of a health and safety nightmare than a shopping centre.

Here he is pictured showing his pet Burmese python to children at another school during a demonstration . Members of a Lions Club enjoy holding Mr Louth's pet Burmese python as part of one of his displays . He added: 'I was in and had got all the animals there set up ready to go but five minutes before I was due to start I got a phone call saying no reptiles were allowed. Health and safety fears at a Lincolnshire school left a group of children disappointed . 'I spoke to a senior member of staff on the phone and said can they give a reason but she just said no. Then I said well if I can’t show the reptiles I will just show the invertebrates and mammals’ but then she said no animals at all. 'I decided to stay as long as I could and keep the animals in the boxes so the kids could at least see something and I talked to them about the animals. 'But I had to pack the animals away and leave with a group of deserving kids sat at their desks with their cameras out ready. It was ridiculous.The kids were gutted.' The carer’s organisation had booked Mr Louth to do his hour-and-a-half workshops on Wednesday, October 23 and Thursday, October 24. But because of the school’s ban, he was forced to walk the children to a local youth centre and do a rushed workshop on the Thursday. Mr Louth, from Ruskington, Lincolnshire, added: “This is what I do for a living. I am fully insured. 'I’ve got every licence under the sun. I’m even licensed to work with dangerous animals like a cobra or alligator. 'I’m just really disappointed for the kids.

"Morally wrong: Mike Penning MP said it is wrong that so many people get welfare payments 'for life' Only 6 per cent of new disability benefit claimants have a face-to-face assessment with a medic, it has been revealed. Disability minister Mike Penning said it is morally wrong that so many people get welfare payments ‘for life’ based on a form they often fill in themselves. Mr Penning, appointed to Iain Duncan Smith’s department last week, claimed Labour tried to ‘control unemployment’ by putting people on disability benefits. This month, the Government will start . to reassess disability living allowance (DLA) claimants for a new . benefit called personal independence payment, which includes an . assessment and regular reviews. The plans have been attacked by medical charities and disability groups, who say they cause uncertainty for claimants. But ministers say without reform, by 2018 one in 17 people would be claiming a benefit designed for those unable to walk. The number on DLA was set to rise to 3.6million by 2015, up from 1.1million when it was created in 1992. There are currently 3.3million claimants, . costing more than £13billion a year – close to the Department for . Transport’s total budget. Government statistics show that in the 12 months to March, just 6 per cent of new DLA claimants had a face-to-face assessment with a healthcare professional, with 94 per cent receiving it on the basis of  a claim form, sometimes with  evidence such as a GP’s note. That equates to some £250million a year given to new claimants with no face-to-face medical checks. The . figures also show 55 per cent of decisions are made on a claim form . alone, without any additional corroborating medical evidence. Mr . Penning said: ‘We can’t just leave people and say “you’ve filled a form . in, sent it off and that means you’re on the benefit for life”. ‘It’s not fair on them and it’s not fair on the taxpayer – or those  people with disabilities who need more help.’ He said it was absurd not to have regular . check-ups, since only 3 per cent of people with disabilities are born . with them and many conditions change over time. Dancing drag queen who said he could not walk . ‘Under the personal independence payment, claimants will have a face-to-face assessment and systematic reviews – something missing in the current system – to make sure they’re getting the right levels of support. This is about making the benefit sustainable,’ he added. Mr Penning said around 170,000 people are likely to lose disability benefit by the next election, but up to 150,000 of the most severely disabled will get more support. ‘We expect to find a large number of people who have been incorrectly assessed,’ he said. Though DLA can be claimed by those in work, the minister said he believed people had been shoved on to a range of sickness and disability benefits to stop them claiming unemployment handouts. ‘In my view this was the way Labour was trying to control unemployment,’ he said. ‘That might keep the unemployment statistics down but it also writes people off.’ The new assessment, initially only given to first-time claimants, looks at everyday activities such as washing, cooking and getting around. It also examines reading, verbal communication and how someone engages with other people, one reason why ministers claim it will do a better job of recognising certain mental health conditions. Under DLA, 71 per cent of claimants get indefinite awards, without systematic reassessments. But those on personal independence payment will face regular checks. The DLA system overpays some claimants £630million every year, while others are underpaid by £190million, figures show. Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson has led criticism of the changes, arguing they will hit the vulnerable. She said many disabled people – such as those who are paralysed or are amputees – are ‘not suddenly going to get better’.","Only 6 per cent of new claimants have face-to-face assessment .

"Teenagers must study at least 15 poems, including works by the likes of Keats, Shelley and Byron, for the new English literature exam in a toughening-up of GCSEs. All pupils will read a series of ‘high-quality, intellectually challenging and substantial whole texts in detail’ as part of reformed qualifications. Exam boards will set questions on the compositions from five or more different poets as well as 19th- century novels and British fiction or drama post-1914. Poetry: Pupils will have to study the work of Romantic poets like Keats (left) and Byron (right) Pupils will also need extra lessons to cope with new maths GCSEs and be forced to pay greater attention to spelling and grammar in English language exams due to stricter marking. Education Secretary Michael Gove yesterday heralded a ‘rigorous and robust’ overhaul of core GCSEs that will help match the standards expected in other countries. Reformed GCSEs in English literature, English language and maths will be taught from September 2015. The Department for Education published new syllabuses yesterday and will announce changes in other core subjects next year. In English literature, there is a new emphasis on reading ‘whole texts’ to prevent children gaining GCSEs by focusing on ‘extracts’ of poems and novels. The new requirements mean that teenagers must study at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one 19th-century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789, including representative Romantic poetry, and fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards. Tests: Coursework will be scrapped, with the new GCSE grades decided by exams at the end of a two-year course . Pupils will need to study a minimum of 300 lines of poetry. Current GCSE requirements are far less specific. They stipulate that students must study poetry, prose and drama including texts from different cultures and traditions, contemporary writers and the English, Welsh or Irish literary heritage and one Shakespeare play. Education Secretary Michael Gove said new GCSEs in English and maths 'set higher expectations' English language exams will include more marks for accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar – up from 12 to 20 per cent. Marks for spoken language exams will no longer contribute to final grades amid fears over inconsistent marking in schools. The qualification will also encourage the study of literature for those who do not take English literature GCSEs. In maths, a ‘much wider and deeper’ range of content will ‘require greater teaching time and greater testing time’, according to the DfE. This will amount to at least one extra maths lesson a week. Students will need to apply their knowledge and reasoning to develop arguments and solve ‘real-world problems’. This will include financial mathematics. They must also learn key formulae by heart such as the formula for the area of a triangle. Currently, formulae are given in exams. The changes form part of a major Coalition reform of qualifications sat by 600,000 teenagers in England each year. Ofqual, the exam regulator, has announced a shake-up of the structure of GCSEs, with a new grading system, less coursework and a greater focus on end-of-course tests – scrapping modular exams. The traditional A* to G grading structure will be replaced with a nine-point scoring system. Mr Gove said yesterday: ‘The new GCSEs in English and mathematics set higher expectations. They demand more from all students and provide further challenges for those aiming to achieve top grades.’ A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: . Its lovliness increases; it will never . Pass into nothingness; but still will keep . A bower quiet for us, and a sleep . Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing . A flowery band to bind us to the earth, . Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth . Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, . Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways . Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all, . Some shape of beauty moves away the pall . From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, . Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon .

Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink. I wandered lonely as a cloud . That floats on high o'er vales and hills, . When all at once I saw a crowd, . A host, of golden daffodils; . Beside the lake, beneath the trees, . Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. Continuous as the stars that shine . And twinkle on the milky way, . They stretched in never-ending line . Along the margin of a bay: . Ten thousand saw I at a glance, . Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. The waves beside them danced; but they . Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: . A poet could not but be gay, . In such a jocund company: . I gazed--and gazed--but little thought . What wealth the show to me had brought: . For oft, when on my couch I lie . In vacant or in pensive mood, . They flash upon that inward eye . Which is the bliss of solitude; . And then my heart with pleasure fills, .

"More than £10million has been spent settling compensation claims in schools, including £600 after a child was hit by a piece of apple. The legal action was one of thousands taken out by pupils and staff against their schools in England and Wales in the last three years. Somerset County Council has so far racked up £575 in legal fees fighting the case after the pupil who was hit by the apple in March 2010 sued. Compensation culture: Millions of pounds have been spent by schools setlling claims made by pupils and teachers . Other payments included one student who was handed £7,800 after falling off their own skateboard, £8,000 to a member of staff who was hit with a ball, and £55,000 for a primary school child who bumped his head. In one Middlesex primary school a pupil received £50 after falling out of a tree. Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show schools are even paying out pupils who become embroiled in playground fights. In Pembrokeshire one student was handed £1,925 following a fight, while at Central Foundation Girls' school in Bow, London, another was paid £43. Despite the huge sums of money spent on the cases most were found to be baseless when investigated. And now critics have slammed the . 'ridiculous' compensation culture in schools, saying it harms children's . education because teachers are wrapping kids up in cotton wool to avoid . payouts. Chairman of Campaign for Real Education Chris . McGovern said: 'There . is a compensation culture in schools. 'While there is negligence, and . schools need to ensure children are in a safe environment, they should . be able to exercise a degree of common sense. 'The . courts should protect schools from spurious claims, because too often . the claims are against events which are a normal part of the rough and . tumble of everyday life. 'The . problem is that schools are now spending a lot of time worried that . they might be sued and so they're wrapping children in cotton wool. 'The . real price is not just financial. The real price is that these children . are losing what we would consider to be a ""normal"" childhood because . it's a risk-averse childhood wrapped in cotton wool so children don't . take any risks. 'That's no preparation for adult life. Schools . are obsessed by the need to ensure that there are no claims and . therefore children are missing out on the adventure and magic and . childhood.' Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance Matthew Sinclair, said: 'Our . worrying schoolyard compensation culture is not only a burden on . taxpayers but is also undermining children's time in the classroom. 'Some of these incidents range from the sublime to the ridiculous, with many either nobody's fault or easily avoidable. 'Every penny spent on payouts for a bump or thrown apple means less cash for textbooks and sports equipment.' A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'Compensation payments are agreed on a case by case basis and the department has no role in the process.' Topping the list of local authorities that have had to fork out the most cash was Sheffield City Council, which racked up a bill of  £1,148,186 settling claims. Worried: Chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, Matthew Sinclair (right), said every penny spent on compensation was one less spent in the classroom. Left, a model plays hopscotch . A huge £2,430.604,62 was claimed on behalf of primary school children, £2,363,275.55 from secondary school children and £5,550,056.04 claimed by staff working at schools. A director at Lancashire County Council, which had the second-largest total at £794,815.18, said accidents were inevitable. Bob Stott, who is responsible for schools, said: 'We would prefer it that no one was ever hurt in an accident while at school. 'But in a county with nearly 10,000 teachers and well over 160,000 school-age children it is inevitable that there will be some incidents resulting in injuries, thankfully mostly minor. 'When the county council receives a claim for compensation it has to make a decision regarding its liability, and defend or settle the case as appropriate. 'This may lead to a compensation payment being made.' A spokesman for Essex County Council, which had the third-highest total at £785,485.31, said: 'Essex County Council takes its health, safety and wellbeing responsibilities seriously and is committed to complying with its legal, moral and financial obligations. 'When a claim is made it is investigated thoroughly and payment made if the claim is successful. 'It is also worth noting that Essex County Council is one of the largest local authorities in the country with a greater number of schools within its boundaries so the numbers will be naturally higher.'","Schools now making payments to children injured in playground fights .

"Filler: A woman receives a cosmetic injection . Beauticians and hairdressers are to be banned from injecting Botox in an effort to cut the number of people harmed by botched procedures. New standards drawn up in Europe stipulate that only doctors, dentists and prescribing nurses will be able to administer the cosmetic fillers. It means that only salons which hire qualified professionals to work in designated treatment rooms will be able to go on offering the treatment. The announcement is a victory for The Mail on Sunday, which is campaigning for tighter regulation of the cosmetic industry. One of the demands of our Stop The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys campaign is for proper training and a register of everyone who carries out cosmetic injections. Botox and fillers have enjoyed a surge in popularity, with 370,000 Botox injections administered in 2010. But this has led to a rise in patients suffering from unwanted and disfiguring side effects including frozen foreheads and swollen lips nicknamed the 'trout pout'. Victims include actress Leslie Ash, who suffered an allergic reaction to lip fillers in 2002. She has called for improved regulation of the industry. New guidelines: Only doctors, dentists and nurses will be allowed to administer cosmetic fillers . Last week, the European Committee for Standardization published a draft guideline on who can provide cosmetic procedures and where these should be carried out. Anyone who flouts it could face prosecution, fines and possibly imprisonment. News of the guideline, which could be introduced by autumn next year, was welcomed by the group that represents private medical providers. Sally Taber, from Treatments You Can Trust, a industry-backed certification scheme for medics who provide cosmetic treatments, said: 'This EU standard is brilliant. 'It is making a sensible and ethical suggestion to protect patient safety. If we let beauty therapists continue to perform these procedures it would be negligent.' Victory: It is a victory for The Mail on Sunday's campaign for tighter regulation of the cosmetic industry . According to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, 70 per cent of members have seen patients suffering from complications after having temporary fillers, and half in patients who had semi or permanent fillers.

"The allegations against 57-year-old Michael Fine were detailed in an emergency court motion from the Lorain County Bar association, which wants him immediately suspended . An Ohio lawyer is being investigated after being accused of hypnotizing a female client to force her into sexual activities. The allegations against 57-year-old Michael Fine were detailed in an emergency court motion from the Lorain County Bar association, which wants him immediately suspended. At least one more woman has also gone to police with reports that Fine, who has been practicing hypnotism for 30-years, had attempted to hypnotize her while discussing her divorce proceedings. He is married to a court reporter and the father of two girls. Identified as 'Jane Doe' in the affidavit, the woman wanted Fine to represent her in a child custody case. She told police she had 'strange memories and feelings' after meeting with him on numerous occasions, The Smoking Gun reports. 'She would be unable to recall substantial portions of the meetings, and afterwards she would realize her clothes and bra were out of place and moved, and her vagina was wet,' according to investigator Richard Thomas. She recorded her next two telephone calls with Fine to get further evidence. While one call starts out with talk of her case, Fine but when Fine 'learns she is alone, he places her in a trance.' The conversation turns into one of 'an explicit sexual nature, wherein he induces her into multiple orgasms.' While he persuades her that she is 'being made love to by the world's greatest lover' once the conversation is over she would 'appear normal and only remember their discussions regarding legal matters.' There was a similar phone call made on October 21. At least one more woman has also gone to police with reports that the 30-year veteran had attempted to hypnotize her while discussing her divorce proceedings at his office . Investigators then put a wire on Jane Doe before the pair met on November 7 at Fine's office. During that conversation, 'Fine begins sexual dialogue, explaining sexual acts that he will do for her.' When police came into the room he was holding her hand and rubbing her shoulders. Another client, called 'Jane Doe 2' also alleged that Fine tried to hypnotize her. She said that besides attempting to seduce her, he would comment on her appearance and ask about her sex life with her husband. She told authorities she 'felt the loss of time during her meetings…as she cannot recall how so much time passed during the meetings for what she remembers discussing.' Jane Doe 2 also told authorities she was sickened that he preyed on her while being 'so upset and distraught about her marital situation when she went to him.'","Allegations against 57-year-old Michael Fine were detailed in an emergency court motion from the Lorain County Bar association .

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market. ‘The fact that this trade is contributing to the threat of extinction faced by many endangered species is of no interest to these ruthless traffickers. 'Border Force’s specialist officers are world renowned for their excellence in identifying and preventing the trade of illegal animal and plant material. ‘Officers are working tirelessly with partners in the National Crime Agency, the police and internationally to stamp out this illicit trade.’ Mr Miller said the biggest shift has been in the beauty and fitness industries, where endangered species once used only in folk medicines are being sold as bodybuilding supplements and facial creams. He added: 'The market is evolving - there is more demand from a wider set of consumers. 'From the traditional Chinese medicine products that we used to seeing, we're now seeing new age beauty products, the health and fitness slimming pills, that are having endangered species within their ingredients.' While much of the trade is in rising Asian markets like China and Vietnam, Britain's position as a global logistics hub means CITES goods often come through its borders. This year 500kg of face cream containing caviar extract were discovered being imported from China, while 126,000 pots of Detonate and 15,120 of CRAZE - bodybuilding supplements containing the rare orchid Dendrobium - were seized en route from the US.

"He was nicknamed Mad Jack by his men during the Second World War. After coming face to face with Lieutenant Colonel John Churchill, the Germans probably had a similar, if less affectionate, moniker for the eccentric officer. Rather than wield a sub-machine gun in battle, the commando leader inspired his comrades by storming beaches armed with a bow and arrow and two-handed sword, dressed in a kilt and playing a set of bagpipes. Brave: Lieutenant Colonel John 'Mad Jack' Churchill believed 'any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly armed' He enhanced his reputation by capturing 42 German prisoners with only his broadsword and later escaping from one of the most daunting Nazi jails before the end of the war. The colourful officer’s bravery – he is the only soldier in the war credited with killing enemy troops with arrows – earned him a chestful of gallantry medals, including two Distinguished Service Orders and a Military Cross. But even though his career was one of the most remarkable in the history of the Army, his story is not widely known. Now the heroism of Lt Col Churchill, who died in 1996 aged 89, has been recovered by researchers at family history website findmypast.co.uk. His story has been put together from reports in local newspapers which have been placed online for the first time. Hot shot: Jack Churchill represented Britain at the 1939 World Archery Championships (pictured) Born in Surrey in 1906, he was educated on the Isle of Man and at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He joined  the 2nd Battalion the Manchester Regiment in 1926. He later left the Army to become a professional bagpipe player and appeared in films. He was also a highly skilled bowman, representing Britain in the World Archery Championships in 1939. At the outbreak of war he was recalled to the Army. Carrying an English longbow and American Indian arrows on to the battlefield, Lt Col Churchill’s fearlessness under fire became his hallmark. He often said that ‘any officer who goes into action without his sword is improperly armed’. An account in the Dundee Evening Telegraph from May 1945 described his deadly attack against Germans hiding in bushes during the retreat to Dunkirk five years earlier. ‘He was on patrol when some Germans were detected in a thicket about 200 yards away,’ said the report. ‘He shot two arrows into the thicket. There were some strange noises and no answering fire.’ He was also in the thick of the action with his bagpipes while leading  2 Commando through Sicily, to Messina and the landings at Salerno, Italy. Mad Jack escaped the Sagan prison before being captured again and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, in Germany (pictured) Alongside a corporal named Ruffell, he took 42 German prisoners and captured a mortar post using only his sword, taking one guard as a human shield and then creeping between sentry posts and forcing the soldiers to surrender. Mad Jack was finally captured in an attack on the island of Brac, off the then Yugoslavia, when, as bombs exploded around him, he continued to play his bagpipes until he was knocked unconscious. He later escaped from the Sagan prison but was recaptured and interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp until being released by the German army. Debra Chatfield, a family historian from findmypast.co.uk, said: ‘His story is amazing.’","Commando leader said soldiers without a sword was 'improperly armed'

"Claims: Scotland Yard has reportedly interviewed the wife of a soldier that said Princess Diana was assassinated by the SAS . The estranged wife of a SAS veteran who claims elite soldiers murdered Princess Diana has told Scotland Yard his story is 'utterly convincing', it emerged today. The former sniper - known only as Soldier N - believes the Princess of Wales' death 16 years ago in Paris was carried out by British special forces who then 'covered it up'. This morning it was revealed his former lover has been interviewed by the Metropolitan Police in a secret location and told detectives the military man is 'telling the truth'. Soldier N claimed driver Henri Paul was blinded by an intense flash of light moments before he lost control of their ­Mercedes and killed the Princess and her lover Dodi Fayed. 'She was utterly convinced he was telling the truth when he said the SAS was involved in Diana and Dodi’s deaths,'  a source told the Daily Express. 'It came out when there was no ­marital strife and when they were still friends.' The Express reports that detectives travelled to a secret location to interview both his estranged wife and his mother-in-law last week. Detective Chief Inspector Philip . Easton is said to have questioned the sniper's estranged wife at length. She reportedly had 'total belief' in his story and reportedly gave a . 'compelling account' of her husband's claims. She . denied the story that an SAS hit squad was involved in the deaths was . 'fantastic', and said that the veteran had repeated the claims several . times. Diana, Dodi and their driver were killed when the Mercedes crashed in the Pont de L’Alma underpass in Paris in August 1997. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was critically injured but survived. Crash: Conspiracy theories have long surrounded Diana's death in Paris in 1997 despite the official finding that it was an accident caused by paparazzi photographers . Princess Diana and with Dodi Fayed (pictured together on the night they died) were killed alongside Henri Paul when the car crashed in a Paris tunnel . An inquest in 2008 found that Princess . Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross . negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who . had been drinking. But the families of Dodi and Mr Paul have long claimed it was a murder. Soldier N's credibility has been called into question, with Royal bodyguards and Met experts calling it a  'mystifying stunt' based on 'nonsense' evidence. He is currently in jail for illegally keeping guns at home, and was described by those who know him as a  'loose cannon'. As well as hiding weapons in his . house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked . his son after mistaking him for the Taliban. Soldier N is also accused of saying he . could enlist the help of his colleagues to ensure his wife – the mother . of his two children and the woman who defended his theory to police – would ‘disappear’. His allegations surfaced in a letter linked to the trial of former sniper Danny . Nightingale. Revelation: The new claim emerged in connection with the trial of Danny Nightingale, pictured with his wife . The families of Henri Paul and Dodi al Fayed (pictured with Princess Diana) have always believed there was a murder plot . The . document was written by the mother-in-law of 'Soldier N', Nightingale's . housemate, in September 2011 and sent to military prosecutors. The . eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that . had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’. Sergeant . Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a . pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N. Soldier . N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the . same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from . whom he is now separated. The letter was sent to Soldier N’s . commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service . Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial. All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA. The . paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his . wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that . has been covered up.’ Scotland Yard confirmed officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing information handed to it by the Royal Military Police. Pictured: The couple at the Ritz Hotel before they both died . The . letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of . his unit use for private jobs’. ‘They put in the box the name, address . and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to . earn extra money does that job.’","It has been claimed officers have interviewed wife of Soldier N 'at length'

"The head of admissions at Oxford University has declared that he is weeding out ‘thick rich’ applicants who might have been offered places in the past. Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions, said the admissions  process selects students based on their aptitude alone. Privileged hopefuls who might have been given preferential treatment a generation ago will now struggle to win a place, according to Mr Nicholson. Oxford University's head of admissions Mike Nicholson has said he is weeding out 'thick rich' applicants . He said the world-class university is looking for the brightest and the best, irrespective of their backgrounds. ‘I really don’t care whether candidates are poor and bright or rich and bright. I want the bright ones. If they’re thick and rich, they’re the ones I’m hoping our  process can exclude,’ he said. Mr Nicholson said tougher testing was key to differentiating between deserving students and those who have been schooled to make it through the interview process for the prestigious university. He said the ‘thing that really links our students together is that they are all selected on their academic merit, they’ve demonstrated that they can cope with the tutorial environment and they’re all really smart’. His comments come in the wake of a high-profile example of a man trying to beat the system to win a place at Oxford. He placed an advert offering £122,300 for a private tutor to help him become an  eligible candidate. The unnamed Arab businessman’s advert in the Times Education Supplement said he needed an understanding of jazz piano, major works of opera and Shakespeare in order to apply. As part of the Oxford admissions process, 90 per cent of students take an  aptitude test designed for their subject. Picture shows a student at Oxford University's Brasenose College . Mr Nicholson suggested applicants from the 70s and 80s were more likely to have been accepted based on social status. He said: ‘Of those people who were admitted 20, 30, 40 years ago, it would be interesting to see how many of them would be admitted now.’ He told an  international higher education conference run by the Sutton Trust charity: ‘We’re supposed to be identifying  students with real potential for success, irrespective of social background.’ Oxford invests £8million in bursaries to help students from low-income backgrounds pay for their degrees. More than £3million is spent each year on outreach work that aims to encourage applicants from a variety of backgrounds. A gender gap is opening up in universities, with women a third more likely to apply for higher education, it was claimed. Mary Curnock Cook, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, said if trends continue then by 2025 the biggest difference could be between men and women, not between those from rich and poor backgrounds. Universities might in future have to treat young men as an under-represented group, she said. Around 30 per cent of  eligible men applied to go to university last year and just under 25 per cent won places. But 40 per cent of women applied, with 32.5 per cent being accepted.","Director of undergraduate admissions Mike Nicholson said process selects students based on aptitude alone .

"They may not be regarded as the world’s greatest lovers,  but it seems you can rely on British men where it really counts. That’s right – our chaps are far more likely to be found scrubbing sinks or dusting the dining room than any other men in Europe, a study has found. There’s still some way to go before they catch up with women, who typically do a bigger share of household chores. Rule Britannia: A study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores . But in Britain, men do a third of the work, while those in Spain and Italy only manage a fifth. The study of more than 58,000 people living with partners in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain looked at how long they spent doing a range of chores. The Spanish team logged time spent cooking, ironing, cleaning the house, washing dishes, doing the laundry and odd jobs, gardening and shopping for groceries. ‘If all housework is considered, the United Kingdom would rate as the most egalitarian country,  followed by France, Germany, and as more inegalitarian cases, Italy and Spain,’ said lead author Marta Dominguez Folgueras, of Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. ‘The difference is significant:  men in the United Kingdom do on average one third of the housework whereas in Italy, they hardly manage 20 per cent.’ Participants were asked to keep a diary of what they did during each 15-minute period of the day. Still trying to impress? the study also found that cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts . The lion’s share of chores fell to women – except in shopping, where the work was evenly split, and some ‘occasional male tasks’. Italian couples spent the most time on household chores – seven hours per day between them. The British came in fourth, at five hours and 52 minutes, while the French spent the least time. The study, published in the Journal of Family Issues, also looked at the difference between married couples and those who were cohabiting, but not married. It found cohabiting men were more likely to do housework than their married counterparts. The average married male did 23 per cent of the chores, but those who had yet to walk down the aisle did 30 per cent, a trend researchers suggest is partly down to a desire to impress a partner. ‘Cohabiting unions hold more egalitarian divisions of household labour, both in terms of quantity – percentage of household load – and quality – types of task performed,’ the researchers wrote. They said living together may be ‘part of a partner selection process’ in which willingness to do chores is seen as ‘a desirable trait’. Living as an unmarried couple was most common in France, where 20 per cent chose to cohabit, followed by the UK with 14 per cent. Young people were the most likely to live together when not married. A separate study this week found women in the UK do more unpaid housework and childcare than those in most other countries. The research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that in a week, married British women spend an average of 11 more hours on household matters than their husbands do, while putting in three hours less in paid work.","Cohabiting men more likely to contribute than husbands, study finds .

"In protest: Mavis Woodger, outside her home in Maidstone Kent, has stopped paying her council tax because of a six foot leylandii . A grandmother who claims a towering hedge is breaching her ‘right to light’ is refusing to pay her council tax. Pensioner Mavis Woodger says her neighbours’ six foot leylandii leaves her living room in constant gloom and has killed off part of her garden. The 83-year-old first complained to the council about the trees in 2007, but her claim was rejected. A subsequent appeal to the local government ombudsman also failed. Lawyers for Mrs Woodger relied on laws dating back to the 19th century that state windows that have received natural light for at least 20 years are entitled to maintain this level of illumination. The laws can prevent a neighbour from going ahead with a home extension or have high trees if it blocks out sunshine. The grandmother-of-two claims the council have refused to have any further dealings with her regarding her complaint, saying it has been resolved. But in a bid to force a resolution she has stopped paying her council tax on her £200,000 semi-detached home in the hope she will get summonsed to court. Mrs Woodger, a retired sales assistant from Maidstone, Kent, said: ‘I have a right of light and I should be able to use my land. ‘I have lived in this house for 50 years, and my enjoyment of my property is not the same because of this. My life is not the same. ‘I cannot grow my plants where the hedge is now, it blocks out my light in my front room, and I have cracks in my paving.’ But neighbours Gary and Clare Gilby say old photographs show the hedge was higher still in the 1980s. Mrs Gilby said: ‘We keep the hedge at two metres - we wouldn’t want it any taller because it would restrict the light.’ A Maidstone Borough Council spokesman said: ‘We investigated Mrs Woodger’s complaint about her neighbour’s front garden hedge in 2007. ‘At 2.1 metres in height, it was decided that it was not adversely affecting Mrs Woodger’s enjoyment of her property, and this decision was upheld by the Planning Inspectorate. ‘If Mrs Woodger wishes to pursue a right . to light, she can do so as a civil matter; the council has no legal . powers to get involved.’ Earlier this year, the Law Commission, a . government advisory body, suggested the right to light was acting as a . barrier to development and should be reined in. Fight: Miss Woodger, 83, has been complaining to the council for eight years over her neighbours' six foot trees, pictured in background . It said it had simply become a ‘tool to extract money from a neighbour who proposes to develop his or her land’. The Commission warns that such rights have a ‘disproportionately negative impact upon the potential for the development of land’. It wants to change the law so that new properties do not acquire a right to light after 20 years. The change would not affect existing rights.","Mavis Woodger says neighbours’ six foot leylandii leaves block her light .

"Alan Miliburn, the government's social mobility adviser, said the middle classes, as well as those on low incomes, struggle to make it to the top . Middle class children are being held back by ‘entrenched elitism’ which means the rich and privately-educated are a third more likely to get top jobs, a government adviser warned today. Alan Milburn, the social mobility tsar, said it was not just children from poorer families who struggled to ‘move up and get on’. In the latest high-profile attack on the privileged elite who run Britain, he said it was time to ‘break open the closed shop’ at the top of society. David Cameron has been stung by criticism of the wealthy background of many in the Cabinet. Former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major took a swipe last month, warning the Conservatives cannot win if they fail to understand the ‘silent have-nots’ who suffer in ‘net curtain poverty’. New research from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission found that privately-educated graduates are one-third more likely to get top jobs than state school-educated graduates. In a speech today Mr Miliburn said: ‘A society where opportunities are frozen rather than fluid hurts more than those at the very bottom end. ‘It hurts the people President Clinton once famously called the “forgotten middle class”. ‘They, and not just low income families, are the victims of entrenched elitism in our country.’ The former Labour Cabinet minister told social mobility experts that the problem did not affect just people from working class backgrounds, but was also a block on the aspirations of middle class families. Part of this gap was explained by the fact that top employers continue to recruit from a narrow range of highly selective universities, where those who went to independent schools tend to be over-represented, said the Commission. Research shows the increased probability of working in a top job if privately educate, compared with attending a state school . But it also found that even where two similarly qualified graduates have attended the same university and got the same degree, a privately-schooled graduate is still 8 per cent more likely to get a top job than a state-schooled one. Mr Milburn added: ‘Social mobility relies on people across the income spectrum being able to move up and get on. ‘We have a twin problem in our country:  middle class aspirations and working class opportunities to advance are both being thwarted.’ Commission analysis suggested that some of the career advantage for privately-educated graduates comes from having social connections that state-educated graduates are less likely to enjoy. But it found that most of the gap is unexplained. 10.5% of all graduates work in a top professional job, while privately educated graduates are 6 percentage points more likely than state school graduates to work in these jobs . Mr Milburn said the expansion of the middle classes would help more people to break through into the top of society. He said: ‘A twin solution is needed: we need to break open the closed shop at the top of British society and expand the middle. ‘It should be our country’s ambition to create a bigger middle class with more avenues for advancement. A growing middle-class is the foundation for a more mobile country.’ Mr Milburn outlined a five-point policy agenda, involving expanding early years education; paying the best teachers more for working in disadvantaged areas; opening up universities to a wider pool of talent and making vocational education a national priority; increasing the minimum wage; and expanding entry to the professions by getting firms to recruit from a wider range of universities and ending unpaid internships.","Graduates who went to private schools still dominate modern Britain .

"Living in a wealthy country doesn’t necessarily mean you will be happier, according to a study. Researchers found that once a nation’s gross domestic product surpasses £22,200 per person, individual happiness begins to nosedive – as the worry of ‘keeping up with the Joneses’ kicks in. The researchers said these high expectations in the world’s wealthiest countries were to blame for creating dissatisfaction among citizens. The British study compared per capita GDP with data on life satisfaction gathered from the World Values Survey. Wealth doesn't pay: Once a country's GDP per person tops £22,200 per person, the level of the nation's individual happiness starts to drop . In the poorest countries happiness rises as a country’s wealth increases and citizens are able to afford their basic needs. People in countries with a GDP per capita of below £4,100 were 12 per cent less likely to report the highest level of life satisfaction than those in countries where it reached £11,100. However, beyond a level of £12,600 per person, the link between increasing prosperity and happiness is much less marked. Between this level and the very highest GDP per capita level £33,000, the probability of reporting the top level of life satisfaction changes by no more than two per cent. Satisfaction peaked at £22,200, after which it appeared to dip in the world’s richest nations. It means Britons, with a per capita GDP of around £22,800, should be fairly satisfied with their lives. Lead researcher Dr Eugenio Proto, of Warwick University, said: ‘Whether wealth can buy a country’s happiness is a major question for governments. Many policy-makers, including in the UK, are interested in official measures of national well-being. Satisfaction: Graphic shows how happiness declines in countries with a gross domestic product of £22,100 per capita . 'Our new analysis has one very surprising finding which has not been reported before – that life satisfaction appears to dip beyond a certain level of wealth. ‘In our study we see evidence that this is down to changes in the aspiration levels of people living in the richest countries. ‘As countries get richer, higher levels of GDP lead to higher aspiration. There is a sense of keeping up with the Joneses as people see wealth and opportunity all around them and aspire to having more. ‘But this aspiration gap – the difference between actual income and the income we would like – eats away at life-satisfaction levels. ‘In other words, what we aspire to becomes a moving target and one which moves away faster in the richest countries, causing the dip in happiness we see in our analysis.’ Contrast: . Based on the findings, residents of wealthier nations such as . Switzerland, pictured, should be less content than their UK . counterparts. But a separate UN study ranked the country in the top five . of most satisfied nations, while Britain was ranked in 22nd place . The findings, published in journal Public Library of Science ONE, seem to confirm the Easterlin Paradox – that the link between life satisfaction and GDP is more or less flat in richer countries. But the study seemed to go further in suggesting a small drop in life satisfaction once countries go beyond a certain level of prosperity. Based on the findings, residents of wealthier nations such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway should be less content than their UK counterparts because of the higher GDP per person. But a separate UN study published earlier this year found all three countries rank in the top five most satisfied nations, while Britain was ranked in 22nd place.","A British study compared per capita GDP with data on life satisfaction .

"Nick Clegg's £2.5billion pupil premium has failed to narrow the gap between the achievements of the poorest schoolchildren and their wealthier counterparts . Underprivileged pupils fell further behind better off children last year despite Nick Clegg’s flagship policy to narrow the exam gap between them. The gulf widened in 72 out of 152 local authorities in a year despite extra funding from the pupil premium policy, according to Left-wing think-tank Demos. This included 66 where the difference was larger than before the premium was introduced. The analysis was based on the number of pupils gaining five or more GCSEs with a C grade or higher, including English and maths. The achievement gap is measured by the difference between the results of those pupils receiving free school meals and those whose parents pay for their children’s school dinners. Last summer’s exam results revealed it had reached 26.7 percentage points across England, up from 26.4 points in 2011-12. In 2010-11 it was 27.5 percentage points. But if inner London is removed – where the difference closed from 18.9 percentage points to 18.6 points over three years – the average gap in 2012-13 rises to 29.5 points. The capital has benefited from another initiative, the London Challenge, which has improved academic results for poorer children by pouring millions of pounds into schools. The lack of progress made nationwide since the £2.5billion-a-year pupil premium was introduced in April 2011 is an embarrassment for the Deputy Prime Minister, who included it in the 2010 Lib Dem manifesto. It comes just a week after another of . his policies, to double the number of free nursery places for deprived . two-year-olds, was criticised for threatening to lower standards unless . it was delayed. The Sutton Trust education charity . warned many of the extra staff needed would be former childminders, who . tend to have lower qualifications than nursery workers. The . pupil premium was introduced in April 2011. At present, the scheme provides primaries with an extra £953 for each child on free school meals and secondaries with £900 for each such pupil. Exam results from last year show that in 72 out of 152 local authorities the 'attainment gap' widened, and in 66 the difference was greater than before the premium was brought in . The widest gaps were found in the South East, with 42.5 per cent in Wokingham, Berkshire, and 39.6 per cent in Buckinghamshire. London . had the three smallest gaps - 4.2 per cent in Kensington and Chelsea, . 7.7 per cent in Southwark and 9.5 per cent in Lambeth. Ian . Wybron, an education specialist at the think tank Demos, said: 'The . attainment gap has been a difficult nut to crack in recent years. 'The . pupil premium is supposed to finally close it and is a good policy in . theory.' A separate report out today says social class is still . 'exerting a powerful influence' on the skills of English adults. The Institute of Education in London said the attainment gap that opens up at school carries on into adulthood. It . added: 'The relationship between parental background and adult literacy . and numeracy among those aged 16 to 24 is stronger in England than in . all other countries except the Slovak Republic.' A . Department for Education spokesman said that since 2010 the achievement . gap had fallen faster than at any time since 2002. ‘We are taking . decisive action to support disadvantaged pupils and close that . unacceptable gap,’ he added.","In 72 of 152 local authorities, the gap between grades of underprivileged children and their wealthier counterparts got worse last year .

"When it comes to Christmas, it seems you are never too old to take part in the festivities. Hanging out a stocking for Santa is not just for the children, with a third of adults under the age of 55 admitting they still leave theirs near the tree each year. And nearly one in every six adults pens a letter to Father Christmas, while one in five adults visits a grotto to visit him and his elves in person. Family time: For many Christmas involves making bog day special for their young ones, but some adults never grow out of their own festive routines . The survey of 2,500 adults also found that many of us remain big kids at heart, with one in three of 25-34 year olds given an advent calendar by their parents. We also remain fans of timeless traditions, with the research revealing the most special Christmas moment for adults is decorating the tree and seeing the Christmas lights being switched on. Where's mine?: One in six adults revealed they still write letter to Father Christmas . When it comes to food, 52 per cent think their family roast is unbeatable. As a result, more than half of cooks follow their mum’s Christmas recipes to the letter, while 50 per cent of us follow the same Christmas day schedule we enjoyed growing up. Tony Berry, from the National Trust, which carried out the poll, said: ‘Our research highlights how important traditions are to families at Christmas time, and so this year, National Trust places around the UK will be rekindling the magic of a family Christmas with events that embrace traditions old and new. 'Whether carolling, making your own decorations or mince pie tasting, our Christmas activities are the perfect way to enjoy some of the nation’s favourite customs - whatever your age!’ The conservation charity is inviting everyone to share in the magic of festive traditions old and new, as National Trust venues will be decked out with Christmas sparkle for all the family to enjoy. Over the yuletide season special events will take place across many of its sites, bringing spirit of Christmas to life, from food and crafts to winter lights displays and atmospheric grottoes. The survey also asked respondents to give their top ten special Christmas traditions, here are the findings: . 1. Decorating the tree . 2. Seeing Christmas lights . 3.

"'Great crime': Tristram Hunt says his party created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils . Labour created a culture of low expectations for state school pupils, Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, has admitted. He said it was a ‘great crime’ that the last government had failed to pushed children more than simply aim for them to achieve a C grade at GCSE level. He also admitted that exams had been dumbed down in recent years, saying ‘yes, there are elements of grade inflation’. Labour now wants to introduce licences for teachers, stripping them of their right to be in the classroom if they fail assessments carried out every five years. In a startlingly frank admission, Mr Hunt said: ‘The great crime was an awful lot of effort being put on kids getting a C at GCSE, then not going further. There should be no limits - the system should be saying how far can this child go?’ Schools were too focused on the pass grade, ‘C’, because of its significance in league tables. He said that education should not just be about exam results. ‘What do people who send their children to private school want? It’s not just smaller class sizes. It’s the playing fields and the after-school stuff like music and drama because they help to build confidence and character.’ He told the Times: ‘We need to work out how we can generate all those elements for everyone within a broad education and value them alongside academic rigour.’ Labour would not shut surviving grammar schools but Mr Hunt said their social mix should be questioned. ‘If they are simply about merit why do we see the kind of demographics and class make-up within them?’ Instead of focusing on a handful of specialist schools, he called for the whole system to be more aspirational. A source close to Mr Gove said that Mr Hunt was ‘right’ to acknowledge mistakes with league tables, adding: ‘We’re getting rid of the five A* to C league-table measure that lay behind it. In future, league tables will be based on progress across eight subjects - so no more focus on the C/D borderline.’ Labour has also revived its plans to licence teachers in the same way that doctors and lawyers are regulated. Changes: The party have also outlined plans to licence teachers in the same was as medics and lawyers (library photo) ‘You need a critical mass of good teachers,’ Mr Hunt said. ‘The quality of an education system cannot be greater than the quality of its teachers.’ Under his plans, teachers would have their lessons assessed by other teachers to demonstrate they were keeping pace. A new Royal College of Teaching would supervise the licencing regime. He said while bad teachers could currently be fired, there was a lot of ‘recycling’ where they were simply hired by another school. ‘There is usually a collection of teachers who are not at the cutting edge and this is a check upon that. If a teacher has left one school but then gets a renewed enthusiasm, great, but they would need to pass the re-licensing a s a sign of confidence.’ Mr Hunt, who has been tipped as a future leader, was privately educated at £15,000-a-year University College School in North London and has a PhD from Cambridge. He has previously said he would not rule out sending his own children to private school, although his son currently attends a state school in London. Mr Hunt favours a return to the ‘basics’ in education and wants more children to read the classics and study Latin.","Tristam Hunt, shadow education secretary, says Labour failed pupils .

"Russia's leading state television company fired an entire department today after its facebook page lauded Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels as a 'great' figure alongside Winston Churchill. 'We apologise to our readers for the unethical publication,' said VGTRK media group after a public outcry. The scandal erupted after Kremlin-controlled Vesti-24 news channel on Monday published a montage of quotes about Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, to mark the 90th anniversary of the death of the Soviet Union's founder this month. Russian TV station Vesti 24 posted this picture of Nazi Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels on its facebook page today on a list of 'great men' Goebbels, the Third Reich's fascist ideologue, was cited as praising Lenin for 'leading' the Russian people 'from suffering' - and to freedom. Other 'great men' on the list included British wartime leader Churchill as well as Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Einstein. Lenin's successor Josef Stalin was also included. The inclusion of Goebbels led to a furious backlash readers of the Facebook page which is followed by 1.1 million people. By Tuesday night, the Nazi had been dropped from the list, though Stalin - a figure revered by some older Russians - remained. Because of the scandal 'we . announce that our Social Media Marketing team has been fired in its . entirety', stated the company. The page has now been removed . Goebbels (left) appeared on the state TV station's facebook page . on a list of 'great men' alongside Winston Churchill (right), Mahatma . Gandhi, and Albert Einstein. It was unclear if the posting was a deliberate act to cause embarrassment at the media giant or an unintentional blunder. The company is seen as a mouthpiece of the Kremlin, part of a tightly controlled Russian media which strongly backs President Vladimir Putin. Opposition photographer and popular blogger Dmitry Aleshkovsky described VGTRK's main news show as 'Goebbels' television,' in a Facebook comment. The company's deputy general director Dmitry Kiselyov was also recently named head of Russia Today, a new state news agency established in an apparent bid to improve the country's battered international image. Another television station caused controversy by debating whether the Russians should ave surrendered to the Nazis during the siege of Leningrad (pictured) The Goebbels quote was published on the 70th anniversary of one the Russian people's greatest collective sacrifices, the end of the Siege of Leningrad, during which more than 800,000 people perished from hunger as they repelled Hitler's onslaught. Another channel, privately-run TV Rain, outraged viewers - especially the elderly - in a separate incident with a phone-in on whether Leningrad, now St Petersburg, should have surrendered to the Nazis. The channel  issued an immediate apology, saying it had not intended to offend veterans. Attempts to whitewash the Nazis often provoke understandable anger in the former Soviet Union, a country which saw the loss of up to 27 million in the Second World War.","Russian state TV channel put a list of 'great men' on its facebook page .

"Driver: Samantha Pitcher, 28, has been spared jail killing a grandfather in a horror road crash - just seconds after she was distracted by a text message . A mother-of-three has been spared jail for killing a grandfather in a horror road crash - just seconds after she was distracted by a text message. Samantha Pitcher, 28, crashed into partially-sighted David Wright, 74, and his wife Pauline as they crossed a road near their home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, with their son and grandchildren. The elderly man died from horrific injuries, while his wife of 51 years was left seriously injured. But now, Pitcher has walked free from court after being found guilty of causing Mr Wright's death by careless driving. Pitcher, also from Lowestoft, was driving on the A12 on February 18 last year when she received a text message on her mobile phone, Ipswich Crown Court heard yesterday. Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Wright were crossing the road with their family after going for a meal at the Foxburrow Beefeater Grill. Mr Wright was walking with a white reflective stick and holding on to his wife's arm when Pitcher crashed into them just nine seconds later, the court heard. The couple's son, Howard, was walking ahead with his two children when he heard a 'short screech of tyres', followed by a 'massive crack'. He turned round to see a scene of absolute horror - his mother was lying on the kerb, while his father was under Pitcher's car. Mr Wright, who had lost most of his sight due to a genetic condition, died from devastating injuries following the crash at around 9pm. Meanwhile, Mrs Wright was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing treatment for multiple fractures and now has to use a walking frame. Scene: The mother-of-three crashed into partially-sighted David Wright, 74, and his wife Pauline as they crossed the A12 (pictured) near their home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, with their son and grandchildren . Tributes: The elderly man died from horrific injuries, while his wife of 51 years was left seriously injured. Above, floral tributes to Mr and Mrs Wright, who were knocked down by Pitcher's car after going for a family meal . At an earlier trial, Pitcher, who has three young children, pleaded not guilty to a charge of causing death by careless driving. However, she was later convicted by a jury. Mr Wright, who was active in his local community, belonged to Gunton Park Residents' Association and Gunton Woodland Community project. He was also a member of Lowestoft Live Arts group for the visually impaired. Sentencing Pitcher to a two-year driving ban, Judge Rupert Overbury told her: 'It is of significance that nine seconds before the attack your mobile phone received a text message that was the last in a series of messages. Crash site: Pitcher was driving on the A12 (pictured) on February 18 last year when she received a text on her mobile phone. Nine seconds later, she crashed into Mr and Mrs Wright as they crossed the road with relatives . 'I'm satisfied that the jury's verdict was on the inescapable conclusion that you were somehow distracted by that message. 'Although you didn't read it by picking it up you could scan the message across the screen very quickly as your telephone was positioned by the gear stick.' He added: 'It is plain you were distracted by the telephone and your eyes moved off the road for a few seconds which unfortunately was long enough not to see Mr and Mrs Wright crossing the road.' Jonathan Goodman, defending, said Pitcher was 'utterly remorseful' over her actions. 'From the moment she stepped out of the car her life, like the victims', has changed forever,' he said. 'She remains traumatised by her actions and the consequences of them. She sends her deepest condolences to the family.' Speaking after the sentencing, Sergeant Bob Patterson, of Suffolk Police's Serious Collision Investigation Team, said: 'This was a tragic incident witnessed by Mr and Mrs Wright's son and grandchildren. 'Throughout the year we campaign and enforce against what we refer to as the ""fatal four"" - speeding, drink-driving, not wearing a seatbelt and using a mobile phone whilst driving. 'These four are considered responsible for many fatal collisions.' Case Pitcher walked free from Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) yesterday after being found guilty of causing death by careless driving. She was handed a two-year driving ban, as well as an 18-month community order . He added: 'In this case we were able to provide evidence that Samantha Pitcher had received a text on her mobile phone around the time of the collision. 'Without providing any explanation as to why she collided with Mr and Mrs Wright, it is possible she may have been distracted and now has to live with these consequences. 'Hopefully this sentencing will make others think again about the dangers of being potentially distracted by a mobile phone while driving.' Pitcher was also handed an 18-month community order and sentenced to 240 hours' unpaid work.","Samantha Pitcher, 28, was distracted by new text message while driving .

"They say you can't have too much of a good thing, but try telling that to the husband who's divorcing Britain's wealthiest female entrepreneur. Former maths teacher Tony Hawken, 57, is splitting from Xiu Li, 51, because he says he is fed up with being wealthy. The couple were catapulted into the world of the super-rich after Li's idea of building shopping centres in disused Chinese air-raid shelters earned her an estimated £1.1billion by 2011 and placed her on The Sunday Times Rich List. Tony Hawken, 57, is divorcing his wife Xiu Li, 51, Britain's wealthiest woman entrepreneur, because he says he doesn't like being rich and is 'not in the habit' of spending lots of money . The pair traded up their semi-detached home in South Norwood, London, and bought a £1.5million house in Surrey. Li, who is now worth $1.2billion (£700million) according to Forbes, quickly settled into a life which included sipping a £900 bottle of wine on a luxurious yacht. However, Mr Hawken says he felt more comfortable getting lunch in his local Wetherspoon's. Despite his sudden wealth he continued to buy books from charity shops, and shunned designer clothes. In an interview with The Times, he said: 'I think it made me uncomfortable because I'm not in the habit, I don't like spending lots of money — I've been brought up that way. 'Until recently I was never a wealthy person. I've been moderately comfortable because I have been careful with my money.' Now the couple have decided to part, Mr Hawken will walk away with just £1million, but says it will be enough for him. He added: 'I have got a settlement which is not great, but it's enough for me because I don't have an extravagant lifestyle. I won't have to work if I'm careful.' On a recent trip to China, Mr Hawken said his wife took him on a yacht and treated him to a £900 bottle of wine, but he prefers his local Wetherspoon pub (file picture) 'I'm getting a pittance when you consider her potential wealth, but I don't really want to fight it.' Mr Hawken met Li on a blind date while he was still a teacher and she was studying English. The couple married, but as Li's business took off the couple spent more and more time apart. Mr Hawken says the couple have spent most of the relationship apart. Far from driving them apart, Mr Hawken believes the distance kept them together, and says they would have divorced a long time ago if they were under the same roof. Mr Hawken says his only regret is not getting a divorce sooner, but he didn't push for it over fears it would affect the couple's teenage son William, now 17. Mr Hawken no longer teaches full-time, but instead gives free tuition to under-privileged children. Li owns 22 shopping centres and is president of football team Guizhou Renhe, who are third in the Chinese Super League.","Tony Hawken, 57, is divorcing millionairess wife Xiu Li, 51, after 21 years .

Anelka faces a five match ban for performing Dieudonne's 'quenelle' gesture - a hand and arm movement which some say is a reverse Nazi salute. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala (right) will support the West Bromwich Albion player at a press conference in London . But Dieudonne, 47, said he will ‘prove to everybody’ that he is ‘by no means anti-Jewish, or racist in any way'. He added: 'There will be a press conference in London, and a show - everybody will be able to make up their own mind. 'Nicolas Anelka has my full backing - I am coming to Britain to support him. 'Both myself and Nicolas Anelka are Frenchmen of African descent. ‘The quenelle is our way of expressing anger against the establishment, and especially the establishment which allowed slavery to flourish. Uproar: Anelka's gesture, the quenelle, has caused conflict in the UK and France over whether it is racist . 'We are brothers in humanity. Nicolas is a prince as far as I am concerned. I will always support my friend.' Anelka has been charged by the Football Association with making a gesture which is considered abusive or indecent - an offence which carries a minimum five-game ban. Last Thursday, Anelka denied the charge and requested a personal hearing to defend his case. Anelka's case has received the qualified backing of Roger Cukierman, head of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF) and vice-president of the World Jewish Congress. While 'disappointed' by Anelka's goal celebration, Mr Cukierman said: 'In a place that has no significance for Jews, it is merely an anti-establishment gesture which I feel does not warrant any harsh sanction'.

Eric Zemmour a prominent Jewish writer, said: 'It is ridiculous to turn Dieudonne into someone who is nostalgic for the Third Reich. France is first and foremost about freedom of speech.' Mr Zemmour said any attempt to ban Dieudonne's shows was 'to deny the entire liberal tradition of French law.' Dieudonne's last visit to Britain was in 2010, when he appeared in front of a large of audience of mainly French expatriates at a London theatre. He argues that his act is full of risqui humour about a range of minority groups, including black people and Muslims. Dieudonne, who was brought up as a Christian, said that one of the reasons Anelka is being made a scapegoat in Britain is because he is a black Muslim who drives a Ferrari.","M'bala M'bala will speak at press conference in London to support Anelka .

"Seven out of ten voters want immigration reduced or stopped completely, according to a poll released last night. The YouGov survey found strong public concern about immigration, with people saying only the economy will be more important in the 2015 general election. The poll also revealed six out of ten people believe it is essential that migrants should be able to speak English, while 67 per cent think British people should be given priority for jobs. Immigration: A poll for Channel 5 has found 70 per cent of people want fewer or no migrants to Britain . Net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating - rose to 182,000 in the year to June, up from 167,000 in the previous 12 months. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to get this figure below 100,000 in the current Parliament. According to the ONS, there are now 785,000 adults in the UK who are ‘non-proficient’ in English. The poll was conducted for the Channel 5’s The Big British Immigration Row: Live, which will be screened tonight at 8pm. Campaigners said the government must now listen and take firmer steps to reduce the number of incomers. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch, said: ‘This poll makes it crystal clear that the immigration lobby have decisively lost the battle for public opinion. Crossing the border: 182,000 more people came to Britain than left it in the year to June 2013 . ‘The public’s common sense has seen through their arguments. The political system must now respond.’ Some 70 per cent of voters said they want immigration reduced (49 per cent) or stopped completely (21 per cent). Almost half of people who support the Liberal Democrats - the party most in favour of immigration - want a cut of halt in the number of new arrivals. The poll also found 42 per cent of all respondents said immigration will be ‘important’ in deciding how they vote, putting the issue ahead of crime, the NHS, welfare, housing and Europe. Some 42 per cent of those surveyed also feel that immigration is bad for the economy, compared to 25 per cent who said it was good. Fight: The channel's Big Benefits Row featured a spat between Benefits Street's 'White Dee' and Katie Hopkins . A total of 44 per cent believe that immigrants do not contribute to the British way of life, compared to 39 per cent who gave a positive response, and nearly two-thirds of the country is worried about immigration levels. Six out of then believe that people coming to live and work in this country should wait a longer period of time - more than a year - before using free public services such as the NHS. A majority of supporters of all three major parties, plus UKIP, said it was vital that migrants should learn English. Those who could speak English had a lower employment rate - 48.3 per cent - and were more than three times as likely to report no qualifications (46.2 per cent) as those with English as their main language. Channel 5’s director of programming, Ben Frow said: ‘These survey results demonstrate that immigration is at the top of the agenda in today’s Britain.’","Poll was commissioned for Channel 5's Big British Immigration Row: Live .

"Worth millions of pounds, it has been dubbed the créme de la créme of string music. But a Stradivarius could be no more special than a bog-standard violin, according to a new study. Researchers found the world's leading violinsts could not distinguish between the antique Italian instrument and its cheaper counterpart. Scroll down for video . Expensive: Worth millions of pounds, it has been dubbed the créme de la créme of string music. But a Stradivarius violin (pictured) could be no more special than a bog-standard version, according to a new study . This is despite the Stradivarius having a longstanding reputation for being tonally superior to anything you can buy today. Most musicians even prefer contemporary violins which cost a fraction of the price, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported. French and U.S. researchers asked ten experts to play 12 violins - six new and the others old, including five by Antonio Stradivari - to find out which were superior. Cheaper version: Researchers found the world's leading violinsts could not distinguish between the antique Italian instrument and its cheaper counterpart (picture) They blindfolded the participants, before testing them each for an hour and a quarter in a rehearsal theatre, and then again in a 300-seat concert hall. At the end, six selected a new violin as their preference, with one of them emerging as a clear overall winner. All of the soloists added that the cheap version was better than their own bespoke instruments. Violin acoustics expert Professor Claudia Fritz, of the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, and her colleagues caused a storm four years ago when they came up with the same findings in a similar study. But that study only involved tested six violins in a hotel room, and 21 participants of various levels. Researchers decided to extend it to include maestros performing in more familiar conditions. Violins crafted by Antonio Stradivari or Giuseppe Guarneri 'del Gesu' can fetch millions of pounds. Many violinists truly believe these instruments are better than newly made violins, and several scientists have tried to work out why. Some have suspected the unusually dense wood, harvested from Alpine spruces that grew during an Ice Age. Meanwhile, others have pointed the finger at the varnish, or the chemicals that Stradivari used to treat the wood. But Prof Fritz and study co author Joseph Curtin, who makes violins in Ann Arbor, believe there is no secret because the 'superior' sound is a myth. Prof Fritz said: 'The violins of Stradivari, Guarneri 'del Gesu', and other Italian makers of the 17th and 18th centuries are widely believed to possess playing qualities that are both immediately discernable to experienced players and not found in new instruments. 'Over the past two centuries, numerous playing and listening tests have challenged this belief by pitting new violins against old. Findings: Most musicians even prefer contemporary violins which cost a lot less, the study found (file image) 'Although results often favoured new instruments, the tests typically lacked sufficient rigour for the results to stand as scientific evidence.' Since the early 19th century, numerous tests have questioned the alleged superiority of the old Italian violins. Time and time again, listeners have failed to distinguish between the sound of the old and new instruments. But critics have been quick to pick holes in these studies. Antique: Antonio Stradivari lived in Cremona between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos, guitars, violas, and harps. It is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime. Above, a Stradivari violin . In most cases, the listeners were not . experts, and the players and researchers knew which violin was which - a . flaw that could have biased the results. The latest findings claim to have closed these holes. Prof Fritz said: 'Some studies open new fields for investigation. This study attempts to close a perennially fruitless one, the search for the ""secrets of Stradivari"". 'Great efforts have been made to explain why instruments by Stradivari and other Old Italian makers sound better than high quality new violins, but without providing scientific evidence that this is in fact the case. 'Doing so requires that experienced violinists demonstrate both a general preference for Old Italian violins and the ability to reliably distinguish them from new ones. 'The current study, the second of its kind again shows that first rate soloists tend to prefer new instruments and are unable to distinguish old from new at better than chance levels.' Antonio Stradivari lived in Cremona between 1644 and 1737 and also crafted cellos, guitars, violas, and harps. It is estimated he made up to 1,100 instruments during his lifetime and about 650 survive, including around 500 violins.","Stradivarius could be no better than bog-standard violin, says new study .

"Republicans on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee won a vote Wednesday demanding the Justice Department criminally prosecute Lois Lerner, the former Internal Revenue Service official at the center of a scheme to slow-walk tax-exempt applications from conservative groups. They claim she committed three federal crimes punishable by a total of 11 years in prison. The panel voted 23-14, along party lines, to approve a letter instructing Attorney General Eric Holder to charge Lerner and prosecute her in court. The Justice Department has said it already has its own investigation into the conduct of Lerner and other Obama administration officials in what has become known as the 'tea party scandal.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner (R) now stands accused of violating the constitutional rights of conservatives who applied -- and waited -- for the tax-exempt status that liberal groups easily won . Ways and Means Committee chair Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, is retiring next year, making the Lois Lerner matter one of his final packages to wrap up . Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, has told reporters that his client  met with DOJ officials and answered their questions weeks ago, but has heard nothing since. President Obama seemed to pre-empt that inquiry's result on Super Bowl Sunday, declaring in a televised interview with Fox news Channel host Bill o'Reilly that there is 'not even a smidgen of corruption' at the IRS. Republicans are hopping mad. Lerner has twice refused to answer questions in House hearings, claiming her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Congress has determined that she waived that right in May 2013 be defending herself in an opening statement. The congressional committee met in secret because some of the material being debated consisted of private tax information protected by Section 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code. They approved a criminal referral letter charging her with three crimes. Lerner 'used her position to improperly influence agency action against only conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law,' the committee said in a statement. 'She showed extreme bias and prejudice towards conservative groups.' She 'impeded official investigations by providing misleading statements in response to questions from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,' the statement continues. And 'Lerner risked exposing, and may actually have disclosed, confidential taxpayer information, in apparent violation of Internal Revenue Code section 6103 by using her personal email to conduct official business.' Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, has broad discretion and could choose to do nothing. He could also prosecute Lerner in federal court. Tea Party Patriots, one of the groups the IRS targeted beginning in 2010 – with letters signed by Lerner – is hoping Holder will act. 'It's time to send a message to this administration that Americans will not stand for this kind of Banana Republic thuggery,' said the group's co-founder Jenny Beth Martin. '[H]istory should never forget the shame brought upon this nation by the Obama administration’s lawless targeting of American citizens based on their beliefs,' she added. Walls closing in? Lerner could receive 11 years in prison if the DOJ were to successfully prosecute her . One-two punch: While Ways and Means presses for a criminal trial, Rep Darrell Issa's House Oversight Committee is prepared a Contempt of Congress resolution against Lerner . Before her hasty retirement last fall, Lerner headed the IRS office in charge of vetting and monitoring nonprofits whose missions entitle them to income tax waivers. Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, released a lengthy timeline on Wednesday outlining Republicans' version of Lerner's activity. Predictably, reactions to the latest step in the scandal were split. 'The evidence is clear and compelling that Lois Lerner, at the bidding of political special interest groups, abused her powerful position at the IRS to violate the civil rights of taxpayers,' Texas Republican Rap. Kevin Brady said Wednesday. 'While many of my constituents believe the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder will turn a blind eye to the corruption at the Internal Revenue Service, I call on the Justice Department to prosecute this case.' Democrat Sandy Levin of Michigan framed the issue as an election-year stunt. 'It now seems clear that Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee have decided that they do not want to be left behind in the Republican campaign to declare this a scandal and keep it going until November.' GOP leaders in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are running a parallel investigation. They are expected to vote Thursday on a motion to recommend a Contempt of Congress citation by the full House of Representatives. That measure could be used to persuade a federal judge to order Lerner to testify before Congress.","House Ways and Means Committee tells DOJ that Lerner violated tea party groups' constitutional rights and misled investigators .

"Allegations: X-Men director Bryan Singer has been accused of sexually abusing an underage boy in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Hawaii . Just a month before his next film X-Men: Days of Future Past is set to release, director Bryan Singer has been accused of child molestation. According to documents filed in Hawaii, 31-year-old Michael Egan claims Singer used his power in the entertainment industry to sexually exploit him when he was an underage teen actor striking it out in Los Angeles. Now Egan is suing the director, for $300,000 for the 'catastrophic psychological and emotional injuries' he says he suffered, the documents filed Wednesday explain. Representing Egan is attorney Jeff Herman, who plans on filing more sex abuse cases against film industry execs soon. 'Hollywood has a problem with the sexual exploitation of children. This is the first of many cases I will be filing to give these victims a voice and to expose the issue,' Mr Herman said in a press release. In the suit, Egan claims the abuse started when he  was 14 or 15 and moved to Los Angeles with his family to start his acting career. It was in LA that he was introduced to another Hollywood powerplayer, Marc Collins-Rector and his lover Chad Shackley, he claims. Egan was invited to one of Collins-Rector's 'notorious' parties held at his home, dubbed the M&C Estate in Encino, California. According to the suit, the parties were well-known in Hollywood and attended by investors in Collin-Rector's company who lured young boys as part of a 'sordid sex ring'. Collins-Rector eventually faced justice himself, admitting in court in 2004 that he lured five minors across state lines for sexual purposes. While these parties allegedly 'featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys', Egan maintains he 'never freely' consented to the advances. It was two or three months after Collins-Rector began allegedly abusing Egan that he was introduced to Singer at one of the parties. Egan was in the pool when Collins-Rector approached him and ordered him out to hug Singer. Egan was nude, as per the rules of the house pool, so when he hugged Singer the director allegedly 'grabbed his bare buttocks'. Egan claims the three then went to a jacuzzi where he was ordered to sit on Collins-Rector's lap before being passed off to Singer. Scroll down for video . Promises: Singer has been directing X-men movies since 2000. He allegedly promised the then 17-year-old victim a role in one of the movies back in 1999. Above, a poster for Singer's latest film, due out next month . Egan claims Singer brought him an alcoholic beverage, even though he was under age, and then promised him a part in one of the upcoming movies he was directing. He spoke about the people at the party, saying 'this group' controls Hollywood. According to the lawsuit, Singer told Egan he was 'sexy' and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him. The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but the then-minor says he resisted. That allegedly caused Singer to push the boy's head under water. When he finally got up for air, Singer again demanded he perform oral sex and when he refused for the second time, Singer took him out of the pool and forcibly sodomized him, Egan says. The suit also refrences two trips Egan went on with Singer to Hawaii when he was 17 years old. Egan stayed at Paul Mitchell's resort in Kailua, Hawaii where he says Singer provided on multiple occasions cocaine,  xanax, rohypnol, as well as other drugs and alcohol. Scene of the crime? Egan was allegedly taken on two trips to Hawaii with Singer where they stayed at the Paul Mitchell resort, entrance pictured above. However, those claims are now in question . He even promised him a part in an X-Men movie he was directing. Singer first started directing the comic book adaptations in 2000. In 1999, when the Hawaii trips happened, the director would have been around 33 years old. Egan and his lawyer are scheduled to hold a press conference about the new lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles. They've filed in Hawaii, however, since the statue of limitations to file a suit is longer there and would have expired next week. In response, Marty Singer, a lawyer for the director, said 'it is obvious that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity,' ahead of the film's release. 'The claims made against Bryan Singer are completely without merit. We are very confident that Bryan will be vindicated in this absurd and defamatory lawsuit.'","The 48-year-old director was hit with a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Hawaii .

"A secondary school in Birmingham has been accused of praising senior Al-Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki during assemblies. Two members of staff at Park View Academy claimed a senior colleague had endorsed the teachings of the now dead American-born leader of Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula, and that a viewpoint politically sympathetic to the terrorist group had been promoted in an assembly. The Department of Education confirmed that several schools in the area - thought to include Park View - are under investigation amid claims hard-line Muslims are trying to indoctrinate pupils. Park View Academy denies the allegations, which were made by anonymous members of staff who were speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme . Claims: The now dead American-born leader of Al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured) was allegedly praised by a senior member of Park View staff . Investigation: Park View School is one of a dozen believed to be subject to an official probe, but a governor at the school said it is being unfairly targeted . The two anonymous members of Park View staff reportedly insisted there was truth in the allegations that hardline Muslims had infiltrated the school. They added that non-Muslim members of staff were being isolated, male and female pupils were being segregated, and that nepotism was apparent in the hiring of new recruits. Allegations of radical Islamist infiltration of several schools in Birmingham, apparently including Park View, first came to light last month when a letter referring to a 'Trojan Horse' plot was sent to the local council, then leaked to the media. The source and authenticity of the letter remains unclear, but it has led to the Department of Education investigating financial records and interviewing staff members at 'more than 12 schools' in the area. Education Secretary Michael Gove is believed to have taken a personal interest in the investigation, which includes both faith schools and secular establishments. Claims that Park View Academy employed members of staff sympathetic to Al-Qaeda were raised during the first visit by a journalist to the school since the 'Trojan Horse' allegations were made. Allegations: Two members of staff at Park View Academy (pictured) in Birmingham claimed that a viewpoint politically sympathetic to Al-Qaeda had been promoted in an assembly . Fear: Anwar al-Awlaki - who died in 2011 - was a senior talent recruiter and motivator for Al-Qaeda. He was involved in planning terrorist operations for the Islamist militant group . During an interview Tahir Alam, chair . of governors at the school, insisted on accompanying reporter Sima . Kotecha at all times, and restricted her access to other members of . staff. Speaking of the . leaked letter and addressing claims he is the 'ringleader' of the . hardline Muslim takeover of the school, Mr Alam said: 'You can go round . the school, you can have a look at the school, and you will find there . is no evidence for these things whatsoever. 'So whatever practices that the school is observing, they are actually voluntary. None of them are prescribed - they are purely optional,' he added. Mr Alam - who has been a governor at Park View for 17 years and was also a pupil at the school, went on to say: 'I believe it is a witch hunt based on all sorts of false allegations which have been repeated over many weeks. 'I also believe it is motivated by anti-Muslim, anti-Islam sentiment that is also sort of feeding this frenzy,' he added. The Islamic call to prayer is said to be played in corridors at the self-described 'multi-faith school', which is predominantly staffed by Muslims of Pakistani parentage. Warning: Labour MP Khalid Mahmood has spoken of his fears that Muslim pupils are being indoctrinated by extremists at Birmingham schools . The majority of governers at the school are said to be followers of the Wahhabi movement - an ultra-conservative branch of Sunni Islam, according to Birmingham's Labour MP Khalid Mahmood. Mr Mahmood, who chairs the Tackling Terrorism All-Party Parliamentary Group and has long been a vocal critic of Park View Academy, said: 'The majority of kids are Sunni mainstream Muslims. It is an attempt at indoctrination. 'These are state schools, not Islamic. I . am very concerned at the way non-Muslim staff have been dealt with and . the effect on the children,' he added. He suggested that education officials had previously steered clear of getting involved in disputes with Muslim schools for fear of being dubbed racist. 'Council officers were in a difficult position where they either went along with it or were portrayed as anti-Islamic,' Mr Mahmood said.","Staff at Park View Academy accused colleagues of sympathy for Al-Qaeda .

"X-ray images of an unopened cardboard box have revealed a treasure trove of Christmas tins sent to British soldiers on the Western Front 100 years ago. A collector, who bought the unremarkable-looking box at auction on a hunch it may contain gift tins, didn't want to damage the box by opening it. So instead, he decided to X-ray it - with the scans revealing hundreds of tins stuffed with goodies such as chocolate, cigarettes and sweets inside. During the war, the tins were made in their thousands then shipped off by the Royals to soldiers fighting in the trenches over the first Christmas of the war in 1914. Hidden treasures: 81 bronze tins stuffed with cigarettes, pencils and sweets that was due to be sent to the troops on the Western Front in 1914 have been found in a sealed cardboard box by a collector (pictured) Gift: Thousands of tins, similar to this one pictured, were sent to troops in 1914. The five-inch boxes were paid for by the Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund - organised by George V's daughter Princess Mary . But one box never made it to its intended destination - and is now up for sale 100 years on for almost £30,000. The five-inch long tins were paid for by the Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund - a nationwide appeal for donations organised by George V’s daughter Princess Mary. It is thought that more than 355,000 were sent to troops in 1914, although due to the pressures put on the postal service some soldiers did not get theirs until 1916. By the end of the war the fund had raised £200,000 and had sent out 2.5 million boxes. Mystery surrounds the box for sale, which was bought by a collector of First World War memorabilia several years ago after he spotted it at auction. The collector, who was told the box had been found in Ireland, suspected the box had Christmas tins inside so had it X-rayed as he didn't want to open it. Inside: The collector, who bought the box at auction on a hunch it would contain the tins, didn't want to open the box - so he had it X-rayed (pictured) to see what was inside . Hidden treats: The scan showed the box was stuffed to the brim with the Christmas gift tins, pictured, which contained a Christmas card, sweets and chocolate . It will be opened for the first time by Lady Emma Kitchener, great-grandniece of military great Lord Kitchener, at the Chalke Valley History Festival near Salisbury, Wiltshire, later this month. A select amount of tins will be sold at the festival for £300 to £350 with the rest being auctioned in Onslows’ Great War sale in Dorset on July 9. A proportion of the proceeds will be donated to a services charity. Patrick Bogue, from Onslows auction house in Blandford, said: 'With Christmas 1914 approaching, George V’s daughter Princess Mary came up with the idea for a fund which would pay for presents for soldiers and sailors fighting on the front lines. 100 years: The box will finally be opened later this month by Lady Emma Kitchener at the Chalke Vallye History Festival in Salisbury. A number of the tins will be auctioned off for £300 - £350 during the event - with the proceeds going to charity . At the start of the conflict, British soldiers were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day. However, this was soon reduced as supply lines were disrupted due to naval and land blockades across Europe. Two years later in 1916, the meat ration was down to 6oz a day. Towards the end of the conflict, soldiers were lucky to get meat once every nine days. Some sources suggest the troops ate horse meat from animals killed on the front line. Some soldiers reportedly grew their own vegetables in the trenches - but few were successful. Instead, nettles and weeds were used in stews. Other goods provided included tea, bacon, cheese, jam and meat stews - all of which were tinned. Flour was scarce also, so ground-up vegetables were used as a substitute. In terms of equipment, every soldier was issued with a 1908 Pattern Webbing for carrying personal items. It included: A wide belt, left and right ammunition pouches each stocked with 75 rounds and an entrenching tool head. A water bottle carrier, a small haversack - including a knife and unused rations - and large pack were also supplied. A mess tin was contained inside a cloth buff-coloured khaki cover. 'She had wanted to do her bit and the campaign was very successful. 'It . was common belief that the war was going to be very quick and so . hundreds of thousands of these little tins with gifts inside were put . together. 'It was meant to be a one off but as we know now the war lasted a lot longer than anticipated. 'The fund continued to grow and so the boxes were sent to others helping the war effort such as young soldiers and nurses. 'There were a few types of box - the initial ones contained a packet of cigarettes and a pencil made from a shell casing while others got sweets and chocolate. 'The box was found in Ireland but we don’t know any more about its history. 'It is a complete mystery as to whether this box was simply surplus to requirements or if there is another reason why it never made it to the front line. 'Its seal is still intact which would suggest it has never been opened which is incredible in itself because the tins potentially have packets of cigarettes in them. 'The box has been X-rayed and it confirms these are the tins with the shell cartridge pencils inside. 'It is amazing to think they have spent the last 100 years undisturbed.' Chalke Valley History Festival runs from June 23 to 29. The box will be opened on June 28.","81 bronze tins containing cigarettes, pencils and sweets found by a collector .

"A council has said it will cancel a . village hall’s rate subsidy if it hosts a speech by British National . Party leader Nick Griffin. Mr Griffin is due to give a talk  at Baldslow Memorial Hall in  St Leonards, East Sussex, today. But Hastings Borough Council has told . those who run the hall they will have to repay the £376 they received . as a charity in rate relief if the speech goes ahead. Controversial: Nick Griffin's planned speech in St Leonards is at the centre of a storm between a village hall and its local council . However the council has been accused of trying to 'blackmail' the village hall. Hastings Borough Council leader Jeremy Birch said the local authority was 'committed to equality of opportunity and to community harmony. He added: 'We have no intention of providing financial subsidy to those who aim to undermine these principles.' BNP party spokesman Simon Darby said: 'It's quite beyond belief what they are trying to do. Payback: The people who run Baldslow Village Hall (pictured) have been told if they do not  withdraw the event they will have to repay a rate subsidy . 'They're basically seeking to tax people . who don't agree with the Labour Party, which is not really the British . way to do things. 'It's effectively blackmail, putting a gun to the people that run the hall by giving them a financial penalty if Nick is allowed to speak there. He's an MEP, he's not some person off the street.' 'Beyond belief': Simon Darby accused the council of trying to blackmail the village hall . Councillor Birch said he had been approached by members of the community who were unhappy at Mr Griffin's appearance. He went on: 'We have discretion about providing an element of business rate relief to charities. 'Here we have a charity that is providing a platform within its community building to the national leader of a political party committed to challenging these principles. 'If the charity wants to run a community facility for genuine community groups like Cubs, Scouts etc then it can withdraw the booking from the BNP and the council will reconsider the business rates.' Earlier this month Trinity College Dublin was forced into a U-turn on plans to have Mr Griffin join a debate on immigration. The university said it could not guarantee the safety and wellbeing of staff and students and warned the party leader he would not be allowed on its campus.","Organisers told to repay rate subsidy if Griffin's speech goes ahead .

"A mother has pulled her seven-year-old son out of school after teachers started pouring away his bottle of squash claiming it breached the school’s health policy. Sammie Riley, 25, started sending son Bailey to The Bewbush Academy in Crawley, West Sussex with bottles of squash because he doesn’t like the taste of water. However, she was shocked to discover teachers had been pouring the juice away and replacing it with water because the flavoured drink is against the school's health policy. Sammie Riley, 25, temporarily took her seven-year-old son Bailey out of The Bewbush Academy in Crawley, West Sussex (above) after staff started pouring away his bottle of squash because it was against school policy . After finding out her son’s drink was tipped away twice in one week, the mother-of-three decided to take action and kept him off school. She said: ‘The school have pulled me in about it and told me they have a no juice policy. ‘I kept him off school on July 2 and sent him back on the Thursday but again the staff had tipped his juice away and refilled it with water. I was absolutely fuming. ‘Bearing in mind it was a really hot week with temperatures of 26C outside, it must have been hitting 30C in the classrooms and my son was unable to drink. Headteacher Elizabeth Harrison said children could have non-fizzy drinks at break-times, but they must have nothing but water in lessons (file picture) ‘Bailey came home dehydrated with a really bad headache and I wasn't happy for him to go back to school. ‘I was livid that they have been tipping Bailey's drink away.’ Miss Riley spoke to the acting head and head of Year 2, but was told it was ‘water or nothing’. She was also told that staff had tried putting cucumber and lemon in the drinks to spruce up the water, which didn't work. The mother, who is now considering setting up a petition, has accused the school of double standards because they ban juice but hand out sherbet sticks and lollipops at the end of the week for ‘rewards’. She said: ‘It is part of their health policy but how is it helpful for my son to become dehydrated and unable to concentrate in lessons? ‘Of course I'd prefer him to drink water because it's healthier but at this stage I want him to drink rather than being left with nothing. ‘I don't think the school should me to make my son drink something he doesn't like. ‘The school is being totally ludicrous and contradicting its own health policy because they are giving out treats as rewards.’ Headteacher Elizabeth Harrison said parents are able to pack non-fizzy drinks for children to enjoy during break-times, but they must have nothing but water in lessons following advice from health professionals .","Sammie Riley sent son Bailey to school with squash as he doesn't like water .

"A Minnesota homeowner who shot and killed two teenagers during a break-in was convicted Tuesday of premeditated murder. Byron Smith had claimed he was simply defending himself during the break-in at his home in the small city of Little Falls on Thanksgiving Day 2012.  Smith's attorney said the 65-year-old was fearful after previous burglaries. But prosecutors argued that Smith waited in his basement and intended to kill the teens. A total of nine shots were fired at 17-year-old Nick Brady and 18-year-old Haile Kifer. Going to prison: Byron Smith was convicted Tuesday of murdering two teens on Thanksgiving Day 2012. Pictured above leaving court today after closing arguments . Jurors began deliberating Tuesday morning and within three hours had a verdict: Guilty on two counts each of first-degree and second-degree murder. Mothers of the teens cried as the verdicts were read, while Smith showed no emotion. Defense attorney Steve Meshbesher said he would appeal. The teens' killings stirred debate around the state and in Little Falls — a Mississippi River city of 8,000 about 100 miles northwest of Minneapolis — about how far a homeowner can go in responding to a threat. Minnesota law allows deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but one's actions must be considered reasonable under the circumstances. Lost life: Cousins Haile Kifer, 18 (left), and Nick Brady, 17 (right), were shot dead on Thanksgiving Day 2012 after breaking into Smith's home in Little Falls, Minnesota . Hunted: Smith claimed he killed the teens in self-defense, but prosecutors proved that he staked out in the basement of his home - waiting for burglars . Prosecutors said Smith's plan was set in motion on the morning of the killings, after Smith saw a neighbor whom he believed responsible for prior burglaries drive by. Prosecutors say Smith moved his truck to make it look like no one was home, and then settled into a chair in his basement with a book, energy bars, a bottle of water and two guns. Smith also set up a hand-held recorder on a bookshelf, which captured audio of the shootings — key evidence in the prosecution's case. Smith had also installed a surveillance system that recorded images of Brady trying to enter the house. The audio, which was played several times in court, captured the sound of glass shattering, then the sounds of Smith shooting Brady three times as he descended the basement stairs. Vermin: Audio recordings played in the trial revealed Smith calling the teens 'vermin' after shooting them dead in his basement. Pictured above leaving court on Tuesday . Time lapse: After killing the teens, he hid them in his house and waited a full day before telling a neighbor to call 911 about the break-in. Pictured above in court on Tuesday . Fighting: Smith's lawyer said they would be appealing the case. pictured above on Tuesday . Smith can be heard saying, ""You're dead."" Prosecutors said Smith put Brady's body on a tarp and dragged him into another room, then sat down, reloaded his weapon and waited. About 10 minutes later, Kifer came downstairs. More shots are heard on the recording, then Kifer's screams, with Smith saying, ""You're dying."" It's followed soon after by another shot, which investigators said Smith described as ""a good, clean finishing shot."" The teens were unarmed, but Smith's attorneys had said he feared they had a weapon. The tape continued to run, and Smith was heard referring to the teens as ""vermin."" Smith waited a full day before asking a neighbor to call police. The two cousins were active in athletics at two local high schools. They were also linked to a burglary the day before they were shot and killed, though the judge excluded evidence about their histories from the trial as irrelevant . Smith did not testify on his own behalf. Meshbesher highlighted previous burglaries on Smith's property, including one on October 27 that included the theft of weapons. A neighbor testified that Smith came to his door after that burglary and appeared very frightened. Meshbesher said Smith wrote a memo to the Morrison County Sheriff's Office on October 29 asking them to investigate. Meshbesher said in his closing arguments that the teens would still be alive if they hadn't broken into Smith's house. He also said Smith had a legal right to use deadly force to defend himself. Witness: Smith's neighbor Bill Anderson is seen in court on Tuesday. He testified twice during the trial . Changing his story: Anderson ended up testifying for the defense. He told investigators after the shooting that Smith talked about the burglars returning for more, but said in court that it was his statement - not his neighbor's . Scene of the crime: Byron Smith's brother walks towards the basement of Smith's home in Little Falls, Minnesota on November 25, 2012 . Before retiring from the U.S. State Department, Smith worked on technical security issues for American embassies, such as building layout and alarms. Kifer was a senior who was active in athletics at Little Falls High School. Brady was a student and a wrestler at that school before transferring to nearby Pillager High School, where he was a junior. They were cousins. Court documents that were not allowed as evidence showed Brady had broken into Smith's house and garage before. Brady and Kifer were also linked to another burglary the day before they were killed; stolen prescription drugs were found in the car they were driving. Judge Douglas Anderson excluded evidence about the teens' histories from the trial as irrelevant .","Byron Smith, 65, was convicted Tuesday of murdering Haile Kifer, 18, and Nick Brady, 17, after they broke into his house on Thanksgiving 2012 .

"Ofsted inspectors are favouring ‘trendy’ learning methods over traditional ‘chalk and talk’ teaching, a report claims today. They prefer child-led activities to such an extent that it is ‘inconceivable’ for teachers to allow pupils to learn from textbooks during a visit from the watchdog. An examination of Ofsted reports by the think-tank Civitas reveals that inspectors show an ‘aversion’ to direct teacher instruction and like group work instead. Guidance: Ofsted inspectors, led by Sir Michael Wilshaw (pictured), are said to prefer 'trendy' and 'jazzy' teaching methods . This is resulting in staff putting on ‘jazzy’ lessons to impress them, according to the study, Playing The Game: The enduring influence of the preferred Ofsted teaching style. Robert Peal, a history teacher and education research fellow for Civitas, examined 130 Ofsted reports of secondary schools inspected between September and October last year. Of these, 52 per cent showed a preference for lessons in which pupils learn independently from teachers and 42 per cent favoured group work. Eighteen per cent criticised teachers for talking too much and the same proportion criticised lessons because the pupils were ‘too passive’. There was only one example of an inspector recommending a more teacher-led approach. Two months later, Ofsted issued new guidance for inspectors which stated they should not back one style of teaching over another in the course of their work. And in January this year, Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools, wrote to inspectors saying: ‘Please, please, please think carefully before criticising a lesson because it does not conform to a particular view of how children should be taught.’ Mr Peal studied an additional 130 reports of inspections conducted between January and March this year to assess whether inspectors had taken the guidance on board. Only 8 per cent demonstrated a preference for pupil independence and there were no reports of inspectors criticising teachers for talking too much. Two per cent flagged up the ‘passivity’ of pupils. But Mr Peal claims the changes are ‘largely superficial’ and that ‘fundamental problems’ remain because reports have simply been rewritten to ensure signs of ‘bias’ are not included. Inspectors have been given a list of ‘banned’ phrases to prevent schools from thinking the watchdog has a preferred style of teaching. Serco – which is contracted by Ofsted – provided its inspectors with alternative ways of making comments in May. Instead of writing that ‘too much teacher talk dominates’, it was suggested that inspectors could write ‘explanations are not clear’. Techniques: An examination of Ofsted reports by the think-tank Civitas reveals that inspectors show an ‘aversion’ to direct teacher instruction and like group work instead (file picture) Inspectors are also still backing child-led learning in verbal feedback to staff, according to Mr Peal. One teacher told Civitas: ‘“Too much teacher talk” is often verbally mentioned in feedback but, due to new criteria, not written down.’ Writing in the report, Mr Peal claims inspections are ‘distinctly in favour of child-centred teaching methods and prejudiced against more teacher-led alternatives’. He said: ‘Teachers are accustomed to putting on “jazzy” lessons, replete with group work, role play and active learning in order to fulfil what has become widely acknowledged as the Ofsted style. ‘So strong is the inspectorate’s reputation for favouring trendy teaching methods that the idea of putting on a “chalk and talk” lesson or learning from a textbook with an Ofsted inspector in the room has become inconceivable within the teaching profession.’ In June, Ofsted announced a pilot scheme in the Midlands to end grading teaching quality on each lesson observation form. Instead, lead inspectors will form an overall judgment on teaching in the school from their team’s summaries. An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘As HM Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw has repeatedly made clear, Ofsted does not have a preferred teaching style. It is up to the classroom teacher to determine how they should teach.’","Study by think-tank Civitas revealed inspectors prefer 'trendy' methods .

"A teacher has been jailed for hitting a young boy when he made mistakes during reading lessons at a mosque. Arfaq Hussain, 36, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, used his knuckles to rap the seven-year-old around the knee in what the judge described as 'unforgiveable conduct'. The offence came to light in December 2012 when another pupil told a teacher that he did not want to do PE classes at the Jame Masjid Mosque in Batley, West Yorkshire, because his legs were sore. Arfaq Hussain, 36, who was a teacher at the Jame Masjid Mosque in . Batley, West Yorkshire, has been jailed for 26 weeks after admitting . cruelty against a seven-year-old, who he hit over the knee with his . knuckles . Leeds Crown Court heard how social services spoke to both boys about the allegations. A medical examination then found six blue-coloured bruises to the side of the seven-year-old's knee. The court heard that, when the boy was questioned, he said his teacher would hit him . if he made mistakes. He said he would be told: 'You’re not reading what you are supposed to be reading.' Hussain, who has been suspended from teaching, admitted cruelty and was jailed for 26 weeks. He admitted he kept an eye on the children and reported them to the main teacher if they were naughty. Rebecca Young, defending, said it was a 'momentary lapse of control by an otherwise caring father and teacher'. Leeds Crown Court heard how social services spoke to the boy about the allegation and that six blue-coloured bruises were found on the side of his knee . She said he had not intended to cause any injured and was 'mortified' by the shame he had brought on his family and mosque. Miss Young added that a jail sentence would be difficult for his family, for whom he was the sole provider. Judge Tom Bayliss QC accepted it was a one-off offence but said his parents had trusted their son would not be harmed at the mosque. He said: 'They were entitled and the public is entitled to know that those who care for our children in whatever capacity, voluntary or paid, will not abuse them, will not injure them. 'You did injure him. It may have been only once but it was unforgiveable conduct towards a young and vulnerable child.'","Arfaq Hussain, 36, taught at Jame Masjid Mosque in Batley, West Yorks .

"The parents of a boy who killed himself have released pictures of his last hours to tell the bullies who tormented him: ‘Look what you did’. The heart-rending images show Dylan Stewart unconscious in a hospital bed. Doctors were unable to save the 12-year-old’s life after he was found hanging in his bedroom. His mother Amanda said he had been picked on for being new at his school and for coming from another town. She said he was attacked a number of times by bullies who branded him ‘Downey’ – a reference to Down’s syndrome, which he did not have. Tragedy: Dylan Stewart's parents have released this picture of their son taken before his death and have blamed bullies for his attempt to hang himself . Dylan Stewart was found unconscious at home in Telford, Shropshire, in April this year by his mother Amanda, who claims his life was made a misery by other students at school . Mrs . Stewart hopes the pictures will stop the bullies picking on another . victim. ‘If it helps save one other child then we’ve achieved . something,’ she said. ‘I don’t want other parents to suffer like we . have. ‘Bullies need to . know the impact their actions can have. It has had catastrophic . consequences for our family and we want them to see what they have done. Nothing can bring Dylan back – but we hope this sends a strong . message.’ The 39-year-old owner of a hair salon said she realised her son was depressed but thought it was because she had had a stroke. She . added: ‘Before he started school, he was outgoing, he was always on his . bike but afterwards that changed and he became more withdrawn. 'Bullying . did affect him, but he didn’t say anything. It is rife at that school . and other parents have contacted me to say thanks for raising the issue. ‘He was a beautiful . boy, he was so loving and we miss him every day. When we sit down at the . table as a family, there’s always an empty chair.’ Dylan, . who was born in Stoke-on-Trent, had started at Lakeside Academy in . Telford, Shropshire, in January. Teachers told the inquest into his . death – at Birmingham Children’s Hospital on April 30 – that there was . no allegation that he was being bullied. Bereft: Mrs Stewart, pictured her looking at Dylan's belongings, said today: 'He was a beautiful boy, he was so loving and we miss him every day. He lived for laughing. He was always laughing with me and the family' The inquest heard Dylan was a model pupil at Lakeside Academy in Telford, which boasts a 'rigorous anti-bullying policy.' Despite his family claiming  bullying was a contributing factor, teachers told the hearing there was no allegation he was being bullied. The hearing also heard that on the day of Dylan’s hanging a £5 note went missing from Mr Stewart’s wallet, and the parents had discussed whether he had taken it. Dylan said he found it behind a radiator. Defence: Dylan's school Lakeside Academy based in Stirchley, Shropshire, said they were 'confident that everything that could have been done by the school to support him was done' Upset: . Dylan's mother said his life was 'made hell' by bullies and police . failed to take action after he was attacked in a bus stop outside . school . Shropshire . Coroner John Ellery last week recorded a narrative verdict that he . hanged himself, but whether or not he intended to kill himself was . unclear. But . Amanda and Robert - who are sure their son intended to take his own . life - have now urged schools to take tougher action over bullying. Robert, . a chef, who is now a full-time carer for his wife, added: 'No child . should be pushed to the point where they have to take their life because . they feel that's the only way to escape. 'Schools . also need to listen to pupils, there are a lot out there who are asking . for help and they shouldn't be swept under the carpet.' Lakeside Academy based in Stirchley, Shropshire, says it put in a number of measures to protect Dylan after he joined the school. Barbara Williams, Lakeside Academy’s chair of governors, said: 'Lakeside has well established procedures for supporting young people at the school. “We are very saddened by the tragic events surrounding Dylan Stewart. However I am confident that everything that could have been done by the school to support him was done. 'Lakeside Academy has an anti-bullying policy which includes generic sections for both staff and students. 'The section for students was put together by the students themselves. 'It is the nature of schools that bullying occurs from time to time but any incidents at Lakeside are dealt with very rapidly'. In reference to the assault claims West Mercia Police said: 'From the description given it was a verbal attack rather than a physical one. His mother was happy that this was not a criminal matter and that the boys concerned with the incident were spoken to by police and advised regarding their conduct'.","Dylan Stewart died eight days after he was found hanged in his bedroom .

"Barack Obama's Ivy-League educated half-brother is publishing his autobiography next month, painting a dramatically different picture of their few meetings from the one the president related in his best-selling 'Dreams from My Father' memoir. Mark Obama Ndesandjo includes an appendix in his book, cataloguing what he says are factual errors in 'Dreams' – including words falsely attributed to his mother, a Jewish woman named Ruth. 'A lot of the stuff that Barack wrote is wrong in that book, and I can understand that,' he told the Associated Press last year when he planned to self-publish his book. 'To me,' Ndesandjo said then, 'for him the book was a tool for fashioning an identity and he was using composites. I wanted the record to be straight. I wanted to tell my own story, not let people tell it for me.' Scroll down for video . Revelations: Mark Obama Ndesanjo, the half-brother of Barack Obama's half-brother, is uncorking family secrets that the president left out of his own memoir . Troubled childhood: Ndesandjo as a baby with his mother Ruth, then married to the elder Barack Obama. Mark claims his father once held a knife to her throat . His book, 'An Obama's Journey: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery across Three Cultures,' is due in stores September 16 and published by Globe Pequot Press. Describing a two-day stretch in 1988 . when the two half-brothers first met and shared a next-day lunch, . Ndesandjo, who bears only a vague family resemblance to the president, . writes that 'overall, it was a very awkward, cold meeting.' 'An Obama's Journey: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery across Three Cultures,' an autobiography of President Barack Obama's Kenyan half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo, is due in stores on Sept. 16 . Barack Sr., he explains, was someone he tried not to think of since he had divorced Ruth years earlier and descended further into alcoholism and a downward career spiral. But with Barack Jr. suddenly in his living room, brought for a visit by the future president's aunt, avoiding thoughts about their common father became uncomfortably impossible. It was, he writes, as 'though the skeleton that no one ever talked about had strayed into the middle of a family party.' Ndesandjo, according to a writer at WND.com who obtained an advance copy of the book, 'described their lunch together during that second day as filled with tension, as Barack struggled to embrace the African heritage of a father Ndesandjo had rejected.' The author 'had refused even to use the Obama name, unable to forget, as a child, experiencing the alcoholism and brutality of their father.' The elder Barack was a blithely self-involved alcoholic, once killing a man in a DUI auto accident and dying at age 46 while driving drunk. His viciousness is largely absent from the president's 'Dreams' – President Obama met Barack Sr. just once after his infancy, at age 10 – and is relegated to Obama quoting his half-brother criticizing Barack Sr. 'You think that somehow I’m cut off from my roots, that sort of thing,' Ndesandjo tells the future president in 'Dreams.' 'Well, you're right. At a certain point, I made a decision not to think about who my real father was. He was dead to me even when he was still alive. I knew that he was a drunk and showed no concern for his wife or children. That was enough.' In 'Dreams,' Obama casts himself as . the all-seeing observer trying to connect himself back to his Kenyan . roots. But Ndesandjo now recalls details that never made it into the . president's 1995 book. 'My . impression at the first meeting,' he writes, 'was that Barack thought . that I was too white, and I thought that he was too black.' 'He was an American search for his African roots. ... I'm an American but I was living in Kenya, searching for my white roots.' Ndesandjo moved to China 12 years ago, married a Chinese wife, and is now fully immersed in the Chinese language and culture . Accusations of violence: Mark Ndesandjo says the future president thought he was 'too white' even though  they both called the same man 'father' Culture warrior: Ndesandjo lives in Shenzhen, China with his wife and has won volunteer service awards for his campaigns against domestic violence . 'I remember that when I spoke with him about the heroes of Western culture, he rolled his eyes impatiently,' he has told Maariv, an Israeli newspaper. 'My feeling was that, here is an American who in many ways is trying to be a local Kenyan youth. This is something I tried to flee my entire life.' Ndesandjo says his effort to escape his African cultural roots was furthered in part by a desire to escape the legacy of his violent father. 'His self-hatred and tendency toward self-sabotage was passed down and became part of my identity,' he acknowledges in his new book. 'My mother's lily-white skin and my father's ebony-black visage come to symbolize an eternal incompatibility in my mind's eye. For a long time I hated to have anything to do with what my father represented, whether it was him personally, or even the positive aspects of African culture.' 'In violent reaction to him,' he concludes, 'I turned passionately toward Western culture and music, which brought me a measure of solace.' After earning degrees in physics from Brown and Stanford Universities, Ndesandjo honed his artistic talents in China where he lives with his wife. He is an accomplished pianist and recording artist who often gives lessons to orphans in the Chinese boom town of Shenzhen. More criticisms of Barack Sr. surfaced in 2009 when the new president visited China during his first year in the White House. Only visit: Barack Sr. visited the future president in Hawaii in the 1970s (L) for the first and only time before heading back to Kenya, and posed (R) with his former wife and President Obama's mother Stanley Ann Dunham . That's when Ndesandjo published his first book, an autobiographical novel titled 'Nairobi to Shenzhen: A Tale of Love In The East.' It paints Barack Obama Sr. as an abusive drunk who repeatedly beat him and his mother in episode after rage-filled episode. 'There were some thumps as of someone falling,' reads one passage that Ndesandjo wrote in the third-person. Out of Africa: President Barack Obama shared a laugh on Wednesday with Tanzania's President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete at the White House's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington . 'His father's angry voice raised itself. ... He didn't remember what they were fighting about, but his stomach felt sick and empty.' 'His mother was being attacked and he couldn't protect her. ""You bastard!"" he remembered her screaming out. And that was just one night. There were many more.' One of those nights, Ndesandjo writes in 'An Obama's Journey,' resulted in his blitzed father holding a knife to his mother's throat after she obtained a restraining order against him. 'We Obamas have big hands. They can be used to create or to debase,' reads one portion. 'My hands enable me to comfortably reach across twelve keys and play piano well. My father would use his big hands to knock my mother down when he came home from a night of drinking.' 'I would move protectively toward her and clutch her legs, crying,' writes Ndesandjo. 'I know now why I mostly remember her legs, not her torso, or even her face.' His parents met when Obama Sr. was a graduate student at Harvard University. They moved to Kenya in 1964, where he and his brother David were born. David later died in a motorcycle accident. Obama Sr. had earlier divorced President Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, following Obama's 1961 birth. Ndesandjo's mother later divorced the elder Barack Obama and married another man, whose surname both mother and son also took.","Mark Obama Ndesanjo, the son of Barack Obama Sr. and his third wife, details beatings he and his mother endured in Kenya .

"George Osborne yesterday attacked some charities for being anti-business as he urged firms to put their heads ‘above the parapet’ and stick up for the free market. The Chancellor said that for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the principles of enterprise and business as a force for widespread prosperity were ‘up for grabs’. Speaking to business leaders at the Institute of Directors’ annual convention, he called on firms to counter an anti-free market movement led by trade unions and some charities. George Osborne attacked some charities for being anti-business as he urged firms to put their heads ‘above the parapet’ and stick up for the free market . ‘You have to get out there and put the business argument,’ he said. ‘Because there are plenty of pressure groups, plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities and the like, that will put the counter view. ‘It is, I know, a difficult decision sometimes to put your head above the parapet, but that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprising, business, low-tax economy that delivers prosperity for the people and generations to come. ‘There is a big argument in our country about our future, about whether we are a country that is for business, for enterprise, for the free market. ‘For the first time since my adult life, that is up for grabs. That issue felt it had been resolved when the Berlin Wall fell. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said Osborne was agreeing with Margaret Thatcher's 'enemy within' rhetoric . ‘Politicians like Tony Blair form the left felt like they had understood that free markets create the taxes to fund public services and the like. ‘That argument has gone and you saw it with the very stark contrast between the two political conferences in the last two weeks, so I would urge the business community not to sit on the sidelines of the political debate that is going to happen over the next seven months. ‘It doesn’t mean you have to endorse a party, a party like the Conservatives, but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument… that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise, business low-tax economy which deliver prosperity for generations to come.’ The general secretary of the TUC, Frances O’Grady, said: ‘The Chancellor accuses unions of being anti-business, yet many of Britain’s most successful companies and sectors – such as carmakers – depend on the labour and skills of trade unionists just as much as their managers. 'He has let down his guard to show how much he agrees with Margaret Thatcher’s ‘enemy within’ rhetoric. ‘But the real issue today is that the Chancellor is doing nothing to fairly share the benefits of recovery. 'He has rewarded soaraway executive pay with tax cuts for the super-rich, but been happy to see the longest and deepest cut in living standards for everyone else, only this week announcing cuts in the benefits that low-paid workers desperately need when the real value of their pay is falling.’","Chancellor George Osborne attacked some charities for being anti-business .

"For many mothers, the school run can be one of the most stressful parts of their day. Spare a thought then for Melissa Stowe, who faces a four-hour journey involving 12 buses to get her daughter Olivia to and from school after the little girl was turned down by primary ten minutes from their home. When the four-year-old starts school in September, Miss Stowe, 22, will have to take three buses from their home in Methley, Leeds, West Yorkshire to drop her off in Allerton Bywater, and three buses back. Scroll down for video . Long journey: Melissa Stowe faces a four-hour journey involving 12 buses to get her daughter Olivia to and from school after the little girl was turned down by primary ten minutes from their home . Miss Stowe will then have to repeat the exhausting . two-hour round trip - along with eight-month-old baby Daisy and her pram . - when she collects Olivia at the end of the day. Miss Stowe had applied to get Olivia into the reception class at her nearest school in Methley, which is just 10 minutes walk from the family’s home. However, the school, which has been rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted is massively oversubscribed and she lost an appeal. Olivia cannot get in, even though she is already at the nursery there. Olivia . has now been placed on the waiting list, and at an appeal hearing Miss Stowe was told there is nothing she can do but wait for a place, if one becomes available. The school where Olivia has been offered a place is 4.7 miles away by road, but school places are allocated 'as the crow flies' - with that distance being 1.78 miles away. Route: Miss Stowe will have to get her first bus at 6.50am, travelling from Methley to Whitwood. From there she will go to Castleford and finally on to Allerton Bywater to drop off Olivia . Arduous: When the four-year-old starts school in September, Miss Stowe, 22, will have to take three buses from their home in Methley, Leeds, West Yorkshire to drop her off in Allerton Bywater, and three buses back . Neither Miss Stowe, nor her partner James Sheard, 24, drive. Miss Stowe also cares for her disabled mother, which makes her situation even more difficult. 'We did two test runs of the journey and Olivia was completely exhausted,' Miss Stowe said. 'We will be setting off just after my partner leaves for work every morning, but he will actually get home before us. It’s crazy.' The full-time mother says she will have to set off at 6.40am for the 6.50am bus to be . able to get Olivia to school for 8.40am - meaning in total she will . spend almost eight hours a day on buses. 'We are having to rely on three buses,' she said. 'Those buses run at . half-hourly intervals so if one of those buses doesn’t turn up we are . going to be late. 'I . feel so sorry for Olivia having to make that journey. I took her on the . bus for a couple of taster sessions and she was so tired at the end of . it' Melissa Stowe . 'The schools are now talking about fining for lateness so that is another worry. I am so stressed about it.' Because . the crow flying distance is relatively low the family do not even . qualify for any help with bus fares - it will cost them £35 a week. 'James is looking into passing his test and if he did he would . have the possibility of a work’s van, but he still wouldn’t be able to . take us because he sets off at different times to us,' said Miss Stowe. Miss Stowe said she will have to wake at about 5.30am to get ready and feed Daisy . before waking up Olivia at 6am to get ready for school, and would not get home until after 5pm each evening. She . said: 'When I went for the appeal I took Daisy with me for them to see . how difficult it would be for me but they did not seem to consider it . would be a problem. 'There . was even a suggestion for me to walk across a canal towpath but that . journey would be no good with children in tow and in dark, damp mornings . and evenings.' There are . other schools that are closer to Miss Stowe but, because they are also . oversubscribed she has been placed on their waiting lists, and because . she is further away from those, she is further down the lists. Allerton Bywater is also a popular school but it has recently expanded, making places available. Waiting game: There are other schools that are closer to Miss Stowe but, because they are also oversubscribed she has been placed on their waiting lists, and because she is further away from those, she is further down the lists . Miss Stowe claims she did not receive an admissions form when they were sent out at . the end of last year and wonders whether this could be why she didn’t . get a place at her preferred school. She says she phoned Leeds City Council’s Admissions department in November when she had not received her forms. 'I rang the department and was told to wait and see if the forms . came because there had been changes with the postal service and it was . Christmas. I was told to call back in January,' she said. 'I rang back in January as the deadline for applications was nearing and was told I would be sent a form. 'I . still didn’t receive a form and made several calls between then and . April to ask for forms. They said they could not understand why I was . not receiving them and kept sending me forms out. 'I finally received forms in April, on the same day that parents got their letters confirming school places. 'I . feel so sorry for Olivia having to make that journey. I took her on the . bus for a couple of taster sessions and she was so tired at the end of . it. 'And poor little Daisy will be spending even more time on the bus. We are going to have no life.' Miss Stowe is the latest among a string of parents who have failed to be allocated slots in their nearest or chosen schools for the new school year starting this September. While education bosses insist every child in Leeds does have an allocated school place, they admit they are 'acutely aware of the pressure' on spaces. Paul Brennan, Leeds City Council’s deputy director of children’s services, said: 'We are aware that a number of parents in Methley have expressed concerns about securing places at local schools and we are working hard to address this. 'This year has seen us managing an unusually high demand for places in the area which we anticipate will fall next year. 'We will continue to talk to local schools about possible expansion and will do all we can to support parents to get places in a good school as close as possible to their home. 'National legislation, which limits early years class sizes to no more than 30 pupils, also means that school place appeals can only be granted under exceptional circumstances.' He stressed the importance of parents completing their applications on time as this is 'vital' in helping secure places at preferred schools. Miss Stowe also expressed concern that a major new 180-house development planned for Methley will add additional strain to school places in the area. However, the council said no decision has yet been made regarding planning permission for the new scheme and discussions are ongoing with the developers to ensure full community contributions from the developer regarding education provision are secured. Leeds faces a potential shortfall of more than 4,000 primary school places within three years.","Melissa Stowe's daughter Olivia, four, will start school in September .

"A 26-year-old Seattle woman Chantae Gilman is facing rape charges after a man alleged woke up to find her on top of him in his apartment, pinning his arms down. The unidentified victim, 31, reported the June 17 attack to police saying that he did not know Gilman personally but said she was an acquaintance of another man in the duplex. He described her as 'a drug user in the area.' Scroll down for video . 26-year-old Seattle woman Chantae Gilman is facing rape charges after a man alleged he woke up to find her on top of him in his apartment, pinning his arms down . Gilman has prior felon convictions for attempted robbery and possession of a stolen vehicle, The Smoking Gun reports. According the the police report, on the night of the attack the man had attended a birthday party for a neighbor known to Gilman. 'Once arriving home he fell asleep on his bed,' reported Detective Roger Ishimitsu. 'Victim slept very hard due to a long day.' He woke at 2 a.m. to find the 5'7''. 240-pound Gilman on top of him with his erect penis inside of her. His hands had been 'pinned down over his head,' according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. DNA taken off the victim's body at Harborview Medical Center matched a sample of Gilman's DNA . He told her to get off of him but Gilman ignored him. Finally he was 'able to work his way out from underneath' her. He was then able to eject her from the apartment before going to the Harborview Medical Center for a sexual assault examination. It's still unclear how she was able to get into the apartment. Gilman denied knowing the man to police and said she did not remember being at his house or having sex with him. Detective Ishimitsu wrote: 'She said that she has a mental illness and suffers from Bipolar disorder and Psychosis.' A sample of her DNA matched female DNA recovered from the sexual assault kit.

"The childhood home of Beatles guitarist George Harrison has been snapped up at auction by a super fan. Beatles fanatic Jackie Holmes, from London, bought the Liverpool property for £156,000 at the auction which took place last night at Liverpool's Cavern Club. The property in Upton Green, Speke was home to the musician during Beatle-mania and was a popular hang-out for the band during their early years. Scroll down for video . The childhood home of Beatles legend George Harrison (pictured) has been snapped up at auction by a Beatles super fan . The Liverpool property in Upton Green, Speke (right), was home to George Harrison (left) during Beatle-mania and was a popular hang-out for the band during their early years . Seen by some as the ultimate piece of Beatles memorabilia, the three-bedroom house attracted widespread interest from fans around the world. The house - which was home to George for 12 years until 1962 - had an initial guide price of just £100,000 and was on the market with selling agent Entwistle Green. But its historic association with the Beatles appears to have inflated the price after it was snapped up for  £56,000 more than had first been hoped. It is the second former Beatles home to be auctioned off recently, after a house once lived in by John Lennon sold for £480,000 last year - more than triple its asking price. Andrew Brown, from Countrywide Property Auctions, said: 'There was interest in the property before the auction from potential buyers who lived in the UK and internationally.

George was born on February 25, 1943 at his family's previous home in Wavertree. But in 1949 his parents, Harold and Louise, moved their four children to a new council house at Upton Green. The property was once a regular rehearsal venue for the Fab Four - but in recent years it has undergone a complete renovation.

"Five Birmingham schools declared failing by inspectors in the wake of the alleged 'Trojan Horse' takeover plot by hardline Muslims have still not improved, Ofsted has warned. In the first update following inspections earlier this year, the watchdog's chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said that 'too much poor practice remained unchallenged during the summer term'. Ofsted also found it has taken too much time to appoint new governors and senior leaders at these schools, meaning that 'very little action' has been taken to address the serious concerns raised. Scroll down for video . Sir Michael Wilshaw has said too little has been done to tackle 'poor practice' in schools at the centre of the 'Trojan Horse' extremism scandal in Birmingham, which emerged earlier this year . Ofsted said that the segregation of boys and girls at Park View Academy has not been tackled . In one case, at Park View Academy, 'little had been done' to tackle segregation between the sexes, and encourage boys and girls to sit together in lessons and share ideas, inspectors warned. At another school, Golden Hillock, teenagers studying for a GCSE in RE 'have to teach themselves for options other than Islam', Ofsted said, leaving students at a 'significant disadvantage'. And at another school, Oldknow Academy in Small Heath, trustees were kept in the dark about a controversial trip to Saudi Arabia involving pupils. Ofsted said: 'Worryingly, trustees were not aware that a visit to Saudi Arabia had taken place this year for pupils and staff, despite a similar trip last year receiving criticism from inspectors at the previous inspection due to failures in safeguarding. 'Indeed, they had been told by senior leaders that the visit had been cancelled.' Oldknow came under fire in June after banning 'un-Islamic' tombolas and raffles at a fete and has now seen parents withdrawing their children from acts of collective worship, the new report found. Responding to the latest report, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'It is utterly incomprehensible that, six months after these serious concerns became public, David Cameron's Government has still not taken action, putting children at risk from radical, hardline agendas and damaging school standards. 'It is gross negligence from the Prime Minister and his Tory-led Government and they must urgently explain their inaction.' GCSE RE students at Golden Hillock school have to teach themselves about religions other than Islam . Pupils at Oldknow Academy have been taken on another trip to Saudi Arabia this year, despite criticism for a similar move in the past . In June, Ofsted issued a damning verdict on the running of a number of Birmingham's schools and declared five failing, placing them into special measures. These schools were Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET), as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. Four separate probes were conducted into the allegations in Birmingham, which were originally sparked by the 'Trojan Horse' letter - now widely believed to be a hoax - that referred to an alleged plot by hardline Muslims to seize control of a number of school governing boards in the city. Following the publication of the investigations into the Trojan Horse scandal, ministers announced that in future, all schools will be required to 'actively promote' British values such as democracy, tolerance, mutual respect, the rule of law and individual liberty. While plans have been drawn up to revamp the curriculum at each of the five schools inspected, these often lack the detail needed to ensure that action will be taken to actively promote these values and tolerance of different faiths, Ofsted said. Inspectors conducted unannounced follow-up visits to the five schools, four of which are academies and the fifth run by the local council, during a week last month. The findings also showed that staff at the schools had 'some optimism' that there would be changes, but they also raised concerns about equality and fairness. Saltley school was among five schools put into special measures by inspectors following the claims . Some staff said some people at their school hold jobs that they do not have the experience or qualifications for, the advice note said. It also criticised Birmingham Council for failing to show Ofsted the plan it has drawn up in response to the findings of the investigations into the alleged Trojan Horse plot. Sir Michael called on the Department for Education (DfE) to look at how it can take more rapid action to change the trustees and governors of an academy school when there are serious concerns about how it is being run. In a statement issued to pupils' parents, the trustees and executive principal of the Park View Educational Trust said it had already addressed many of the issues raised by Ofsted. 'In the period of a month since the monitoring visits, the Trust's new transition plan has led to significant progress and this was highlighted by the Department for Education during their recent visits to our academies at the beginning of October,' the statement said. 'We remain realistic about the challenges ahead but are focused and determined to maintain rapid and sustained progress ahead of the next monitoring visits, which will provide a more authentic insight into the new leadership and governance arrangements. 'Students at our academies no longer face segregation in classes and several new opportunities are being welcomed.' The Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year, when a letter emerged  outlining an alleged a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools. The letter prompted Department for Education inspectors to go into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen. Sir Michael Wilshaw said the plot was 'planned and orchestrated' attempt to control school boards . Whistleblowers at Park View claimed the school was in the hands of a group of extremists who had infiltrated its governing body. It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school. The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area. Following inspections, Sir Michael Wilshaw told MPs in July that there had been a 'planned and orchestrated' plot to radicalise pupils in schools in the city. He told the Education Select Committee said: 'I spoke to eight or nine head teachers. They believed it was planned and orchestrated. 'They believed people got together and decided which schools to target. They believed there was a strategy to infiltrate governing bodies. 'They believed governing boards couldn't take place in the normal way. They believed all that was planned and orchestrated. This was all in Birmingham.' When asked by MPs if pupils had been radicalised in the schools, Sir Michael replied: 'We didn't see that. The issue of extremism was outside of our remit.' The Ofsted chief inspector told MPs: 'What we did see was the promotion of a culture, which if that promotion had continued would have exposed these children to extremism.'","Inspections ordered earlier this year amid claims of extremism in schools .

"Islamic State terrorists last night released another propaganda video featuring British hostage John Cantlie, who warns of an impending third war in the Gulf. In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist, who describes himself as the 'British citizen abandoned by my government', accuses the western media of being complicit with America and its allies in trying to drum up support for a ground war against ISIS. He said: 'Obama is terribly busy insisting US ground troops won’t be going back into Iraq. Thus even the Pentagon admits airstrikes are a stop-gap military measure that will not disrupt the Islamic State actvities' Scroll down for video . Captive: A still from the newly-released video of British Hostage John Cantlie. The photojournalist has been a captive of ISIS for two years . He added: 'Meanwhile, America puts 1,200 troops into Baghdad to protect their embassy and the airport. Surely sounds like boots on ground to me… The rise of the Islamic State give Obama a chance to look tough in the media just as midterm elections approach.' In tonight’s professionally-produced video, the 43-year-old captive from Surrey – wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit – said Obama's use of the plight of the Yazidi minority, which has suffered greatly at the hands of ISIS, as justification of military force is disingenuous. He said: 'Since when has America cared about the fate of a minority in the Muslim lands? 'Modern history is sadly littered with religious minorities being crushed and neither the U.S.  nor anyone else said anything.' Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who was kidnapped in Syria two years ago, also said the public is wrong to support the airstrikes. Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including The Sunday Times, has featured in several propaganda videos released by the Islamic extremists in recent weeks . He said: 'They say the public has a short memory, but the ink has not even dried on the written orders to pull out of Afghanistan and here we are, gearing up for Gulf War 3. 'They (IS) have grown exponentially  so that even the U.S. military, the policeman of the world, are not able to contain them. ""So we have spent a few trillion dollars on failed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan"", is the unwritten message. '""Isn't it worth spending a few trillion more to avoid the spectre of another 9/11?""' In an article published last week in an IS magazine Mr Cantlie claimed he wrote the scripts for the videos, although this could be propaganda put out by the militant group. Hostage: An article allegedly written by British hostage John Cantlie, was published by Islamic State militants . 'Frustrating': Two days ago Jessica Cantlie urged the Islamic State to 'restart dialogue' with the family . Two days ago Mr Cantlie's sister  urged the terror group to 'restart dialogue' with his family. In an emotional appeal, Jessica Cantlie said that the family had been in contact with the terrorists, but that recent messages have been ignored. Ms Cantlie said it was 'frustrating' that their line of communication had been cut off and 'strongly' challenged the group to return to 'their previously opened channel'. Referring to her brother's appearance in the videos and article, Ms Cantlie said his 'words are powerful and have huge resonance'. Speaking directly to camera, Ms Cantlie said: 'We, John's family, want to address Islamic State, who are holding him. 'It is not true to say that there has been no attempt to engage with IS. It is simply not accurate. 'This is frustrating for all parties, including those who are trying to assist us. We had previously been in contact through a channel started by you, but then this stopped for reasons best known to you. Earlier this month Mr Cantlie's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son’s release. In a direct televised appeal to Islamic State, Paul Cantlie, 80, who has throat cancer, asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him. He said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them. Speaking about watching the original footage of his son, he said: ‘For the first time in almost two years, we saw John when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the Islamic State and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die. ‘As a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing John and knowing that he is alive. This was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness.’ Addressing his son’s captors, he said: ‘To those holding John: please know that he is a good man, he sought only to help the Syrian people and I ask you from all that is sacred, to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him.’ Smoke rises after a strike on the Syrian town of Ain al-Arab, known as Kobane by the Kurds, as seen from the Turkish-Syrian border .

"Tower Hamlets's Muslim mayor Lutfur Rahman sparked a storm of protest tonight after raising the Palestinian flag over the town hall ‘in solidarity with Gaza’. Barely 24 hours after it emerged Mr Rahman is to face trial over claims he committed widespread voting fraud, he ordered the flag to fly ‘in support of a ceasefire and peace’. Jewish leaders condemned the move as 'destructive' for community relations as local residents said the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' and not international conflicts. Scroll down for video . Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman tweeted this photo of the Palestinian flag flying outside the town hall . Mr Lutfur said he had taken the decision to fly the flag ‘in solidarity with Gaza’ but Tory party chairman Grant Shapps condemned the 'empty, flag-waving gesture politics' Mr Rahman was a member of the Tower Hamlets Labour Party and was its candidate to be the first directly elected mayor of the borough in 2010. But he was expelled from the Labour party after allegations surfaced about his close links with an Islamic extremist group called the Islamic Forum of Europe. He is accused of using illegal tactics to win the mayoral election in Tower Hamlets, East London, in May. Just yesterday it emerged four voters had won their big to have a damaging dossier of evidence heard at a full trial. Mr Rahman has strenuously denied allegations of electoral fraud. Today Mr Rahman risked provoking fresh controversy with his decision to fly the flag of Palestine over the town hall in Mulberry Place, off Clove Crescent. He tweeted a photograph of the flag, with the message: ‘Palestinian flag flying at Town Hall in solidarity with #Gaza and in support of a ceasefire & peace.’ The move risks angering the Jewish community in the east London borough and fuelling divisions in a borough increasingly used to making headlines for the wrong reasons. A recent review found the council's handling of the local and European election count was 'inadequate'. Tonight Tory party chairman Grant Shapps told MailOnline: 'This is an administration that cannot even organise their own election count, let alone intervene on foreign affairs in the Middle East. 'What we need is an immediate ceasefire and continued humanitarian aid, rather than empty, flag-waving gesture politics.' Mayor Rahman should remember that he is flying a flag from a British town hall in support of an organisation that is regarded across Europe and the world as terrorist. It is totally inappropriate. It is also destructive of relations between the communities that make up our capital city. It is not thought that there are any rules stopping the flying of the flag over a public building. Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 'Mayor Rahman should remember that he is flying a flag from a British town hall in support of an organisation that is regarded across Europe and the world as terrorist. 'It is totally inappropriate. It is also destructive of relations between the communities that make up our capital city.' The decision to fly the flag from the town hall Mulberry Place, off Clove Crescent in the East London borough risks causing community divisions . There was immediate condemnation of the decision on Twitter, with some arguing the council should concentrate on 'potholes and bins' In a statement Mr Rahman said: 'We are flying the Palestinian flag over the town hall as a humanitarian gesture of our solidarity with the people of Gaza. 'In addition to the current military onslaught, the blockade of Gaza is causing a humanitarian catastrophe. Over 1,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. An urgent aid corridor needs to be opened to allow those injured to receive treatment and medical care. 'We mourn the loss of life in this tragic conflict. We call on our Prime Minister to help create a lasting peace that breaks the cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and prevents any further loss of innocent lives.' An estimated 1,200 Palestinians and 55 Israelis have been killed in the conflict. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after a surge in rocket fire from the territory. Hamas, which controls Gaza, has said it will not stop fighting until a blockade on the area, maintained by both Israel and Egypt, is lifted. Already this month there have been angry rows about Preston Town Council and Bradford Council flying the Palestinian flag. David Israel of the Leeds Jewish community said the Preston council was wrong to take sides in the conflict. innocent Israeli civilians have suffered through war and conflict,' he told the BBC. 'If you're going to put up one flag you need to put up the other flag to show support for innocent civilians on both sides on the conflict.' Others backed the move, saying they were 'proud' of Mr Lutfur for taking the controversial decision . Earlier Mr Cameron announced an extra £3 million aid for Gaza as he repeated his call for an unconditional ceasefire to stop the conflict. Britain has already given £7 million in aid. Speaking during a Q&A session with workers in Warrington, Mr Cameron said the £3 million would ‘help make sure the people in Gaza have the basic necessities of life, the food, the shelter and the assistance that they need’. Prime Minister David Cameron today announced an extra £3million for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza . He went on: ‘We should be very clear that we want an unconditional, immediate, humanitarian ceasefire that applies to everybody. 'What we are seeing happening in Gaza is completely tragic and ghastly, the loss of life is appalling, it is heart-rending watching these scenes on our television. 'But while calling for an unconditional, immediate ceasefire, we do have to be clear about a couple of points.' Mr Cameron added: 'Yes, it is awful what is happening in Gaza and the loss of life, but we do have to remember, whenever we have had a ceasefire in the last few days, it has been a ceasefire that has been obeyed and observed by the Israelis but it has not been observed by Hamas. 'Hamas continue the rocket attacks that are not aimed at military targets or political targets. They are aimed, indiscriminately, into Israel in order to do the maximum damage they possibly can. 'And so we do have to understand that that has to stop in order for there to be a lasting ceasefire.'","Lutfur Rahman ordered move 'in support of a ceasefire and peace'

"A primary school which banned pupils from using Black Country slang to halt a ‘decline in standards’ has revealed the controversial policy seems to have improved children's reading and writing. Parents were furious when school chiefs ordered children to stop speaking  the dialect, saying it should be preserved to protect the local identity. Staff at Colley Lane Primary School, Halesowen, West Midlands, drew up a list of ten outlawed phrases such as 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that,' and 'It wor me'. Parents including Alana Willetts with her son George, nine, were angry with the ban on Black Country dialect, but grades in reading and writing have improved . It has emerged that the ban has been a success in the classroom, with pupils achieving higher grades in reading and writing. The number of children gaining Key Stage 2 reading had improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four. Children achieving the higher level five grade in reading has also gone up nine per cent to 41 per cent. Headteacher John White said: 'Our intention was not to remove any local culture or identity but to give our children the spoken language skills to compete against the best. Headteacher John White defended his school's dialect 'ban', saying it will help pupils achieve success . The letter sent out to parents last year gave a list of outlawed phrases,  such as 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that,' and 'It wor me' 'It would be great to see a more positive view on what we are trying to achieve here.' Last year Mr White enraged parents when he told them about the Black Country ban. Here are the phrases pupils at Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, have been banned from using: . 1. 'They was' instead of 'they were.' 2. 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that.' 3. 'Ya' instead of 'you.' 4. 'Gonna' instead of 'going to.' 5. 'Woz' instead of 'was.' 6. 'I day' instead of 'I didn't.' 7. 'I ain't' instead of 'I haven't.' 8. 'Somefink' instead of 'something.' 9. 'It wor me' instead of 'it wasn't me.' 10. 'Ay?' instead of 'pardon?' In a letter to parents, he said: 'Recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom. 'We are introducing a 'zero tolerance' in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list. 'We want the children in our school to have the best start possible: Understanding when it is and is not acceptable to use slang and colloquial language. 'We value the local dialect but are encouraging children to learn the skill of turning it on and off in different situations.' The Black Country includes Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall, and southern parts of Wolverhampton. Other words and phrases on the prohibited list include 'ay', meaning 'pardon', and 'I day', meaning 'I didn't'. Alana Willetts, 30, whose nine-year-old son George goes to the school, said staff should be teaching pupils about the Black Country and its dialect. 'Some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and I'm an engineer – [the accent] doesn't affect you as a person,' she said. 'I think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a Black Country accent are disadvantaged. All the parents are outraged.' But Zheyan Kareem, 31, who moved to the UK eight years ago and whose seven-year-old son is a pupil, supported the ban, saying: ‘English is my second language. So for me … it is good if my child speaks English in the house and not slang picked up at school.’ The primary school, which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged ‘good’ at its last Ofsted inspection. The number of children gaining Key Stage 2 at Colley Lane Primary School, Halesowen, West Midlands, has improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four . The distinctive Black Country dialect of the 'Yam Yams' is spoken in towns like Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Tipton and Dudley, and can be very confusing to outsiders. Scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from Early Modern English and even Middle English.'Thee', 'Thy' and 'Thou' are still in use, as is the case in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. 'Ow B'ist', meaning 'How beist thou?' is a common greeting, with the typical answer being 'Bay too bah', meaning 'I bayn't be too bad'.'I haven't seen her' becomes 'I ay sid 'er'. Black Country dialect often substitutes the word 'ar' for 'yes'.Several word pronunciations are also different: 'you' is pronounced 'yow' (pronounced yo with a silent w), whereas 'go', which is often pronounced 'goo' or 'gooin'' for 'going', is more in line with pronunciations in the Midlands. The heritage of the West Midlands is brought to life at the Black Country Living Museum and locals are keen to retain their distinctive dialect . It is also quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say 'agooin' instead of 'going'. Inhabitants are proud to be known as Black Country 'folk' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham, calling Birmingham 'Brum-a-jum' (Birmingham's colloquial name is 'Brummagem', a corruption of its older name of 'Bromwicham' and hence West Bromwich) or 'Birminam' (missing the g and h out and saying it the way it's spelt). Residents of Birmingham ('Brummies') meanwhile often refer to their Black Country neighbours as 'Yam Yams', a reference to the use of 'Yow am' (or yow'm ) instead of 'You are', and not because they say 'I yam' instead of 'I am'.Dudley residents often refer to the people of Birmingham as 'Dummy Brummies'. Also, the town of Walsall can be pronounced either 'War-sall' or 'Wor-sull', with a strong Walsall accent considered to be typical 'yam-yam'. The strong Black Country dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past. However, a stronger variation of the dialect (than the one frequently used) appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older Black Country folk. The word endings with 'en' are still noticeable in conversation as in 'gooen' (going), 'callen' (calling) and the vowel 'A' is pronounced as 'O' as in 'sond' (sand), 'hond' (hand) and 'mon' (man). Other pronunciations are 'winder' for window, 'fer' for 'far', and 'loff' for 'laugh' exactly as Chaucer's English was spoken. Local dialect was (and probably still is to a lesser degree) quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the Black Country. Although most outsiders to the Black Country can't tell this difference, Black Country folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent. Here is a glossary of Black Country vocabulary: . Aive - Lift, heave . Bawk - Confuse . Beesum - A pert young woman . Bibble - Pebble, stone . Blithyed - A fool . Bowler - A large moth . Boffle - To hinder . Bonk - A small hill . Broo'us - A brewery . Cagmag - A gossipy old woman . Caw - Cannot . Chicklings - Pig's intestines (a Black Country delicacy) Codding - Joking . Fizog - Face . Flen - A flea . Jed - Dead . Kench - Back strain . Miskin - An outside toilet . Carradiddle - A lie, fib . Tranklements - Miscellaneous items, paraphernalia .

Dismantled: Almost one hour after starting his bizarre attack, Zhu removed the top of the machine thanks to his professional expertise as an electrician . The astonishing video shows Zhu, 38, approach the machine at 1.42am and place paper over what he believes to be the machine's built-in security camera. But in his drunken stupor, he does not realise that another camera - located just above the machine - is recording his every move in the city of Wenling in Eastern China's Zhejiang Province. He first takes a screwdriver out of his pocket and tries to dismantle the machine, before producing a meat cleaver from the inside of his jacket and tries to pry the machine open. After removing the top of the machine, he then uses a pair of pliers to crack it open even further - before then using the meat cleaver to violently hack at the ATM. Almost one hour after he started, he is then seen using his bare hands and knowledge of electrical wiring to rip away the casing until he could get at his card.

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Friday that he expects the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, to be complete by the time he leaves office. Holder, who was speaking at a news event in Los Angeles, last month announced his resignation but said he would not leave until his replacement was chosen and confirmed by the Senate. The Obama administration is expected to announce a nominee to replace him by the end of the year. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder expects the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting death of black teenager Michael Brown  to be complete by the time he leaves office . Brown's death sparked angry protests across the St. Louis suburb and has drawn global attention to race relations in the United States. Holder's legacy as attorney general, a position he has held since the start of the Obama administration, has been largely shaped by his vocal advocacy for racial justice. Holder also said he was 'exasperated' to see leaks earlier this week from the grand jury reviewing the case locally. Holder also said he was 'exasperated' to see leaks earlier this week from the grand jury reviewing Michael Brown's death locally . The leaked information indicated that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was acting in self-defense. 'It appears that people are somehow trying to shape public opinion,' Holder said. In addition to the criminal investigation into Wilson's actions, the Justice Department is also conducting a civil investigation into the patterns and practices of the Ferguson Police Department.","Holder vows his own office will complete his investigation into shooting death of Michael Brown before he leaves office .

"Thomas Docherty was suspended for nine months after he was accused of sighing in a job interview . A professor at a top university was suspended for nine months after he was accused of sighing and being sarcastic during job interviews. Thomas Docherty was banned from the University of Warwick in January following allegations he had given off 'negative vibes' and undermined the authority of the former head of the English department. The English and Comparative Literature professor was said to have been 'making ironic comments' and 'projecting negative body language' when interviewing candidates for a job. Professor Docherty was banned from the campus and from writing references for students without permission during the suspension. He was also stopped from returning their work or providing guidance on PhDs and was not permitted to have contact with undergraduates. Today it emerged the professor - whose suspension was lifted last month - is set to be cleared of all allegations against him. Professor Docherty, who is well-known as a critic of the marketisation and bureaucratisation of higher education in the UK, told the Times Higher Education: 'I'm looking forward to getting back to teaching, working with students and colleagues, and writing again, as normal.' And writing on a Facebook page set up by students to show support for the popular professor, he added: 'I'm now able to say that none of the allegations against me were upheld. 'Throughout this past year, I have been deeply moved and touched by the level of support that I have received. 'The only way I can think of beginning to repay that is through my teaching and writing - and I look forward to returning properly to that in the hope that it will be adequate to what you deserve. He was banned from the University of Warwick campus after allegations he had also undermined authority . 'There are many colleagues - students as well as staff - whose position has been more difficult than mine. 'They now deserve the benefit of our combined reasoning, arguing, and sustained democratic debate. 'Thanks again to you all - and, with luck, I'll see some of you in class, in conference, or just around and about.' Katja Rebmann, a research assistant at the university, replied: 'Your teaching has been and I'm sure will continue to be inspiring - very pleased to have you back.' The University and College Union (UCU) - who welcomed the lifting of the suspension - have now blasted the University of Warwick's procedures. UCU regional official Anne O'Sullivan said: 'It beggars belief that an academic can be suspended with no contact with students or colleagues for almost a year while charges are finalised. 'The one thing this protracted process should ensure is that the University of Warwick looks closely at its internal procedures. 'There is clearly the need for a better structure to deal with these kinds of issues and to ensure that academics have a speedier form of redress. 'Academic freedom is a key tenet of our universities and staff should not be worried for their careers if they wish to speak out about matters of concern.' Dennis Leech, president of the University & College Union branch at Warwick, added: 'The fact that a member of the academic staff can be suspended for almost nine months and subject to such a protracted disciplinary process suggests that there is a need to review the governance of the university. 'I hope the university will look again at how it can strengthen its procedures to protect and defend academic freedom, which this case exemplifies to be threatened from obtrusive managerialism.' A spokesperson for the University of Warwick said the process had taken the time it did 'in order to accommodate the specific requests and needs of all the participants in the process'. In 2011 Professor Docherty published 'For the University: Democracy and the Future of the Institution', which has been described as book that 'helps to make more people aware of the contradictory and short-sighted way that universities are now discussed and managed in Britain.'","Thomas Docherty was banned from University of Warwick in January 2014 .

"Actress Tara Berwin, 18, is pictured as a schoolgirl wearing a very short skirt in the new Kingsmill advert that has sparked complaints from viewers . A TV advert showing a teenager posing provocatively in skimpy school uniform has prompted a barrage of complaints from parents. Advertising watchdogs said the 30-second commercial for Kingsmill fruit and fibre bread had triggered claims that it ‘sexualises children’. The advert shows a schoolgirl in the kitchen at breakfast. Her younger brother then relays a warning from their father: ‘If you think you’re going to school in that skirt, you can think again.’ The girl, played by actress Tara Berwin, responds by defiantly hitching up her mid-thigh length skirt to strike a provocative pose. One outraged viewer wrote on a web forum: ‘Perhaps it’s because paedophilia is very much in the public consciousness at the moment but shouldn’t this be illegal? Nearly seeing up the skirt of  a minor?’ The advert featuring 18-year-old Ms Berwin and nine-year-old Lewis Hardaker is the latest in a £4 million campaign to promote Kingsmill bread. The Advertising Standards Authority will this week examine complaints that it is ‘offensive and irresponsible’ before launching any investigation. The ASA has recorded 19 complaints about the commercial  since its launch a week ago. Web forums were deluged with  critical comments. One parent wrote on Mumsnet: ‘I really think it exploits teenage girls. At the  end there is a girl dressed in a  very short skirt, over-the-knee stockings and it’s basically her school uniform. ‘I just don’t see how it’s appropriate or what it has to do with a Kingsmill loaf. It’s blatantly using sex to sell an everyday product.’ Another parent noted: ‘I think it’s grim, to be honest. The same joke could’ve been made by dressing the girl in any number of other unsuitable-for-school outfits. ‘The camera lingers on her giving a twirl, and the over-the-knee socks make her look like she’s in “naughty schoolgirl” fancy dress. Yuk.’ Scroll down to watch advert . The schoolgirl pops her head in to the kitchen before whispering 'where's dad?' to her little brother . Her brother replies that their father is in the shower but passes on a warning from him: 'If you think you're going to school in that skirt, you can think again' But criticism of the advert, which was uploaded to YouTube, prompted a response from Ms Berwin. She said: ‘There’s no need to patronise me, I haven’t done anything wrong.’ A Kingsmill spokesman said: ‘It captures the playful interactions that are typical of day-to-day family life and demonstrates our understanding of modern families and their needs.’ He added that the advert was cleared for broadcast by the appropriate industry body. The advert was shot by creative agency Contagious Content and was overseen by Will Ghali, director of brands at Kingsmill owner, Allied Bakeries. He said: ‘I don’t think it’s suggestive. It’s light-hearted and gets its message  across in an entertaining and engaging way.’ In response, the schoolgirl hitches her skirt of further and strikes a defiant pose .

"'I would order it': Speaking in Australia, Obama said he would send in the army if ISIS got nuclear arms . Barack Obama has said he would order the U.S. army into ISIS territory if they got a nuclear weapon. The President and Commander-in-Chief was adamant that ground troops would be necessary if the United States were to discover the terror group had nuclear capabilities. Obama conjured the nightmare scenario to illustrate that circumstances do exist in which  the United States military would enter a ground war with ISIS. Previously the President - along with other military figures - has been keen to downplay the prospect of a 'boots on the ground' situation in Iraq of Syria. But, speaking at a news conference in Australia today, the President insisted he would personally order the operation should the U.S. uncovering the terrifying intelligence. He said: 'There are always circumstances in which the United States might need to deploy U.S. ground troops. 'If we discover that ISIL  had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes, you can anticipate that not only would Chairman Dempsey [the top U.S. general] recommend me sending U.S. ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it.' ISIL (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) is the White House's preferred way of referring to ISIS. Around 1,500 U.S. troops are due to be deployed in Iraq already, but their duties are only to 'advise' Iraqi forces, and they are not expected to get involved in actual combat. Condition: Obama made clear that circumstances when the U.S. would enter a ground war with ISIS do exist. Pictured is Raqqa, ISIS's stronghold in Syria, where militants were parading a missile launcher and tanks . General Martin Dempsey said last week that military chiefs are 'considering' recommending that the President send combat troops in. The President's words follow confirmation yesterday that ISIS killed another American hostage - Peter Kassig - in its latest propaganda video. Responding to news of the former U.S. Army Ranger's death, Obama said he 'was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity'. He said the terror group, which calls itself the Islamic State, 'revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.'

"Small spotty cats found in Brazil called Oncillas, look identical to those found elsewhere on the continent, but scientists have discovered they belong to a completely different species. Researchers compared the genes of the wild cats living in the north east of Brazil with nearby populations in the south and discovered there is no flow of genes between the two populations of cats. The discovery is a reminder of just how little scientists still know about the natural world, and has important conservation implications for the cats, according to the researchers. Small spotty cats found in Brazil called Oncillas (here one is pictured from the north), look identical to those found elsewhere on the continent, but scientists have discovered they belong to a completely different species . The animals that are the subject of the surprising research are around the size of a household moggy and are also known as little spotted cats or tigrinas. The new study revealed a complicated set of relationships between the creatures (here one from the south is pictured) and two other species of Neotropical cats . They look the same in both of the colonies, despite their genetic makeup. The scientists, from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, said there has not been any exchange off genes between the two feline communities for millennia, indicating the two populations did not interbreed. Researcher Eduardo Eizirik, who co-authored the study, which was published in the journal Current Biology, said they are in fact two completely different species. He said the study ‘illustrates how much is still unknown about the natural world, even in groups that are supposed to be well-characterised, such as cats. ‘In fact, there are many basic aspects that we still don't know about wild cats, from their precise geographic distribution and their diets to even species-level delimitation, as in this case.’ He and his colleagues have named the species in the south as Leopardus guttulus, while the community in the northeast will be known as Leopardus tigrina. The new study revealed a complicated set of relationships between the tigrinas and two other species of Neotropical cats. Researchers compared the genes of oncillas living in the north east of Brazil with nearby populations in the south and discovered there was no flow of genes between the two populations of cats, making them two distinct species . The oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) is a small spotted cat native to montane and tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is active during the night and in twilight and is related to the ocelot. The creature grows up to 59cm long, with a slender tail. Oncillas typically weight between one-and-a-half and three kilograms . Their fur is thick and soft, ranging from light brown to dark ochre, with numerous dark rosettes across the back and flanks. This colouration helps them blend in with the mottled sunlight of the tropical forest understory. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has classified the oncilla as vulnerable. The . chief threats to these felines are deforestation and poaching. Oncillas . are killed for their pelts, which are highly prized and often sold or . made into clothing. The scientists believe the north eastern species interbred or chose to breed with another species of pampas cat, which made them genetically different to the southern species, despite looking the same. Dr Eizirik said the interbreeding may have helped the two oncilla species diverge. The researchers suggest that the two distinct tigrina species may be suited to different habitats, with the north eastern cats living primarily in savannahs, as well as dry shrub lands and forests and the southern species living in denser and wetter Atlantic forests. Dr Eizirik said: ‘Such distinct habitat associations provide a hint to potentially adaptive differences between these newly recognized species and may have been involved in their initial evolutionary divergence.’ Scientists are keen to learn more about the rare population of oncillas in north eastern Brazil and whether they need to be protected urgently. ‘All four species are threatened and we need to understand as much as possible regarding their genetics, ecology and evolution to be able to design adequate conservation strategies on their behalf,’ he added. Much like domestic cats, oncillas catch birds and small mammals to eat and while they primarily live and hunt on the ground, they are adept at scaling trees, Fox News reported. They are known to be one of the smallest cats living in South America and weigh a maximum of three kilograms.","Researchers from Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul compared genes of oncillas in the north of Brazil with those in the south .

"Every year around 1,000 people in the UK die waiting for a heart transplant and scientists are searching for a lifesaving alternative. Advances in transplant technology could one day enable surgeons to use animal organs in people, which could solve the problem of donor organ shortages around the world. Now scientists have managed to transplant pig hearts into baboons, whose immune systems were supressed to stop them rejecting their new hearts. Take heart: Advances in transplant technology could one day enable surgeons to use animal hearts in people, which could solve the problem of donor organ shortages around the world. A heart transplant using a human heart is pictured . There were 145 heart transplants in the UK last year but a shortage of donor hearts. A transplant might be considered for someone who has severe heart failure, but it could be years before a suitable organ becomes available. Currently, a heart transplant operation takes between four and six hours. The patient is connected to a heart-lung bypass machine that makes the blood circulate around their body. The surgeon will them transplant the new heart before making it beat. When the heart beings to take over pumping and the patient's condition is stable, the bypass machine will be turned off. The surgeon will then close the cut-open breastbone with wire. The procedure is risky and the heart could fail to pump, or the body could reject the new organ. Approximately one in 10 people dies due to complications in the year following surgery . Nine out of 10 people say they support organ donation, but only three in 10 sign the register. Just like the transplant of human hearts, there is a risk that the new heart will fail after surgery, but experts reported that the pig hearts survived in their recipients for more than 500 days. Far more people are waiting for organ transplants than there are donor organs so if animal organs can be used, thousands of lives could be saved across the globe. Dr Muhammad Mohiuddin, chief of transplantation at the National Institutes of Health's National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, in Bethesda, Maryland, told LiveScience that transplanting organs from animals could be used as a stopgap until human organs become available, or as a complete replacement. He told the American Association for Thoracic Surgery in Toronto that tissue rejection by the recipient’s immune system is the biggest hurdle to a heart transplant. In their . experiment, they used genetically engineered pig hearts – which are . similar to a human's - without the genes known to cause tissue rejection . in humans, and replaced them with human genes to encourage the body to . accept the heart. To . study the hearts, they implanted them into the abdomens of baboons - . without removing their original hearts - but connecting the pig's hearts to . the baboons’ circulatory system. Scientists have managed to transplant pig . hearts into baboons (stock image left), whose immune systems were supressed to stop them . rejecting their new hearts. Pig (stock image right) hearts were genetically engineered to minimise the chances of rejecting in the recipients' bodies . The experiment proved that the scientists can control the rejection of organs using immunosuppressive drugs. The scientists will now use the genetically engineered organs to replace baboon’s hearts and if successful, it could still be years before animal transplants can be used in clinical trials on humans. Dr Mohiuddin believes that other tissues could also be transplanted from animals to humans, so that people could carry on with their lives with a pig’s liver, kidneys or lungs in the future.","Scientists in Maryland transplanted pig .

"Google has stated that people should not expect privacy when they send messages to a Gmail account. This is according to a brief that was filed last month in a U.S. federal court and recently picked up by Consumer Watchdog. The company claims ‘all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing.’ Google has stated that people should not expect privacy when they send messages to a Gmail account. The company claims 'all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing' A brief for Google said: ‘Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient’s assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their emails are processed by the recipient’s [email provider] in the course of delivery.’ The document was written in response to a lawsuit accusing Google of violating privacy laws when the company reads emails to determine what ads to serve based on the message’s content. The latest lawsuit follows a string of accusations made against Google for it privacy policies. Last week, Google's latest Android phone operating system revealed a feature that will scan for networks and track user's locations even when Wi-Fi has been turned off. The code used to build Android 4.3 claims that 'to improve location accuracy and for other purposes, Google and other apps may scan for nearby networks even when Wi-Fi is off.' Google's statement was written in response to a lawsuit accusing the company of violating privacy laws when the company reads emails to determine what ads to serve based on the message's content . By identifying nearby Wi-Fi networks a device can determine a user's location and it can be used as an alternative to GPS. It also indicates that any location, or 'other' information obtained during this scan will be shared with Google or other apps installed onto a device. Google is yet to comment on what these 'other purposes' could be. Nick Pickles, director of privacy group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Google has repeatedly put profit ahead of user privacy and the way that the company ignored concerns from regulators around the world when it changed its privacy policy showed just how little regard it has for the law. ‘Just because Google is a big business does not put it above the law. The company has ignored the authorities and refused to make any meaningful changes to how it collects and uses people’s data. Google launched a new combined privacy policy for all its services in March 2012. It allowed the company to combine data on individual users from across its services, which include video-sharing site YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+ . ‘Consumers are increasingly concerned about how their data is being used and it is essential that those breaking the law are properly punished. It is essential regulators find a sanction that is not just a slap on the wrists and will make Google’s think twice before it ignores consumer rights again.’ Google launched a new combined privacy policy for all its services in March 2012. It allowed the company to combine data on individual users from across its services, which include video-sharing site YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+. Users have no right to opt out. The move prompted a joint privacy investigation commissioned by 29 European agencies, including the Information Commissioner in the UK. Speaking about the latest lawsuit, John Simpson, Consumer Watchdog’s privacy project director said: ‘Google has finally admitted they don’t respect privacy. ‘People should take them at their word; if you care about your email correspondents’ privacy don’t use Gmail.’ Google's battle has been running since 2011 - here are the key moments: .

"A five-year-old girl has died in hospital three days after developing a strain of the flu that she was vaccinated against - as a deadly outbreak of the virus continues to sweep across the country. Keira Driscoll was prescribed steroids and a nebulizer at a Quick Care clinic after she started feeling unwell with a cough and a fever at her home in Clark County, Las Vegas, last Sunday. But just hours later, she collapsed. Her mother, Tiffany Driscoll, frantically performed CPR on her small body, before she was rushed to hospital. There, she was found to have influenza A. Despite medics' best efforts, Keira could not be resuscitated and she was placed on life support. On Tuesday, her parents made the heartbreaking decision to turn off the machine the next day. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Keira Driscoll, from Clark County, Las Vegas, has died in hospital three days after developing a strain of the flu that she was vaccinated against, her family has announced. Above, the five-year-old in a school photo . However, Keira died before the machine would have been switched off after suffering from a cardiac arrest. She was surrounded by her mother, father, Peter Driscoll, and other relatives at the time. The youngster is the fourth child in the Nevada-based county - and the 56th nationwide - to have died from the flu in the past few months as vaccines have proved largely ineffective. Speaking to Fox 5 News, Keira's aunt, Laura Beckstead, who is headmistress at the school Keira attended, paid tribute to 'a happy girl' who was 'always curious and loved learning'. 'She was the first one to come up and give somebody a hug. She liked everyone,' said Ms Beckstead, who runs the private American Heritage Academy in South Sandhill Road. Distraught: Keira was rushed to hospital and placed on life support after collapsing at her family's home. Above, this heartbreaking photo shows the youngster's parents, Tiffany and Peter, with her in hospital . Too young: On Tuesday, the Driscolls made the difficult decision to turn off Keira's life support machine the next day. However, Keira died from a cardiac arrest before this. Above, the Driscolls hold their child's hand . Sad: On Fundly.com, Keira's family announced their young relative's death, asking donors to pray for them . She added that the family is relying on their faith, saying: 'Even though Kiera has been taken from us, we believe that her time here, her mission was fulfilled and that she is in a better place.' On Thursday, Keira's classmates dressed in her favorite colour - purple - to pay tribute to the youngster, who also loved 'rainbows, ponies, kittens, princesses, unicorns and everything magical'. Keira's death comes amid a national flu outbreak. So far this season, 56 children have died from flu across the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the first week of the year alone, 19 children died . Nationwide epidemic: Kiera (pictured in a family photo) is the fourth child in the Nevada-based county - and the 56th nationwide - to have died from the flu in the past few months as vaccines have proved largely ineffective . 'A happy girl': Speaking to Fox 5 News , Keira's aunt, Laura Beckstead, who is headmistress at the school Keira (pictured, left and right) attended, paid tribute to 'a happy girl' who was 'always curious and loved learning' Spread: This map shows the high activity level of flu that has swept the U.S. during the 2014/2015 season . In total, more than 8,000 people have been hopitalized with the flu since the start of October, with the elderly the most affected, the CDC reported. The central states, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Texas, have reported the highest incidence of flu illnesses. Most of the victims have suffered from one of two influenza A strains. This is despite, so far this season, a higher number of people having had the flu vaccine than last (40.3 per cent were vaccinated early this season, compared to 39.5 per cent early last season). Keira's death also comes after the CDC reported last week that more than three quarters of people who had the injection - which contains strains of influenza A - this year will get the virus anyway. Youngster's aunt: Keira 'was the first one to come up and give somebody a hug. She liked everyone,' said Ms Beckstead (pictured), headmistress of the private American Heritage Academy in South Sandhill Road . Paying tribute: On Thursday, Keira's classmates at the Academy (pictured) dressed in her favorite colour - purple - to pay tribute to the youngster, who also loved 'rainbows, unicorns and everything magical' Uptake: So far this season, more people have had flu injections than last season, this CDC graph shows . The percentage of effective injections - 23 per cent - is one of the worst performances since the government started tracking how well vaccines work in the 2004-2005 season. The effectiveness has ranged from 10 to 60 per cent, the CDC said. According to the Southern Nevada Health District, there have been six flu-related deaths in Clark County this season. Four of the six were children. Last season, 109 children nationally died from flu. Keira is also survived by her 19-month-old sister, River Driscoll. Her family, which is Irish, celebrated her life with a wake at Sweet Tomatoes - her favorite restaurant - on Friday, News 3 reported. They have also set up a Fundly.com account to help pay for the youngster's funeral expenses. Another victim: Earlier this month, 15-year-old Kobi Pickett (pictured) died at home in Houston, Texas, after passing out in the shower and crashing through the glass door while suffering from a strain of the flu . To date, 56 children have died from the flu this season - and more than 8,000 across the country have been hospitalized with the virus since October 1, the CDC has said. At the end of the year, the CDC confirmed for the first time that deaths from flu and pneumonia reached an epidemic level, comprising 6.9 per cent of all deaths. And now, in the midst of a worrisome flu season, health officials are pushing doctors to prescribe antiviral medicines more often. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lat week sent a new alert to doctors, advising prompt use of Tamiflu and other antivirals for hospitalized flu patients and those at higher risk for complications like pneumonia. CDC officials say a nasty strain of flu is going around that is more dangerous to elderly people and young children.  Worryingly, officials think vaccines do not work well against this particular virus. So 'it's more important than usual' that doctors treat certain patients with Tamiflu or other antiviral medications,' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said at a press conference.. CDC research suggests doctors prescribe antivirals to one in five high-risk flu patients. However, the centers' officials say the number should be higher. When given promptly - within two days of the beginning of flu symptoms - the antivirals can shorten the amount of time someone is sick with the flu, a number of studies have found. The drugs also can prevent patients from becoming sick enough to end up in a hospital intensive care unit - or worse, Frieden said. 'Antiviral flu medicines save lives,' Dr Frieden said. The CDC sent an advisory to physicians last month, warning them this could be a potentially bad flu season and encouraging prompt treatment with antivirals. Officials said doctors should not wait for test results confirming the flu if they are dealing with an elderly patient, someone who is very sick, or someone with pre-existing medical conditions.","Keira Driscoll, five, developed cough and fever at her home last Sunday .

"Google has launched one of its most addictive doodle’s yet as it celebrates the 40th birthday of the Rubik's Cube. An animated version of the popular puzzle has been created by Google engineers allowing anyone to solve the frustratingly-difficult game by clicking below, or visiting Google's homepage. There are 43 quintillion versions of how the cube’s 54 coloured squares can be arranged over the six faces - but every Rubik’s Cube is logically solvable in 20 moves or less. Scroll down for video or click below to play . Single time: Mats Valk of the Netherlands in March 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds at the Zonhoven Open in Belgium. Average time: Feliks Zemdegs at the Melbourne Cube Day 2013 with a 6.54 seconds average solve time. One-handed solving: A time of 9.03 seconds was made by Feliks Zemdegs at the Lifestyle Seasons Summer 2014 . Feet solving: Fakhri Raihaan solved a Rubik's Cube with his feet in 27.93 seconds at the Celebes 2012. Robot: Cubestormer 3 solved a Rubik's Cube in 3.253 seconds - beating the Cubestormer 2's record of 5.27 seconds. The Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik, but was not released until 1980 when it became a phenomenon. In Google’s version, the cube is at first shown performing a simple loop. Clicking on the animation causes the cube to become enlarged fully coloured. The user then rotates the rows and columns horizontally and vertically, and manipulates the cube by clicking and dragging it in different directions. Numbers on the bottom left corner reveal how many moves have been taken. And the old trick of carefully steaming off all of the stickers and then re-sticking them in the right position won’t work here. On the Google homepage, the user can rotate the rows and columns horizontally and vertically, and manipulate the cube by clicking and dragging it in different direction. Numbers on the bottom left corner reveal how many moves have been taken . The Guinness World Record for solving a Rubik's Cube in the fastest time was smashed in March a robot. The Cubestormer 3 solved the cube in a speedy 3.253 seconds. The robot's record-breaking time beat the previous non-human record of 5.27 seconds - set by the machine's predecessor, the Cubestormer 2. The fastest human time to solve a cube was set in March last year by Mats Valk of the Netherlands who completed the challenge in an impressive 5.55 seconds. Amazingly, some talented fans can complete the cube with one hand - such as Feliks Zemdegs who holds the single-handed completion record of 9.03 seconds. The official website of the Rubik's cube recommends seven steps: . 1. Get to know your cube. For example, you should know that white is . opposite yellow, orange is opposite red and green is opposite blue. The . centre piece colours are always opposite each other. 2. Solve the white cross. The Rubik's website recommends you aim to create . a white cross on the top face of the cube first of all. This will make . the next phase easier. 3. Solve the white corners. Corner pieces will have one white side plus two other colours. 4. Solve the middle layer, so the bottom two layers of your cube match in colour. 5. Solve the top layer. Try and get a yellow cross on the top face of your . cube. Next, you should try and get all the yellow on the top face. 6. Position the yellow corners correctly. Twist the top face, which should . be yellow, until at least two of the corners are in the right location. 7. Finally, correctly place the centre pieces. Another top solver Fakhri Raihaan can complete the toy with his feet in just 27.93 seconds . Last month, USA Today spoke to Ernő Rubik, inventor of the Rubik's Cube, about its legacy. ‘The Cube is full of contradictions,’ Rubik said. ‘Humans like contradictions, because that makes life interesting and enjoyable. The Cube is very simple and very complex at the same time.’ Rubik added that when it first came out, it was much tougher to solve without access to Google or other websites. ‘Nowadays it's different,’ he said. ‘You can learn it; you can find lots of things on the internet. The combined power of the mind is much stronger than individual ones.’ The fastest human to ever complete a cube - which was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor Erno Rubik, is Mats Valk of the Netherlands in March 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds .","Game can be played by clicking on the image below or visiting Google .

"As the grumpy old man of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson’s grey hair and paunch are as much part of his image as the fast cars.

A Roma move for Carlton Cole, perhaps? ‘When I heard I had the chance to . come to a big club in Italy it was something I wanted to do. Clubs . abroad don’t come in for English players as much as people think. ‘I’ve . never been out of London so this is a big opportunity for me to try a . different language, a different culture and a different way of living.’ Given . all the hand-wringing after England’s latest World Cup disaster, Cole’s . comments have resonance.

If I go out, I know fans will come up to me, but I . am going to enjoy the city and not be afraid of that.’ Club-wise, there can be little for Cole to regret.

"Wealthy collectors descended on Geneva, Switzerland, for the sale of the Henry Graves Supercomplication (pictured) The 'Holy Grail' of watches sold at auction today to a mystery buyer - for a world record £15.1million. Wealthy collectors descended on Geneva, Switzerland, for the sale of the Henry Graves Supercomplication. Made by Patek Philippe, it is the most complex watch ever assembled entirely by hand and was offered with an estimate of £10million. A bidding frenzy soon broke out in the Sotheby's auction room after an opening offer of 9m Swiss francs (£5.85m). There were tense moments in the auction house and bids became drawn out around the 18m mark (£11.7m). The hammer eventually went down at a staggering 20.6million (£13.4m) - a new world record with the auction house - sparking a round of applause. With auction costs, the final price paid by the 'man in a red tie' was £15.1 million. Patek Philippe was commissioned by New York banker Henry Graves to make the watch in 1925. It took Swiss horologists three years to research and a further five to make, completing it in 1933. The watch has a gold openface minute repeating chronograph clockwatch with Westminster chimes. It also features a perpetual calendar, moon phases, sidereal time, power reserve, and indications for time of sunset and sunrise and the night sky of New York City. In total, there are 24 horological complications and 'The Graves' held the title of the world's most complicated watch for 56 years. The masterpiece has only been surpassed by technicians working with the aid of computers. It was last wound in 1969 and is still in working order. Scroll down for video . It was last auctioned off in 1999 for $11million and had a lower end reserve price of $15.6m in the current sale. The buyer on that occasion is thought to have been Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al-Thani, the former minister of culture and heritage in Qatar. He later gave it to Sotheby's to help cover an unpaid debt. Prior to the auction, Tim Bourne, Sotheby's worldwide head of watches, described The Graves as 'the Holy Grail'. Made by Patek Philippe, it is the most complex watch ever assembled entirely by hand and was offered with an estimate of £10million . With auction costs, the final price paid by a 'man in a red tie' was £15.1 million -  a new world record . There were five bidders who battled it out for 15 minutes to get their hands on the watch. Tim Bourne, Sotheby's worldwide head of watches, and Daryn Schnipper, chairman of Sotheby's watch division, described the Patek Philippe-made masterpiece as 'more than a watch'. They said: 'This evening's stellar result confirms the rockstar status of The Henry Graves Supercomplication. 'It is more than a watch. It is a masterpiece which transcends the boundaries of horology and has earned its place among the world's greatest works of art. 'The fascination it has attracted over the past few months, as Patek Philippe celebrates its 175th anniversary, is a fitting tribute to the genius of the Swiss manufacturer.' Sotheby's said the watch seller was confidential and would not give any details on the buyer.","Sale of Henry Graves Supercomplication followed 15 minute bidding war .

"When the Nichol family was invited to a wedding at Lake Como in Italy, I was rather hopeful I might catch a glimpse of the celebrity-strewn nuptials of George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin who, at the time, were widely rumoured to be preparing to tie the knot on the shores of this most beautiful holiday destination. Inexplicably, they decided to wed in Venice - so my wife Suzie, daughter Sophie and I were able to focus fully on the equally delightful, and paparazzi-free, marriage of our close friends Jo and Mark. After landing at Milan Malpensa, and an hour's stomach-churning car journey around the endlessly winding roads that border the lake, we arrived at Lenno, a small village on the west bank of the lake, some 17 miles north of Como itself. An absolute beauty: Lake Como, with the little town of Bellagio adorning its shore, is a true Italian wonder . The Hotel Albergo Lenno occupies an enviable spot directly on the tree-lined promenade and opposite Bellagio, one of the most famous and picturesque towns on the lake. Our room was large, clean and comfortable with two balconies offering the most incredible views of the lake and surrounding mountains. It was a real delight to gaze out across the shimmering waters to the steepsided, verdant hillsides and watch the ferries ply their trade. A few of the more affluent tourists clearly had money to burn, so came and went by seaplane. As befits a small, family-run hotel, the Albergo Lenno staff were extremely friendly and efficient - small things such as printing out airline boarding passes, helping with translations and booking taxis and trains were all done with a smile. The Y-shaped Lake Como is nearly 30 miles long and divides into two branches at Bellagio. Como sits on the south-western tip, Lecco on the south-east. The crystal-clear waters plunge to 1,300ft in parts, making this one of the deepest lakes in Europe. A different part of Italy entirely: George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin married in Venice in late September . Lake Como is an incredibly popular resort and, though they could easily be something of a tourist-trap in peak season, I was mightily impressed by the shoreside restaurants and bars where staff were friendly and prices reasonable. Using a phrase book and pidgin Italian, I managed to order up a veritable feast for dinner including fresh, crisp pizzas, large plates of delicious pasta, and wonderful bruschetta liberally dosed with garlic, basil and tomatoes. It was simple fare but very well done and staggeringly good value at just €49 (about £38) - and that included copious beer, wine and soft drinks. A boat trip around the lake took us past the luxurious villas of the rich and famous. Richard Branson is rumoured to own one and, apparently, another villa appeared on The X Factor's 'judges' houses' section of the show. The truly magnificent Villa del Balbianello, built for Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini at the end of the 18th century, has starred in many films including Casino Royale with Daniel Craig. Standing on the tip of a steep promontory overlooking the lake, the sweeping gardens and high walls give this fabulous mansion a real air of a Bond villain lair. Making do with a non-celebrity wedding: The Nichol family were denied a glimpse of the Clooneys . Sadly, the time for sightseeing was limited as we had to don our finery for the wedding. The ceremony and reception were held on the shore of the lake. Bathed in sunshine, the backdrop of jagged peaks, passing boats, gleaming water and beautiful hillside villas provided a truly stunning location for such a memorable event. As the sun set over the lake, the wine flowed and the laughter and dancing became slightly more raucous. It may have been a celebrity-free wedding, but the Nichol family were more than happy to have been invited and to experience the splendour and majesty of Lake Como. British Airways (www.ba.com) offers return flights from Heathrow to Milan from £110 and can arrange car hire. Hotel Albergo Lenno (www.albergolenno.com) reopens on March 13.

"Car manufacturers may be working on eco-friendly cars using hydrogen fuel cells and ‘green’ electricity. But three amateur inventors have come up with a steam-powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel. The Cornish trio are testing their bike on local moorland and hope their biogas engine could one day be used to power homes and other machines in a more eco-friendly way than diesel. Scroll down for video . A new approach to cycling: Three amateur inventors have come up with a steam-powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel. Richard Backborow, Graham Waldren and Mat Thompson are pictured from left to right . The machine is endorsed by celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and is a cross between a bicycle and trike. It works by woodchips being burnt inside the contraption’s biomass engine, which gives off gas that is condensed into steam. Rather than pedalling, the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ‘expansion motor’ to generate one horsepower – making the machine three times more powerful than the average cyclist. Inventor craftsman Graham Waldren designed and built the bike with his friends Richard Blackborow, a gallery curator, and Mat Thompson, who works in healthcare.

Rather than pedalling, the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ‘expansion motor’ to generate one horsepower – making the machine three times more powerful than the average cyclist. They are currently testing their new technology on moorland near Zennor, Cornwall and hope one to day to see it power homes and other devices. Mr Waldren said: ‘No-one has made any developments in steam technology for 200 years. ‘The motoring manufacturers are locked into what they are doing. The funding doesn’t exist for this. ‘Once we can put together the engine it will be a platform to demonstrate what we are doing and give us data.’ The bike can currently do around 25 miles for every 2.2lbs (1kg) of wood chips and takes about five minutes to start up. Mr Thompson explained: ‘It won’t replace the car, it might not work for bikes, but [it may work] for a small generator, for taking you off grid. The unusual bike is being put through its paces on the moors of Zennor in Cornwall (shown on this map) The trio of inventors hope one to day to see their biogas engine power homes and other devices. Here, they release a flame from the prototype engine . ‘We don’t have a lot of trees in Cornwall but there will be countries that could use this technology.’ The trio say renewable energy experts from the University of Exeter have expressed an interest in their designs. They are currently raising funds via the Crowdfunder website for further research into the so-called Phoenix Project, which is backed by River Cottage boss Fearnley-Whittingstall. He said: ‘I can’t resist getting behind these guys, if only so I can get a step closer to my dream of a carbon neutral wood-chip powered flail mower for River Cottage.

"Insensitive: Fox presenter Andrea Tantaros compared living on food stamps to a weight-loss plan . As record numbers of Americans spend Thanksgiving on food stamps, one Fox news presenter has offered some advice - treat the experience as a great way to lose those extra pounds. TV host Andrea Tantaros compared food stamps - which provide an average monthly budget of $133 - to being on a diet. Ms Tantaros was asked by co-host Stuart Varney, during Wednesday's broadcast of The Five on Fox Business, if she could live on that amount. She told Fox viewers: 'I should try it because do you know how fabulous I’d look? 'I’d be so skinny. I mean, the camera adds ten pounds, it really does.' Social media lit up with thousands of outraged responses following Ms Tantaros' off-hand remarks. One tweet from @imthepain29 read: 'She can lose lbs but she can't lose Ugly.' Another tweeted at the presenter said: 'Lucky you can diet by choice, not poverty.' Ms Tantaros hit back on Twitter, posting: 'It's amazing how stupid & humorless some liberals can be. I'm asked if I can live on $134/mo in food WHICH I HAVE, and they go crazy Really?' She later highlighted a Department of Agriculture radio advert that had compared food stamps to a healthy eating plan. The . 33-year-old later added: 'Food stamps were sold as a fitness plan to . ""look great"" by our liberal, dense government - remember? The Fox panel discussion was sparked by Newark Mayor Cory Booker's decision to live for a week on food stamps from December 4. His plan is to highlight the struggles families face on the government-assisted program. The Democratic politician took up the . challenge after getting into a dispute with a voter who had argued that . it is not the place of government to insure that everyone maintains high . nutritional standards. Off the cuff: Fox News' Andrea Tantaros, who co-hosts The Five, likened food stamps to a diet during a discussion with co-host Stuart Varney . Being thankful: A Thanksgiving lunch is provided at the LA mission to help those less fortunate . Mr Booker responded that it is when it comes to children who need to be 'ready 2 learn' at school. The argument took a turn when the Twitter user made a slight about food stamp recipients, saying: 'why is there a family today that is ""too poor to afford breakfast""? are they not already receiving food stamps?' Booker responded: 'Lets you and I try to . live on food stamps in New Jersey (high cost of living) and feed a . family for a week or month. U game?'

"Steven Gerrard gave an assured display at the heart of England's midfield. Check out his heat map and all the match stats here . In the 82nd minute, a large, white paper aeroplane floated down the considerable distance from Wembley’s third tier and struck Hansell Riojas, a Peru substitute playing at full-back, on his right shoulder. It drew the most heartfelt cheer of the night. Quite right, too. Skill like that you don’t see every day. The rest of it, we’ve sort of seen before. The most famous Peruvian visitor to these shores took to hanging about antiques shops in Portobello Road and kept marmalade sandwiches under his hat, so it is fair to say not a huge amount was expected of England's opponents and they did not disappoint. Peru turned in enough skilful, enterprising play on the counter early on to pose a gentle threat, followed by some woeful defending of set-pieces that afforded England two second-half goals from corners, and a scoreline with emphasis.

The Italian back four have seen the . odd inswinging corner and, first of all, you have to get up their end of . the field to win it. On this evidence, what progress  England do make . in that direction will be painstaking, to say the least. The energy levels grew as more players with a point to prove — . those not in the starting line-up — were introduced, but if this was a . dry-run for England’s tempo in the heat of Manaus, ‘slow and steady wins . the race’ seems to be the motto. England’s first group game with Italy . is the shortest price for a 0-0 draw of any fixture in the tournament, . and with good reason. Still, . a party with a happy atmosphere was the demand and England will depart . for Brazil via Miami this weekend, smiling. There was music, a bit of .

Sturridge finding his range from outside the area, as he did in the . first half. Sturridge’s goal, coming after 32 minutes and much needed . after a turgid opening, was the true highlight of the night. The chance of finding a back four in Brazil quite as prone to bouts of narcolepsy, however, is unlikely. Glen . Johnson took a quick throw-in on the right, and would have been . delighted to find the two nearest defenders in repose and in no position . to stop Sturridge receiving the ball and turning towards goal. He was . forced out to just beyond the penalty area by the one Peruvian paying . attention but it was not diversion enough. Sturridge sighted the target . and hit a lovely left-foot shot that curled away from goalkeeper Raul . Fernandez, who is not the most imposing presence, it must be said. Lift-off: Gerrard and his team-mate applaud the home fans after a satisfying result at Wembley . A big hand: Joe Hart was called into action several times but kept Peru at bay . The . goal gave England the breathing space required and Peru’s defence did . the rest. It might have been different if a 35-yard shot from Jean Deza, . who has spent the past year on loan at Montpellier, had dipped an extra . six inches nine minutes into the second half but it didn’t and Peru’s . threat then passed. Their . best spell had come in the first half when Joe Hart saved another . deflected shot from Deza and then kept out Luis Ramirez with his feet, . but Peru were nifty without being greatly intimidating. They were chosen . for this purpose, one supposes, and served it well. It . may be that manager Roy Hodgson instructed his squad to imagine this . was a stifling night in tropical Manaus and to play at a tempo conducive . to saving energy in heat and humidity. We can only hope so. If . not, England need to find  several gears if they are to make any . impression on the group in Brazil, let alone the tournament. No matter . the conditions, a certain rhythmic level is required and  England lacked . it for long periods. It is . not a good sign when the biggest cheer is provoked by paper missiles, . or when the first successful throw on to the playing area instantly . inspires hundreds of distracted imitators.

Pain game: Luis Ramirez winces after coming off worse in a challenge with Wayne Rooney on Friday night . Caught out: Danny Welbeck slips while trying to evade the attentions of Christian Ramos . Sadly, . all that was proven for much of the night is that England’s flyers are . as inconsistent as their footballers: the very occasional score . enlivening a rather ordinary succession of failures. Having . said this, a good set-piece will always win matches, even in the most . rarefied atmosphere, and England are taking a weapon of sorts to South . America in the shape of Baines. It . was the Everton man who picked out Gary Cahill in the 65th minute for a . thumping header that gave England a two-goal cushion and dispelled any . hope of a Peruvian revival. The marking was ordinary and it always helps . when the man guarding the far post would need a pogo stick to reach any . header steered towards the top corner, but Peru’s shortcomings are not . England’s responsibility. There . was a degree of fortune with the third, however, the entirely . unconvincing Fernandez dropping what should have been a simple gather, . the ball clipping Cahill’s head on the way down and falling to Phil . Jagielka who prodded it smartly through the hapless goalkeeper’s . legs. Job done: Hodgson replaced skipper Steven Gerrard with Jack Wilshere . Looking up: Wayne Rooney skips past Josepmir Ballon as England launch an attack . Watching brief: The England bench observe proceedings at Wembley . Plenty to ponder: Hodgson named a strong team, including Rooney, for the final game on home soil before the World Cup .

Hodgson . says that he has not made his mind up on the team, but performances in . training are as likely to influence a final decision as any match — . unless a player turns in a performance of extremes, either positive or . negative. There was nothing at either end here. England did what was expected, but need to step it up this summer.

The top name in Tiger Woods' den of . mistresses is fuming over claims she said she'd be a 'fat housewife with . three kids' had her fiancé not be killed in the 9/11 attacks. As the nation prepares to mark the . tenth anniversary of the terror atrocity, Rachel Uchitel, allegedly told the New York Post’s Page Six magazine that dying on 9/11 was part of Andy O'Grady's destiny. But she says the quotes had been reported out of context. She said: 'I believe Andy was meant to die because he was too good. I'm almost happy it ended the way it did because I've learned so many lessons from him. 'It would have been tragic if we got into fights and then divorced.' In addition, Miss Uchitel was quoted as . saying her life would be drastically different had her fiancé survived. She said: 'I would be a fat housewife with three kids in Sands Point, [Long Island].' On Tuesday, Miss Uchitel hit back on her Twitter page, claiming her remarks were taken out of context. She accused the newspaper of 'molding words and shaping how readers . perceive people. This should be stopped' In addition, Miss Uchitel told TMZ: 'I . would have loved nothing more than to be Andy's housewife.' When reached by MailOnline, the New York Post said: 'We stand by our story.' Mr O’Grady, an investment banker who had proposed to Miss Uchitel months before, was working in the south tower on the morning of  September 11. Days after the attacks, pictures of Miss Uchitel sobbing while clutching a photo of her missing fiancé became one of the most heart-wrenching images of the tragedy.

Miss Uchitel, 36, initially denied the allegations but came clean as more than a dozen other women came forward with their stories of infidelities with the world-famous golfer. Eleven years ago, she met Mr O'Grady on a blind date. He proposed a few months later, in the summer of 2001. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday last year, Miss Uchitel said she and Mr O'Grady 'were madly in love and I was the happiest girl in the world'. 'In Andy I had found my rock, a stable male figure that I’d never had… then 9/11 happened.' She said she left for work early on that morning and didn’t kiss him goodbye because she didn’t want to mess up her lipstick. She said: 'It’s something that haunts me.'

"A taxi driver had his nose broken during a terrifying ordeal in which he was beaten up, robbed, kidnapped, car-jacked and driven nearly 200km by a drunken passenger in NSW's Hunter region. The cabbie picked up the customer from hell in Kurri Kurri on Saturday morning and was asked to drive to Newcastle, a trip which usually takes around half an hour. Police say that on the way, the intoxicated passenger asked to be driven to a caravan park in Maitland to collect money for the fare. By the end of the horrifying ordeal, involving a high-speed police chase, the cabbie ended up battered and bruised all the way in Moorland - nearly 200km away from the Lower Hunter Valley city of Maitland.

The intoxicated passenger then drove the car almost 200km to Moorland . On arrival at the caravan park, what started out as an ordinary job turned violent. The driver and passenger went inside a cabin where it's alleged the passenger pulled out a knife, kicked the taxi driver in the head and took his wallet. The passenger then allegedly forced the taxi driver into the passenger seat and cut the wires to the taxi meter, radio and CCTV system. Taking control of the wheel, the inebriated criminal started speeding north on the Pacific Highway. Police used road spikes to stop the taxi after detecting it travelling at 185km/h on the Pacific Highway at Moorland near Johns River.

"Deciding whether to make a move on the handsome guy you've been eyeballing across the bar has  always been one of the riskiest parts of the dating game. But not for much longer it seems, as technology specialists Philips have launched an app that could remove the possibility of being rejected for good. The Vital Signs camera app measures heart and breathing rates by detecting the small changes of colour in someone’s face and in the movements in their chest. Step one: Surreptitiously take a photo of someone you fancy... We said, SURREPTITIOUSLY!! Users simply hold their iPhone in front of the object of their affection to measure the tell-tale signs of attraction and find out whether they make their date’s heart beat faster. 'The app measures parameters such as heartbeat and breathing rate from real time video images,' says Vincent Jeanne, the man behind the new technology. 'Your heartbeat causes small changes in the colour of your face which are not visible to the eye, but with advanced software, the iPad 2 or iPhone 4S camera detects these ""micro-blushes"" to measure your heart rate. '[Using the same] software, the iPad 2 or iPhone 4S camera simultaneously tracks the movement of your chest as it moves up and down to measure your breathing rate.' Step two: Sit and revel in the fact you're a perfect match...or slink away brokenhearted . WARNING: Don't use if standing next to Game of Thrones star Nicolaj Coster-Waldau or Zero Dark Thirty actress Jessica Chastain. Unless, of course, you're hotter than they are... According to a survey carried out by Philips, more than 41 per cent of men would be willing to try the app, compared to just 28 per cent of women - with the majority of the yes group found in the 18 to 24 age bracket. Older respondents, however, preferred traditional ways of spotting a potential love match such as whether or not they deliberately smile at you or make obvious eye contact. But these signals aren't infallible, and there are very few people who haven't been left red-faced as a result. Far better, say Philips, to rely on technology that is 99 per cent accurate and can even help you choose between two potential dates by measuring two people standing side by side and telling you which one fancies you the most. 'Detecting attraction levels is a novel . and fun way to use the Vital Signs app,' adds Jeanne. There's just one question left for Philips to answer: Can you be 100 per cent sure that when their heart rate goes up that they're looking at you and not at a poster of Jessica Chastain or Nicolaj Coster-Waldau in the background? Users will have to find out for themselves. The Vital Signs app can be downloaded from iTunes for 69p . According to the Philips survey, you don't always need an app to work out whether someone fancies you or not. From extra eye contact to playing with their hair, these are the top five signs to look out for - and you don't have to do a paparazzi impersonation to find out! 1. Use lots of eye contact (28 per cent) 2. Try to find an excuse to touch you  (10 per cent) 3. Accidentally brush their hand/arm/leg with yours (9 per cent) 4. Act overly interested in you or what you are saying (8 per cent) 5. Play with their hair (7 per cent)","Vital Signs app picks up on heart and breathing rate .

"Samantha Harris has spoken for the first time of her devastation at the jailing of her fiancé for causing death by dangerous driving. Luke Hunt was sent to prison for four years on Wednesday after he was found to be driving over the speed limit when he ran a red light and collided with another car. The 23-year-old model, who was in the car at the time of the accident, still struggles to discuss the tragedy which killed the driver of the other car, 78-year-old Kenneth Lay. 'Devastated': Samantha Harris has spoken for the first time about her fiance Luke Hunt's jailing for causing death by dangerous driving . But Ms Harris has now revealed her heartbreak at losing her partner as he was sent behind bars. 'It has been an incredibly traumatic couple of years,' Harris told the Daily Telegraph. 'I am beyond devastated with what has happened and for the Lay family. It is still so raw, having lost my partner. I need time to process and get used to not having him in my life for now.' Ms Harris was seen to be in an emotional state when she attended a beauty launch for Priceline Pharmacy at Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens just two days after the sentencing. Struggling to cope: Model Samantha Harris at an event at Sydney's Botanic Gardens just two days after her fiance was jailed for four years . Luke Hunt, 28, had been driving 35 km/h over the speed limit when he ran a red light in Narweena, NSW . At the time, Ms Harris admitted she had been having a tough time dealing with the court case but wouldn't comment further. ‘It’s been a very tough few days and I really can’t talk about it,’ Ms Harris swallowed. ‘It’s just been really tough.’ ‘She’s still really upset, she just can’t talk about it,’ said her publicist. The model, a Priceline and David Jones ambassador, was more forthcoming about the bullying she experienced growing up, revealing she never felt like she fit in because of her height and her big lips. ‘It’s quite hard for young girls when they stand out and look different and that was me,’ she said. ‘I had big lips when I was little and obviously still do and that was one of the things I didn’t know how to feel about because none of my friends had lips like me and that made me self-conscious and nervous. Glum: The 23-year-old looked downbeat as she attended the event in the Sydney sunshine . Ms Harris did not attend court for the sentencing of her fiance. Hunt defended her lack of appearance, saying she was avoiding the attention of media: 'She is very upset, she can't handle it nowadays,' he said . ‘Kids are kids, some kids aren’t very nice. You get the occasional remark which is hurtful but now that I look back, I think I’ve done quite well with these so-called big lips.’ Ms Harris had not attended court on Wednesday when Hunt, a 28-year-old builder from Queensland, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. When asked by the judge why Harris had not been present at his sentencing, The Daily Telegraph reported that Hunt answered: 'She is very upset, she can’t handle it nowadays.' The incident occurred two years ago when Hunt was on his way to the gym in Narweena in Sydney's northern beaches. He had been trying to change lanes at high speed when his Commodore collided into Mr Lay's Hyundai Lantra at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St, Narraweena. Hunt's car then slammed into a tree. Judge Colin Charteris heard Hunt had been doing 95km/h in a 60km/h zone, Mr Lay, a father of seven and grandfather of 16, died in hospital. The 23-year-old still find is too difficult to discuss the event which saw the death of 78-year-old grandfather Kenneth Lay two years ago . The model, who posed alongside X Factor winner Dami Im and Home And Away's Ada Nicodemou, also spoke out about being the victim of bullying, saying she was picked on for her height and lips . Sentencing at Downing Centre District Court, he said: 'There has been no real account from Hunt to explain why he was driving in such a hurry at the time of the accident. It's completely inexcusable.' However, the judge accepted Hunt's remorse and acknowledged the 28-year-old tradesman now suffers from depression. 'He wishes he had passed away in the accident ... but his regret cannot remedy what has occurred,' Mr Charteris said. Harris seems to be trying to move on from the traumatic event, continuing with her work with little mention of her beau . Harris did not seem her perky self at the event which attempted to set a Guinness World Record for the longest selfie chain . Hunt was also heard sobbing an apology to Mr Lay's family, adding: 'I have been in a dark place for a long time.' Hunt has also been disqualified from driving for six-and-a-half years and will be eligible for parole in 2016. Outside court, Mr Lay's daughter Christine Scott said there were no winners. 'We're not cruel people, and I hate to see somebody go to jail like that, but you can't do what he did,' she told AAP. Hunt and Ms Harris, who shot to national fame in a modelling competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 14, met in a shopping centre on the Gold Coast when the model was 17. They have been engaged for four years. In prison: Luke Hunt, the model's fiance was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted of dangerous driving - he never gave an explanation as to why he was speeding, and now suffers from depression after causing the death of pensioner Kenneth Lay . The collision took place at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St in Narweena, in Sydney's northern suburbs.

"It was his deathbed interview, and a yellow-faced Chopper Read, Australia's most notorious underworld figure, had some bombshells to drop. A little over a fortnight before he died of liver cancer in October 2013, Read sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes and revealed he had been responsible for four cold-blooded killings. He was remorseless. Claimed he didn't feel anything when he killed people.  No surge of adrenalin. No rush. And the man who once said 'You put a camera in front of me... I'll lie my head off' insisted he was telling the truth. 'That's what it's all about, the last interview, the last picture show,' he said. 'I'm telling the truth now.' Scroll down for video . Notorious: Chopper Read, who had his own ears cut off in an attempt to be shifted out of a maximum security prison, was Australia's most infamous underworld figure. 'Deathbed confessional': Dying of liver cancer, Read appeared sick and yellow-faced in his final interview with 60 Minutes last year. In the interview he confessed to four murders. He wanted to be like Ned Kelly: Chopper's body was riddled with tattoos at the end. Resemblance: Eric Bana played Chopper in the self-named film, released in the year 2000.

Adam Shand writes: '(Friends) Mark Dixon and Jacko dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday. 'He had been nowhere near Casino when Sid Collins had disappeared, they said.' MYTH #3: He killed notorious paedophile Reginald Isaacs . Adam Shand writes: 'It is highly likely that Read and Hegyalji had nothing to do with Isaacs' death, yet in the years to come, Read would 'confess' hundreds of times that he and Mad Charlie had murdered Isaacs. 'He would run a dozen different versions in books, shows and interviews, all of them factually impossible, of how they had slain the monster of D Division'. MYTH #4: He killed Desmond Costello, a union heavyweight . Adam Shand writes: 'There was no hard evidence linking Read to those killings... nothing more than his say-so, or he would have been arrested long ago.' Source: The Real Chopper: The Man Behind  The Legend, Inside and Out . His confessions came as little shock to the many Australians who thought of 'Uncle Chop Chop' as a badass -  a murderous, but strangely familiar, character. But, like many of Chopper's stories, there was little evidence. For three of the four murders, the only proof was his word. The interview was one last effort at cementing the myth of Chopper. And it was a missed opportunity to tell the truth about it all, author and journalist Adam Shand argues in a new book, The Real Chopper: The Man Behind The Legend. 'He didn't have the courage to tell people that finally, a lot of what he was saying for the last umpteen years was rubbish,' Mr Shand told Daily Mail Australia. Chopper, who spent 23 years and nine months in prison, 'wasn't nearly as bad as he said he was', Mr Shand said. 'He was a most unremarkable crook.' His tall tales of murder, all based on his say-so, were likely too incredible to be real. Mr Shand wrote that Chopper's associates, Mark Dixon and Mark 'Jacko' Jackson, 'dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday'. They said Chopper was 'nowhere near' Casino, NSW, at the time he was said to have killed Queensland bikie boss Sidney Collins in 2002. Mr Shand also told Daily Mail Australia that Chopper he was only a teenager in 1971, when he was supposed to have murdered union heavyweight Desmond Costello - an unlikely proposition. And as for his apparent murder of notorious paedophile Reg Isaacs in jail, in the mid-70s? 'His story doesn't match (the facts) at all,' Mr Shand told Daily Mail Australia. There's only proof he was behind the deaths one of his alleged victims: Drug dealer Sammy 'The Turk' Ozekam, who was gunned down outside Bojangles Nightclub in St Kilda, Melbourne, in 1987. Chopper was acquitted of his murder after pleading self-defence. Likewise, Mr Shand wrote that Chopper's stories of chopping of toes, torture and blowtorching people's feet weren't grounded in reality. The tagline of Bana's movie was 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn'. An autographed picture of 'Chopper' Read. Shot dead: Even Chopper Read was surprised when he was acquitted of murdering Sammy The Turk (pictured) on the grounds of self defence. Victims? In his final interview, Chopper Read claimed he murdered union heavy Desmond Costello (left) and Sidney Collins (right), a Queensland bikie boss. In his prime: Chopper worked as an informer for Victoria's Armed Robbery Squad in 1986 - 87. If anything, Chopper appears to have been a lousy crook. Whether it was armed robbery, impersonating a police officer or killing Sammy The Turk, 'just about everything he ever did, he was caught for,' Mr Shand said. And while he often said his motto was Never Plead Guilty, Chopper, who would spend 23 years and nine months behind bars, almost always did. 'He would open up like a watermelon falling off a truck,' Mr Shand wrote. But he had a glorious imagination, which grew out of his love of cowboy tales and gangster yarns as a child. He had something of a lonely childhood - his mother, a devout Seventh Day Adventist, was a 'religious zealot'. He developed an ambition to become a household name similar to those other legends of Australian criminal history, Ned Kelly and 1920s Melbourne gangster Squizzy Taylor. And that's what he became. He first felt the glow of infamy when, imprisoned in the notorious maximum security H Division wing of Pentridge Prison in the 1970s, he convinced a fellow inmate to cut his ears off in order to get him shifted out. Everyone slashed their wrists, Mr Shand wrote. Chopper, however, needed to do something more dramatic. And while the extent of his biggest crimes are questionable, many of his bizarre antics were the stuff of truth. He audaciously tried to kidnap a County Court judge in 1978. And he once spooned two or three tablespoons of faeces into the prisoners' stew at Pentridge Prison. As you can imagine, it made him a lot of enemies. Read was a devoted dad to his two sons, Charlie (pictured) and Roy. Father figure: Read promised wife Margaret he would never return to crime. The myth around Chopper ballooned in the 1990s after the publication of some of Chopper's 'diaries'. And then it appeared to spin out of control. Australians have purchased more than 500,000 copies of his books, according to an ABC report.  Plus there was Eric Bana's feature film, which hit the big screen in 2000. Mr Shand, who followed Chopper's case for years, trawled through his prison file and interrogated his friends and enemies, told Daily Mail Australia that in reality, Chopper was just a fraction of the myth he created. 'I would say there's about ten per cent truth,' he said. He said Mark Read - devoted father of his two boys, Roy and Charlie - became imprisoned by the myth of Chopper. 'Everyone wants to be famous... He craved fame, he craved acceptance,' Mr Shand said. 'Mark Brandon Read, was not prepared to step outside the cartoon character and say, ""Here I am!"" '(Even in his books) he gives you big, juicy hints some of this wasn't all quite right. But we all sort of chose to ignore thos' 'He told people he never cut people's toes off with a pair of boltcutters. Really he was just giving people what they wanted. Earlier this month, Chopper Read posthumously won the 'Best Supporting Actor' gong at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival for a role he played in the comedy Start Options Exit'. It was a strangely appropriate tribute, Mr Shand said. 'I think he's been acting his whole life,' he told Daily Mail Australia, 'So it's not surprising'.

"It is an over-the-top and extravagant house that would not look out of place at a theme park. But for Teresa and husband Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice, their dream home is quickly turning into a nightmare as the pair face charges of financial fraud over the property. In newly released stills from the Bravo show The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Teresa's lavish home has been revealed in all its opulent glory. Gaudy: This marble-floor hallway and double staircase with have cost the Giudice family a pretty penny . Teresa is seen posing in her daughter Audriana's room which features an animated self-portrait titled 'Mama Teresa'. The gaudy dining room includes a giant low-hung chandelier which certainly wouldn't have come cheap. But perhaps the most costly sight of all is the hallways in the property which features marble flooring and a double staircase. Over-the-top: Teresa poses by some graffiti artwork on her daughter Audriana's bedroom wall in the mansion . Living in a fantasy: The Giudice's dream home could soon turn into a nightmare for the family . OTT: Teresa's daughters rooms come complete with a Bratz dolls style color scheme and graffiti artwork . Yesterday it was revealed that Teresa and her husband Joe had been released on a combined $1million bail after making initial court appearances Tuesday on federal fraud charges. Mother-of-four Teresa broke her silence on her official Twitter account on Wednesday to talk about the case. 'Thank you all so so much for your love and support. It means the world to me and my family,' adding: 'I wish I could hug you all right now.' The couple have been ordered to surrender their passports and to confine their travels to New Jersey and New York. Joe Giudice could be deported to Italy if convicted because he is not a U.S. citizen. Teresa, 41, and her 43-year-old husband had toned down their usual flamboyant look to wear differing shades of slate suit, the reality TV queen even had her famous hair slicked back into a sensible ponytail as she walked into Martin Luther King Jr. courthouse in Newark, New Jersey. Grand: The kitchen area also boasts a marble-to breakfast bar in the plush mansion .

The couple were charged in a 39-count indictment Monday with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud. They are accused of exaggerating their income while applying for loans before their TV show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after their first season aired. Authorities allege the couple submitted fraudulent mortgage and other loan applications from 2001 to 2008, a year before their show debuted on Bravo. Prosecutors said the couple submitted fake W-2s, tax returns and bank account information to lenders. Serious trouble: Teresa and Joe, who have posted $1 million bail, are facing 50 years in prison if convicted on 39 counts of various forms of fraud . In a statement, Teresa said she supports her husband and wants to resolve the charges as soon as possible. 'I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible, which includes continuing my career,' she said. In their 2009 bankruptcy filing, the couple said they were $11 million in debt. They stated their monthly take-home pay was $16,583, but $10,000 was from 'monthly assistance from family members' and Bravo income. Proud home owner: Teresa certainly takes pride in the appearance of herself and her opulent home in New Jersey . Happier times: There appears to have been no expense spared on the home of Teresa  and husband Joe Giudice .

The most serious charges the couple face, bank fraud and loan application fraud, carry a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of more 50 years in prison.

"Following accusations of double standards, Sharon Osbourne has 'categorically' denied that either she or husband Ozzy have ordered take-out food from the Beverly Hills Hotel since she called on people to boycott the establishment. Osbourne has been one of the most vocal public supporters of the on-going protest against the hotel after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced strict new Islamic criminal laws in the Southeast Asian state. On Monday, the New York Post reported that staff at the iconic hotel had confirmed that the Osbourne household had secretly been ordering takeout from them, while Sharon was publicly calling on people to shun the resort. All talk? Sharon Osbourne, one of the most vocal public supporters of the on-going boycott against the Beverly Hills Hotel, has been accused of double standards . 'It is categorically false that Ozzy Osbourne and I have order take-out food from the Beverly Hills Hotel since we started our boycott,' wrote Sharon on Facebook. 'First off, I have been out of the country for the past two weeks, so there's not even the slightest possibility I could have placed a 'recent' order as stated by hotel staff.' 'For the record. I am continuing my boycott of The Dorchester Collection Hotels in opposition to the Sultan Of Brunei's implementation of Sharia Law. I would never back down from my beliefs, especially for a plate of food.' Until recently, the hotel was one of the most popular with Hollywood actors and celebrities, but they’ve been shunning it in recent weeks as part of protests at the introduction of strict new Islamic criminal laws in Brunei. Sharon Osbourne took to Facebook on Monday to 'categorically' deny that she has ordered take-out food from the Beverly Hills Hotel since she called for a boycott of it . The hotel, part of the Dorchester Collection, is owned by the Sultan, who six weeks ago passed the laws which call for the stoning to death of homosexuals and adulterers. Osbourne joined a host of celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres, Jay Leno and Virgin boss Richard Branson, who’ve called for a boycott of the Sultan’s hotels as a protest at the archaic laws. On an episode of The Talk last month, Osbourne said she wouldn’t be visiting the hotels until he sold up. ‘I will not frequent an establishment that is owned by a person who says they are going to stone gays. It is insane behavior!,' she said, before revealing that she had gay friends who worked in several of the Sultan’s hotels. Until recently, the Beverly Hills Hotel was one of the most popular with Hollywood actors and celebrities, but they've shunned it in recent weeks . On an episode of The Talk last month, Sharon Osbourne said she wouldn't be visiting the hotel until the Sultan of Brunei sold up . On Twitter and Facebook, Osbourne has also made very public statements calling for people to join her in the boycott. However the New York Post is reporting that several sources have confirmed that the Osbourne household have made several orders in recent weeks all while the boycott has been going on. ‘Nobody can be seen going into the hotel, so Sharon and her staff have been ordering takeout food from the Beverly Hills Hotel’s Fountain Coffee Room, then sending an assistant to pick it up,' a source told the newspaper. 'Sharon’s home is around the corner. The hotel staff are shocked at the hypocrisy.' A representative for Sharon Osbourne has denied the allegations, but admitted that staff at her home could have ordered from the supposedly shunned establishment. ‘Sharon is continuing her boycott of the . Dorchester Collection hotels in opposition to the Sultan of Brunei’s . implementation of Sharia law,' said the rep in a statement. On Twitter and Facebook, Sharon Osbourne has also made very public statements calling for people to join her in the boycott . 'Rumors that she had her assistant pick up food for her at the Beverly Hills Hotel are fabricated and a blatant attempt to discredit Sharon. Sharon stands by her values and beliefs and would never back down, especially just for a chopped salad. ‘Christopher Cowdray (CEO of the Dorchester Collection) came to meet with her at CBS Studios and begged her to stop the boycott and to continue to be a patron of their hotels, but she flatly refused. 'Sharon says this shows that the boycott is working and that they’re desperate. They’re just singling Sharon out because she has a daily talk-show platform. 'Just for the record, her assistant (Julie) has not set foot in the Beverly Hills Hotel in the six weeks since she started her boycott.’ Cowdray admitted last month that the hotel has missed out on over $1.5million in lost income due to cancelled events, but he insisted the company could ‘weather the storm’.

"PG Tips apparently have no interest in funding retirement of their star . As celebrity retirement homes go, this one is disappointingly low key. There are no chaises longues, no gilded mirrors, no hot and cold running servants, and no carb-free meals arriving under silver domes. There isn’t even a telly (though there was one once — showing Westerns and old episodes of Kojak all day long). Fancy a cuppa? Choppers, in the wig, starring in a PG Tips advert . Instead, there’s a large mound of grass populated by a couple of tree stumps, and a very basic climbing-frame draped with rope, all enclosed by a mini-moat and high smeary glass walls. Inside, behind two floppy plastic doors, is a large area covered in straw. There are four shelves for beds and lights go out at 8pm. Choppers the last surviving British PG Tips chimp and, in the Seventies, one of our biggest television stars . This is home to Choppers, the last surviving British PG Tips chimp and, in the Seventies, one of our biggest television stars. Now 42 years old, she has a kindly face, a bit of a stoop and a lot of very bristly facial hairs. She . potters about her enclosure in Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire, . occasionally stopping for a sniff, a scratch or a rub against the tree . stump. Her previous . incarnation — dressed in flowery frocks and enormous wigs, proffering . cups of tea and opening fetes, shopping arcades and new schools — seems . quite unbelievable. And long forgotten. But memories have come rushing back after zoo officials claimed that Choppers (along with the rest of ‘The Tipps Family’) was irretrievably damaged by her brush with celebrity and human contact during her developing years. ‘She’s mixed up. She didn’t know how to interact with other chimps. It’s taken years for her to re-integrate,’ said Sharon Redrobe, of Twycross Zoo. To add insult to injury, PG Tips apparently have no interest in funding the retirement of their one-time star. It’s hardly surprising if Choppers is a bit confused. For at the height of their fame, the Twycross chimps didn’t exactly lead normal lives. Under the loving (if, with the benefit of hindsight, misguided) supervision of the zoo’s eccentric founder, Molly Badham, they starred in countless commercials, became massive stars and helped fund Twycross as it is today. It all began in 1956, back when nobody baulked at the thought of dressing up wild animals in pinnies and blue-rinse wigs and training them to iron shirts, ride exercise bikes and sip daintily from china cups and saucers. PG Tips chimp Choppers in one of the PG Tips adverts that aired during the 1970s . For nearly three decades, generations of Twycross chimps posed as tea ladies, exercise fanatics, James (‘Brooke’) Bond, cowboys with ten-gallon hats and six shooters and Tour de France cyclists, all to sell more tea. Perhaps the most enduring advert featured two removal men — Mr Shifter and son — wrestling with a piano stuck on the stairs. The apprentice asks his dad if he knows the piano is on his foot, earning the reply: ‘You hum it, son, I’ll play it.’ Cue Choppers’s big moment — wearing a flowery dress, frilly pink pinny and blue rinse wig, she offers them a consolatory cup of tea. Although we could never admit it now, the adverts (voiced by, among others, Peter Sellers, Kenneth Williams, Cilla Black, Arthur Lowe, Bob Monkhouse and Miriam Margolis) were brilliantly funny. Popular: Picture shows the chimps trainer Kenny Reid with 'Jacky' in 1986 . And they were fantastic for business. Within two years, PG Tips went from fourth in the market to Britain’s top-selling tea. For their part, the chimps — all young and bouncy and brilliantly malleable and adaptable — had an absolute ball. They are natural show-offs and adored the attention. They are also fantastic mimics, highly intelligent and with 98.5 per cent of their DNA identical to humans, very easy to teach. Each action — pouring tea, ironing, man-handling a piano — was broken down into a series of parts and demonstrated over and over until they couldn’t resist mimicking. Everywhere they went they caused a stir. They hosted tea parties watched by enormous awestruck crowds, appeared on Blue Peter and Tiswas and even took part in a race from London’s Post Office Tower to the Empire State Building in New York, staying in five-star hotels where they enjoyed room service. Instead of the recommended chimpanzee diet of leaves, fruit and the occasional low-flying bird, they were fed sugary tea, jam sandwiches for breakfast and snacked on buns, ice cream and boiled eggs. Handler: One of the PG Tips monkeys with handler Molly Badham . Meanwhile, they lounged around on heated beds for up to seven hours a day watching Westerns and the wrestling on their own wide-screen television. Some could even work the remote control and use a human toilet. Molly and her partner, Natalie Evans, hand-reared dozens of baby chimps in a house in the grounds of the zoo. At one stage, several of the chimps lived with them, cuddled up on the sofa and even accompanied them the hairdresser. But as they approached maturity, . between six or eight years old, such domestic bliss came to a halt. They . were too big, too dangerous. According . to Choppers’s current keeper, adult chimps are five times stronger than . humans and can be killers if provoked — and are prone to aggressive . outbursts. The Brooke-Bond PG Tips chimps making their 100th TV commercial in Rome in 1986 . For Choppers, the celebrity life ended in the mid-Seventies. For other, younger, chimps coming up through the ranks, the high life continued up to the Eighties, until, uncomfortable at the demand for increasingly ornate outfits and wigs, Molly withdrew her apes from their PG Tips contract. Although the chimps’ time being treated as humans was at most five or six years, according to Dr Charlotte Macdonald, the zoo’s head of life sciences, the damage was done. ‘It’s not a good start in life to be treated like a human. It means they don’t learn ape behaviour and they’re not very good at being with other chimps,’ she says. Since then, poor Choppers has been . trapped between two worlds — half-chimp, half-human. It didn’t help . that, as long as Molly Badham stayed in charge at Twycross, certain . privileges remained — TV, sugary tea, jam sandwiches, chocolate bars, . toys to play with. Fame: A chimp films a PG Tips advert in 1989 which was part of a campaign which cost £5million . And although, in the wild, chimps live in groups, Choppers and her long-term companion Louis (aka Brooke Bond) were given private accommodation. There is no question that Molly (who died in 2007, aged 93) adored her chimps and meant well. She was a world authority on primates and the TV revenue transformed the zoo from a few sheds to a thriving breeding centre. ‘The chimps would do anything for her,’ says retired Mail photographer Mike Hollist, who spent a lot of time with Molly. ‘They loved dressing up and watching themselves on telly. You forgot they were chimps and thought  they were children. They enjoyed  it immensely. ‘There was no cruelty involved. She’d know immediately if they’d had enough and never pushed it. She really loved them.’ While life got back to normal at Twycross, PG Tips looked elsewhere for chimps — first  in Italy and then America, until the tea firm killed off The Tipps Family in 2002. Adverts: Choppers, a 42-year-old ape, became one of the stars of the PG Tipps tea adverts in the 1970s. She lived in a cage at the zoo with co-star Louis (pictured right in the advert) until he died at the age of 37 last July . Meanwhile, life rumbled on in Leicestershire for Choppers and Louis until, last year, the latter passed away, aged 37. Today, Choppers spends her time lounging about, foraging for food and playing a brain game with boxes of hidden food and a stick and occasionally even taking part in the all-important mutual grooming sessions with her new pals Benji, Noddy and Rosie. Meanwhile, Twycross is busy trying to erase links with PG Tips. There is no mention of PG Tips on the website, no merchandise in the shop, no photos on the wall, not even a commemorative plaque on Choppers’ enclosure. There, ever the performer, she’s still keen to put on a bit of show. I watch as this showbusiness veteran climbs atop the tree stump, scratches, sniffs, urinates, smacks her lips, jumps up and down a bit and grins. There’s not a flowery pinny in sight, and she happily looks much more chimp than human. A PG Tipps monkey at Twycross zoo.

"A WWF legend who once wrestled headliners like Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant is now a double amputee living in poverty in rural Mississippi. Now all James Harris, who rose to fame as Kamala the Ugandan Giant in the 1980s, has left from those days as a pro wrestler on the national stage are his memories. And with his continued optimism in the face of nightly dialysis, a tragic family story and mounting bills to pay, Harris hopes to put those memories down on paper in an autobiography called Kamala Speaks. Rise and fall: James Harris, aka Kamara the Ugandan Giant, once wrestled WWF headliners like Hulk Hogan, but has since lost his legs to diabetes and is living in rural Mississippi in poverty . Named ironically, since his cannibalistic character spoke only in grunts in the ring, the tome is the focus of a Kickstarter donation drive. After all, as Harris recently told Bleacher Report, 'Life is worth living.' But that doesn't mean there hasn't been heartache. The Mississippi native lost a parent at the tender age of 4 when his father was killed during a game of dice. To date, he's also lost his sister to murder, a son to AIDS and his mother. it appeared that Harris, who recalls sometimes having nothing to eat but discarded bones from the butcher as a child, was going to skirt what looks a lot like a family curse when he was discovered by the WWF in 1982. Kamala was actually a 6-foot-7 Mississippi native, but he terrified audiences as an 'Idi Amin-inspired' African cannibal who often took on legends like Andre the Giant in the 1980s and the Undertaker in the 1990s. His character didn't speak and was accompanied by a keeper named Kim Chee (left) Harris saw great success in the pro wrestling world, but says he was paid only a tiny fraction of his banner name opponents . He quickly rose to fame as the silent, shirtless cannibal from afar--whose 6-foot-7 frame and girthy build struck fear in children and adults alike--accompanied by a man named Kim Chee. That man, whose real name is Kenny Casanova, is the mind behind his Kickstarter and book. Casanova believes Harris--who has a 9th grade education--lost out the soaring salaries of WWF headliners like Hogan and the Undertaker and is now paying the price. 'If I had been a better talker, if I'd have known how to negotiate, that probably would've helped me,' Harris told Bleacher Report. Today, Harris lives on a meager government check following the loss of both his legs to years of diabetes. And his wife has recently been laid off from her job of nearly 30 years. 'I figured Kamala's story alone in book form could be one answer to lost earnings,' Casanova writes on the Kickstarter page. If written correctly, it could mean great supplemental income for Kamala for years to come. So, I picked up the phone and made the call.' Kamala speaks: In order to right what he sees as a wrong, Kim Chee AKA Kenny Casanova, decided to try to help Harris earn a few bucks by telling his unbelievable life story in a biography . Old friends: 'Many HUGE wrestling names came together to provide quotes, stories and additional content for this project, to help create an autobiography like you have never read before,' Casanove writes in his Kickstarter page for the biography project . Today, the book is done and--like Harris himself--tries to focus on the positive. The biography of Harris focuses on, according to Casanova's Kickstarter page: . And, as Harris says: . 'Don't feel sorry for me, If you want to, encourage me. Embrace me. I'm going to be all right—just like I've always been.'","6-foot-7 Mississippi native James Harris once wrestled headliners like Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant as Idi Amin-inspired African cannibal Kamala .

"Raven-Symoné has blasted rumours that she was sexually assaulted by co-star Bill Cosby during their years on The Cosby Show. 'I was NOT taking advantage of by Mr. Cosby when I was on the Cosby Show! [sic]' the 28-year-old wrote on Instagram on Wednesday. 'I was practically a baby on that show and this is truly a disgusting rumor that I want no part of!,' she added. 'Everyone on that show treated me with nothing but kindness. Now keep me out of this!' Scroll down for video . 'Keep me out of this!' Raven-Symoné (pictured earlier this month) has blasted rumours that she was sexually assaulted by co-star Bill Cosby (pictured on Monday) during their years on The Cosby Show . Symone was referencing a report posted earlier this week on fake news site Hip-Hop Hangover, claiming the actress had filed molestation charges against Cosby when they acted together on the hit sitcom. The website, which calls itself 'a gossip parody and satirical publication', alleged the assault took place after the series finale in 1992, when she was around six years old. Symone starred as Cosby's step-granddaughter Olivia from 1989 till 1992 (the show started airing in 1984). Former co-stars: Symone starred as Cosby's step-granddaughter Olivia from 1989 till 1992 . Symone is the first star from the show to be brought into the current sexual abuse scandal surrounding the beloved star. Lachele Covington, who played a waitress on the CBS sitcom, filed a police report in 2000 alleging that Cosby  'put her hand under his T-shirt and guided it south toward his sweatpants.' However, the actor reportedly was never questioned or charged. So young: Symone said she was 'practically a baby' when she was on the show . Five women recently have come forward and accused Cosby of sexual assault. Supermodel Janice Dickinson is the latest to go public, alleging he drugged and raped her. Dickinson gave a TV interview on Tuesday in which she alleged Cosby invited her to dinner to discuss a role on The Cosby Show, offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps. Serious allegations: Supermodel Janice Dickinson is the latest to go public, claiming he drugged and raped her, pictured on Wednesday in LA . That is one of the last things she remembers of the evening. 'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' she told Entertainment Tonight. 'I remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs.' Coming out: Dickinson gave a TV interview on Tuesday in which she alleged Cosby invited her to dinner to discuss a role on The Cosby Show . Bad guy: Dickinson says after Cosby allegedly gave her the pill, the next thing she remembers is 'waking up with her pajamas off and semen between her legs' Dickinson says her last memory of the night was of Cosby taking off his robe and climbing on top of her, and that the next morning she remembers 'a lot of pain.' The supermodel claims the incident occurred in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. However, Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, branded the allegation a 'complete lie.' She also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel, but that Cosby and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details. But Singer also flatly rejected this claim, saying: 'You can confirm with Harper Collins that she never claimed that Mr Cosby raped her, that no attorney representing Bill Cosby tried to kill the story... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about Bill Cosby in her book.' In a statement, reported by NBC News, he added: 'There is documentary proof that Janice Dickinson is fabricating and lying about Bill Cosby.' Dickinson did, however, detail some of her evening in Lake Tahoe with Cosby in the book, though telling a very different story. She said she was drinking with Cosby at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired, at which point he slammed his door in her face. The aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story. She says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do.' As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words. 'How dare you,' she says. 'Go f*ck yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.' Bombshell: At the time of the alleged rape, Dickinson (pictured in the 1980s) was one of the biggest models in the world . This comes as a third women, Joan Tarshis, came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by Cosby in Los Angeles back in 1969. She called him a 'very, very sick man who needs help.' Another of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, told MailOnline she was just 17 when he 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.' Cosby, who refuses to comment on the allegations, did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior. His lawyer John P. Schmitt has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.'","Symone is the first star from The Cosby Show to be brought into the sexual abuse scandal .

"Actress Blake Lively seems to have stopped getting her hair dyed during her pregnancy, and her brown roots are starting to show amid the blonde. The 27-year-old star recently attended Martha Stewart's American Made Summit in New York - and she still looked radiant despite the three to four inches of new hair growth. Colorist Dana Ionato, who works at Sally Hershberger Downtown in Manhattan, told Yahoo Beauty that Ms Lively is probably being 'super cautious about any chemicals going into her body' until her baby with actor Ryan Reynolds is born next year.

Though Ms Ionato says there isn't substantial evidence that hair dye can affect a pregnancy (a claim backed by the Mayo Clinic), she said it is still ultimately up to clients to judge what is best for them. 'I mean, it's only nine months, and it your child, so I always respect the wishes of the client,' she said. 'I guarantee Blake hates her roots, but most women put the baby first.'

Stars like Kourtney Kardashian, Drew Barrymore and Snooki have famously come under scrutiny for coloring their hair while pregnant. 'I did research about doing anything to the color of my hair while pregnant and followed all of the guidelines from my doctor and took the proper precautions necessary,' Ms Kardashian wrote on her blog in 2012 before the birth of her daughter Penelope Scotland Disick. Many women who do opt to dye their locks while expecting still exercise caution. Various parenting websites recommend using ammonia-free dyes; waiting until after the first trimester; avoiding procedures that directly touch the scalp; wearing a mask and rinsing the hair thoroughly afterward.

'Nick was jealous because Sofia and Chris are close and she is investing in some of his clubs in Miami. 'And to be honest, for Sofia, Chris has always been the one that got away.' It was at Paciello's club on New Year's Eve 2012 that Sofia and Loeb got into a fight which ended with the star's dress being ripped and Loeb being thrown out by security. Paciello, now 42, previously had connections with New Springville Boys in his youth, a gang with affiliations to the Bonanno crime family. Moving from New York to Miami, Paciello - born Christian Ludwigsen - hung . out with Madonna, Jennifer Lopez and everyone who was anyone in 1990's South Beach, where he ran the club Liquid with Madonna's pal Ingrid Casares . and dated Sofia. 'She was insane about him then,' says the source,' She would have married him then if she could have.' But in December 1999, Paciello was arrested for for . his involvement in planning a gang robbery which saw Judith Shemtov . fatally shot in the head in 1993. He was charged for the mob-related murder and robbery, in which he was driver. In 2000, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to ten years in prison. He served just seven years of his 10-year . sentence after ratting out dozens of top Mafia figures, including . members of the Bonanno family which ultimately led to the takedown of . family boss Joseph 'Big Joe' Massino. He and Sofia ended their romance then although the source says they remained friends and she remained in contact with him after he went to jail. Once he was out, he went back to Miami and opened Bianca restaurant, in the Delano Hotel in South Beach, saying: 'I regret the mistakes I made in the . past. I am working hard to make a positive impact and to build a new . life for myself in Miami. I am grateful to the many people here who have . welcomed me back with open arms, and look forward to a positive . future.' And in December 2012, he opened Story nightclub in South Beach.

Sources say Loeb is still jealous of Paciello - despite the fact he and Sofia are just friends . The calm before the storm: Modern Family beauty Sofia Vergara pulls a funny face as she joins former lover, Miami nightclub owner Chris Paciello, at Story on December 31, 2012. The night ended with her ex-fiance Nick Loeb being thrown out of the hotspot following a scuffle . 'On some level she . will always care about him and that drove Nick crazy. Every time they . went to Miami, they saw Chris and even though Sofia said there wasn't . anything like that between them any more, I think Nick was jealous of . Chris' hold over Sofia.' That . boiled over on New Year's Eve, shortly after Story opened. Sofia and . Loeb were at the club with friends to help Chris get publicity for the . club. Paciello . and Loeb argued and eventually Loeb got into a fight with someone else . and was kicked out, while Sofia got caught in the middle of the brawl . and her dress was torn.

Chris help plan the wedding to Nick, before they broke it off.  She is . this huge star and Chris should just be part of her past now, but he . isn't.' Scuffle: Nick Loeb shows off the marks of a row following a dispute that saw him thrown out of Miami's Story nightclub on New Year's Eve 2012 - the day after the fight . In August last year, Page Six reported that Paciello had been bought out of his stake in Story, receiving a $600,000 payout as part of his severance, sources said. He has gone on to work on new projects. Announcing the end of her two-year engagement to Loeb, Sofia blamed the relationship's . collapse on their inability to balance their professional and personal . lives together.

Public displays of annoyance: The 41-year-old and her businessman beau are known for their public fights and had a huge row in the airport after touching down in Miami, Florida in January . Sofia is currently the highest paid actor on television raking in $175,000 an episode but her numerous endorsement deals helped her earn an astounding $30 million last year.

Nick, while known by most only because of his high profile relationship, comes from a well known investment family and runs a condiments company with a new worth reportedly over $15 million. Sources have said it was his desperate bid to win publicity for his 'Onion Crunch' condiment - even trying to foist it at the White House - that embarrassed Sofia.

Accompanied by a male friend at the Hamptons . magazine bash at Southampton Social Club, he said: 'I don’t dance, so . there is no point going to clubs. I don’t need to see hot . girls, I’ve got my friend here. If I want to see hot girls, I’ll go on . the Internet, adding: 'I’m not 25.' Sofia - who has a 21-year-old son, Manolo . from her first marriage to Joe Gonzalez - aid ion the View last month she was trying to make the time to get married. The star said she has had such a long engagement 'because I don't have time. 'And I am Latin. I have to do a big wedding if I'm going to get married.

"Town Hall chiefs have banned staff from using the term ‘the elderly’ and suggested ‘older people’ as an alternative. According to Respect, a 31-page booklet handed out to 5,000 employees at Denbighshire County Council in North Wales, the word elderly is an ‘unacceptable’ phrase. Similarly, an office is not manned but staffed, dinner ladies should be referred to as catering staff, workmen are workers, headmaster is head teacher, chairman is chairperson and a child or youngster is a younger person. Politically incorrect: 'Older people' have replaced the elderly in Denbighshire, North Wales (right) The booklet, produced in Welsh and English, told staff: ‘We should not make assumptions based on someone's age. 'Being older in the UK carries views of being worn out and of little use, it is also used as a term of abuse. 'Youth can be seen as representing inexperience and unreliability.' It added: 'The terms . love, dear, pet may be considered offensive by some people, . particularly women and should not be used. 'We should always consider whether it is . necessary or appropriate to use labels to describe people and we must be . careful not to patronise people by undermining their individuality.

"Madison Bumgarner proved his big-game brilliance with a four-hit shut-out of the Kansas City Royals on Sunday that put him into the Fall Classic record books and the Giants within a win of the title. The young lefty lifted the Giants to a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven with a 5-0 win that moved an AT&T Park crowd to chant 'M-V-P, M-V-P' in a farewell to Bumgarner as Major League Baseball's championship shifts to Kansas City for its climax. Bumgarner, 25, struck out eight without a walk, lowered his career World Series earned run average to a record 0.29, and improved his Fall Classic record to 4-0. An outstanding performance from San Francisco Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner took his team to within one win of the World Series as the Kansas City Royals were beaten 5-0 at AT&T Park . Bumgarner's shut-out in Game Five puts the Giants 3-2 ahead of the decisive pair of matches in Kansas City . Bungarner (right) and Buster Posey shake hands after the vital win that puts the Giants on the verge of glory . 'I felt great,' said Bumgarner, who dominated the Royals 7-1 in San Francisco's opening game victory in Kansas City. 'I'm just happy we won. That was a big game for us being tied up 2-2.' Patience from Giants manager Bruce Bochy paid off after he stuck to his rotation and did not bring Bumgarner back a day early to start Friday's Game Four, which San Francisco won 11-4. One day before that, a report surfaced that Bumgarner had demanded to start Game Four on short rest rather than wait for Game Five, something the pitcher denied. 'I'm good with whatever (Bochy) wants to do this time of year. You have to be ready to go whenever you're called on,' Bumgarner told reporters. 'He's the boss, he makes the decisions,' added the pitcher, who made it clear he would be available to contribute if the team needed him in a potential Game Seven.

Pence beats the Royals' Salvador Perez to score on an RBI double in the eighth . Adhering to the rotation worked wonders on Sunday and San Francisco's second straight victory has them on the brink of claiming their third World Series championship in five years. It was all made possible by the red-hot Bumgarner, who became the first pitcher to toss a complete-game shutout in the World Series since Josh Beckett in 2003. 'When this guy is on, it's fun to watch,' Bochy said. 'He had great stuff.' The Giants scored their first run in the second inning when Hunter Pence crossed home on a groundout from shortstop Brandon Crawford, who had three RBIs in the game. The home team scored another run in the fourth when a single by Crawford plated Pablo Sandoval. That was more than enough for the masterful Bumgarner, but the Giants piled on three runs in the eighth with defensive outfield replacement Juan Perez belting a two-run double high of the center field fence to send the crowd into a frenzy. San Francisco enjoyed an offensive explosion in Game Four with 11 runs on 16 hits, but they managed on far less with their standout on the mound. The Giants' Brandon Crawford hits an RBI single during the fourth innings . The Royals' Salvador Perez is out at the first on the sliding tag of the Giants' Brandon Belt . A sell-out crowd enjoyed Game Five of the World Series at AT&T Park as San Francisco took control . 'You look at (Bumgarner) and he looks like he's pitching in the middle of June,' Crawford said. 'He takes the pressure off everyone.' Sandoval and Pence, stalwarts in the middle of the Giants lineup, each had two hits and two runs scored in the victory. Kansas City starter James Shields had a solid outing, yielding two runs on eight hits over six innings but was no match for Bumgarner. The Royals entered the World Series as an amazing Cinderella story, having gone undefeated through the playoffs to reach the title series. Kansas City is looking for a first World Series since 1985 and have run into a huge challenge in trying to get over the line. Typically known for their stellar defense, the Royals were let down in the field when shortstop Alcides Escobar failed on a pair of tricky plays that led to runs in the second and fourth innings. 'They were difficult plays. (But) If he catches those balls it's probably 0-0 going into the eighth,' Royals manager Ned Yost said. 'We have to walk a tightrope now without a net. If we fall off we're dead.'","Giants beat the Royals 5-0 to lead the World Series 3-2 .

"Madison Bumgarner pitched five innings of near-perfect relief as the San Francisco Giants succeeded where no team had in 3-and-a-half decades, winning Game 7 on the road to claim their third World Series title in five years. Punctuating one of the finest October performances in baseball history, Bumgarner came out of the bullpen to pitch five scoreless innings on two days' rest for his third win of the Series, helping the Giants hold off the Kansas City Royals 3-2 Wednesday night in a championship pushed to the limit. 'I wasn't thinking about innings or pitch count. I was just thinking about getting outs, getting outs, until I couldn't get them anymore and we needed someone else,' Bumgarner said in a monotone that made it sound as though he was talking about batting practice.

Bumgarner celebrates with team-mate Buster Posey following victory over the Kansas City Royals . San Francisco Giants left fielder Michael Morse (left) and starting pitcher Tim Hudson hold up the World Series trophy after their win . A two-out misplay in the ninth almost wrecked it for Bumgarner and the Giants. He had retired 14 in a row when Alex Gordon's single fell in front of center fielder Gregor Blanco, who let the ball get past him for an error that allowed Gordon to reach third. Left fielder Juan Perez ran back to the wall and retrieved the ball in time to hold Gordon at third. 'When it got by him, I had a smile on my face. I thought maybe I could score, but he got to it quickly enough,' Gordon said. 'I just put my head down and ran, almost fell around second base, was just waiting for Jirsch (third base coach Mike Jirschele) to give me the signal. It was a good hold, he had the ball in plenty of time.' Bumgarner retired Salvador Perez on a foul out to third baseman Pedro Sandoval. The big left-hander was immediately embraced by catcher Buster Posey, and the rest of the Giants rushed to the mound to join the victory party. Most of the San Francisco players tossed their gloves high in the air as they ran to the center of the diamond. Three days after throwing 117 pitches in a four-hit shutout to win Game 5, Bumgarner threw 68 more and dropped his record-low career Series ERA to a barely visible 0.25. Bumgarner initially was credited with the win. But nearly an hour after the final out, the official scorers decided it was Jeremy Affeldt, who was in the game when San Francisco took the lead. Bumgarner got a save instead. Bumgarner is congratulated by San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy as the team celebrate the victory . The San Francisco giants celebrate wildly as the victory was sealed in Game 7 of baseball's World Series . The huge crowd watches on as San Francisco succeeded where no team has in three-and-a-half decades . Regardless, he etched his place in postseason lore among the likes of Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Reggie Jackson, Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling - players who delivered indelible October performances to lead their team to titles. Posey expected Bumgarner to throw three innings, then turn over the game to setup man Sergio Romo and closer Santiago Casilla - who threw four pitches in the entire Series. 'But he just kept rolling,' Posey said. 'I mean, it's unbelievable.' Michael Morse hit a go-ahead single in the fourth that stood up, and the Giants eked out a battle of the bullpens on a night when both starting pitchers made unusually quick exits. The Giants were dubbed a 'Band of Misfits' in 2010 when they beat Texas to win the franchise's first title since 1954 in New York. Two years later, they swept Detroit for another championship. And this time, they became the second NL team with three titles in a five-year span, matching Stan Musial's St. Louis Cardinals of 1942-46. Every other year. It's the closest thing to a dynasty baseball has seen in the 21st century. Kansas City Royals second baseman Omar Infante throws too late to first base to get San Francisco Giants batter Pablo Sandoval . Salvador Perez of Kansas City reacts after being hit by a pitch during the second inning . Home teams had won nine straight Game 7s in the Series since Pittsburgh's victory at Baltimore in 1979, including the Royals' 11-0 rout of St. Louis in 1985. Teams hosting the first two games had won 23 of the last 28 titles, including five in a row. And the Giants had lost all four of their previous World Series pushed to the limit. But before a pumped-up crowd of 40,535 that hoped noise and passion could lift the small-market Royals to a title that seemed improbable when Kansas City was languishing two games under .500 in mid-July, the Giants won the second all-wild card World Series, 12 years after losing Game 7 to the Angels in the first. Both managers promised quick hooks if their starters showed the slightest signs of faltering, and both managers delivered as Tim Hudson and Jeremy Guthrie combined for 15 outs - matching the fewest by Game 7 starters. Hudson, at 39 the oldest Game 7 starter, allowed two runs in 1 2-3 innings. The 35-year-old Guthrie took the loss, giving up three runs in 3 1-3 innings . Jeremy Affeldt followed Hudson with 2 1-3 innings of scoreless relief in his longest outing since July 2012, getting help from the first successful replay challenge in World Series history.

San Francisco police officers work to break up the large crowds who were celebrating after the Giants' victory . There were several reports of fires being started in the city as fans celebrated . He gave up an opposite-field single to his first batter, Omar Infante, who advanced on a sacrifice. Bumgarner retired Nori Aoki on a liner near the left-field line that was grabbed by Perez, starting over Travis Ishikawa because of his defense. Bumgarner then struck out Lorenzo Cain. He retired the side in order in the sixth, seven and eighth, increasing his pitch count to 52. With loud chants of 'Let's Go Royals!' echoing through Kauffman Stadium, he struck out Eric Hosmer to open the ninth, then retired Billy Butler on a foulout to bring up Gordon. The 25-year-old Bumgarner allowed two hits, struck out four and walked none. He pitched 52 2-3 postseason innings, 4 1-3 more than the previous mark set by Arizona's Curt Schilling in 2001, and finished with 270 innings combined, including the regular season. Voted the Series MVP, MadBum became king of SoMa, and from Nob Hill to North Beach, from The Marina to The Mission, San Francisco celebrated another title won by Kung Fu Panda and Hunter Pence. Pence batted .444 in the Series and Sandoval, a free-agent-to-be playing perhaps his last game for the Giants, finished at .429 following a three-hit night. In an era when pitching and computer-aided defense has supplanted steroids-saturated sluggers, baseball's dominant team established itself in the tech-fueled, boomtown by the Bay. The Giants, a 20-1 longshot when 2014 odds were first posted a year ago, won their eighth title and third since moving from New York to San Francisco after the 1957 season. They also have won 10 straight postseason rounds, one shy of the record set by the New York Yankees from 1998-01. Bruce Bochy became the 10th manager to win three World Series titles - the other nine are all in the Hall of Fame.","San Francisco Giants won Game 7 against Kansas City Royals to claim third World Series title in five years .

"Monica Lewinsky is writing a tell-all book about her affair with Bill Clinton after the scandal left her hard up, unable to get a job and with her dreams dashed, friends have claimed. The former White House intern, 39, is reportedly penning the book - including her intimate love letters to the ex-president and how he desired threesomes - for revenge on her former flame. But friends say it could simply be a matter of cash for Lewinsky, who was left with massive legal debts and could never achieve her dream of 'losing 30 lbs, finding a boy, moving to Westchester County and having a family' after revelations of her Oval Office trysts with Clinton surfaced. Speaking out: Monica Lewinsky is reportedly writing a $12 million tell-all book about her affair with Clinton . While Lewinsky has yet to sign a deal, it had previously been claimed that publishers were scrambling for the book and had offered her as much as $12 million. 'She may very well need the money,' a friend told MailOnline. 'That’s why she did the Andrew Morton [biography in 1998]. She had massive legal debts. It was a misconception that she came from a wealthy family. She's had trouble finding work. 'She went to the London School of Economics where it was easier for her blend in, because, in Europe, what prime minister hasn’t had an affair? But when she came back to the States, she couldn’t escape her past. 'Who is going to hire her and have her name come across in an email? It's unfair. She's a smart, capable, personable woman. How many 22-year-olds have made bad judgements? Admiration: A December 1996 White House photo shows Clinton and Lewinsky at a Christmas party . Affair: Lewinsky, pictured in November 1995, claimed she had nine sexual encounters with President Clinton in the Oval Office between November 1995 and March 1997 . 'I think, if she had her dream, she would have lost 30 pounds, found a boy, moved to Westchester County, and had a family.' Speaking to the National Enquirer, friends . said the book will include never-before-seen love letters that she . wrote to the president - some of which were so intimate she never sent . them. They reportedly detail her love for . Clinton and how Lewinsky, then just 22, could make him much happier than . his wife, Hillary, who the president called a 'cold fish'. The book will also reportedly detail how he laughed about his nonexistent sex life with Hillary - and said he thought he was not the only one looking for love outside their marriage. 'Monica can describe how Bill went on . and on about his insatiable desire for three-way sex, orgies and the use . of sex toys of all kinds,' the friend added to the Enquirer. Centre of a scandal: In October 1996, Clinton embraces Lewinsky, then a White House intern . Aftermath: In July 1998, Monica Lewinsky follows her lawyer Judy Smith through a media swarm . As . well as the heartbreak she suffered after her relationship with Clinton, Lewinsky . also plans to detail the pain of ending a pregnancy at the height of her . liaison with the president, the source said. She . was carrying a child fathered by a Pentagon employee called 'Thomas', . she revealed in an earlier biography written by Andrew Morton. 'That . void has never been filled,' said the friend. She is also writing it to get revenge on Clinton, now 66, friends said. 'For years, Monica tried to protect . Bill out of a misplaced sense of loyalty,' a source told the Enquirer. 'But she no . longer feels that way, and her memoir is his worst nightmare.' During her grand jury testimony . against Clinton in 1998, an immunity deal prevented her from exposing . intimate details about their affair in the Morton expose that came out that . year. Denial: With his wife standing by in January 1998, Clinton insists he did not have relations with 'that woman' Truth: But in August 1998, Clinton confessed on television that he did have sexual relations with her . Coming clean: People in California in August 1998 read papers the day after Clinton admitted to the affair . 'But that agreement expired in 2001, and . when Bill published his autobiography My Life three years later, . Monica felt betrayed by him all over again,' said the source.

Editors have also cast doubt over interest in the book, questioning whether a $12 million deal is really on the cards.

"A new 'planking' style craze is sweeping the internet during the big freeze - posing naked in the snow. The impromptu challenge was started by Wiltshire care worker Leanne Myers, 40, who posed in her underwear with neighbour Danielle Smith in a bid to amuse friends. But after posting the photo on Facebook the idea quickly snowballed and a page dedicated to naked snow pictures went viral. Mischievous: Leanne (left) and Danielle posed for skimpy pictures of themselves for a bit of fun. Now hundreds of people have been photographed naked in the snow . Chilling: This trio of ladies relax with a drink and wear beautiful bright colours outside in sub-zero temperatures . The group now has more than 5,500 likes and 250 photos showing people of all ages stripping down and covering their unmentionables in imaginative ways. Leanne, from the village of Durrington, has been amazed by the response and has had offers of photos from as far afield as Abu Dhabi. She said: 'It is totally amazing, I really had no idea it would take off like this. 'People have really embraced it, and a lot of the pictures are of friends of friends, but now there's some coming in from people I don't know.

The group - entitled 'Wiltshire, let's get naked in the snow!' - began on Friday after Leanne and her fellow careworkers battled to get to those they support in the overnight deluge of snow . After work, as a way to amuse her friends and family, she decided to pose in her underwear with next-door neighbour Danielle and then invited friends to do the same. 'I really did just think it would be a . bit of fun, to provide a bit of a giggle for maybe 50 of my friends and . neighbours in the village, but on Saturday it really took off,' she . added.

Ellie, now 12, was born six and a half weeks early and was immediately rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at Odstock Hospital, in Salisbury, Wiltshire, where she was diagnosed with a heart condition. At just two-years-old the tot underwent major heart surgery at the neighbouring John Radcliffe Hospital and has now made a full recovery. The mum-of-two said she could not express enough thanks to both hospitals and really wanted to use the opportunity she had been given to help out the Salisbury District Hospital Stars Appeal.

"The winter vomiting bug could be virtually wiped out by reintroducing brass taps and fittings, according to new research. A study has found norovirus cannot survive on the metal, offering hope of a cheap and effective way of reducing the 267 million cases of acute gastroenteritis it causes each year. The highly infectious bug costs the National Health Service at least £100 million annually, with up to 3,000 people admitted to hospital each year. The winter vomiting bug could be virtually wiped out by reintroducing brass taps and fittings, according to new research. The findings suggest the bug cannot survive on the metal . There is no treatment or vaccine, and outbreaks require expensive cleaning, with lost working days when staff are infected adding to the burden. Its impact is also felt beyond healthcare, with cruise ships and hotels suffering significant damage to their reputation when epidemics occur among guests. Dr Sarah Warnes, of the University of Southampton, said: ‘The use of antimicrobial surfaces containing copper in clinical and community environments, such as cruise ships and care facilities, could help to reduce the spread of this highly infectious and costly pathogen.’ The virus can be contracted from contaminated food or water, person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces, meaning those made from copper could effectively shut down one avenue of infection. A study designed to simulate fingertip touch of surfaces showed norovirus in room temperature was rapidly destroyed on copper and its alloys, with those containing more than 60 per cent proving particularly effective. The rate of destruction was initially very rapid and proportional to the copper content. No such effect was found on stainless steel. The virus can be contracted from contaminated food or water, person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces . Copper alloys have previously been shown to be effective antimicrobial surfaces against a range of bacteria and fungi. Dr Warnes said: ‘Copper alloys, although they provide a constant killing surface, should always be used in conjunction with regular and efficient cleaning and decontamination regimes using non-chelating reagents that could inhibit the copper ion activity.’ Professor Bill Keevil added: ‘Although the virus was identified over 40 years ago, the lack of methods to assess infectivity has hampered the study of the human pathogen. ‘The virus can remain infectious on solid surfaces and is also resistant to many cleaning solutions. ‘That means it can spread to people who touch these surfaces, causing further infections and maintaining the cycle of infection. ‘Copper surfaces, like door handles and taps, can disrupt the cycle and lower the risk of outbreaks. What we have found is the metal destroys the genetic material of the norovirus. ‘In the U.S., 100,000 people die each year from hospital acquired infections. In the UK, I believe the figure is about 5,000. If a healthy person gets norovirus they are sick for a couple of days, and then get over it. But for an elderly person, it can be fatal. The figures are frightening. ‘If you build a hospital, a care home or a liner from scratch using copper instead of stainless steel, the cost will be about the same. ‘Brass fittings were used in hospitals forty or fifty years ago, since when we have gone over to stainless steel. During this time hospital acquired infections have soared. Is that a coincidence?’ Earlier research has found copper fittings rapidly kill bugs on hospital wards, succeeding where other infection control measures fail. The highly infectious bug costs the National Health Service at least £100 million annually, with up to 3,000 people admitted to hospital each year . In a ten week study at Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham, copper taps, toilet seats and push plates on doors all but eliminated common bugs. It is believed the metal 'suffocates' germs, preventing them breathing. It may also stop them from feeding and destroy their DNA. Lab tests show that the metal kills off the deadly MRSA and C difficile superbugs. It also kills other dangerous germs, including the flu virus and the E coli food poisoning bug. Although it is usually thought to be an expensive metal, copper is actually a similar price to stainless steel.","Copper destroys the genetic material of norovirus and stops it breathing .

"Woolwich suspect Michael  Adebolajo came to the attention of MI5 after he appeared in court in Kenya on suspicion of planning to fight for a terrorist group. The Mail on Sunday has learned he was arrested with five others in November 2010. All were said to have been heading for neighbouring Somalia, where they had been recruited by Al-Shabaab, the Islamist insurgent organisation. Adebolajo, who was filmed after the Woolwich slaughter with blood on his hands, was deported without being charged. Scroll down for video . Michael Adebolajo in a Kenyan court in 2010 with five other men after he attempted to cross the border . It was soon after his return to Britain, a close friend claims, that MI5 earmarked him as a potential  informant and began assiduously courting him. The Mail on Sunday has been told: . An East London-based solicitor, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He came to see us last year. He raised serious concerns which are similar to ones we have heard before from others. He met a member of my team and discussed his case. ‘He complained that they [MI5] kept wanting to talk to him and his family. They kept coming round his family home and wanted to meet him regularly. We said if he wanted to deal with it properly, he should give us the number they [MI5] had given him and we would call them. ‘He was very paranoid about the whole thing. But he didn’t come back so we didn’t do anything else with him.’ Raid: police moving in on Rikki Thomas's Greenwich house last week . It is understood that soon afterwards the contact with intelligence officers suddenly ceased. Adebolajo’s links to the security services were first revealed on Friday on Twitter by one of his closest friends, Abu Nusaybah. Hours later, Nusaybah was arrested under the Terrorism Act just as he was finishing a pre-recorded interview for BBC Newsnight. Earlier that day, Nusaybah, whose real name is Ibrahim Hassan, gave an interview to a Mail on Sunday reporter in which he made further claims about MI5 and Adebolajo. ‘They wanted him to spy on a group of Muslims who have links to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula [AQAP]. They wanted information about them.’ AQAP, based in Yemen, has been called ‘the most active operational franchise’ of Al Qaeda beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan. ‘They offered him [Adebolajo] money and they gave him a special mobile phone to use when calling them,’ said Hassan. ‘They even took him in for interviews, just to intimidate him to work for them. But he refused.’ By the time Adebolajo arrived in Kenya in 2010, he was already deeply immersed in radical Islam and espousing extremist views. Along with five Kenyan youths, he was picked up by local police on November 23 after spending the night in a guesthouse on Faza Island, part of the Lamu archipelago in the Indian Ocean close to the Somali border. Principal magistrate Richard Kirui was told that all six men had been recruited to Al-Shabaab and intended to fight with them to bring down the country’s transitional government. Al-Shabaab has imposed a strict version of Sharia law in the areas it controls, including stoning to death women accused of adultery. Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, . brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the . killing. It was claimed last night that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six . months ago . Adebolajo, right, is pictured at an English Defence League march in 2009 . Cold-blooded: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, with a knife in his hand after he had hacked Lee Rigby to death . In court, the youths claimed they had been given nothing to eat for two days and had been denied access to lawyers. They had spent a night in police custody in Mombasa and were questioned by counter terrorism officers before being taken to court the next day. Adebolajo was fingerprinted and photographed and made a full statement. After the order was made to deport Adebolajo, police officers accompanied him, handcuffed, in an unmarked police vehicle to Nairobi airport. During the day-long drive, the vehicle was involved in a minor accident, and although no-one was injured the journey was delayed.That evening Adebolajo was put on the first available flight to London. Fallen hero: father Lee Rigby was killed in the attack on Woolwich last week . A great character: Father of one and soldier Rigby, of Greater Manchester, pictured relaxing on Army leave . At this time he was living on a council estate in Greenwich, South East London, with girlfriend Rikki Thomas and her two children from a previous relationship. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Thomas – arrested last week in a police raid on her Greenwich house and later released without charge – gave birth to the terror suspect’s son last year. Neighbours yesterday recalled how 29-year-old Thomas wore mini-skirts and was a ‘bright lovely woman’ before meeting him six years ago and turning into someone who hardly left the house. Odette Hamilton said: ‘Rikki began to dress more and more like a Muslim.

"A video warning Poles of the dangers of coming to Britain has been issued with the backing of the Government. Migrants who are unprepared could be ripped off, made homeless and even set on fire by thugs, it says. The three-minute film funded by Whitehall warns of the consequences of illegal working, sleeping rough and street violence. Warning: The stark video advises people in Poland that without a job and home in Britain they risk being attacked by thugs . Homeless: It tells the story of Jacek who ends up sleeping rough after losing his cash in hand job . Fire: In the most dramatic moment flames appear to engulf him in his sleeping bag . It advises Poles to ‘be well prepared’ if they are coming to Britain – with a guaranteed job and back-up money. But it also shows dramatic and . alarming images of a Polish immigrant, played by  an actor, who loses . his job and is then beaten up and burned while he is sleeping on the . street. The advice – not to assume the streets . of London or other British cities are paved with gold – comes at a time . of increasing concern about the plight of unemployed eastern European . migrants. Official counts say that around four . in ten of the rough sleepers in London come from eastern Europe and more . than a fifth are Poles. Romanian migrants are also living in desperate . poverty in Britain. Westminster Council is anxious to stop begging by . organised Romanian groups in the  capital and this week there have been . concerns over the appearance of an eastern European shantytown in . Hendon, North London. Whitehall has already backed efforts . to warn Romanians and Bulgarians over the potential difficulties of life . in Britain to try to prevent the arrival of unprepared migrants when . the labour market is opened to citizens of the two countries at the end . of the year. Immigrant: The video talks about how Jacek moved to England in search of work and a better life, but was not well-prepared . Streets: Up to one in 10 rough sleepers in London are Polish, according to latest figures . The Department for Communities and . Local Government and the Foreign Office have both backed the . three-minute Polish language video, as has the Polish embassy in London. Narrated by an actor playing a successful Polish immigrant, it tells . Poles that his success was achieved only by hard work and that many . pitfalls await those who move to Britain.

Advice: Another character in the three-minute film, Andzrej, boasts of being well prepared when he moved to Britain . London: The video is entitled Before You Go - Zanim wyjedziesz in Polish . Mick Clarke, of charity The Passage, . which made the film, said: ‘In recent years we have seen firsthand the . devastating impact of people failing to prepare before they travel to . the UK … Before You Go enables us to get a clear prevention message out . there before people travel, to help ensure that for those who do come to . the UK their move is a success.’ Housing Minister Mark Prisk said: . ‘Sadly too many rough sleepers are foreign nationals who arrived in the . UK without realistic prospects and as a result ended up with a life on . the streets.’ He said the film aimed to ensure migrants ‘understand the risks’.","Three-minute Polish-language film warns of dangers of moving to UK .

"The NFL is expected to adopt penalties for using the N-word on the field that will be enacted starting this upcoming season. A proposal currently circulating through the league’s competition committee seeks to impose a 15-yard penalty against the team of a player using the racial slur, with a second utterance resulting in ejection. John Wooten, head of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which monitors diversity in the NFL, first disclosed the initiative to CBS Sports. Something must be done: Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito (68) and tackle Jonathan Martin (71) stand on the field during training camp prior to last season - one in which Martin left the team amid claims he was bullied . He said the league is seeking to completely remove the word from league workplaces and make it a fineable offense – from the front office all the way down to the field. ‘I will be totally shocked if the competition committee does not uphold us on what we're trying to do,’ Wooten said Saturday to a standing ovation during the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. ‘We want this word to be policed from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room,’ he continued. ‘Secretaries, PR people, whoever, we want it eliminated completely and want it policed everywhere.’ The NFL declined to comment, but told the site workplace ‘respect’ is a key aspect of changes the league is seeking to make in the fallout from the Miami Dolphins bullying and Riley Cooper scandals. Wooten said that next month’s competition committee meeting is the first step to making the penalty the law of the land. ‘I think they're going to do what needs to be done here, there is too much disrespect in the game,’ he added. Fired: Dolphins offensive line coach Jim Turner (pictured during a practice last season) was fired after being found to have also taken part in the bullying - also gone are Martin, Incognito and others . Baltimore Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome, himself African-American and a member of the competition committee, also spoke about the proposal Saturday during the combine. ‘With any rule that we put into play, we have to look at it from A to Z and find out what are the unintended consequences as much as the consequences,’ he said, according to NFL.com. ‘But as it was stated in our meeting, there are mics everywhere,’ Newsome added. ‘If something is being said, it's probably going to be captured somewhere. So, it would be an opportunity to get it verified if we had to.’ Newsome, one of only seven black GM's in a predominantly African American league with 32 teams, also expressed a desire to see the rule further discussed. Former New York Giants great Harry Carson, now the executive director of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, told the New York Daily News that use of the word already results in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, but that more needs to be done. ‘It needs to be put a halt to in the locker room, on the field, whether it’s staff, whether it’s a player, there is no room for it,’ said the Hall of Famer. Infamous: Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught using the word at a concert, he received no fine or penalty for his actions, he also did not miss a single game . Fans who spoke to the paper had mixed reactions. ‘I am sure that word gets thrown around all the time every game so how would you even enforce that?’ Giants fan Brian Ellis wondered aloud, adding ‘I don’t think it should be banned.’ A friend of Ellis’ said ‘the whole idea is stupid.’ A Philadelphia Eagles fan told the paper he is in favor of policing the word’s use. ‘There are a lot of ways to trash talk without saying certain words to people… the players will learn to comply with the rules.’ Cooper, who plays for the Eagles, was infamously caught on video repeatedly shouting the slur at an African-American security guard while attending a concert at the team’s stadium prior to last season. Twitter reactions ranged from surprise to calls of hypocrisy as many compared it unfavorably to the ongoing Washington Redskins name saga. ‘Saying the n-word on the field is a 15 yard penalty. Wearing a racial slur on the front of your jersey; totes cool,’ a fan wrote. Hypocritical?: Many fans wondered on social media how a racial slur - Redskins is a derogatory term for Native Americans - can be used as a team name but not spoken on the field . ‘Please tell me the NFL isn't seriously considering a penalty if a player says the N word. Games would take 6 hours,’ said another. ‘Latest NFL recap: N-word, 15-yard penalty; R-word, marketed; caught dragging unconscious fiancé out of elevator, employed. Got it,’ tweeted one more. Others said teams would run out of players and be forced to look into the stands for players to finish out the second half of games. The rule must be backed by the competition committee to go to the owners for a final vote, which would take place prior to the upcoming season.","The proposal still has yet to be voted on by team owners, it would go into effect next season if approved .
It is one of several ideas being considered to reduce bullying in the league .

"New Zealanders are more likely to move home than residents of any other country, according to a new poll. The survey on 'internal migration' - moving to a new city within the same country - reveals that North America and Scandinavia are also particularly mobile regions. Overall, 381million adults have moved from one city to another within the past five years - eight per cent of the world's population. Domestic migrants: New Zealand, the U.S. and Scandinavia all have many residents moving cities . New Zealand leads the way in the Gallup poll, . with 26 per cent of its population on the move, followed by the U.S. on . 24 per cent, Finland on 23 per cent and Norway on 22 per cent. Other countries which have seen high . levels of internal migration include war-torn and poverty-stricken . nations such as Syria and Malawi, where more than a fifth of the . population has moved cities. On the whole, however, people in . richer countries seem to be more likely to move home than residents of . the developing world - in China and Venezuela, for example, fewer than . five per cent of people have moved. Countries in the European Union are hovering around the global average, with nine per cent of their population on the move. Numbers: This table shows that well-educated young people are the most likely to migrate internally . 'Migration is often associated with . the search for better educational opportunities, and across most . regions, adults with higher education are more likely to be internal . migrants,' Gallup explains. 'Worldwide, . those with at least a college education are more than twice as likely . (13 per cent) to say they moved internally in the past five years as . those with primary education or less (five per cent).' They argue there is no evidence of an education effect in regions such as the former USSR, where six per cent of people were internal migrants. Among age groups, younger adults made up the greatest number of internal migrants. Worldwide, 10 per cent of adults between 15 and 29 years of age reported moving within their country. After the age of 50 that number was only five per cent. The study surveyed 236,865 adults in 139 countries representing than 97 per cent of the world's adult population, 'enabling a reliable global estimate,' according to Gallup.","26 per cent of New Zealanders moved from one city to another over 5 years .

"There was fury across Greece today after it was announced that a journalist who published the names of more than 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts is to stand trial again. Costas Vaxevanis has been told that his acquital earlier this month for breaking data privacy laws after publishing the so-called ‘Lagarde List’ was 'faulty.' The Athens Public Prosecutor’s office said that Mr Vaxevanis must now be tried again by a higher court on the same charges. Retrial: Costas Vaxvanis (centre) was acquitted of breaching privacy laws earlier this month after publishing the names of 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. He has now been told the acquittal was 'faulty' List: Mr Vaxevanis (left) said an anonymous source gave him a copy of the so-called 'Lagarde List' because ministers had done nothing with it . If found guilty, Vaxevanis could be jailed for up to two years or face a fine. ‘The prosecutor believes that the decision in favour of the journalist is legally wrong,’ a court official said. The speedy arrest, trial and acquittal of Mr Vaxevanis for publishing the so-called 'Lagarde List' had aroused international concern and captivated recession-weary Greeks angry at the privileges of the elite. Names: The list has been dubbed the 'Lagarde List' after Christine Lagarde (above), head of the IMF, who was the French finance minister when it was passed to Greek authorities . Given to Greece by French authorities in 2010, the list contains the names of 2,059 Greek account holders at HSBC in Switzerland to be probed for possible tax evasion. The list was named after Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund who was the French finance minister when the list was handed over. The list and the saga of how it was passed from one senior official to the next and misplaced at one point without anyone apparently taking action, has riveted Greeks. In his defence, Mr Vaxevanis accused politicians of hiding the truth and protecting an 'untouchable' elite. He said the trial was politically motivated, calling it 'targetted and vengeful.' Greece has so far failed to convict any big names for tax evasion, fuelling popular disenchantment with a political class that promised to force the wealthy to share some of the pain of the debt crisis. Mr Vaxevanis has said an anonymous source gave him a copy of the Lagarde List because ministers had done nothing with it. Mr . Vaxevanis’s supporters included the Greek daily newspaper Ta Nea, which . also published the list over 11 news pages. It made clear there was no . evidence that any of those named had broken tax evasion laws. Published: Mr Vaxevanis has accused politicians of hiding the truth and protecting an 'untouchable' elite .

"Australian parents are failing to say no to their children and are 'doing a crap job' by not setting boundaries, an Australian psychologist warns. Dr Michael Carr-Gregg believes today's parents are raising a generation of spoilt brats and there may be serious long-term consequences. While parents 'may be offended by the term ""crap"", the truth is they are crappy,' Dr Carr-Gregg said. Scroll down for video . Australian parents are failing to say no to their children and are 'doing a crap job' by not setting boundaries, an Australian psychologist warns . In his new book called Strictly Parenting, he assessed the rise of poorly-behaved children to five major parenting problems and included a chapter titled 'The Unfortunate Rise of Crap Parenting.' He told ABC that the first problem is that there are too many 'parents being doormats for their kids.' 'They have got what I call a vitamin N deficiency, which is a failure to say no,' he said. 'It's incredibly important that parents set limits and boundaries and I don't know that that's happening at the moment.' He said parents who constantly 'hover before swooping down if the child is facing challenges' was called the 'helicopter' in his book. 'The high-strung, control-freak parents that want to smother their kids with so much love and attention and monitoring and supervision that they never, ever develop any self-reliance and can't solve their own problems later on.' Dr Carr-Gregg said the first problem is that there are too many 'parents being doormats for their kids' Dr Carr-Gregg told ABC that he has seen evidence of the consequences to these types of parenting, not just in his own clinic but schools around Australia. 'For the last 15 years I have been on the speakers' circuit in schools around Australia, and it's the teachers in early learning centres, the primary schools, the secondary schools that regale me with stories. Dr Carr-Gregg said the wisdom around parenting, which was derived from grandparents had no longer been so readily available. 'We've had people moving to these artificial villages called cities, primarily to get jobs and in doing so, a lot of the kinship networks have been destroyed. Dr Carr-Gregg said parents are frightened to say no and it's incredibly important that they set limits and boundaries . Bad parenting has a result of both short and long-term effects, warned Dr Carr-Gregg. 'The short-term consequences you can see in restaurants and in waiting rooms and in airports throughout Australia, where you have these kids who are just completely feral, running out of control. 'Parents don't do anything about it because they're frightened of being seen as bad parents or frightened to say no.' Dr Carr-Gregg said this style of parenting has major effects on the mental health of children and adolescents as they grow up. 'Long-term, I think what we're doing is infantilising a lot of children into incompetence,' he said. Psychologist Andrew Fuller disagreed with Dr Carr-Gregg's theory, stating that Australian parents were 'doing a good job' However, The Advertiser reports psychologist Andrew Fuller disagreed with Dr Carr-Gregg's theory, stating that Australian parents were 'doing a good job.' 'The relationship between kids and their families is very strong, and kids look up to their parents in positive ways,' he said. 'Parents are very concerned about the wellbeing of their kids, but most of their kids are doing well. 'It’s popular to see young people on the verge of catastrophe, but young people are brighter and happier than ever.

"Three white lion cubs born in Hangzhou Zoo, China, have been adopted by a female dog after their mother refused to feed them. The cubs, born in late April, were abandoned by their mother and are now breast-fed by a dog together with a Siberian tiger cub in the zoo. White lions are not actually a species in their own right, but are a variation of the African lion, with their colour caused by a recessive gene which is shared by both parents - like blue eyes in humans. Three white lion cubs have been born in a zoo in China's southeastern province of Hangzhou but were rejected by their mother . The three cubs, along with a tiger cub, have now been given to a surrogate dog mother to look after until they are a bit older . By giving the animals to a dog, instead of hand rearing them, keepers hop that the animals will eventually be able to rejoin their own kind . Contrary . to popular belief, white lions are not albinos. Their colour is . caused by a mutation similar to albinism, but they lack the distinctive . red eyes. It is not the first time the zoo, in China's southwest, have used a surrogate dog mother to adopt baby lions and tigers. In December last year they placed a pair of Siberian tiger cubs with a stray dog from the nearby village after their mother refused to suckle them. They brought in the dog, named Xiao Wang, to act as their surrogate mother while still nursing her own newborn puppies. It is not the first time this zoo in China has given baby lions and tigers to a surrogate dog mother to look after, they did the same thing in December last year with two Siberian tiger cubs . While naturally occurring white lion cubs are rare, because the cause of their colour is genetic they can be bred for in zoos, leading to fears of interbreeding . Raising the cubs is hard work for a dog. As babies they require far less food than the 20lb their adult counterparts require, but it is still more than a baby dog . The lions were born in late April, meaning they are just over a month old. It is usual for cubs to be separated from their dog surrogate before they are a year old and can start doing harm . While young Siberian tigers obviously do . not eat as much as their adult counterparts - who need at least 9kg . (20lb) of food each day to survive - their appetites are certainly . greater than that of the average puppy, making the task a difficult one . for a dog. The technique is used to keep human animal interaction to a minimum so the animals can eventually be reintroduced with their own kind. In 2010, a tiger cub called 'Lucky' was introduced to a litter of dogs after its mother refused to feed it. And other cross-species adoption has also been known to take place, with or without encouragement by zookeepers. White lions are thought to have been living in the Timbavati region of South Africa for centuries, although the earliest recorded sighting was in 1938 . Once the cubs are older it is hoped they can be reintroduced to a pride of other lions as being reared by a dog means they will not be dependent on humans . In 2010, a tiger cub called 'Lucky' was introduced to a litter of dogs after its mother refused to feed it . White lions are regarded as sacred animals in certain parts of Africa, but after Europeans 'discovered' them in the 1970s, many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations . In 2005, a newborn squirrel was discovered in Seattle having been adopted by a pregnant papillon dog called Mademoiselle Giselle. In the same year Owen, a one-year-old orphaned hippo, was taken in by Mzee, a 130-year-old giant tortoise, in a Kenyan zoo. Golden retriever Isabella adopted three white Bengal tiger cubs on a US ranch in 2008 – although they were separated for the dog’s own safety when the big cats reached a year old. The species has been technically extinct fro 12 years, but has never officially been registered as endangered as they are not a separate species from the regular African lion . In their natural habitat, white lions are regarded as 'apex predators', able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes .","Three white lion cubs were born in April but when their mother refused to suckle them they were given to a dog .

"New York's first immigrant Juan Rodriguez who arrived in the city in 1613 has had a three-mile stretch of Broadway named after him . New York's very first immigrant has been honoured with a three mile stretch of Broadway named after him, 400 years after arriving in the Big Apple. Juan Rodriguez, a sailor and trader from the Dominican Republic, is widely believed to be the first non-native American to have ever set foot in the city. While the street in its entirety, will continue to be known as Broadway, from 159th Street in Washington Heights to 218th Street in Inwood, it will now go by the additional name of Juan Rodriguez Way. Yesterday a renaming ceremony was held in Mitchel Square Park and May 15 was celebrated uptown as Juan Rodriguez Day. Ramona Hernandez, director of the City University of New York’s Dominican Studies Institute told The New York Daily News: 'We are happy, we are dancing! 'It’s a carnival, a festival, and a celebration of a man who came here many, many years ago, and gave the Dominicans a claim on this great city at the very beginning of its history.' Quite how Rodriguez cam to end up in New York is a matter of some debate. It is generally accepted that he arrived on the vessel Jonge Tobias from Santo Domingo under the Dutch sea captain Thijs Mossel. When Mossel set sail to return to the Netherlands, Rodriguez was left behind - either having decided to stay for himself or having been marooned. Mossel himself insisted that Rodriguez had abandoned ship and remained on the island voluntarily . In sworn affidavits crew members testified that the 'mulatto' or 'Spaniard' had 'run away from the ship and gone ashore against their intent'. They even suggested that they ought to have killed him when he refused to board ship and sail back to Europe. Rodriguez is believed to have mastered the local Indian language and set up a small trading post and may have eventually settled down marrying an Indian woman. Sign of respect: The stretch of Broadway from 159th Street in Washington Heights to 218th Street in Inwood, it will now go by the additional name of Juan Rodriguez Way . Yesterday a renaming ceremony was held in Mitchel Square Park and May 15 was celebrated uptown as Juan Rodriguez Day . During the winter he moved to a Dutch . fur trading post which had been set up on what is now Lower Manhattan by . Christiaan Hendricksen earlier that year. A . report by the Dominican Studies Institute read: 'Juan Rodriguez happens . to be the first historically recorded individual of non-Native American . ancestry to have ever resided in what is today metropolitan New York, . before the Dutch named their settlement New Amsterdam.' Ramona . Hernandez, of the City University of New York described Rodriguez as . 'the first immigrant, the first black person, the first merchant, the . first Latino and, to us, the first Dominican to have ever lived in New . York City.' Trader: Rodriguez negotiates with Native Americans at his small trading post in New York . Juan Rodriguez . Records of Juan Rodriguez are few and far between and what little is known about him comes chiefly from the records and ships' logs of Dutch traders. He was raised in the Spanish settlement of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. A skilled linguist, he was was hired by the Dutch sea captain Thijs Volckenz Mossel in 1613 to serve as the translator on a trading expedition to the Native American island of Mannahatta. When Mossel's set sail to return to the Netherlands, Rodriguez, who had already learnt the Algonquinian language of the native Lenape people, remained ashore setting up a trading post. Mossel had left him eighty hatchets, some knives, a musket and a sword which he used to barter with the indians. Rodriguez later married an Indian woman. During the winter he moved to a Dutch fur trading post which had been set up on what is now Lower Manhattan by Christiaan Hendricksen earlier that year. The small outpost formed part of the network of Dutch settlements that would become New Amsterdam and eventually New York City. Much of what is known about Rodriguez comes from records concerning the Dutch fur trader Adriaen Block. Block was furious when captain Mossel arrived and accused him of trying to 'spoil the trade' by offering indians three times more for a beaver pelts than he did. In a report submitted to the Amsterdam Notary upon his return to Holland, Block claims crewman Rodriguez had become a permanent fixture in Manhattan, trading and living alone among the natives. Rodriguez had taken it upon himself to gain friendship with the natives, set up a trading post, and live comfortably on Manhattan Island. Later Hendrick Christiaensen captain of the Dutch ship the Fortuyn describes in his log how Rodrigues came aboard the Nachtegaal, presented himself as a freeman, and offered to work for Christiaensen trading furs.","Juan Rodriguez was a sailor and trader from the Dominican Republic .

"Passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight most likely died from suffocation as the plane coasted into the ocean on autopilot, Australian officials have said. In a new 55-page report, the Australian Transport Safety Board said investigators arrived at the conclusion after comparing conditions on the flight with previous disasters. The news comes as authorities announced the Australian-led search will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the Indian Ocean. Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said it was 'highly, highly likely' flight MH370 was on autopilot . The report narrowed down the possible final resting place from thousands of possible routes, while noting the absence of communications, the steady flight path and a number of other key abnormalities in the course of the ill-fated flight. 'Given these observations, the final stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of MH370's flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction,' the ATSB report said. Officials said this suggested the plane was most likely to have crashed further south than previously thought. They said they are confident the . Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, was set to autopilot several hours . before its demise into desolate and unmapped waters. Deputy . Prime Minister Warren Truss said: 'It is highly, highly likely that the . aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the . orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings.' The new analysis comes more than 100 days after the plane disappeared on March 8 shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing. Mr Truss said the new phase of the search could take more than a year and involves mapping 23,000 square miles of ocean, while the previous search area was only 330 square miles . Investigators say what little evidence . they have to work with suggests the plane was deliberately diverted . thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route before eventually . plunging into the Indian Ocean. The . search was narrowed in April after a series of acoustic pings thought . to be from the plane's black box recorders were heard along a final arc . where analysis of satellite data put its last location. But . a month later, officials conceded the wreckage was not in that . concentrated area, some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) off the northwest coast . of Australia, and the search area would have to be expanded. The new analysis comes days after Malaysian police said pilot Zaharie Shah, 53 (pic), is the main suspect in the disappearance . 'The . new priority area is still focused on the seventh arc, where the . aircraft last communicated with satellite. We are now shifting our . attention to an area further south along the arc,' MrTruss told . reporters in Canberra. Truss . said the area was determined after a review of satellite data, early . radar information and aircraft performance limits after the plane . diverted across the Malaysian peninsula and headed south into one of the . remotest areas of the planet. The . next phase of the search is expected to start in August and take a . year, covering some 60,000 sq km at a cost of A$60 million ($56 million) or more. The search is already the most expensive in aviation history. The . new priority search area is around 2,000km west of Perth, a stretch of . isolated ocean frequently lashed by storm force winds and massive . swells. Two vessels, one . Chinese and one from Dutch engineering company Fugro, are currently . mapping the sea floor along the arc, where depths exceed 5,000 metres in . parts. A tender to find a commercial operator to conduct the sea floor search closes on Monday . The new search area has been the subject of an aerial search . previously, but efforts will now head below the waves, combing the . ocean floor which is some 5km deep in parts. The shift was expected as the head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Martin Dolan, said last week it would move south. 'This . site is a most likely place where the aircraft is resting,' he said. 'The search is going to be painstaking – of course we could be fortunate . and find it in the first hour or the first day, but it could 12 . months.' Mr Truss said Australia remained dedicated to the task of solving 'this greatest aviation mystery in total history.' Malaysia airlines flight MH370 vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard . The new analysis comes just days after Malaysian Airlines pilot Zaharie Shah, 53, was revealed to be the prime suspect behind the plane's disappearance. Malaysian police made the announcement after discovering files on Shah's home flight simulator showing he practiced landing on small airfields, including several in the Indian Ocean. The files had been deleted from the computer before officials seized it, but have since been recovered by detectives. The criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur, but the only individual arousing suspicion was Captain Zaharie. The father-of-three was found to have no social or work-related future plans, unlike the rest of the crew including his co-pilot, Fariq Hamid. The criminal inquiry, which is yet to rule out other reasons for the plane's disappearance including a mechanical failure and terrorism, has so far only released its results to foreign governments and their investigators.","Officials say new analysis suggests plane crashed further south than previously thought .
