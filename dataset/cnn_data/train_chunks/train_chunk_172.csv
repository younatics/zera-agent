"Munich, Germany (CNN) -- A documentary about the murder victims of a German neo-Nazi terror cell has scooped the top prize at this year's CNN Journalist Awards ceremony in Munich. ""Eight Turks, One Greek and a Policewoman"" -- by Matthias Deiss, Eva Muller and Anne-Kathrin Thuringer -- won both the CNN Journalists of the Year award and TV category Thursday night. The awards are open to young German journalists. The report, which aired on German television, tells of the search for answers following the ""Doener Murder Series"" -- a string of fatal attacks across Germany which took place between 2000 and 2007, leaving 10 people dead. The killings were committed by suspected members of the National Socialist Underground. The journalists' search for the victims' families led them to discover an alleged murder target who is still alive. Full coverage of the CNN Journalists of the Year award (German) Jurors commended the recipients for their well-researched, investigative journalism. ""The journalists showed persistence to stay on an explosive topic, putting it into a new perspective in the focus of attention,"" said Franz Fischlin, head of the awards panel. Watch video of the CNN Journalists of the Year award . Print category honors went to Takis Wurger of Der Spiegel, who accompanied a unit of German marksmen in Afghanistan. The piece told the story of Christian Sommerkorn, a soldier who is waiting to kill someone for the first time in his life. Sabine Rossi's ""Call From Damascus,"" in which a young father in the Syrian capital regularly discusses the Syria unrest via telephone, won the best Radio category. Jurors praised Rossi's ability to provide the WDR Funkhaus Europa listeners with ""a direct insight into the life and fate of a family."" Also recognized were Salome and Lukas Augustin, who won the Online category, for their video piece ""Afghanistan -- Touch down in flight."" Their film posed the question to viewers: What do we have in common with the people in Afghanistan? It displayed vivid footage of everyday life in the country without the use of words, text or links and was first published on iPad app Suddeutsche Zeitung Magazin before it went viral on the Internet. Originally published in Liga -- the magazine for the Austrian League of Human Rights -- Fabian Weiss' portraits of ""Lesbian Women in China -- A life bordering on life"" focused on the women at the LaLa Shalongs in Beijing, a meeting place for lesbians. Judges awarded Weiss top accolade in the photographic category and said his work was ""poetic, expressive and very authentic."" Tony Maddox, Executive Vice President of CNN International, said: ""These young journalists and press photographers who are nominated for the eighth CNN Journalist Award have had the courage to cover difficult topics in a distinctive way. They give a face to stories which would not have been brought to the focus of society without their attention and their relentless journalistic curiosity."" ""Underpinning the sheer courage of this year's reporting on controversial sometimes inconvenient issues that more often evade the spotlight is an intense regard for detailed research. The importance of this quality can be overlooked but is an integral facet to quality journalism.""","Deiss, Muller, Thuringer win CNN Journalist Award .

"(CNN) -- With the April 15 tax filing deadline fast approaching, top Justice Department tax lawyers are pressing efforts to prosecute tax cheats in a cat-and-mouse game with billions of dollars at stake. ""We basically see the same attempts over and over again â€” it runs the range,"" Kathryn Keneally, assistant attorney general for the Tax Division, said Tuesday. She said despite the forced spending cuts, also known as the sequester, the Tax Division, along with the IRS, expects to aggressively pursue tax violators. ""The IRS and Department of Justice have made significant strides in recent months to combat tax fraud, identity theft and offshore tax evasion,"" said Steven Miller, acting IRS commissioner. Keneally said government prosecutors had achieved a 95% success rate in all civil and criminal cases they had litigated in the past year. Prosecutors from the Justice Department obtained 127 indictments, which resulted in 137 convictions. Altogether the Tax Division has authorized 938 grand jury investigations, resulting in 1,751 prosecutions, according to a news release issued Tuesday by the Justice Department. The Justice Department said it had collected $290 million through civil litigation and retained more than $1 billion in requested refunds that officials prevented from being issued. The federal investigators are particularly focused on the use of foreign tax havens, which they believe can account for $100 billion annually. Government tax lawyers were particularly pleased with the guilty plea of Wegelin Bank of Switzerland in January. The oldest private bank in Switzerland was the first overseas bank to plead guilty to felony tax charges. The bank admitted it had tried to defraud the United States by helping American account holders hide assets from the IRS in undeclared accounts. In the past year the United States has charged eight bankers and 11 account holders in connection with investigations into offshore banks located in Switzerland, India and Israel. The Justice Department says it is also targeting individuals engaged in stolen identity refund fraud. In this scheme, criminals illegally obtain Social Security numbers and other identifying information then file false returns and pocket the refunds. Keneally said authorities are still plagued by tax dodgers who purposely refuse to comply with the tax laws and use ""frivolous"" arguments to support their actions. The government has had some success in recent years targeting some of the leading dodgers who have claimed constitutional backing for their anti-tax views.","Foreign tax havens, identity fraud are priorities for the Tax Division .

"Long Beach, California (CNN) -- Gasoline at $4 a gallon is no worry for T. Boone Pickens, the billionaire energy investor from Texas. He drives from his home to his office in a car that runs on fuel costing less than $1 a gallon. His method: He has a device that fuels his Honda Civic GX with natural gas from the pipes that serve his home. And he thinks there's a lesson there for America's energy woes. Pickens, who is speaking Wednesday at the TED2012 Conference in Long Beach, California, said America needs to make natural gas a building block of a plan for ending oil imports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Natural gas is ""cheaper, it's cleaner, it's abundant and it's ours, and we're fools not to use it,"" Pickens said in an interview with CNN. Pickens, an 83-year-old trained geologist who has been working in the energy field since 1951, said the United States could use domestic resources to replace the 5 million barrels of oil imported daily from OPEC, which makes up a quarter of America's daily use of oil. The U.S. natural gas reserves amount to the equivalent of three times the oil reserves possessed by Saudi Arabia, he said. ""All you need now is leadership,"" he said, lamenting that America ""has no plan, we've gone 40 years with no energy plan. We're the largest user of oil in the world."" Pickens' plan is encapsulated in the Natural Gas Act, a bill with Democratic and Republican sponsors, that would provide tax credits to replace diesel-fuel burning truck engines with natural gas-powered engines; users of natural gas as a transportation fuel would pay fees that would make up for the lost government revenue. His firm, BP Capital, has a vested interest in energy policy since it invests in energy futures and the shares of firms in a variety of parts of the industry. He said the worry over increasing fuel prices in the United States rests in part on a lack of understanding of the energy market. Energy prices in America are by far the cheapest in the world, with Europeans paying more than double to fuel their cars and with natural gas costing four or five times as much in Europe and China. Promises of much lower fuel prices are a fantasy, Pickens said, since the world's demand for oil is roughly equal to the amount that is being produced. Pickens said the media should challenge GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich on his claim that if elected he can lower gasoline prices to $2.50 a gallon. ""You've got Donald Trump saying don't pay OPEC $100 for the oil. Just tell 'em you'll give them $50. ""Really? I go into Trump's hotel, it's $1,000 for a suite and I say I'm not going to give you that, I'll give you $200. I'm on the street looking for another place to sleep. You can't tell 'em I'll give you $50 when the world market is $100. It just doesn't work that way."" He said he still favors wind energy, which was a key part of the ""Pickens Plan"" he put forth in 2008, but the price of natural gas is now so low that wind projects can't compete economically, Pickens said. With 70% of everyday oil use going to transportation fuel, he said the impact of putting a much cheaper fuel such as natural gas into the market will be to bring the price of gasoline and diesel down. His current plan is focused on moving trucks to natural gas, but he said President Barack Obama could also urge consumers to commit that their next car will run on a domestically produced fuel, whether it's natural gas or a plug-in electric vehicle. A Wall Street Journal editorial Tuesday, headlined ""Boone-Doggle,"" called Pickens' plan ""the hottest energy fad in Washington"" and criticized it for proposing subsidies for a natural gas industry that should compete on its own. The start-up costs of relying on natural gas for transportation aren't cheap. The cost of replacing truck engines is roughly $35,000 apiece, Pickens said. His own natural gas car costs thousands more than a gasoline-powered Honda Civic, and then there is the cost, which he said was $2,000, to install the natural gas fueling device for the car. And U.S. consumers have only that one natural gas model from which to choose. In France, he said, there are 62 models that use natural gas. Pickens said American carmakers do produce such vehicles for overseas markets but have not seen a viable market in this country. One of the concerns is that there isn't a widespread network of service stations that could refuel a natural gas-powered car. Pickens said natural gas is available in pipes that go down every street and alley, so it could eventually be more accessible for refueling. ""Somebody says you couldn't get in that car and drive to Chicago, well, you could -- you'd have to do a little work to see where the stations are, but I'm not going to drive that car to Chicago, I'm going to drive that car from my house to my office."" And if he is going on a trip to Chicago? ""I'm going to get in my wife's car. She has a bigger car. Women always have bigger cars than men do.""","Energy investor T.

"Washington (CNN) -- From bustles to silk chiffon with organza flowers and Swarovski crystals, the newly updated first ladies exhibition at the National Museum of American History is an extravaganza of frills and fashion. The first ladies' gowns have been shown at the Smithsonian for 97 years in at least 10 separate exhibitions, the latest of which will open to the public on Saturday. Eight of the 26 dresses in ""The First Ladies"" exhibition are new to the display, as the curators work to rotate in different dresses in an attempt to extend the life of the collection as a whole. Light, climate and gravity are harmful to fabric. Taking them off display can help keep the gowns in good condition ""so that this almost hundred-year-old show, the thing that your grandmother brought you to, your granddaughter can bring her granddaughter to come and see,"" said curator Lisa Kathleen Graddy. ""We wanted to balance color and style and time periods and some things that hadn't been out before,"" said Graddy. They also wanted to focus on first ladies who had a strong fashion presence, she added. The new additions on display include a dark blue, sparkly flapper-style dress worn by Grace Coolidge, and a pink silk brocade gown worn by Dolley Madison. According to Graddy, first ladies have popularized colors, as Nancy Reagan did with red; they have been praised for their modest and simple attire, like Lucy Hayes; and they have been trendsetting icons, like Jacqueline Kennedy. ""They've also coped with the public interest in their fashion sense, which is a somewhat unexpected part of the job for many first ladies,"" Graddy said. Michelle Obama's 2009 inaugural gown of white silk chiffon is a centerpiece of the exhibit. The one-shouldered gown designed by Jason Wu shares a display case with the Jimmy Choo shoes and jewelry she wore with the dress. Videos and pictures of the first ladies wearing the gowns accompany the dress display at the museum, adding another dimension to the way visitors see the dresses. In addition to the gowns, ""The First Ladies"" exhibit includes White House china and other personal possessions of first ladies. ""The first ladies' artifacts make up one of the most enduring and popular collections of the Smithsonian,"" said Marc Pachter, interim director of the American History Museum.","Eight of the 26 dresses in the exhibition are new to the displays .

"(CNN) -- Two days after a Gulf of Mexico oil platform blast and one day after his co-worker was found dead on the sea floor, a Filipino man offered a succinct message Sunday to his relatives and countrymen: ""I am alive."" Wilberto Ilagan is one of the at least 11 injured in Friday morning's explosion on a platform located 20 miles off the coast of Grand Isle, Louisiana. He is also one of four -- all men native to the Philippines -- who suffered major burns and are being treated at Baton Rouge General Medical Center. Read more: Search for missing oil workers suspended . Hospital officials briefed reporters Sunday about the status of those four patients, including passing along a message from Illagan, who was recently upgraded to fair condition. ""I am burned, but my heart and lungs are healthy,"" the Filipino man said, according to the hospital. Two others remain in critical condition at the hospital, which is about 160 miles from the explosion site and 8,500 miles from the Philippines, said Baton Rouge General's chief of surgery Dr. Jeffrey Littleton. One other patient is in serious condition and being treated by staff at Baton Rouge General's burn center. ""They remain in the critical window of time that follows major burn injuries,"" said Baton Rouge General's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Flip Roberts. ""But our physicians and staff remain hopeful about their prognosis."" Ilagan is the only one of the four at the Baton Rouge hospital to be identified by name. Authorities and energy company officials have not yet named the man whose body was found by divers Saturday night. Another worker was still unaccounted for Sunday. Black Elk Energy President and CEO John Hoffman said that man's body was discovered under the platform, on the sea floor. He was one of two crew members who went missing after the explosion and subsequent fire. ""We're working in coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard so we can respectfully and most efficiently recover the body and get that body to shore,"" Hoffman said. Black Elk Energy, a Houston-based firm, was in charge of the platform -- which was used for production, not drilling -- where the blast occurred. About 28 gallons of fuel spilled into the region, Coast Guard Response Division Chief Ed Cubanski said. An oil sheen reportedly stretched for about a half-mile near the platform. The injured were airlifted to area hospitals, and nine other crew members were evacuated, according to the Coast Guard. The cause of the blast remains under investigation.

"Carmel Church, Virginia (CNN) -- At the Flying J truck stop in rural Virginia, truck drivers can taste the coffee, smell the diesel and see the future. The future lies in a remote corner of the parking lot, where workers recently planted two rows of gleaming new fuel pumps. They are labeled LNG -- liquefied natural gas. Though little noticed by the four-wheel public, there is a revolution taking place in the world of long-haul 18-wheelers. Next year, truck manufacturers will begin churning out trucks with new 11.9-liter engines fueled by LNG -- a fuel that is significantly cheaper than diesel, is abundant in the United States and Canada, and is, arguably, clean. But there's a problem. Currently, there are only about 30 open LNG fueling stations in the country -- many of them clustered in energy-conscious southern California. So if you were to try to drive from Washington to Los Angeles, you'd run out of fuel near Nashville, far from the nearest open station. In an odd twist on the old trucker's joke -- ""You can't get there from here"" -- you really can't get there from here on LNG. Historian says U.S. set for 'fracking' bonanza . The trucking industry calls this the ""chicken and egg"" problem: which will come first -- LNG trucks or LNG refueling stations? Trucking companies need assurances there will be fuel before committing to new fleets; fuel companies need assurances there will be a stream of LNG trucks. ""I would say that, hold your breath, because any time now, that won't be a problem,"" said Bill Graves, head of the American Trucking Associations. ""There's going to be a deployment of fueling stations all across the nation and it's going to make movement of freight by truck -- by natural gas powered truck -- a reality."" By next spring, some 120 new LNG stations will have been completed, popping up like crocuses from coast to coast, although many are being immediately mothballed until LNG trucks become more plentiful. When they will open is ""anyone's guess,"" one industry representative said. History is replete with examples of people hyping new, cheap, plentiful and clean alternative fuels. But the current interest in LNG for large trucks is undeniable. When the ATA early this year planned a ""Natural Gas in Trucking"" summit, it anticipated some 200 people would attend. When the summit convened last week, its venue -- expanded to 500 seats -- was sold out. Oil man turned natural gas evangelist and investor T. Boone Pickens said the reason is simple: money. ""I mean, you are talking about saving a dollar and a half, two dollars a gallon and that's unheard of,"" said Pickens, who, as an investor in Clean Energy, has a stake in the success of natural gas. ""If I'm trucking against you and my fuel bill is $2 a gallon cheaper than yours, I can tell you, you've got a problem. I will take a lot of your business away from you,"" Pickens told CNN. The 11.9-liter engine is a game changer, industry officials say, because it occupies a ""sweet spot"" in the market. The bulk of long-haul trucks use 11.9-liter engines. The engine will open up the world of long-distance natural gas trucking. At today's prices, the added cost of an LNG-powered truck can be recaptured in a year or two, industry officials say. Ironically, one of the few voices of trepidation at the ATA natural gas summit was from an environmentalist. ""It's a mistake to rush headlong into this,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. Krupp said that despite diesel's dirty image, diesel technology has grown much cleaner in the past decade. Today's diesel and natural gas engines emit similar amounts of sulfur, nitrogen and particulates, he said. The problem with LNG, Krupp told the trucking summit, is not the gas that is burned, but the gas that escapes as it is transported through the supply chain from the well to the fuel tank. The un-burned, leaked gas is 72 times more potent than carbon dioxide -- a greenhouse gas -- making it more damaging to the environment, Krupp said. Will public chargers mean more electric vehicles? For Krupp, the issue comes down to a simple calculation. Currently, the government estimates 2.8% of natural gas used in trucks leaks somewhere in the supply chain, he said. ""If we can get the leak rate at 1% or less, then it's an OK thing for the atmosphere to make the switch (from diesel),"" he said. ""Unless we take the necessary steps to measure and reduce the amount of methane escaping from the entire supply chain, natural gas engines could very well be worse for our climate than diesel,"" Krupp told the truck industry summit. Trucking and gas industry officials at the summit were bullish about the prospects for natural gas, and confident that the environmental issues could be addressed. ""Virtually every trucking company that we've talked to has understood that the savings involved with natural gas vehicles will be significant over what their fuel costs will be with diesel,"" said Tom Kiley, an alternative fuel specialist for Freightliner Arizona. ""The only hesitation that we see is what's the fueling infrastructure -- Where can I get my fuel?"" Pickens, a member of Clean Energy's board, doesn't flinch at that question. The country faced the same question a century ago, in the beginning of the automobile age, he said. ""If somebody said, 'Henry (Ford), have you thought about it? You don't have any filling stations!' He'd say ""Gosh, I haven't thought about that. Well I'll forget this idea.'"" ""That's not what he said. He said, 'Don't worry about it. You will get filling stations. If the car shows up, filling stations will come.'""","Next year, truck manufacturers will start making new vehicles that use LNG .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea said Monday that it had shut down operations at two nuclear reactors after discovering that they were using parts supplied with forged quality certificates. Halting the reactors to replace the parts will result in ""an unprecedented level"" of strain on the nation's power supply as it heads into the winter months, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a statement. The controversy over the products used in the Korean reactors comes amid increased scrutiny of nuclear power worldwide following the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan during the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the country in March 2011. Read more: Radioactive levels staying high near Fukushima Daiichi plant . The unverified parts in South Korea are products like fuses and power switches that don't pose a risk of causing a radiation leak, authorities said. The plant operator, Korean Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., found that eight suppliers had sold it a total of 7,682 items with forged quality certificates between 2003 and 2012, according to the government. The total value of the products was around 820 million won, or $750,000. The vast majority of those parts that were put into use went to two reactors at the Yonggwang Nuclear Power Plant in the southwest of the country, the government said. Those are the two reactors that are being shut down until at least the end of the year in order to replace all the unverified items. The two reactors account for about 5% of South Korea's national power supply, according to the government. Their suspension will significantly reduce the amount of energy supply that South Korea holds in reserve each day during January and February. Temperatures in areas of South Korea regularly drop well below freezing in the winter months. The government has called on relevant agencies to enact measures this month to counteract the expected pressure on the power supply from the shutdown of the reactors.","The shutdown will put an ""unprecedented"" strain on power supply, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- In Brooklyn, a woman pushed a small grocery cart with a single bag inside. In it, a precious possession shielded from prying eyes: a red can filled with gasoline. In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, gasoline might as well be gold. ""It has become a hot commodity, so we didn't want to risk it,"" she said. With lines snaking for blocks -- miles, even -- outside gas stations in New York and New Jersey, tensions occasionally flared as people waited for the chance to to pump gas into cars or gas cans. ""The situation is hectic,"" said Terry Landers, a CNN iReporter in Lebanon, New Jersey. ""Many gas stations are either out of gas or (will be) soon."" The demand is high, and the fuel isn't just for empty car tanks. Many people still have no electricity and are using gasoline-powered generators, adding to the demand. Temperatures drops, tempers rise in power outage . ""As word spreads that somewhere has gas, there are (lines of) cars as long or longer than the one in my video,"" Landers said. Federal and state authorities acted on two fronts Friday to address the issues -- both to bring more fuel to the area, and to more fairly distribute what is already there. At President Barack Obama's direction, the Defense Logistics Agency will buy up to 12 million gallons of unleaded fuel and up to 10 million gallons of diesel that will be moved on tanker trucks to replenish stocks in New York, New Jersey and other areas experiencing severe gas shortages. In order to ration and decrease wait times, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed an executive order Friday tying whether a driver gets gas to his or her license plate number. It goes into effect in 12 counties at noon Saturday. On days that end in even numbers -- such as November 4, 6 or 8 -- gas station operators can sell gas to only those with license plates with a last digit that is even. On odd-digit days, such as November 3, only those with plate numbers ending in an odd number or those with specialty plates can get gas. In New Jersey, only station attendants can pump gas. ""This system will ease the strain on those gas stations still operating, while we work to bring more online for the public to access fuel, in a manner that is fair, easy to understand and less stressful,"" Christie said. 7 health risks after Sandy . Mariangel Javier, who is nine months pregnant, said she had been waiting for more than five hours to fill up at a gas station in Union City, New Jersey. She had used what little gas she had left to drive to her last doctor's appointment. ""But I didn't find out until I got there that they didn't have power either, so now I need gas to get back home,"" she said. The gas station's manager, Favhan Javed, has been working day and night alongside his staff to keep the station running and was confident that Javier would be able to fill up. ""I even stay until after midnight for my friends who are taxi and limousine drivers, because they have to feed their families, too,"" he said. For the most part, people have remained remarkably cool. As a precaution, police are helping to keep the lines in order at some gas stations. In other areas, there was a sense of organized chaos that sometimes veered more toward disorder. At a station in Queens, New York, police arrested a man early Thursday after he cut in line and then pulled out a gun when he was challenged by other residents. Sandy roared ashore Monday night, knocking out power to millions of people, and flooding mass transit systems across the Northeast. Three days later, more than 1 million people in New York and 1.4 million in New Jersey are still without power. Powerless in New Jersey . The demand for gasoline is only going to rise, with New York's subway system still out of commission -- meaning more people are forced to travel by car -- and a forecast of cold weather for New York and New Jersey this weekend. Most major gas station chains, from ExxonMobil to Hess, were experiencing disruptions. In fact, some 60% of gas stations tracked by AAA in New Jersey were not operational, according to the motorist group. In New York's Long Island, that figure was 65%. Economic impact of gas shortages . CNN's Christine Romans explained that a lot of the closed gas stations simply don't have electricity to operate their pumps, while others cannot get gasoline delivered to the station from the refinery because of blocked roads or other logistical problems created by the storm. And even with government efforts to address the problems, gas shortages could stretch ""though the weekend and into the next,"" according to Matt Smith, an analyst for Summit Energy. To cope with the overwhelming demand, some stations limited their services to emergency vehicles only. Other stations only provided gas for people's gas cans, and not their cars. Many gas stations set limits to how much gas each person could pump: maybe $20, or maybe $50. Desperate residents -- who at least had enough power to charge their mobile devices -- used social media to try to avoid long lines or empty gas stations. Twitter users in New Jersey created the hashtags #njgas and #njopen to provide real-time information on open gas stations, the length of the line, and any restrictions. ""Bp gas on French street near jersey ave in New Brunswick is open and line is less than 30 minutes,"" tweeted @johnnymatson. ""This guy turned a blocked driveway into a business opp for those of us in line for gas,"" tweeted @AmyMJ2, along with an Instagram picture of a man smiling behind a table with two coffee dispensers. Some Twitter messages revealed that red gas cans were quickly becoming just as scarce as gasoline itself. Others offered some humorous perspective on the situation: Charles Leone, offered this: ""Some perspective. The NYC marathon winner will run the marathon in less time than the average (gas) lines.""

"(CNN) -- An ongoing skid in crude oil markets and the impact of Superstorm Sandy helped drive U.S. gasoline prices down nearly 21 cents a gallon in late October, the latest Lundberg Survey found. The national average price of regular gas fell to $3.55 a gallon between October 19 and November 2, survey publisher Trilby Lundberg said. ""It's the biggest price decline in our surveys since early December 2008, when the recession hit in full force,"" Lundberg said. The price at the pump remains about 12 cents higher than a year ago after a volatile year that's seen steep peaks and deep declines. Crude oil prices, which make up the largest element of the price of motor fuel, are on the downswing, and demand has fallen since the end of the summer vacation season, Lundberg said. Behind the gas panic: One expert explains . ""But we also have two other things going on -- the destruction from Sandy inhibiting consumption of petroleum products, and demand weakness from lackluster economic performance,"" she said. Lundberg predicted gas prices could fall another 10 to 20 cents a gallon in the coming weeks, ""assuming there's no jolt in the price of crude from some awful, international reason."" The Lundberg Survey canvasses more than 2,500 filling stations across the continental United States twice a month. In the latest, conducted November 2, the cheapest gas could be found in Memphis, Tennessee, at $3.11 per gallon; the highest was in San Francisco, at $4.05. Average per-gallon prices in other cities: . Atlanta: $3.36 . Billings, Montana: $3.60 . Boston: $3.75 . Denver: $3.46 . Houston: $3.30 . Jackson, Mississippi: $3.21 . Minneapolis: $3.26 .

"(CNN) -- Gas prices have dropped more than 7 cents over the past two weeks, but risen in some regions stricken by Superstorm Sandy, according to a survey published Sunday. The new national average for regular gasoline is $3.47 -- down more than 36 cents over the past six weeks, the Lundberg Survey found. ""This latest decline comes mostly from weak gasoline demand,"" said publisher Trilby Lundberg, ""both because we are in the lower demand season and have also lost our daylight saving time. Losing that puts a damper on driving."" Sandy's impact in the Northeast lowered demand as well, since many people were stuck at home, unable to drive. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . But because there was also ""great difficulty getting fuel to the end user point,"" gas prices went up in some of those same areas, she said. The highest average price found by the latest survey was $4.18 for New York's Long Island. That average was up 26 cents from two weeks earlier. Long Island generally has higher prices than the national average due to taxes. The Lundberg Survey tallies prices at thousands of gas stations nationwide. Good news should lie ahead for consumers around the country, Lundberg said. ""Pump prices may well drop some more form here -- unless crude oil prices get seriously spooked by Middle East conflict or another geopolitical issue."" The current nationwide average is 9cents above the average a year ago, ""whereas most of this year it's been more like 16 cents,"" Lundberg said. The city with the lowest average in the latest survey was Memphis, at $3.04. Here are average prices in some other cities: . San Diego - $3.80 . Seattle - $3.49 . Las Vegas - $3.57 . Denver - $3.35 .

"(CNN) -- The state of Florida on Saturday filed a lawsuit against BP and Halliburton over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The suit argues that Florida is entitled to the revenues it lost because of the spill. These include a long list of lost taxes -- sales, corporate, cigarette, liquor -- and other forms of revenue for the state, such as rental car surcharges. See more on CNN's Powering the Planet . Florida is also seeking punitive damages for the ""misconduct that led to this environmental and economic disaster,"" according to a statement from the state attorney general's office.

"Washington (CNN) -- Less than two weeks after Barack Obama won his re-election campaign, protesters gathered Sunday to call on the president and his administration to reject the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, and to act on climate change. While Republican candidate Mitt Romney said he would support construction of the 1,700-mile pipeline, for the jobs he said the pipeline would create, Obama in the past has rejected rapid approval, citing what he called the ""arbitrary nature"" of the deadline Republicans proposed for passage and the need for sufficient time for the State Department to gather information necessary for a project that crosses into the American border. Nearly a year ago, the State Department announced the decision to delay until after the 2012 election consideration of the controversial project that would originate in Alberta, Canada,'s tar sands and would extend to the Gulf of Mexico. Keystone pipeline protesters arrested in Texas . On Sunday, protestors flooded Washington's Freedom Plaza, before laying down their signs and picking up a 500-foot plastic ""oil pipe,"" which they carried a few blocks to the White House. One of the event's main organizers, founder of 350.org, Bill McKidden, said that activists may have been silent but haven't forgotten about the project and now they've organized to remind the administration of their commitment to preventing fossil fuel based projects that they say are causing increased climate change. ""They said a year ago they would study it further, now that year is up, and in the meantime we've had the hottest year in America history, we've had an epic drought, we've had the Arctic melting and we've had Superstorm Sandy flooding the subways of New York,"" said McKibben. ""The pipeline has come to symbolize something much, much bigger than just one energy project, it's come to symbolize what is our energy future, and what President Obama is going to do on climate change,"" said activist Jane Kleeb of the anti-pipeline organization Bold Nebraska, in a state where the Keystone XL project would cut through predominantly agricultural areas. At issue is the potential for water and soil contamination from the 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude oil that would traverse the pipeline each day. Film director Josh Fox, whose documentary ""Gasland"" examined the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, also known as ""fracking,"" was among protesters with camera in hand. ""I'm here doing a film on (McKidden's 350.org's) ""Do the Math,"" and the math tells us that we have more fossil fuels in the ground than is supportable by the atmosphere without total catastrophe and calamity,"" said Fox.","The 1,700-mile pipeline would run from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico .

"(CNN) -- U.N. energy chief Kandeh Yumkella knows first-hand what access to electricity can bring to the developing world. Growing up in the West African country of Sierra Leone, he would often study by candlelight as frequent blackouts would leave his university dormitory without power supply. Today, as director general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), Yumkella is using his experiences to ensure no one in the world is left in the dark. An outspoken advocate of energy access, Yumkella is working to prove that there are smarter power strategies that can benefit all nations. ""I advocate that let's have poor people get energy -- 1.3 billion of them who have no electricity at all,"" he says. ""If we're going to lift eight billion people by 2025 or 2030, you need energy access."" The passionate and influential energy leader was appointed director general of UNIDO in 2005. Now, in his second and final term, Yumkella is aggressively promoting the ""Sustainable Energy For All"" program -- a U.N. initiative bringing together governments, businesses and civil society groups to transform global energy systems by 2030. Read related: Harnessing pedal power to light up Africa . Yumkella, a former minister for trade, industry and state enterprises in Sierra Leone, travels the world encouraging world leaders and other highly influential people to join in what he believes will help fight poverty and strengthen nations. He wants to find and install cleaner, renewable alternatives that enhance energy production and are friendlier to the environment. Yumkella spoke to CNN about the U.N.'s energy strategy, plus his personal story and his work for Africa. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: One of your big topics has been energy access to end energy poverty. Kandeh Yumkella: We are convinced that without access to energy you cannot achieve the Millennium Development Goals. I know from my experience growing up in Sierra Leone, going back there today, that if you don't have access to energy you can't talk about closing the digital divide...you cannot talk about getting manufacturing done. The Secretary General calls energy the golden thread that runs through all the development pillars. In fact, 60 to 70% of the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change come from energy systems. So if you want to fix climate change, you need an energy revolution. CNN: Do you think it's possible to eliminate energy poverty around the world by 2030? KY: We believe it's doable. We have the best minds working on this, our friends from the United Nations, friends form the World Bank, the international energy agency. We feel very excited because we just got a big boost in Rio...over 50 developing countries stepped forward wanting to be part of this initiative. The challenge now: we've got billions of dollars of pledges -- how do you convert pledges to real action on the ground over the next 10 years. Can we hold ourselves and countries and businesses accountable that what they pledged they really meant to do? Read: In the dark -- South Africa's haphazard electricity supply . CNN: Can you explain the connection between ending poverty and energy? KY: For me that's our role in the U.N., to make that connection to see the possibilities of transformative change that spreads prosperity for all. If we don't do it and we become nine billion and one third of mankind is still poor but yet we've taken all their raw materials to be prosperous, there will be insecurity around the world. CNN: What are your frustrations that you have, particularly when it comes to finance? KY: The frustration is that because sometimes of narrow political interests you see people knowing what to do, believing in what to do but for the sake of short term political gain -- because they have to stand for election in four years -- they decide not to support a cause. We call it in global governance short-termism. So you are trying to talk to them about transformative change for 10 years and they're like ""OK, yeah, right. I have elections coming up next year. I need to talk about populist topics now."" Read: Pay-as-you-go solar power lights up rural Africa . It's the same with development corporations we see for example in the context of Africa. People talk a lot about poverty reduction but they don't want to talk about wealth creation in Africa. But you have to create wealth in Africa, you have to help those economies move into the industrial age. If African population is going to be 1.3 billion by 2030, two billion almost by 2050, most of those people living in the cities you must to talk about wealth creation, you must talk about manufacturing to transform those economies -- otherwise there will be crisis. People forget that this so-called Arab Spring revolution started in North Africa, that's Africa -- it was about youths demanding jobs, yes, there was governance issues but at the end of the day it was about jobs and prosperity and lack of vote. The rest of sub-Saharan Africa need that change. But people rather talk about poverty alleviation, saving the poor people in Africa than talking about a true partnership with Africa to transform those economies. That's politics. That's an old paradigm of development in Africa: Africa as a receiver as a poor nation, ""save their souls."" No, it is about partnerships, it's about making Africa a viable entity in a 21st century global economy. That's the issue. Politicians will talk about poverty because it's a little bit more sexy. CNN: What needs to happen in Africa? KY: I always say to people, we Africans don't want to be basket weavers forever, that's not what my child is looking for. She's in a wonderful university somewhere, she wants to come back to Africa and have a good job. Africans themselves need to think differently today. They must believe that they can transform. Look at what globalization did in the last 20 years, lifting 200-300 million people out of poverty in India and China alone. If poor countries, particularly in Africa, depend only on commodities, they will remain poor. That is my message, that is my advocacy in the world -- and to do that, you need infrastructure, you need energy, good governance, education, market opportunities and global partnerships.","Kandeh Yumkella is the director general of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization .

"(CNN) -- Ahdaf Soueif isn't in one place for long. She has spent the last month touring India and Australia, and is back in her native Egypt for a few days before heading to London. She is in demand for speaking engagements, particularly at literary festivals, to help the world understand political events in Egypt, still in turmoil more than two years after its revolution. Soueif, 62, is a Booker-shortlisted author and political commentator whose most recent book ""Cairo: My City, Our Revolution"" gives a personal account of her involvement with the protests in January 2011 that led to the downfall of former president Hosni Mubarak. Soueif is not one for commentating from a safe distance. On the day before we speak, she has yet again joined protesters on the streets of Cairo. ""I came straight from the airport to the streets,"" she said. On January 25, 2011, when hundreds of thousands of protests began flooding into Tahrir Square in Cairo, Soueif was at a literary festival in Jaipur, India. ""I did my final event and then went sightseeing and shopping in Jaipur,"" she said. ""When I got back to my hotel I had I don't know how many messages, so I turned on the TV and saw what was happening in Tahrir Square."" She had been planning to spend another 10 days in India, but instead got the first flight back to Cairo to join the demonstrations. In her book, Soueif describes euphoria in joining the demonstrations with her two young nieces. ""It was grassroots, millions of people walking out,"" she said. ""It was amazing and totally inclusive."" For Soueif, the revolution that began in January 2011 is still a work in progress, because despite free presidential elections in June 2012, there have not been the changes in social justice that many were hoping for. Despite the setbacks and continuing violence, Soueif is adamant the country is better off than it was before 2011. ""I'm very optimistic,"" she said. ""The change that has happened in people was huge. People have broken free and expressed what they want."" Soueif said she joins protesters on the streets of Cairo two or three times a week when she is not traveling the globe on speaking engagements. ""It gets tiring, but at the same time it's re-energizing because there's a tremendous positive energy flowing,"" she said. ""It reminds you what it's all about and of the determination of people."" Soueif was born in Cairo to intellectual parents and spent her childhood between the United Kingdom and Egypt. She studied English literature at university in Cairo before researching a PhD in Britain. She married the late British poet Ian Hamilton, with whom she had two sons, Omar Robert Hamilton and Ismail Richard Hamilton. Soueif has written two novels, several collections of short stories, a book of essays and edited a hefty tome an Islamic art. Her second novel ""The Map of Love"" in 1993 made her the first Muslim woman to be shortlisted for the Booker Prize. ""What it meant to me wasn't just about being the first Muslim woman or Arab, it was just great as a writer to make an impact,"" she said. ""Map of Love"" was translated into 28 languages, with the Arabic translation by her own mother. ""It was a tremendous privilege to work with her. She was incredible,"" said Soueif. ""We had some rows to begin with along the lines of 'whose book is it anyway?', but it was a very rich experience. ""I still remember the times when we would sit and mull over the right translation for a certain expression for hours."" In recent years, Soueif has been too busy as a columnist and commentator to write fiction, although hopes to write another novel when she can find time. Last year she was listed by Arabian Business magazine among its 100 most powerful Arab women. She is currently working on her own Arabic translation of her Cairo book, but is struggling to find time in her busy schedule. ""If I get two clear hours, that's what I work on,"" she said. Ahdaf Soueif will be appearing at the Women of the World Festival at London's Southbank Centre from March 8-10.","Ahdaf Soueif was the first Muslim woman to be shortlisted for the Booker Prize .

"(CNN) -- People like to say history repeats itself, but Southern Co., which is building the first U.S. nuclear reactors approved in decades, is hoping this isn't true. With last year's tsunami-induced disaster at the Fukushima Daichi plant in Japan, Southern doesn't want its reactors to meet the same fate. ""We learned a lot from Fukushima, and all that has been taken into account,"" said Cheri Collins, general manager of Atlanta-based utility, one of the largest electricity distributors in the United States. ""Our uncompromising focus is safety and quality."" During October's annual France-Atlanta 2012 conference, Collins explained how the newly designed Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro, Georgia, will feature safety measures meant to prevent a Fukushima sequel. They include the reactors' not needing electrical power to shut down safely and relying less on pumps and valves and more on natural heat. Also, because of digital operation, a human controller won't be required for 72 hours, and the main core will remain cool because of a containment cooling system. These design changes, Collins said, are meant to protect employees and the surrounding community in the event of a natural disaster. Collins noted that while Southern keeps safety atop its list of priorities, it can't ""control the weather,"" and it's hard to prepare for natural disasters such as the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan or 2005's Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast. According to Mike Altizer, Southern's nuclear engineering programs manager, tests involving floods, earthquakes, fires and tsunamis were conducted in hopes of ensuring a natural disaster wouldn't affect the reactors. Yet while Southern moves forward, last year's disaster has soured the prospects for nuclear energy in some European nations, while critics ask why more isn't being done to tap safer energy such as natural gas. On March 11, 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the fourth-largest on record, struck off the coast of Tohoku, Japan. It triggered a tsunami with 30-foot waves that later forced the shutdown of eight reactors at two plants in Fukushima. The next day, a nuclear emergency was declared at the Daichi and Daini plants after the tsunami cut off electricity and disabled the backup generators at the former while causing the cooling systems to fail at the latter. Roger Hannah, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman, said the agency is taking a number of actions in response to Fukushima. They involve equipment, training, procedures, maintenance and fire protection, he said. ""The Vogtle reactors are an advanced design that has more passive safety features,"" Hannah said. ""The NRC does not allow a plant to operate if it does not meet the agency's stringent safety regulations."" According to the NRC website, on March 12, the commission passed regulatory requirements for nuclear plants in response to Fukushima. Those requirements include mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events that result in a loss of power at the plant, steps to ensure the safety and reliability of venting systems designed to release pressure and the enhancement of spent fuel pools. Also, the NRC created the Japan Lessons Learned Project Directorate, a group that focuses exclusively on implementing regulations based on the lessons learned at Fukushima. Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist for the watchdog Union of Concerned Scientists, isn't for or against the new reactors, he said, but he expressed concerns with the tests and safety features. ""In my judgment, the AP1000 design does not have any safety advantages compared to currently operating reactors and, in fact, may be less safe,"" Lyman said. ""The features described are only designed to function in the event of [a] so-called 'design basis accident' -- not the type of severe accident that occurred at Fukushima."" At Fukushima, there was a total loss of power for nearly 10 days, so even if the reactors had been AP1000s, they would have run into trouble after 72 hours, Lyman said. In addition, the NRC has exempted the AP1000 from some of the modifications it is requiring at operating nuclear reactors after Fukushima, he added. He said he isn't familiar with the NRC natural disaster tests, but ""certain components of the AP1000 shield building were tested for their structural integrity under certain stress conditions and actually failed the tests, but the NRC discounted the results because it claimed that those components didn't need to pass those tests."" In a May 2011 New York Times report, NRC Chairman Gregory B. Jaczko said the shield building's design numbers seemed off. Jaczko, who stepped down as chairman in July, said the company had not tested the buildings under enough possible seismic activity situations. However, the five-member NRC voted in favor of the licenses four to one, with Jaczko being the lone vote against it. Jaczko said he wouldn't speak on record to CNN, but he told CNNMoney on February 9 that the new licenses don't go far enough in requiring the builders to incorporate lessons learned from Fukushima. Hannah explained there were many versions of the AP1000 design that raised questions among critics during its creation. The shield building was a major area of concern but was fixed before the final design was approved, he said. A total of 19 changes have been submitted since the design began in 2002, the last of which came in June 2011, according to the NRC website. Asked about Lyman's assertion that the Vogtle plants would incur problems if they went 10 days without power, as did the reactors at Fukushima, Hannah said all plants have some sort of backup generator that allows power to be generated in an emergency -- even one as big Fukushima. ""We have a task force specifically designed to find out what kind of backup generators will work best in these situations,"" he said. Along with the safety concerns, critics have other questions about the reactors. For one: Why build new reactors when there are cheaper energy sources, namely natural gas? Lyman is one of those critics, and he points to the $14 billion price tag for the two reactors, which some estimates indicate may be $1 billion short of the actual cost. ""The enormous price tag of new nuclear power projects, such as Vogtle 3 and 4, means that nuclear power is not cost-effective, especially given the low price of natural gas,"" Lyman said. According to the Energy Information Administration website, new low-cost drilling technologies, growing production and an increase in reserves have made natural gas a primary source for energy, rivaling coal for the first time in April. Before the U.S. approved plans for 13 nuclear reactors this year, the last nuclear reactor was built in 1990. Collins downplayed the natural gas argument during the France-Atlanta conference. While it is ""the right choice of energy in terms of cost"" right now, she said it has been volatile lately and that using nuclear energy is a better option as a long-lasting energy source. The EIA states that prices for 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas, a standard measure, have fluctuated greatly of late, from $9.84 in December 2011 to $15.94 in August. Plant Vogtle has had two nuclear reactors in operation since 1989. Unit 3 is scheduled to be in operation by 2016, and Unit 4 is scheduled to be operational a year later. Vogtle's were the first reactors to be approved since 1978, the year before America witnessed its most serious nuclear plant meltdown. On March 28, 1979, a unit at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant experienced a combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related problems and worker errors that led to a partial meltdown of the unit's reactor core. It took nearly 15 years to clean up the damage. Though no deaths or injuries occurred to plant workers or people in the nearby community of Middletown, Pennsylvania, the Three Mile accident brought about numerous safety changes in the nuclear plant industry that still resonate today. Likewise, other countries haven't taken the events at Fukushima lightly either, and much like Three Mile Island gave the world pause in its nuclear ambitions, Fukushima is prompting changes around the globe. For instance, Belgium and Germany have decided to get out of nuclear power entirely. Italy had been planning to start using nuclear power but decided not to, said European Commission spokeswoman Marlene Holzer. ""We have conducted a reassessment of all existing nuclear reactors in the EU in the light of Fukushima. We hope that the results and the recommendations made will be included when building new reactors,"" Holzer said. ""Building on these results, we will come out with a new EU law on nuclear safety.""","The two new nuclear reactors are the first to be approved by the NRC since 1978 .

Critics say natural gas is cheaper; so why use nuclear energy?
Because of the events at Fukushima, other countries have stopped using nuclear energy."
"(CNN) -- The fight to block construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline through east Texas stepped up Monday as protesters locked themselves to machinery. Dozens of others formed a human chain to keep heavy machinery from moving around the proposed pipeline's path in Cherokee County, said Ethan Nuss, spokesman for the Tar Sands Blockade group. Three protesters at another location suspended themselves from 50-foot pine trees with their life lines anchored by the construction equipment, Nuss said. Cherokee County sheriff's deputies used ""pain compliance"" measures, including pepper spray, to remove the four protesters locked to the machinery, Nuss said. The four were dragged away ""very aggressively and painfully"" and arrested, he said. Protesters, police clash in Cairo . Two others were arrested when they tried to block a cherry picker crane to remove the protesters from the trees, Nuss said. A 75-year-old woman was among those pepper sprayed and arrested, he said. ""Some peaceful protesters doing nothing more than holding signs by the road were violently pepper sprayed,"" said group spokesman Ron Seifert. Demonstrators demand Obama reject pipeline . All of the blockade protesters were removed from the construction sites by 2 p.m. and 12 of them were arrested, he said. Meanwhile, a sheriff's spokesman confirmed six arrests, but provided no other details. TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment Monday. ""Today's Day of Action is in solidarity with local landowners struggling to protect their water and land from TransCanada's toxic tar sands pipeline,"" the protest group said in a written statement Monday. Jordanians protest high gas prices . While construction of some segments of the proposed 1,700-mile pipeline has not been approved, the Texas government and courts have cleared its path through that state. If completed, it would transport tar sands mined in Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Opponents want U.S. President Barack Obama, who in the past has rejected rapid approval, to outright reject the pipeline project, arguing it would be an environmental disaster. Actress Daryl Hannah was arrested last month in Wood County, Texas, when she and another woman tried to stop a bulldozer from clearing land along the pipeline path. Bill McKidden, founder of 350.org, said a demonstration in Washington on Sunday was to remind the Obama administration of its commitment to preventing fossil fuel based projects that they say are causing increased climate change. ""They said a year ago they would study it further, now that year is up, and in the meantime we've had the hottest year in America history, we've had an epic drought, we've had the Arctic melting and we've had Superstorm Sandy flooding the subways of New York,"" said McKibben.

"(CNN) -- In the morning hours of April 21, 2010, Arleen Weise got a phone call from her son's friend, telling her that an explosion had ripped through the Gulf of Mexico oil rig where her 24-year-old had been working. The Texas native quickly hung up and phoned the rig's owner, Transocean, which leased the drilling rig to BP, in a frantic attempt to find out what happened. She learned that her son, Adam, was one of 11 workers killed the night before. ""That was it,"" said his mother. ""That was the start of hell."" For the next two years, the 59-year-old hair dresser would go in and out of counseling to cope with her grief, while leaning on family and her customers for emotional support. BP to pay record fine for Gulf oil spill . ""I knew all along that BP was the devil in that accident,"" Weise said. ""Now they're getting their due."" On Thursday, the Justice Department announced that London-based BP will pay a record fine to settle criminal claims in the ensuing catastrophe. The firm agreed to shell out $4.5 billion in government penalties and plead guilty to a dozen felony charges after the April 20, 2010 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Billy Anderson also lost his son, Jason, in the blast. This settlement ""doesn't bring my boy back, but it does show everybody that they're guilty and everybody knows it,"" he said. Opinion: Three lessons linger from BP oil spill . And yet for many who lost loved ones, Thursday's announcement offered what they described as only a limited sense of justice. ""It doesn't matter how much money anyone pays. It doesn't nearly amount to what we've lost,"" said Weise. A statement from BP's CEO apologized for the company's role in the disaster. ""All of us at BP deeply regret the tragic loss of life caused by the Deepwater Horizon accident as well as the impact of the spill on the Gulf coast region,"" said the statement from Bob Dudley. ""From the outset, we stepped up by responding to the spill, paying legitimate claims and funding restoration efforts in the Gulf."" ""We apologize for our role in the accident, and as today's resolution with the U.S. government further reflects, we have accepted responsibility for our actions,"" he added. The loss of life was only one part of the disaster. Photos: Still plagued by oil spill . Millions of barrels of oil flowed from the BP well and into the Gulf region, where coastal businesses rely heavily on the seafood industry. ""It made the prices of oysters and shrimp go up,"" said 41-year-old Denny Amato, part of family that owns Mother's restaurant in downtown New Orleans. ""I think people have now come back to eating Louisiana seafood. It just took them a while."" Amato said he and other local restaurant owners are ""trying to figure out if there's a way to file a claim."" ""I'm just not really sure what's going to happen now,"" he said. Louisiana's wetlands represent about 40% of the wetlands in the continental United States, prompting major environmental concerns for such a vast and ecologically diverse area. The oil leak was finally capped in July 2010, nearly three months after it started. Thursday's landmark settlement is now subject to federal judicial review. BP posted a $17.2 billion loss in the quarter when the explosion took place, but has been profitable since, tallying total profits of $43 billion over the course of the subsequent nine quarters.

"(CNN) -- Her mother was assassinated, her father died in prison after being jailed by the military. Today, Hafsat Abiola is one of the most prominent civil rights activists in Nigeria, fueled by a desire to ensure her parents' deaths were not in vain. The daughter of Nigerian politician and philanthropist Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (MKO) Abiola, Hafsat was at her second year studying at Harvard, United States, when her father was sent to prison by Nigeria's junta after claiming the country's 1993 presidential election. Although MKO Abiola garnered almost 60% of the vote, the West African country's military rulers annulled the results and eventually charged the former businessman with treason. His imprisonment prompted a wave of demonstrations, led partly by Hafsat's mother and Abiola's second wife, Kudirat. In 1996, Kudirat Abiola was shot in the head when the car she was traveling in was attacked on a Lagos expressway. Hafsat was still in the United States with her siblings when news came of her mother's assassination. ""All five of us were in the U.S. when we heard, and we stood in a circle, and we held hands,"" remembers Hafsat. ""We just stood there, and then I said to my siblings that we won't let her down, and really since that time we've been trying to make sure that we do not let her down."" Two years later, in July 1998, MKO Abiola died while still in custody. Everything Hafsat has done ever since is done through the prism of her loss and her desire to continue the legacy left by her parents. After Kudirat's assassination, Hafsat founded an NGO in her mother's memory, the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND), a group working to strengthen Nigeria's civil society. Along with promoting female leadership by offering training and support to women who want to run for office and be active in public life, KIND is also tackling issues such as violence against women. ""We wanted to also work with protecting women from domestic violence, raising awareness about the issue of domestic violence,"" says Hafsat. ""Also, we're drawing tacit public acceptance of it. If the public challenges people who abuse their wives, their daughters, their sisters, their girlfriends, it will stop, it will be not so easy to continue."" Last year, Hafsat was appointed as a special adviser to the governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amonson. Hafsat runs a conditional cash transfer project for the state, where poor pregnant women are encouraged to use available healthcare facilities for safer pregnancies in a bid to reduce maternal mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, maternal mortality in Nigeria is 630 per 100,000, more than 20 times as high as in Europe or the United States. ""We need to drive the women into our primary health centers,"" says Hafsat, explaining that many pregnant women choose to not visit a doctor due to high costs. ""But for us the cost of their loss of life is too high for us and society to bear, so we have to incentivize them to overlook the cost,"" she says. ""So what we're doing is that we pay them to go to the doctor six times before delivery, which is a lot of times but we want to have enough time to be checking if there's any complications arising that we have to prepare for. ""We pay them to deliver in the hospital, so each time they go to give birth we give them a small amount of money. It's not a lot, but it will cover transportation and a little bit extra."" Hafsat says that through her efforts and those of others in the country, the work of her parents can reach a new generation of Nigerians. ""I think that if they were to do it all over again, they would do it exactly the same way,"" says Hafsat of her parents. ""Or if not, they would even make more sacrifices because I think we only live once, and we must do what we can.""","Hafsat Abiola is the daughter of Nigerian politician MKO Abiola .

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- The World Bank will support Central American security efforts with $1 billion in loans for the next two years, Guatemalan state media reported Wednesday. That money will be in addition to $200 million the bank already has provided to different countries for fighting organized crime, the state-run Guatemalan News Agency reported, citing the bank's vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean. Bank officials are among the international leaders gathered in Guatemala City for a two-day regional security conference. ""In meetings of this kind I see regional leadership, international solidarity, institutional commitment and unprecedented unity among the different national and international actors, and above all, consensus,"" World Bank Vice President Pamela Cox said, according to the news agency. Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States would increase the security aid it provides to Central America this year to help combat a wave of violence sweeping the region. Additional U.S. funding will go toward special police units, a regional crime observatory and support to train judges and prosecutors, Clinton told leaders gathered at a regional security conference in Guatemala City. ""You have identified your priorities. You have set your strategy. And we will respond with almost $300 million this year, backed up by an action plan that is focused on high-impact investments to help you build new capabilities and create the reforms you need from within,"" Clinton said. President Barack Obama pledged more than $200 million when he visited El Salvador earlier this year, she said. The source of the funding was not immediately clear. On Monday, Assistant Secretary of State Arturo Valenzuela told reporters Clinton may announce ""repackaging"" some assistance. Clinton said the United States has ""shared responsibility"" for violence in the region. ""We know the demand for drugs rests largely in my own country,"" she said. But she stressed that Central American countries must lead the fight against corruption and organized crime. ""We will all be your ready partners, but we want and need to follow your lead,"" she said. Several Latin American leaders at the meeting said the United States must play a key role combating violence in the region. Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said his country was reaching the limit of its ability to fight cartels. ""Eight killed per ton passing through Guatemala is a lot of blood. If you pass through Honduras there are 20 murders and if we add it up, a ton of cocaine has too high a human cost. We must reduce consumption and control arms,"" Colom said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who has repeatedly said U.S. weapons and drug demand are fueling his country's drug war, said more must be done. ""If the sale of cocaine is a market of $35 billion in the United States, according to that calculation, a good part of these billions of dollars must be used to feed the criminal organizations here,"" Calderon said. ""The international aid should be at least equivalent to the flow of money in dollars that the criminals receive here to organize and to kill."" The conference is scheduled to continue Thursday, when leaders are expected to hash out a more detailed regional plan. The meeting comes a week after Guatemalan authorities announced a monthlong extension of the ""state of siege"" in the northern border province of Peten -- a move that increases military control to crack down on organized crime in the area. Colom declared the emergency measure in May after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in Peten. Authorities have said members of Mexico's Zetas drug cartel were responsible. The slayings provided brutal evidence of what analysts say is a dramatic spike in violence across the region as Mexican drug cartels expand their reach. ""As you look at the pressure placed on Mexican cartels from the U.S. side of the border, you're going to see more and more of a southbound exodus,"" said Fred Burton, vice president of the STRATFOR global intelligence agency. Social and political conditions in Central America provide a fertile recruiting ground for cartels, said Samuel Logan, founding director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. High unemployment and few jobs mean many are forced to turn to criminal activities to make ends meet, he said. ""Ultimately, what it comes down to is money. In Mexico, the stakes are bigger, the pots of money are bigger,"" he said. Money also has allowed Mexican organizations to wield significant influence with political leaders in Central American countries, many of which already had a longstanding history of institutional corruption, he said. ""Instead of bending over backwards, you get them to do somersaults,"" Logan said. But despite the significant security problems the region faces, Burton said this week's conference is a positive sign that leaders may step up efforts to stop violence. ""Discussion and dialogue is better than doing nothing, so the more exchanges you have along these lines, certainly the better off you are,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Proposed new legislation won't change Ireland's general ban on abortion, Prime Minister Enda Kenny said Wednesday, but is about ""saving lives"" when pregnant women are in danger. Ireland's government published the controversial draft measure late Tuesday to clarify what happens when there's a threat to the mother's life, including a risk of suicide. The government wants the legislation, the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013, to become law before the summer recess at the end of July. The draft bill is already prompting a divided response in Ireland, with much concern focused on the provision for pregnant women who are suicidal. Kenny, Ireland's Taoiseach, or prime minister, acknowledged in a speech how contentious the proposal may be in the majority Roman Catholic country. ""This is an issue that has been very divisive and contentious for over 30 years,"" he said. ""It's also an issue that is complex and sensitive, about which many Irish people have sincere and strongly held views. ""We are a compassionate people. This is about women, it is about saving lives -- the life of the mother and the life of the unborn."" The government's aim, Kenny said, ""is to protect the lives of women and their unborn babies by clarifying the circumstances in which doctors can intervene where a woman's life is at risk."" At the same time, he said, the bill ""restates the general prohibition on abortion in Ireland."" The draft bill seeks to bring the country's legislation into line with a Supreme Court judgment two decades ago that it is legal to end a pregnancy when there is a risk to the life of the mother. Ireland has also had to look again at its abortion legislation because of its obligations under European human rights law. Legal framework . Presentation of the draft law follows calls for change from some quarters after the death last October in Galway of an Indian-born dentist who was denied an abortion while miscarrying. The coroner at an inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar last month recommended that authorities lay out exactly when doctors can intervene to save the life of a mother. Woman's death in Ireland abortion case ruled 'medical misadventure' The government says its proposed bill sets out a ""clear legal framework"" for women and medical practitioners in Ireland. Under the draft legislation, when the threat is not from suicide, two doctors must jointly certify that there is a ""real and substantial risk"" of the loss of the pregnant woman's life, and that they believe abortion is the only way to avert that risk. One of the doctors must be an obstetrician or gynecologist, and at least one of the two should consult with the woman's own doctor where possible. When the risk to the pregnant woman's life is from suicide, the assessment must be made by an obstetrician or gynecologist, along with two psychiatrists. Husband testifies his wife died after abortion was denied in Ireland . A doctor is also allowed to terminate a pregnancy in the case of a medical emergency if there is an immediate threat to the pregnant woman's life, the draft states. The procedure must be carried out by a registered medical practitioner at an appropriate location. The final decision on whether to carry out the abortion will always be made by the pregnant woman, it adds. 'Empty and misleading' While anti-abortion campaigners say the proposed legislation would make abortion too easy, pro-choice proponents say it will still be too difficult for women to access the procedure. United Left Alliance lawmaker Clare Daly told the Irish parliament Wednesday that the bill would not stop the ""exportation of abortion"" -- referring to the Irish women who travel to Britain for terminations to circumvent the ban. Addressing the prime minister, Daly said: ""I'm glad this legislation is before us, but let's be clear what you've presented is the absolute minimum. The clear intention is to make it so restrictive that most women who will be affected will not even bother, that instead they will continue to make the journey to Britain so that you can continue to pretend that there's no Irish abortion."" Meanwhile, the Pro Life Campaign dismissed the government's reassurances over the general abortion ban as ""empty and misleading,"" and said claims the new legislation would be life-saving are dishonest. ""What matters is what's contained in the bill, and what's in the bill is dangerous,"" said Caroline Simons, a legal consultant to the campaign. ""For the first time an Irish government is proposing to introduce a law that provides for the direct intentional targeting of the life of the unborn child."" The draft legislation will be discussed by the Irish parliament's health committee over the coming weeks before being presented to both houses of parliament. It is almost certain to be approved in the end, as the coalition government has a big majority. Some lawmakers from the main coalition party Fine Gael are likely to vote against the bill, however. Their opposition is set to be expressed at their weekly party meeting Wednesday evening. Anti-abortion protesters may also gather Wednesday. Ireland's deputy prime minister, or tanaiste, Eamon Gilmore, reminded lawmakers Wednesday that a small number of pregnant women do find themselves in the awful situation where their life is in danger. ""Women have a right to know that if the worst happens, they will be able to have life-saving treatment,"" he said. ""Yesterday, the government made a decision that that right will now be vindicated.""","NEW: An anti-abortion campaign group says the government's reassurances are ""misleading""

"(CNN) -- In the star-studded world of supergroups, where musical acumen and bloated egos often co-exist, it's not unheard of band members to not talk to each other. But in the case of AfroCubism, the all-star band consisted of renowned Malian and Cuban musicians, the reason for the group's lack of verbal communication is much more straightforward: the band's members simply don't understand each other's language. ""We cannot even speak together on stage,"" says kora maestro Toumani Diabate, one of Mali's premier musicians and a member of AfroCubism. ""Music has created its own language -- it's the music message, and I think the message is true to the audiences [and] to the world also at the same time."" United by the universal language of music, the members of AfroCubism, which also include legendary Cuban musician Eliades Ochoa and Malian griot singer Kasse Mady Diabate blend the desert-inspired sounds of West Africa with Cuba's soul-stirring grooves. For Diabate, one of Africa's most revered musicians, this is not the first time he fuses different sounds to break down musical barriers. The masterful musician is well-known internationally for his daring and innovative musical partnerships -- his long list of collaborators include Damon Albarn, Bjork and the London Symphony Orchestra. Read more: Guitar hero of the desert . ""The fusion is to give and to learn,"" says Diabate. ""This meeting is like fighting but in a positive way. The old musicians from Mali, the old stars, it's like, 'OK, I'm here, I'm playing,' and the Cubans also say the same. So, we take care of our culture, they are taking care of their culture...so we put the both music together to become a new music."" Yet, this cultural crossover took years to become a reality -- back in 1996, a group of Malian musicians were invited to Havana to record with Cuban singers and musicians. The musicians from West Africa, however, never made it to Cuba -- visa problems, lost passports or better-paid concerts elsewhere have all been cited as reasons over the years. Read more: Street musicians unite world through songs . With a studio already booked, the album's producers decided to carry on with the project, using the talents of some of Cuba's greatest musicians, many of whom were retired or had been long forgotten. The resulting album, the now-famous ""Buena Vista Social Club,"" went on to become a global hit, winning several music awards and selling millions of albums. But some 14 years later, the Malian and Cuban musicians finally got a chance to play and record together in Madrid, Spain. Their 2010 long-awaited studio offering received a Grammy nomination last year for ""Best World Music Album."" The band is currently on their second North American tour, spreading their vibrant sounds to new audiences. On stage, Diabate's masterful playing shines though as he brings the unique sound of the kora, a 21-string harp-like instrument from West Africa, to the forefront. ""I tried to open a new door for the kora in the world,"" he says. ""Today, I'm very happy the kora can fit on electronic music, fit in folk music, blue grass, it's fantastic."" Read more: Somali rapper makes songs in the key of love . An ambassador for West African music, Diabate has won two Grammy awards, while his first album, ""Kaira"" -- which he recorded in 1986 aged 21 -- is regarded as the first ever solo kora album and remains a best-seller to this day. His mission today is to keep the thrilling sound of the kora alive, expanding its reach beyond the continent. ""Cuba and Mali, we are two number one culture countries in the world,"" says Diabate. ""In the 1960s a lot of countries in Africa got their independence and we had a very good relation with Cuba -- musicians from Mali were taken from Mali, going to Cuba to study how to write and to read the music -- not to play the music because we already knew how to play the music -- and we still have this kind of relation still running about culture and style."" Watch: Malian kora master Diabate at work . Diabate says AfroCubism songs prove once again that music has the power to bring people together. ""We are singing about love, we are singing about peace, we are singing about understanding and respect and spirituality,"" he says. ""They [Cuban musicians] are happy 200% in what they are playing when we play together and we, from Mali, are happy 200% too -- we are enjoying, we are playing and then audience sees more and you can see in the face of the audience -- [they are] happy, very happy, dancing, enjoying themselves.""","Kora master Toumani Diabate is one of Africa's most famous musicians .

"(CNN) -- Record prize money and an extra rest day for finalists -- U.S. Open tennis chiefs have taken note of player complaints and made significant changes for 2013. The tournament's women's final will now be held on a Sunday and the men's title match on a Monday, while the total prize purse will increase by $4 million. ""I'm pleased that the USTA has modified the U.S. Open schedule to include a day of rest between the semifinals and final,"" defending men's champion Andy Murray said on the New York grand slam's website. ""Together with the prize money increase, it's good that they've taken on board the players' concerns."" Record Australian Open prize money heads off player unrest . Women's champion Serena Williams was also happy with the changes, which mean the female players will play their last-four matches in Friday's afternoon session. ""Both the prize money increase and the addition of a day of rest are great for the players,"" the American said. ""These moves make the tournament stronger than it's ever been for all players."" Previously the finals had been held the day after the semis, prompting criticism that the schedule favored players seeded in one half of the draw who get an extra 24 hours' recovery time. How 'Big Four' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues . The men's final has actually been played on a Monday for the past four years due to weather disruptions earlier in the tournament, which has affected players who have been involved in the Davis Cup teams final the following weekend. The new schedule means that there will be no evening session on the second Saturday of the two-week tournament. ""We recognize the increased physicality required to compete at the highest level of the sport, and we have responded to the players' request for a scheduled day of rest between the singles semifinals and finals,"" said USTA president Jon Vegosen. ""The record increase in U.S. Open prize money and the changes in the next year's schedule are aimed at rewarding the players' talents and accommodating the rigors of the modern professional game."" How tennis aced austerity . The USTA increased the base prize money by $2 million this year, and the 2013 doubling of that figure will mean a 34% increase since 2011. There will be a total $29.5 million on offer, plus a bonus pool of $2.6 million based on results in the seven-week North American swing of men's and women's hard-court tournaments leading up to the season's closing grand slam at Flushing Meadows. Players have been pressing for a better distribution of prize money among the players knocked out in the early rounds of the four grand slams, and the USTA said it is in talks with them about how best to do this.","An extra $4 million will be on offer for the 2013 U.S. Open tennis tournament .

"(CNN) -- Canadian police arrested three people Sunday in connection with a daring helicopter escape from a Quebec prison. Benjamin Hudon-Barbeau, one of two escaped inmates is in custody, along with two other people, said Quebec provincial police spokesman Benoit Richard. Dany Provencal, the second inmate, is ""surrounded,"" and authorities are negotiating to bring him in peacefully, he said. ""I can tell you one thing: The two people that were inside the jail needed help to get out,"" Richard told CNN. The spokesman declined to identify the other two people arrested. He also declined to say where the arrests took place, under what circumstances, or where Provencal was located. The three people arrested will appear in court Monday morning. The escape happened at around 2:20 p.m. ET Sunday at a prison in Saint-Jerome, northwest of Montreal. The pilot was taken to a hospital for examination and will be interviewed by investigators, Richard said. He did not know whether the pilot had been injured and declined to speculate on news reports that said the inmates held a gun to the pilot's head, forcing him to fly. Richard told CNN the pilot is considered a witness, not a suspect. Hudon-Barbeau was cleared on appeal of a double murder, but returned to prison in connection with an attempted murder investigation, the spokesman said. He said he did not know what Provencal was convicted of. Christa McGregor, spokeswoman for the Correctional Service of Canada, said Provencal was serving a federal sentence of seven years and 10 months for various offenses including arson, break and enter, forcible confinement, unauthorized possession of a firearm, utter threats to cause harm and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle. His sentence started in September 2011, she said. After the escape, a man claiming to be Hudon-Barbeau spoke to a reporter at 98.5 FM in Montreal, by phone. ""I don't want to cause any harm to anybody. I am not a killer. I never did anything bad to an innocent. I know that (the escape) wasn't the best thing to do, but I didn't want to stay in prison anymore. I am ready to die,"" the station reported he said. It also reported that the helicopter involved approached the prison and dropped a cable that allowed the inmates to escape. The helicopter was later found at Mont-Tremblant, also in Quebec. Once the helicopter landed, Hudon-Barbeau and Provencal are believed to have left in a car. Authorities were looking for that car, but Richard declined to provide a description of it. After the arrests, he said he didn't know whether the vehicle had been found. Officials were doing a headcount at the prison to make sure that no one else was unaccounted for, the spokesman said. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt reported from New York. Dana Ford wrote this report from Atlanta. CNN's Paula Newton and Alexander Hunter also contributed to this report.","Authorities are negotiating with escaped inmate Dany Provencal .

"(CNN) -- A week can be a long time when you're one of the planet's best young skiers. On Wednesday, Mikaela Shiffrin turned 18. On Saturday she added the World Cup slalom crown to last month's world championships title, and on Tuesday she'll be back from Europe to appear on U.S. national television. ""Hopefully I don't trip when I'm going on stage. If you knew me for longer than a day you would know that I spill things and I break things and I trip a lot. You would not think I'd be good at slalom."" But she's so good that she denied the world's best female skier this season yet another accolade at the finale in Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Tina Maze had been poised to add the slalom title to her overall, giant slalom and super-G Crystal Globes, having been denied the downhill when fog canceled racing on Shiffrin's birthday. The Slovenian was the fastest on the opening run, and led the standings by seven points, but Shiffrin made up a 1.17-second deficit to claim her fourth World Cup race this season and become the fourth youngest woman to win the title. She is only the third non-European to win the slalom globe, following compatriot Tamara McKinney in 1984 and Canadian Betsy Clifford in 1971. No other non-European woman has won four World Cup races in a season. ""I was freaking out, this time there was really too much emotion,"" said Shiffrin, who last month in Austria was the youngest winner of the slalom title at a world championships since 1974. ""I think half of this globe belongs to someone else today. I actually would like to thank Tina Maze. She's been inspiring, she's helped me get to where I am."" She's also had strong support from her parents and coaching staff. ""After the first run I went directly to our athlete tent and just tried to sit quietly and figure out what I needed to do to make it better,"" Shiffrin said. ""It's hard to do that between runs in a race, but my mom helped, my coaches helped, my dad helped, everybody. They all just said the same thing, 'You have to let it go. You cannot hold back. There is nothing to lose.' So I tried to do that."" Maze had to settle for third place behind Austria's Bernadette Schild for her 23rd podium finish this season. ""In the first run I risked a lot and somehow in the second I didn't manage to risk as much,"" the 29-year-old said. ""Mikaela has been dominating slalom the whole season and I don't think I lost the globe here today, but somewhere else."" Maze has already wrapped up the giant slalom globe ahead of Sunday's final race -- and American Ted Ligety confirmed his dominance of the men's discipline when he crowned his season with a sixth victory out of eight starts on Saturday. ""It's so ridiculous, it has been such an amazing year,"" said Ligety, who won three golds at the world championships and sealed the giant slalom globe last weekend with victory in Slovenia. ""I never would have expected it and in a way it's kind of a bummer as I will never be able to do that again. A really cool season and to finish it up with a victory. I couldn't be more pleased."" Overall World Cup champion Marcel Hirscher was second to be giant slalom runnerup, and has already clinched the slalom title ahead of Sunday's final race. ""I cannot sleep. My head is so full, I keep thinking and thinking and trying to digest it all,"" the Austrian said. ""So much has happened this season and I have not had any time to get into terms with it.""","Teenage U.S. skier Mikaela Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom title .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Architect Ryan Gravel has lived in Atlanta, Georgia for more than 20 years, watching the city grow as it strives to compete among the world's finest. ""Great cities are great places to live and they're really vibrant and diverse,"" Gravel said. ""Atlanta has a lot of those qualities, but it really needs to be sort of kick-started and prepare for the future."" With a growth in suburban sprawl in recent decades, Atlanta has acquired a reputation for unbearable traffic and poor public transportation. But a project originally inspired by Gravel's 1999 graduate thesis is helping to change that perception, tapping into Atlanta's potential and steering it onto a more sustainable path for the 21st century. The Atlanta BeltLine is revitalizing a 35-kilometer (22-mile) loop of abandoned railway line, transforming the land and adjacent brownfield sites into attractive new public spaces. With walking trails, cycle paths and parks dotted along the route, the project is helping connect 45 city neighborhoods. When it is completed, the BeltLine will have regenerated around 3,000 acres of land. See Also: LA's green city challenge . Construction began in 2007, with the first trail (the West End) opening the following year. A Northside trail has since opened, with another, the Eastside, due to open this summer. Along the route, residents can stop off in one of four parks, including D.H. Stanton Park (Atlanta's first energy-neutral park) and the Historic Fourth Ward Park, which has transformed 17 acres of wasteland into a ""glistening oasis"" according to developers. And thanks, in part, to a $25,000 donation from famed skateboarder Tony Hawk, the BeltLine has also created Atlanta's first public skatepark. Atlanta was losing population in the 1970s and 1980s Gravel says, but now the urban core is growing faster than most of the suburban counties. ""You've got thousands of people moving back into the city and that creates a lot of opportunities to leverage that growth to create the kind of place that we all want to live,"" he said. ""If we want to live compactly, sustainably and transit oriented, the BeltLine and that growth presents the opportunity to create that kind of place,"" Gravel added. ""Green space is kind of the living room of the city and as more people move into the city it becomes more and more important to have spaces where people can go get out of their homes and apartments and enjoy the diversity and life of the city."" Major work still needs to be completed and local voters will decide in July whether to raise taxes to pay for the work and a lengthy list of other transportation projects. All the time and money being plowed into updating Atlanta's infrastructure proves that the city is ""growing up,"" Gravel says. ""We're figuring out who we are and what we want to be. And there's a lot of opportunities. The Olympics were a big one, part of that. The BeltLine is the next big major move that starts to redefine us and create who we are going to be when we grow up.""","Atlanta BeltLine project is regenerating a 35-kilometer loop of land around the city .

"(CNN) -- As a young art graduate, Bharti Kher went to India intending to spend six months traveling. More than two decades later, she is still there and has become one of the country's most successful artists. Kher, who is based in Delhi, has exhibited her contemporary work -- from paintings to sculptures -- all around the world. Much of her work is based around bindis, the forehead decorations worn by South Asian women. ""The bindis now for me have become a material,"" she said. ""I took the material, I repeated it again and again and again. I made it mine. I can use them like an alchemist would use or to create something that I don't really know what's going to happen with."" Kher was born in London to Indian parents and grew up in a middle-class suburb, only visiting her parents' homeland once, aged four. She went to art school -- a rarity in her British Asian community -- graduating in 1992. ""All my cousins, friends, the people that we knew growing up as Asians are all doctors, accountants, lawyers,"" said Kher. ""This is what Asian children did. If you were first generation in the UK, you had to be a professional. ""I think people were very surprised when we said we're going to art school. I did and so did my sister."" Kher wanted to travel when she graduated and said she chose between New York and New Delhi with a toss of a coin. ""I had no intention of staying in India,"" she said. ""I just thought I'm going to travel around the country."" After turning up at New Delhi railway station, Kher then discovered she was too afraid to travel the country alone. ""I was so very flabbergasted when I first came to India,"" she said. ""My eyes were wide open, but it was like I was blind. Culturally, it was a massive shock for me. I didn't speak Hindi very well at all."" After two weeks in India, Kher met her husband -- Subodh Gupta, now also a well-known artist -- and never left. The couple now have two children, Lola and Omi. ""That's how we fell in love. I've been here since,"" said Kher. She added: ""The first 10 or 15 years were really were very hard like any practicing artist now. To decide to be an artist takes a lot of courage because there are years of rejection and a lot of loneliness. ""To be able to believe in your work when nobody's even looking at it takes real stubbornness. Because we had each other, really would support each other."" As two well-known artists living together, Kher said she and Gupta often compete with each other. ""We do compete, (healthily or unhealthily) sometimes,"" she said. ""I think the crux of our relationship is art because this is something we are both extremely passionate about."" Kher said her career began to take off in 2006 when she made a model of an elephant. ""People started to look and say 'It's grand. It's on a scale,' and I think formally it was very successful. ""It was really the first time people were asking 'Who is this person? Who is this artist? Where is she from? When did you make the work?'"" In 2007, Kher had her first solo exhibition at a major international gallery, Jack Shainman Gallery in New York. ""I had suddenly got into my mojo,"" she said. In the past year, she has had solo exhibitions in London, New York, Hong Kong and New Delhi. When Kher began to work in India, she said there was virtually no art scene, and that even now it's only just beginning to take off. ""India still hasn't been (unpacked) yet, and I think it's about to begin now,"" she said. ""There's a lot of really interesting work here and a lot of really good artists in India. I just hope within our lifetime people realize that culture is really an important part of society."" Kher hopes she continue to contribute to that culture for many years to come. ""When people go away from my work, I want them to go away with questions. Why did the artist make this? What is it about? Is there contradiction? ""I think almost every single piece that I've ever made carries a degree of contradiction between the form and what it's saying, between beauty and terror or the macabre."" Kher's solo show, ""Bind the dream state to your waking life,"" will be at Nature Morte, New Delhi, until February 16.","Bharti Kher was raised in England, but has become one of India's leading artists .

"(CNN) -- A photo of a listening device in a room where attorneys met with terror detainees at Guantanamo Bay caused a stir this month, but a senior military official says it is a relic from the days when interrogations occurred in the facility. A military judge hearing the case against the September 11, 2001, terror mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others ordered the photo released earlier this month. The device baffled defense lawyers who speak with their Guantanamo clients in the room where the device, which looks like a smoke detector, was hanging. One of the top military lawyers for the Gitmo detention facility said he looked into the matter and found no one was listening in on privileged conversations, The Miami Herald reported. A top U.S. commander, who oversees the detention camp and U.S. military operations in the base in southeast Cuba, confirmed the device is not being used to listen into attorney-client conversations. But a video camera in the units watches the conversations. ""Years ago, that particular facility was used for another purpose, and that purpose required not only audio devices, but visual devices,"" Gen. John Kelly, commander of the U.S. southern command, told a Senate panel. ""It was not used for attorney-client rooms. The mission down there has morphed over time, so the room that they were using for attorney-client discussions still had equipment. But that equipment was not energized, it was not used and I can tell you that without question, we have not violated their rights by listening in,"" Kelly said Wednesday. He said the audio portions of the devices were removed this week, but the video part of the mechanism will remain. ""Some of these men, arguably are dangerous,"" Kelly said in response to a question of why the video cameras would remain. ""And although you would think that their defense attorneys would be safe, I have a responsibility to protect the defense attorneys, as well, as I do the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) that visits and the 5,700 non-DOD people that have visited Guantanamo since the beginning,"" he said. ""They weren't listened to. Yes, the video devices will remain -- temporarily, at least, and the attorneys will understand that,"" he told the Senate panel inquiring about the devices.","The device baffled defense lawyers at Guantanamo .

"(CNN) -- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu checked into a South African hospital Wednesday for treatment of a persistent infection, his foundation announced. Tutu, 81, also will undergo tests at the hospital in Cape Town to determine the cause of the infection, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said. Details of the infection were not released. ""The archbishop spent the morning in his office today before checking into hospital. He was in good spirits and full of praise for the care he receives from an exceptional team of doctors,"" the foundation said. The nonsurgical treatment is expected to take five days, according to the foundation. The Anglican cleric was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end and heal the wounds of apartheid, South Africa's system of institutionalized racial segregation. He served as archbishop of Cape Town -- overseeing the church throughout South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho -- from 1986 until his retirement in 1996. He retired from public life in 2011. Tutu was successfully treated in the United States for prostate cancer in 1997. ""We wish him a speedy recovery and trust that he will soon resume his noble duties in the transformative socio-economic agenda of our country,"" said South Africa's governing African National Congress.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A day after thousands of Israeli demonstrators demanded an end to rules that make ultra-Orthodox Jews exempt from the draft, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the nation's approach to military service must change. ""The existing situation cannot continue. Neither the army, the economy nor society can continue on the current path,"" Netanyahu said at the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting. The prime minister named a new team to draw up a law that would ""share the burden"" of military service, which is required for most Israelis when they reach the age of 18. The existing law provides an exemption for Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews. The issue has been a controversial political topic for months for Netanyahu, but time is running out. Israel's Supreme Court has ruled that the law, which exempts tens of thousands of Israelis from service, must be replaced by August 1. Such a move is sorely needed, according to thousands of protesters who marched on the streets of Tel Aviv Saturday night. Holding banners reading, ""Service for all"" and ""We are not suckers,"" they demanded a universal military draft. More than 20,000 people turned out to protest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Netanyahu acknowledged the demonstration Sunday. ""I completely understand the demand of those who serve and their families,"" he said. Ultra-Orthodox students have been exempt from service through historical political agreements since Israel's establishment in 1948. Community leaders have said ultra-Orthodox men should spend their time studying the Torah at religious institutes rather than defending their country in uniforms. Both ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab Israeli citizens are exempt from military service. They can choose to volunteer or participate in civil service programs within their communities, but the vast majority of both groups do not participate in those programs. The issue is a sensitive one for Netanyahu and his Likud paty, which has traditionally relied on ultra-Orthodox parties as natural coalition partners. But his government has showed some signs of shifting toward the center. In April, Netanyahu beefed up his political dominance when he formed a coalition government with the centrist Kadima faction, bringing the number of his coalition partners to 92 in the 120-seat Knesset. On Sunday, the Likud party approved most of the recommendations of a government committee, which had suggested changing the draft law to include ultra-Orthodox Jews. But the party said in a statement that the principle of service for all should apply to Israel's Arab population as well. Should the Likud go ahead with its reform efforts and force thousands of Yeshiva students to join the Israeli Defense Forces, it could risk losing some of its longstanding partners. A lawmaker from one ultra-Orthodox party criticized Netanyahu Sunday for pushing the changes, and warned that the prime minister's political alliances could be at risk. ""To my regret, Netanyahu does not understand that the demonstrators look to cut off the partnerships between us,"" Moshe Gafni of the Yahadut Hatorah party told Israel's army radio. ""If this will be the case, Netanyahu will lose his power."" But the prime minister told his Cabinet Sunday that keeping the current system was not an option. The previous government committee created to tackle the thorny issue dissolved due to disagreements within its members. A new government team will draft the details of a proposed law that will be more equitable, Netanyahu said. Knesset lawmakers will have the final say. ""We are facing a historic move, a dramatic increase in the participation of the ultra-Orthodox and Arab publics in bearing the burden"" Netanyahu said. ""Such an increase has started, it is welcome, it is important -- but it is not enough. We want to bring about a dramatic increase in the rate of participation."" That means those who don't comply with the country's draft law should be punished, Zohara Berger-Tzur of the Israeli Forum for Equal Service told CNN. ""We demand service for all at the age of 18 and personal sanctions against those who evade duty,"" she said. ""The new draft must comply with these demands."" Gaza truce gets off to a shaky start .

"(CNN) -- With its approximately 480 million adherents, Latin America is home to an overwhelming plurality of the world's Catholics. But no one from this region (or hemisphere, for that matter) has been ever been chosen to lead the church as pope. As the church's cardinals gather in the Sistine Chapel to select a new pontiff, the idea of a Latin American pope rises again. There was talk of a Latin American pope in 2005 -- the last time there was a papal conclave -- but secrecy surrounding the process made it difficult to discern how seriously those candidacies were taken. Live blog: Picking a new pope . Mike Allison, a political science professor at the University of Scranton who researched this question, said he believes there was really no serious candidate from Latin America at the time. This go-round is a different story, he says. A number of cardinals from the region have been suggested as pope candidates, according to Allison, and they include the Brazilians Odilo Pedro Scherer and Joao Braz de Aviz, Argentina's Jorge Mario Bergoglio and Leonardo Sandri, and Honduran Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga. A look at papal contenders . Brazil and Mexico have the two largest Catholic populations in the world, with more than 133 million and 96 million believers, respectively. However, those numbers have been on the decline, while Protestantism and evangelicalism are on the rise. ""I really think that in choosing someone from the global south, there is important symbolism, but also, their life histories are very different"" from previous popes, Allison said. Cardinals from Latin America have seen the tremendous inequalities that exist in their countries firsthand, and many played a role in their nations' transition to democracy, he said. ""It would be an enormous gesture to name a Latin American pope,"" said Virginia Garrard-Burnett, a professor of history and religious studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Precisely because Catholicism is losing ground in the region, a pope from there could be a boost for the faith, she said. Scherer, the archbishop of Sao Paulo, is an especially intriguing possibility, as he is a Vatican insider and of German descent, which ties him to the traditional European papal picks, she said. Even though about 39% of all Catholics live in Latin America, only 17% of the cardinal electors hail from there, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Selecting a pope . Still, the cardinals listed above appear on many of the speculative lists of top contenders for the papacy. ""In terms of trying to prognosticate who the next pope will be, that is a hazardous enterprise,"" said the Rev. John Ford, professor and coordinator of Hispanic/Latino Programs at the Catholic University of America. Still, he says, ""the choice of a pope from the Americas or Africa would be quite appropriate."" The fact that the last two popes, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, were not from Italy showed the ""internationalization"" of the papacy, he said. A pick from the Western hemisphere would extend that reach, he said. As it is, a growing Hispanic population in the United States has led the church to put a greater emphasis on Latino populations, Ford said. ""The selection of a Latin American pope would be particularly welcomed by Latin Americans and Hispanics in the United States,"" he said. Candidates from Latin America, however, are not free from criticism and face challenges. In the region, as elsewhere, sex scandals have rocked the church and raised questions about how the incidents were handled. There is also the lingering criticism that the church was too passive during the repressive dictatorships in the region. A look at some of the names suggested as papal candidates from Latin America: . Odilo Pedro Scherer, Brazil: . At 63, he is one of the youngest candidates. Scherer, the archbishop of Sao Paulo, is known as warm, funny and gregarious. As one of the few cardinals who uses Twitter, he is seen as having a connection to young people, as well. He worked in the all-important Congregation of Bishops from 1994 to 2001. ""So he's both an outsider and an insider. That's a pretty good position heading into this conclave,"" CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said. Joao Braz de Aviz, Brazil: . As a young priest, bullets riddled his chest and face as the young priest was caught in the crossfire of a robbery. He still carried bullet fragments. He entered the seminary at age 11 and rose up the ranks to become the archbishop of Brasilia. ""He is sweet and open and gentle,"" Allen said. ""I think the big question mark about him is precisely because he's such a nice guy: Does he really have the steel and the spine to be able to get his hands around the very complex bureaucracy of the Vatican."" Leonardo Sandri, Argentina: . A veteran diplomat of the Vatican who has served in high-ranking posts, Sandri is considered serious but friendly. He became known as the ""voice of the pope"" when he spoke for Pope John Paul II after the pope lost the ability to speak due to his health. Sandri was the one who announced the pope's death to the world. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, Argentina: . Until last year, Bergoglio was the archbishop of Buenos Aires before stepping down because of his age. He is 76. Bergoglio is considered a straight-shooter who calls things as he sees them, and a follower of the church's most conservative wing. He has clashed with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. Oscar Andres Rodriguez Maradiaga, Honduras: . The Honduran was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II, and his name had been suggested in 2005 as a possible successor to the papacy. He speaks eight languages, holds degrees in theology, clinical psychology and psychiatry, and is a pilot. He is 71 years old. CNN's Shasta Darlington and Jose Manuel Rodriguez and journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","A number of Latin American cardinals have been suggested as pope candidates .

"(CNN) -- John Sheardown, a Canadian immigration officer who helped shelter and smuggle six American diplomats out of Iran in 1980, has died, his son said Monday. He was 88. Sheardown had Alzheimer's and suffered from colon and prostate cancer, said Robin Sheardown, who described his father as his best friend. John Sheardown died Sunday night at a hospital in Ottawa, Canada. ""He was a very humble man and a real Canadian hero,"" his son told CNN. John Sheardown played a key role in what has become known as the ""Canadian Caper,"" a covert operation by the Canadian government and the CIA to rescue six American diplomats who eluded capture during the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The episode was made famous again this year by the release of the hit movie ""Argo,"" loosely based on the real-life drama. The film, however, left out Sheardown's contributions. Sheardown was an immigration officer at the Canadian Embassy in Tehran when students and militants stormed the U.S. Embassy there on November 4, 1979, taking more than 50 Americans hostage. Just half a dozen evaded capture. Sheardown and Ken Taylor, the Canadian ambassador to Iran, hid those six envoys in their homes, protecting them until they could be spirited out of the country with Canadian passports in late January 1980. ""John Sheardown remained a very humble man, always willing to stay in the shadow of others, and the people of Windsor remain extremely proud of his diplomatic intervention and career accomplishments,"" read a proclamation that declared November 10, 2012, ""John Sheardown Day"" in the city of Windsor, in Ontario, Canada. According to that proclamation, Sheardown, a Windsor native, was shot down while serving with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He worked with his country's customs and immigration department before joining Canada's foreign service, it said.

"(CNN) -- The fight against gun-related crime has taken a hit from budget cuts, as a federal agency has laid off nearly a hundred contract workers at its facility dedicated to tracing firearms used by criminals. Ninety-eight contract employees at the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' National Tracing Center lost their jobs as of March 31 because of the forced budget cuts known as the sequester. The Justice Department confirmed the layoffs with CNN and offered a written statement: . ""ATF was forced to cut its budget by $82 million across the board, including its firearms program and, as a result, 98 contractors in its Martinsburg, West Virginia, facility firearms program have been laid off so far."" Those 98 were among 380 contract workers and 185 full-time federal employees at the Martinsburg facility. Neither the agency nor the Justice Department would speak on the record about the layoffs. ""Laying off employees at the National Tracing Center is a big deal,"" said David Chipman, a former ATF special agent who once headed the agency's firearms program. Now, he's policy adviser for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's gun safety group, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. ""Getting information on purchasers to law enforcement as quickly as possible is a critical need."" The firearms bureau hired the contract workers because requests for gun traces kept rising while the bureau's budget for full-time positions did not, Chipman told CNN. When there's a gun-related murder, or when a police officer is shot, the agency's goal is to trace the purchaser or the owner of the gun within 24 hours. ""My understanding is, they will still do whatever possible to meet that deadline, though now it's going to be much harder,"" Chipman said. ""They've had to take resources from other sections to do it."" He said those other sections deal with tracing stolen firearms and keeping records that help police investigate firearms trafficking. ""It's not that things won't be done,"" Chipman said. ""It's just that things won't be done as quickly,"" a potentially major problem because, ""some crimes, time is of the essence."" On top of it, ATF has a labor intensive method of gun tracing. Because of federal laws aimed at preventing a federal gun registry, much of the ATF's record keeping is done by hand, rather than by computer. So the labor cuts hit that much harder.","98 contract employees have been laid off from the National Tracing Center .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia police are still searching for the woman who they say abducted a 5-year-old girl from her elementary school on Monday by posing as the girl's mother, dressed in a Muslim-style head covering. The suspect, who police say may be pregnant and may go by the name ""Rashida,"" took the girl to a nearby house where a male suspect waited. Once inside the home, authorities say, the girl was told to remove her clothing and was given a black T-shirt to wear. She was blindfolded and forced to hide under a bed, they said. She was fed at some point. ""This was an egregious crime, and the community should be outraged,"" Capt. John Darby, commanding officer of special victims, said at a news conference Wednesday. ""This was not a random act as far as we're concerned."" A man on his way to work early Tuesday found the girl wearing only the black T-shirt and crying under a slide at a playground, police said. She has since returned home with her mother, and there are ""no overt"" signs of injury, Darby said. Police are searching door to door in the neighborhood near the school for the two suspects. The ordeal began when the woman wearing a head covering with only her eyes exposed came to Bryant Elementary School shortly after classes started Monday and scribbled her name on a sign-in sheet, police said. She did not show identification but said she was the child's mother and wanted to take her out for breakfast, Darby said. She then proceeded to the child's classroom and asked for the girl by name. Neither parent had given permission for the child to be taken out of school, Darby said, adding that the female suspect ""knew exactly what to do."" The abduction has raised questions about the School District of Philadelphia's protocol. ""It's disturbing that an adult is able to walk into a classroom and have the teacher release the child without knowing who the adult is,"" said Fernando Gallard, a school district spokesman. Policy requires anyone signing out a student to go to the main office and provide identification that matches a list of approved individuals, he said. As he headed to work early Tuesday, sanitation employee Nelson Myers said he heard what he said sounded like a cat meowing before realizing it was an abandoned girl. ""When I got closer, it sounded clear: 'Help, help,'"" Myers said at a news conference Tuesday. ""When I saw her under the slide, I was shocked,"" he said. ""She was there by herself and only had a shirt on."" Myers will receive a $10,000 reward offered by the city, Mayor Michael Nutter announced via Twitter. ""Mayor @Michael_Nutter, full $10,000 reward to Nelson Mandela Myers, who saw (the girl) in an Upper Darby park and did the right thing,"" Mark McDonald, the mayor's spokesman, tweeted Tuesday. ""I am just glad I was there at the right time, because I just wish somebody would do that for my child if my own child was in that situation,"" Myers said. Now, police are hoping the public will help identify the suspects behind the girl's abduction. They are offering two rewards in connection with the case: $5,000 from the Fraternal Order of Police for the arrest of one or both offenders; and $5,000 from the Citizens Crime Commission for the arrest and conviction of one or both offenders, authorities said. Police describe the female suspect as a dark-skinned black woman in her late 20s, 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall with a thin build, and possibly pregnant. Police say the male suspect is a light-skinned male, in his mid-30s, with short brown hair, wearing sweatpants and a blue, long-sleeved t-shirt.","Police are searching for two suspects in child's abduction .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Armed men in trucks with anti-aircraft guns mounted on them surrounded the Libyan Foreign Ministry in Tripoli early Sunday and refused to allow ministry staff to enter the building, a ministry official said. Gunmen diverted traffic away from the ministry in central Tripoli as they continued the siege through the day. In a news conference at the scene, protesters said they had a list of demands. Their main goal was to push the General National Congress to pass a proposed law that would ban Gadhafi-era officials from holding government posts. The political isolation law proposal has been a matter of contention among lawmakers for several months because it could push current senior officials out of office for serving under the former regime. The protesters said they chose the foreign ministry because it employs officials who continue to serve after the 2011 revolution that overthrew Moammar Gadhafi. Another one of their demands is to ""cleanse"" the Foreign Ministry of former regime elements. A foreign ministry official, who refused to be named for security reasons, said that no violence erupted during the siege, but ministry staff felt intimidated and threatened by the armed show of force. Witnesses reported seeing more than a dozen gun trucks on roads leading to the ministry. Watchdog groups have been calling on Libyan authorities to rein in armed groups that they say continue to pose a threat to the country's future. ""Unlawful armed groups that show up with heavy weapons and block access to government institutions demanding grievance, crosses the line of peaceful protest; it is intimidating and threatening and there should be accountability for these actions"" Hanan Salah, the Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch told CNN on Sunday. In recent months, similar incidents have taken place in the capital, with some Libyans resorting to armed protests. In some cases protesters surrounded government offices, and sessions of the country's legislature have been interrupted by armed groups who would storm their meetings. Last month armed protesters besieged members of the General National Congress for several hours in an attempt to force them to pass the political isolation law. Gunmen later opened fire on the vehicle of the parliament speaker, who escaped unharmed. Eighteen months after the fall of the regime, Libya remains awash in weapons and militias that the government has been struggling to control to secure the country.

"(CNN) -- The $1 billion patent dispute between Apple and Samsung picked back up in federal court in San Jose on Thursday, with both sides arguing over issues of damages amounts, bans on product sales and allegations of dishonesty on the part of the jury foreman. In August, a nine-person jury awarded Apple just more than $1 billion in damages from Samsung after three weeks of complicated and technical testimony. The jurors found that Samsung copied the iPhone and iPad designs for its own smartphone and tablet models, and calculated the damages amount using 109 pages of jury instructions and a 20-page verdict form. Now Apple is pushing to increase the amount of damages it was awarded by several hundred million dollars, and to ban Samsung from selling certain products that infringe on Apple patents. Samsung is fighting to chip away at the enormous settlement amount or to have it thrown out. As part of its strategy, the South Korean company is asking for a new trial, alleging that the foreman of the jury was willfully dishonest by not divulging he was sued by his former employer in 1993, a company in which Samsung had invested. Judge Lucy Koh didn't make any rulings on the various post-trial motions on Thursday, but said she plans to issue the orders separately over the next month. A protracted legal battle after a jury verdict is not unusual in a case this large and complicated, and was expected by legal experts. ""It shows that there is a careful process; the judge does get to review what the jury has done,"" says law professor Jay P. Kesan of the University of Illinois. Each side is armed with impressive and expensive legal teams that are also fighting smaller battles in other countries. While those legal costs are likely astronomical, they are dwarfed by what's at stake: a global smartphone market that is expected to be worth $150 billion by 2014. Currently, only 50% of mobile phones in the world are smartphones, which means there's a huge untapped market of potential smartphone customers. The judge urged both sides to reach a settlement, claiming it was best for consumers, the industry and both parties. ""I think it's time for global peace,"" she said. However, a settlement still looks unlikely at this point -- both parties were made to meet before the trial began to discuss a settlement but nothing came of it. In court on Thursday, Samsung indicated it was willing to reach an agreement, saying the ball was in Apple's court. Apple, however, wanted more. It said the awarded damages, which are for past infringements, are not enough to discourage Samsung from copying Apple patents in future smartphones and tablets. ""The key issue is whether there's going to be a permanent injunction. That's probably the hardest thing for Apple to get,"" said Kesan. He said the chance of a retrial was also very remote.","Apple was awarded $1 billion in damages for patent infringement by Samsung in August .

"(CNN) -- An overwhelming vote by residents of the Falkland Islands to remain under British rule didn't quell claims from Argentina on Tuesday. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called this week's two-day referendum a ""parody"" and maintained that the territory, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas, rightfully belongs to her country. ""It is as if a consortium of occupiers had voted on whether to continue illegally occupying a building,"" she said at an event in Buenos Aires. ""The results were fixed."" Asked whether they wanted to remain a British Overseas Territory, more than 99% of voters who cast ballots said yes, according to a Falkland Islands government spokesman. Just three people voted no, spokesman Darren Christie said. Pictures at the polls showed some residents of the islands draped in Union flags as they cast their votes. Cars displayed banners that read, ""We're British and proud."" A parade honoring British heritage marked the start of voting Sunday. The vote drew praise from British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""It's the clearest possible result there could be,"" he said, ""and the fact is that the Falkland Islands may be thousands of miles away, but they are British through and through, and that is how they want to stay."" Argentina should respect the will of the islanders, he said, adding that the United Kingdom ""will always be there to defend them."" Before the results were announced, one lawmaker from the islands criticized Argentina for arguing that the vote was illegitimate. ""I believe we are like other people in the world, and we are entitled to determine our own future. ... I think it's dreadful that someone like Argentina should be trying to deny us that,"" Sharon Halford, a member of the Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly, told CNN. ""They obviously don't care what their own people think, but worldwide, everybody has the right to determine their own future, and why should we not be the same?"" Argentina's top diplomat in the United Kingdom, meanwhile, maintained her government's position that the referendum did nothing to settle the issue. ""The British inhabitants of the Malvinas Islands unquestionably enjoy civil and political rights,"" Argentinian Ambassador Alicia Castro said in a statement Tuesday. ""But they do not have the right to decide the sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom."" Renewed tensions . The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain says its civil and military losses amounted to 255. For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, with both sides accusing each other of colonialism. What lies behind renewed tensions over Falkland Islands? Prince William's military deployment to the islands last year further fueled tensions, drawing sharp criticism from Argentinian officials. In January, Fernandez wrote an open letter, published in the British press, calling on Britain to hand back the islands and accusing it of blatant colonialism. She cited a 1965 U.N. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the British to abide by the resolution. The British government accuses Argentina of trying to coerce island residents by intimidating those involved in fishing and oil exploration and trying to isolate the remote islands by limiting access by sea. British officials have rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British and ""have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N. charter."" ""There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend,"" the British Foreign Office said. ""The islanders can't just be written out of history."" Residents react . Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources, including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry. The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories and have been under British rule since 1833. More than 2,500 people from more than 60 nations live and work there, according to the government website, as well as forces stationed at the British military's Mount Pleasant Complex. Many Falkland Island residents are of British origin. About 1,600 voters from the Falkland Islands were eligible to vote in the referendum, officials said. Turnout was 92%. Before results were announced, Halford said she didn't think the vote would put an end to Argentina's renewed bid for control of the islands. ""They've been saying for ages that they have no intention of recognizing it, whatever the outcome, which I find interesting because they've been going to horrendous lengths around the world to try and discredit it,"" Halford said. For Argentina, she said, the islands are a ""political football"" used to distract citizens from problems at home. On its official website, the Falklands government rejects as false the Argentinian government claim that a civilian population was expelled by Britain in 1833 and argues for the inhabitants' right to choose their path. ""We are not an implanted population,"" the government says. ""Our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly 200 years. ... We are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of South America whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from Europe -- we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration."" The islands are economically self-sufficient, the government says, except for the cost of defense needed as a result of ""the claim made by an aggressive neighbour.""

"(Mashable) -- HTC has launched a new flagship Android smartphone, the HTC One X, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. The majority of mobile giants had their announcements before the actual start of the MWC -- including Samsung, LG and Sony. HTC had the last, and perhaps the most glamorous event of the day, held in a huge rounded dome at the top of the CÃºpula las Arenas next to Fira de Barcelona, where the main conference is held. The HTC One X (the first in a new line of devices called simply HTC One), unveiled by the company CEO Peter Chou, is a 4.7-inch, quad core Tegra 3-powered beast in a polycarbonate white shell. The device also brings a vastly improved camera experience, called Image Sense. The camera takes photos quickly -- in 0.7 seconds. It has 8 megapixels and uses an f/2.0 lens, which captures more light than any other HTC smartphone camera. It also takes great photos in unfavorable light conditions, thanks to the device's HDR algorithm. An on-screen comparison with the photos taken with an HTC One X and an iPhone 4S portrays HTC's device as a clear winner, but we're sure Apple will have a word or two to say about that. HTC is bundling a bunch of extras with the device: 25 GB of free Dropbox-powered storage, Beats Audio sound (HTC acquired Beats Audio in August 2011) and a feature called Media Link, which takes your photos and videos from the smartphone to the TV (through a special gadget that connects to any TV) with a three-finger swipe on the smartphone's screen. The company also launched two other HTC One devices with slightly lower specs -- the HTC One S and the HTC One V. All three devices should be hitting the market in the next two months, likely in April. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Venezeula has decided not to embalm the body of its late president, Hugo Chavez, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said on Friday in a Twitter message. The initial plan was to have Chavez's embalmed body displayed much like the remains of former revolutionary leaders Vladimir Lenin of Russia and China's Mao Zedong. But the embalming was ruled out, Villegas said, after a report from a Russian medical panel. ""The Russian medical commission established that in order to do the procedure, the body would have to be transported to Russia and remain there for seven to eight months,"" he said. Scientists in a preliminary assessment have determined that the process might be ""quite difficult,"" acting President Nicolas Maduro said Wednesday. Scientists will study possible Chavez poisoning . He said at the opening of the Book Fair of Venezuela that scientists argued that ""the decision should have been taken much earlier."" Chavez died this month, at 58, after a battle with cancer.

"(CNN) -- International leaders are responding to an uprising of Islamist militants in northern Mali, hoping to inject stability in a country once hailed as a model for democracy in Africa. Following a coup last year, militants destroyed ancient shrines, once a major draw for Islamic scholars from around the world. They also banned music. Read more: France vows to halt jihadist charge in Mali . Reports of human rights abuses soared, including the public stoning death of a couple accused of having an affair. The U.N. Security Council last month authorized a peacekeeping mission. This week, French troops joined the fight against militants in its former colony, which was under a state of emergency Friday. Read more: Malian rebels vow to 'open gates of hell' as U.S. weighs policy options . The urgency for international intervention came after Islamists seized Konna on Thursday, a frontier town that was the de facto line of government control. A day later, the government said it recaptured the town. What's the story behind the instability? Mali gained independence from France in 1960. The landlocked West African nation went through growing pains after independence, including droughts, rebellions and years of military dictatorship. Read more: Rebels still hold key town in Mali, French defense minister says . It held its first democratic elections in 1992, and had a strong democracy for the most part. That was until March, when a group of soldiers toppled the government, undermining the nation's growing economy and relative social stability. Read more: Renegade Mali soldiers walk through ravaged presidential palace after coup . What led to the coup? A group of outraged soldiers accused the government of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. In March last year, a riot erupted at a military camp a few miles from the presidential palace in the capital of Bamako. Disgruntled soldiers marched to the palace. Read more: Mali protesters storm palace, beat interim president . A few hours later, a soldier appeared on state television and said the military was in control of the nation. The president was nowhere to be found. The Tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum and seized some parts of the north. They have always wanted independence, and have staged several rebellions since the 1960s. After Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was killed in 2011 and Libya was plunged into chaos, his weapons became available. The Tuareg -- many of whom fought for him -- seized them and took up arms against the Malian government. How did the north end up in the hands of Islamist militants? After Tuareg rebels seized it, a power struggle erupted with local Islamist radicals. The Islamist extremists toppled the tribe and seized control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Various factions of al Qaeda-linked militants are reportedly in the area, including Ansar Dine. Read more: Is this al Qaeda's 'last chance' for a country? The international community has voiced concerns about al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and its expanding presence in Mali. U.S. officials have said that the wing, the al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, is linked to the deadly Benghazi attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. The region needs a well-funded operation led by Africans to have a good chance of pushing out the al Qaeda extremist movement growing in northern and western Africa, according to Gen. Carter Ham, the top American military commander in Africa. Last month, the U.N. Security Council authorized a one-year military peacekeeping mission in Mali. The African-led International Support Mission in Mali aims to help rebuild the nation's forces and recover the areas in the north. Tuareg rebels have vowed to fight back against the Islamists. The Tuareg want their own country in the north, which they call Azawad. And as the world seeks a solution, Islamist militants are busy applying their strict interpretation of sharia law. What are some of the human rights concerns in Mali? Islamists controlling most of the north have imposed a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. ""We don't have to answer to anyone over the application of sharia,"" Islamist commissioner Aliou Toure said last year. Locals are not receptive to the extreme interpretations; they practice a much more relaxed form of Islam. Some have taken to the streets in protest. As part of their new laws, radical groups banned music, a major setback for a country known for ""Festival au Desert,"" where acts like Robert Plant and Bono have performed. They've also said no to smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. At least four times in 2012, the militants have destroyed Timbuktu's historic tombs and shrines, claiming the relics are idolatrous. The picturesque city was once an important destination for Islamic scholars for its ancient and prominent burial sites. Public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhumane punishments are becoming common, the United Nations says. CNN's Phil Gast and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","French forces are helping Malian troops battle Islamist rebels .

"(CNN) -- It's just over a week until one of the biggest geek gatherings of the year, South By Southwest Interactive, kicks off in Austin, Texas. SXSW is where fledgling tech companies sink or swim. Twitter and Foursquare caught on in part thanks to massive buzz at SXSW, while thousands of other new companies dreamed the ""Southby"" dream but went nowhere. So which new technologies might we expect to see breaking out at SXSW 2012? Applications set to go mainstream . The iPad 3, which will be announced by Apple two days before SXSW Interactive kicks off, will be a big topic in Austin. Developers at the festival will no doubt be rushing to update their applications to work with what is expected to be a higher resolution screen on the device. A handful of emerging companies also will continue to gain momentum: The mobile journal Path has achieved some success with the early adopter crowd after its latest update, while the social nature of photo-sharing app Instagram is bound to make it a favorite at SXSW. Pinterest, the fast-growing darling of the online-scrapbooking set, also will be in Austin. New startups . My bet for the breakout trend at this year's SXSW is ""ambient social networking."" While the last crop of mobile apps involved ""checking in"" to venues to find friends, many smartphones are now able to continually discover your location and broadcast it. Once you log in with Facebook, Foursquare and other existing social networks, new mobile applications can alert you when a friend, or even a friend of a friend, is in the vicinity. Some even tell you when people nearby share your interests. Which app names might you be hearing if this trend takes off? Perhaps Sonar, which analyzes your Foursquare, Facebook and Twitter networks to see if any friends -- or friends of friends -- are nearby. Or Glancee, which alerts you when people with similar interests are, say, in the bar next door. Ban.jo alerts you about friends you didn't know were nearby, while Highlig.ht lets you see when your Facebook contacts are around. Tech enthusiast Robert Scoble predicts Highlig.ht will be ""the hot app at SXSW this year."" Oversharing . The potential problem should be obvious: Privacy. This new generation of apps broadcasts your location at all times to friends -- and in many cases to people you don't even know. The physical distance at which alerts are sent varies, but some app developers propose that being in the same city as a contact would be enough to trigger a message. And unlike the previous generations of applications that required you to check in to a venue, these apps are persistent unless you pause them or turn them off. The potential for both hilarity and calamity is clear. So the real question is: How comfortable are early adopters with ambient social networking? And if they enjoy the experience, will mainstream users catch on fast -- or will privacy concerns scare them away? At SXSW 2012, we hope to find out.","Cashmore: Breakout trend at SXSW this month may be ""ambient social networking""

"(CNN) -- Best Buy wants to know if you'd pay $1,499 for a 42-inch, high-definition Apple TV which uses your iPad or iPhone as a remote control. You know ... hypothetically. The big-box gadget retailer sent a survey to some customers asking in fairly explicit detail about the long-rumored TV system -- under language that says ""Apple finally reinvents what a TV can do."" The survey, first acquired by tech site The Verge, calls the system a ""concept."" But it goes into explicit detail describing it. The question describes a 1080p LED flat-panel screen and access to Apple's iCloud service, iTunes, Netflix, YouTube and Flickr. Intriguingly, it also describes a built-in iSight camera and microphone for using Skype video calling. An Apple spokeswoman said the company has no comment about the survey and referred questions to Best Buy. In a statement to Wired (a CNN content partner), Best Buy said the survey just asked a hypothetical question to gauge interest in possible future products. ""The customer survey was a routine offer effectiveness survey conducted by one of Best Buy's research partners,"" the statement said. ""Any brand reference was hypothetical. The survey is no longer available."" Industry analysts almost unanimously expect Apple to enter the television market in the near future. In ""Steve Jobs,"" a biography of the late Apple co-founder, author Walter Isaacson writes that Jobs told him he'd finally figured out a way to make a TV practical. He said it would wirelessly synch with other Apple devices . Since 2007, the company has made a product called Apple TV, a set-top Web-streaming box that competes with rival Google TV and independent offerings like Roku and Boxee. But compared to hits like the iPhone and iPad, it has largely underperformed, leading Jobs to say in 2010 that Apple TV has ""never been a huge hit."" But a full-on TV set, integrated with Apple's other platforms and products, would be another thing entirely. The presumably mythical TV in the Best Buy survey would use Apple's mobile operating system (iOS), which is also used by its current Apple TV system. It would also be able to download apps from the app store. ""Can you imagine playing 'Angry Birds' on a big screen in your living room?"" text in the survey reads. Hypothetically, of course.","Specs for Apple HDTV published in Best Buy survey .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- The makers of Gorilla Glass, the glass that's used in touchscreen gadgets such as iPhones, iPads and more than 500 other models of electronic gadgets, has officially unveiled a thinner and more touch-sensitive version of their product. When it comes to innovation in electronic gadgets, a new kind of glass is not especially sexy. But when that glass is built into millions of touchscreen devices, and could potentially make them thinner, lighter and more responsive to your finger, consumers may take notice. Corning Inc. says Gorilla Glass 2 is thinner and more touch-sensitive without sacrificing toughness or resistance to scratches. The company showed off the glass Monday at a gadget-showcase event at the International Consumer Electronics Show here and is showing live demos of its enhanced qualities at the Corning booth throughout the four-day show. The new glass is not any less resistant to breakage than the current Gorilla Glass, which may be disappointing news to anyone who has had to put up with a cracked screen after dropping a phone. ""It's not scratch-proof. And if they drop it on granite, it can be broken,"" said Corning general manager Clifford Hund. But he added that Corning has managed to make the glass 20% thinner but just as strong -- a key advancement at a time when smartphone and tablet makers are trying to produce ever-thinner devices. The second generation of Gorilla Glass will debut in Windows-based PCs this year. Other manufacturers also are weighing how and when to add the glass to their upcoming devices, Hund said. Because it's thinner -- about 0.8 millimeters instead of 1 millimeter -- the glass allows users' fingers to be closer to the touch interface, creating a screen that responds more quickly and accurately, said Gorilla Glass program director Jaymin Amin. The glass also has been engineered to let more light through, creating a brighter display screen, Corning executives said. Due to customer nondisclosure agreements, Corning cannot name all the devices that use Gorilla Glass -- including Apple products. But according to multiple other sources, including Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, the product's first consumer application was the original iPhone in 2007. A passage from Isaacson's book details how Apple had originally planned to use plastic display coverings for its iPhone before Jobs approached Corning CEO Wendell Weeks about ordering glass instead. Weeks told him Corning had developed a tough form of glass, made extra strong by a chemical process, but couldn't find a market for it. Weeks didn't think Corning could manufacture the glass fast enough to meet Apple's timetable for the iPhone launch. But at the prodding of Jobs, who wouldn't take no for an answer, Corning did it in six months. After the iPhone hit the market, Jobs sent Weeks a note that said, ""We couldn't have done it without you."" Gorilla Glass also is part of touchscreens in electronic devices by Acer, Asus, Dell, HTC, LG, Motorola, Nokia, Samsung and Sony, among other manufacturers. Amin demonstrated its toughness Monday by placing a small square of the original glass in a lever press, then applying more than 100 pounds of pressure onto it. Despite looking like he was truly exerting himself, he couldn't break it. Amin then tested the new glass the same way and got the same result.","Corning unveils a new, thinner form of its popular Gorilla Glass at CES .

"Washington (CNN) -- Parents are finding it more difficult to keep their children's private personal data from being collected by mobile phone apps, according to a new report. The Federal Trade Commission is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps. It's the second time this year the agency has looked at the issue. Since the first report in February, the FTC said it found that almost nothing has been done by developers or phone companies to improve transparency. Only 16% of apps provided parents with a link to a privacy policy or other disclosure before an app is downloaded, the first survey found. In the follow-up, researchers found similar results, with 20 percent of the apps linking to general disclosure information or a privacy policy, the report said. ""Even more troubling, the results showed that many of the apps shared certain information with third parties -- such as device ID, geolocation, or phone number -- without disclosing that fact to parents,"" the FTC said. By using the information collected through mobile devices, companies could potentially develop detailed profiles about children without a parent's knowledge or consent, the FTC said. ""Our study shows that kids' apps siphon an alarming amount of information from mobile devices without disclosing this fact to parents,"" said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz in a statement released with Monday's report. Through apps, kids can make purchases right from the device. The FTC said parents have reported their children racking up hundreds of dollars in charges they weren't aware of until the bill arrived. ""Parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities,"" the FTC report said. A recent phenomenon of the digital age, apps -- or applications -- are programs that mobile phones users can purchase and install on their devices. Apps can include everything from games to medical monitoring software. The market for mobile apps continues to grow at an explosive rate. As of September, there were more than 700,000 apps available in Apple's App Store, a 40 percent increase since December 2011, and more than 700,000 apps available in Google Play, an 80 percent increase since the beginning of 2012, the FTC said. An investigation is planned to determine whether some mobile app developers are violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act or are engaging in unfair or deceptive business practices, the FTC said. The agency urged developers and marketers to work together and develop accurate privacy disclosures regarding what data is collected through apps used by kids.","Smartphone apps can expose children's data, Federal Trade Commission says .

"(CNN) -- The removal of 500px from Apple's App Store raises questions over review equity, fairness and API functionality. When Evgeny Tchebotarev started the day, he wasn't expecting to end up spending so much time fielding calls from the media. Tchebotarev is the COO and co-founder of 500px, a popular photo site and community for professional and amateur photographers. Yet that's exactly what happened after Apple removed the 500px app from the App Store. After more than 16 months in the App Store and over 1 million downloads, a routine app update had unintended consequences. On Monday night, Tchebotarev tells Mashable that he received a call from Apple. There was a problem with 500px. Like many other apps with photo communities, including Tumblr and Flickr, some of the photographers who use 500px use it to take photographs that contain nudity â€” not pornographic images, but nudity nonetheless. According to Tchebotarev, Apple reps told him that it was too easy for users to find nude photos using the app. As a result, the app was in violation of Apple's content policy and would be removed from the App Store. Tchebotarev offered to make the necessary changes to the app to comply with Apple's rules, but it was too late. As of Tuesday morning, 500px was gone from the App Store. A few hours later, TechCrunch reported on the story. Other outlets followed, including CNET, MacRumors and The Verge. Soon, the story was viral. The general reaction from both 500px employees and app users was disbelief. For one thing, 500px actually makes it difficult for new users to browse or search for nude photos. A user who signs up using the app can't see those types of photos; instead, he or she must log in through their desktop, and turn off a safe-search setting. For another, 500px is hardly the only app that could potentially expose users to nude images. Web browsers â€” including Apple's Safari â€” can display nude photos of all types. Plus, the aforementioned Tumblr and Flickr apps are much easier to use to track down nudes. To add insult to injury, while 500px is gone, a dozen apps that use 500px's API and replicate the functionality of the official app are still available. Then, Apple released its own statement on the matter. It said: . ""The app was removed from the App Store for featuring pornographic images and material, a clear violation of our guidelines. We also received customer complaints about possible child pornography. We've asked the developer to put safeguards in place to prevent pornographic images and material in their app."" This statement was confusing to Tchebotarev and other 500px execs because it was the first any of them had heard about complaints regarding ""possible child pornography."" Apple never mentioned that to the company before pulling the app, Tchebotarev said. He added that 500px has made the necessary changes to its app, and re-submitted to the App Store. With any luck, the app will be back in the store very soon. Normally, this is where the news story would end. But what the 500px incident showcases, however, is that although more than four years have passed since the App Store opened, Apple's app-review process is still occasionally hampered by incongruities and unclear policies. App Rating Fairness . My initial guess was that 500px was removed for not having the correct content rating. Apple assigns content ratings to apps to give users an idea of who the app is suitable for. A rating of 4+ means that there is no objectionable content in the app; a 9+ means there might be cartoon violence; a 12+ means there may be infrequent or mild sexual content/nudity and mild violence; and a 17+ means the app may contain heavy violence and mature themes. These content ratings can be arbitrary at best. Tumblr has a rating of 4+ despite the fact that it's very easy to find hardcore pornographic images using the tag search function within the app. Third-party web browsers such as Chrome and iCab have 17+ ratings because they can be used to access any site on the Internet (assuming it doesn't use Flash). Before Monday's incident, 500px had a content rating of 4+. Tchebotarev told me that the copy of the app in the submission queue has a rating of 12+. Based on feedback he's heard from other developers, Tchebotarev's theory is that Apple's review team (a team that is notoriously overworked) doesn't always check to ensure that apps have the proper content rating. Instead, it takes a series of complaints or a particularly conscientious review-team member to force an app to change its rating. This makes sense to me. Still, I'm utterly unsure how Tumblr, of all apps, has managed to avoid even a 12+ rating. What About APIs? Another issue raised with the 500px case is the role of an API within the app-review process. Apple initially said it was going to pull Pulpfingers' ISO500 app from the App Store. 500px acquired Pulpfingers (and ISO500, by extension) last month. As of this writing, ISO500 is still in the App Store, and doesn't appear to have been pulled. It wasn't clear why ISO500 was going to be removed, but some pundits worried that it was because the app uses 500px's API. The API allows read-access to the site and search, including, presumably, access to nude photos. This opens up an interesting question when it comes to third-party apps that use 500px's API, such as Flipboard. Flipboard can do virtually everything the official 500px and the ISO500 apps can do (at least, as far as displaying content), so would it be at risk? Right now, that seems unlikely, but it does raise some interesting questions that few of us have considered over the years: Is an app that plugs into another app's API going to be rated based on the functionality of that API? It's unclear. Waiting For a Resolution . At the time of this writing, 500px is still missing from the App Store. While I fully expect the app to appear within the next day or two, I can't help but feel empathy for the startup caught in the middle of this. What do you think of the latest App Store hijinx?

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Mobile technology is no longer limited to laptops, smartphones and tablets. It's seeping into every corner of our lives, including television and movies, cars, the workplace, health care, education and eventually our bodies. This expansion of mobile, and its next generation of highly mobile tech users, were the subject of Monday's Consumer Electronics Show keynote. Delivered by chip maker Qualcomm's chief executive Paul Jacobs, the talk marked the official kickoff of the show, which opens its doors Tuesday morning. The CES keynote address was previously handled by Microsoft, a company whose products are instantly familiar to consumers around the world. Successor Qualcomm isn't a household name, even though it says it has shipped 11 billion chips in its 27 years and its mobile processors power the mobile devices you use everyday. The challenge for Qualcomm on Monday was to illustrate how its technology is relevant to regular consumers. The resulting talk was as scattered and entertaining as its rooster of special guest stars, which included ""Sesame Street's"" Big Bird, Archbishop Desmond Tutu (via video), filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, NASCAR driver Brad Keselowski, ""Star Trek"" actress Alice Eve and pop band Maroon 5. But the biggest guest star for this tech audience may have been Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who ran out on stage to giddily show off three new Windows 8 products. 5 fun and odd gadgets from CES . The event kicked off with a skit featuring young actors playing stereotypes of the most annoying people you've ever been stuck behind in a Starbucks line. An OMG-spouting popular girl, a gamer geek who talks like a surfer and a Silicon Valley wannabe entrepreneur. What tied these characters together was the theme of the event: they were all ""born mobile."" The primarily mobile phenomenon is international. According to Jacobs, 84% of people worldwide say they can't go a day without their mobile device. The smartphone interface is so commonplace, people now want it on their other devices. The Android mobile operating system is already expanding beyond smartphones and tablets to smart TVs, cameras and Google's Project Glass smart glasses. Qualcomm's chips have an even broader reach, appearing in smart TVs, game consoles, home automation devices and even cars. During its keynote Qualcomm showed how its technology can be used to enable wireless charging for electric vehicles. The tech industry assumes that eventually, everything will be connected to the Internet, with cars, household appliances and mobile devices all communicating with each other. The concept, called the ""Internet of Things,"" has been kicking around for many years, but a recent boom in low-cost sensors and popular gadgets like the Nest smart thermostat have led to more gadgets that successfully add Web connectivity. For example, wearable health monitors could be used to notify you or your doctor as soon as something is wrong with your vital signs. Trends to watch at CES . ""It's really going to empower us by giving us more information about ourselves and our environment,"" said Jacobs, who said most people look at their phones 150 times a day. Even in the present, mobile phones are changing people's lives and behaviors. In developing countries, where a phone is many people's first and only device, phones are being used to deliver basic heath care. Augmented reality apps, like those powered by Qualcomm's Vuforia platform, are being used to help children learn to read. Qualcomm also used the keynote to announce two new processors, the Snapdragon 600 and 800. Most people who will benefit from the faster, more energy-efficient chips probably won't know their names. But with this keynote, Qualcomm hopes to make a name for itself as a innovative company powering the mobile tech of the future.","Chip-maker Qualcomm kicked off the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show with a keynote .

"(CNN) -- The slow process of updating the rules that dictate when and if you can use electronic devices on airplanes is inching along, with one major agency urging more freedom to use tablets, e-readers and other gadgets. In August, the FAA announced plans for a working group that would study the issue of portable electronics on flights and then make suggestions for changes. Now that committee is starting to come together. On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission sent a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration, officially announcing who will represent the FCC in the working group. The letter also included words of support for the initiative. The letter was first obtained by The Hill blog. ""I write to urge the FAA to enable greater use of tablets, e-readers, and other portable electronic devices during flight, consistent with public safety,"" FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said in the letter. The working group will also include representatives from the electronics industry, pilots and flight attendant groups, plane manufacturers and other government agencies. Once established, the representatives will meet for six months and eventually give suggestions to the FAA about what devices are safe to use onboard and when they can be used. The group will not discuss cell phone use in the air, which is banned by the FCC because of the potential for interference with wireless networks on the ground. The other rules for gadget use on planes are established by the FAA, including a ban against the use of personal electronics during takeoff and landing, when the plane is below 10,000 feet. Electronic health devices such as hearing aids and pacemakers are allowed at all times. The FAA regulations can be frustrating to passengers, but they are in place to prevent interference with planes' communication and navigation systems. While there hasn't been any conclusive proof that devices such as tablets and e-readers are a danger, a study last year found 75 instances of interference that may have been related to personal electronic devices. While Thursday's FCC letter doesn't reveal anything new about the process, the reaction in the news and on social networks is telling. People are eager for the FAA and airlines to catch up with the latest technology. They want to read their Kindles during take-off, listen to soothing music on smartphones in airplane mode during turbulence and silence fussy children with cartoons on 7-inch tablets.","The FAA is assembling a group of experts to update rules for electronics on planes .

"(CNN) -- Is Google in a hurry to get 2012 over with? Probably not. But that didn't stop the snarky headlines after it was discovered that a buggy app in the new version of Google's mobile operating system omits the month of December. The People app lets users bookmark friends' birthdays and other important dates on a calendar. But some users of Android 4.2, the system's newest update, are complaining they can't note December dates in the app because its calendar skips from November to January. December simply does not exist. The Internet's reaction was swift. ""Is Google the new Grinch who stole Christmas?"" posed CNET, a tech-news site. ""Sure, the month of December can be expensive and stressful, but Google apparently has an app for avoiding it."" Added Business Insider, ""The new version of Android thinks there are only 11 months in a year."" And Engadget said the Android bug ""makes end-of-year birthdays even less bearable."" Google posted a statement Tuesday on the Android page of Google+, its social network, vowing to fix the problem. It said: . ""We discovered a bug in the Android 4.2 update, which makes it impossible to enter December events in optional fields of the People app (this bug did not affect Calendar). Rest assured, this will be fixed soon so that those of you with December birthdays and anniversaries won't be forgotten by your friends and family."" Android 4.2 is found on a handful of devices, including Google's Galaxy Nexus phone and Nexus 7 tablet. The bug does not affect the Calendar app in Android 4.2 -- nicknamed Jelly Bean -- where December is still alive and well. So maybe Google isn't worried about that Mayan apocalypse after all.","A buggy app in Google's new mobile operating system omits the month of December .

"(CNN) -- Maybe a phone's not big enough for you and your spouse to cuddle up with on the sofa. Or single folks need to travel light when they're on the prowl. Whatever the reasons, a new survey suggests that married couples are more likely to own a tablet, while smartphones are more popular with unhitched folks. The Search Agency, a digital marketing company, recently released its 2012 Online User Behavior and Engagement Study (PDF), created with the help of market research firm Harris Interactive. In it, 49% of single respondents said they own a smartphone, compared with only 43% of married people. Meanwhile, 45% of people who have said ""I do"" reported owning a tablet, compared with 36% of singles. Search Agency Vice President Mike Solomon said that differences in the ages of single and married respondents may have played a bigger role than specific habits. ""For many of the findings, percentages zigzagged between age groups, rather than plotting a consistent bell curve -- indicating how factors such as generational differences, disposable income, and the influence of children on their parents impact results,"" Solomon said in a written statement. ""Married people are often older, have more disposable income and can more easily justify superfluous pieces of technology, such as tablets. At the same time, baby boomers are often more tech-literate than their slightly younger counterparts -- likely because their millennial children are pushing them to use new tools and devices."" The survey of 2,006 U.S. adults was conducted online between August 14 and 16. It provides some other interesting glimpses into what could be called the mobile revolution that has taken over the computing world. For example, 59% of smartphone owners said they had launched a Web search on their mobile phones when they were sitting within arm's reach of a desktop or laptop -- a number that jumps to 74% for younger users, age 18-34. And 66% of tablet owners said they've quickly jumped onto their iPad, Kindle Fire, Nexus 7 or other gadget to get more information about products they see on TV.","Survey: Singles are more likely to own smartphones, couples to have tablets .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Mobile phone giant Nokia on Monday unveiled a phone with a powerful 41 Megapixel camera as it attempts to reposition itself back at the forefront of the mobile market. The phone is among a dazzling array of new gadgets unveiled so far at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, an annual event that showcases the industry's latest innovations. Read more: 'Must-have gadgets' at world's biggest mobile show . Among them is a Chinese phone that claims to be the world's fastest and another that carries an in-built projector. The unrivaled camera capabilities of Nokia's 808 PureView, which runs the company's Symbian operating system, caused ripples of surprise among Congress delegates who predicted few surprises thanks to pre-event leaks and rumors. The 41 Megapixels put the phone in the same league -- in terms of photo resolution -- as professional cameras costing thousands of dollars. Reportedly priced at â‚¬450 ($600), the device is due to be released in May, with the camera technology likely to be carried over to other Nokia phones. Nokia, which in recent years has seen its dominance of the global mobile market eroded by manufacturers such as Apple and BlackBerry, also launched a lower-cost version of its flagship Lumia phone range. The Nokia 610, priced at â‚¬189, runs on the mobile version of Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system. On Sunday, Chinese mobile maker Huawei made headlines with what it claims is the world's fastest smartphone. The Ascend D quad features much-vaunted quad core technology -- twice the processing power of most new devices -- and runs Ice Cream Sandwich, the latest version of the Google-linked Android operating system. Read more: Jargon-busting mobile industry's buzzwords . It is expected to be released in China in coming months, but no dates for a roll out beyond Asia have been announced. Other hot gadget announcements include phones by Taiwanese manufacturer HTC. Its One X, One S and One V devices feature 4.3 inch screens made of toughened Gorilla glass and eight Megapixel cameras. Another surprise -- chiefly because the technology has proved unpopular in the past -- came in the shape of the Samsung Galaxy Beam, a phone featuring a built-in projector. The Android-powered device allows users to beam 50-inch wide video and photo images onto walls. Industry reviewers said the gadget appeared to work well during demonstrations in a darkened room. The as yet unpriced Galaxy Beam is expected to be in shops in the next few months. Barry Neild contributed to this story from London.","Nokia unveils smartphone featuring powerful 41 Megapixel camera .

"(CNN) -- Yes, critics of the sometimes disposable nature of today's tech world, it's come to this. You can now eat your iPhone case. The price of a crunchy treat that also (theoretically) protects your most precious of mobile gadgets? $81. Made from brown rice and salt, the Survival Senbei Rice Cracker iPhone 5 Case ""is literally part food, part phone case ... and great in an emergency when you are desperate for a snack."" Oh, and about that theoretical protection: ""Please be aware that due to its delicate nature, this case may become broken in the delivery or dispatch process,"" according to Japan Trend Shop, a site selling the case in the U.S. Which raises the obvious question: Are these people serious? The answer: not really. The site describes the cover, which is handmade and takes a month to deliver, as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on Japanese obsessions with food and consumer technology. Its name also plays off of pop culture's recent fascination with post-apocalyptic tales like ""Revolution"" and ""The Walking Dead."" It may not save you from zombies, but at least you wouldn't starve while you were hiding from them. (And, yes, the Japanese share that fascination. Three words: zombie-themed restaurant).

"(Financial Times) -- The Huffington Post is planting its flag in Germany, striking a partnership with Burda's Tomorrow Focus to bring its mix of news, blogging and social commenting to readers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The start of a German edition, timed for the country's elections in September, would become the seventh international launch for the splashy online news and commentary site owned by AOL as it sets to build a global new media empire. Since expanding its footprint to Canada and the UK in 2011, the Huffington Post has joined with prominent media companies to launch non-English editions in France, Spain and Italy. Editions and partnerships are in the works for Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, South Korea, Morocco, Mexico and Australia. ""The international expansion has been a dream of mine from the beginning,"" Arianna Huffington, president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group, told the Financial Times. ""We are taking the HuffPo editorial and technology DNA everywhere. We also are creating a group of international bureaus that can work together on stories."" The Huffington Post's global expansion stands in contrasts with traditional news organisations that are bleeding revenues and cutting staff. The Huffington Post has not turned a profit since it was acquired by AOL for $315m in 2011, but executives said traffic and ad revenues were growing. The site would make money, they said, if it weren't building new ventures such as the international editions and digital video. AOL reports earnings on Friday. ""One of our strategies has been to invest inside the disruption,"" said Tim Armstrong, AOL's chief executive. ""That strategy, although it looked overly bold, allows us to get into some interesting areas."" Each international outpost -- outside Canada and the UK -- is set up as a joint venture, where the Huffington Post contributes its technology system and the traditional media outlet contributes its promotional power and understanding of the market as well as its ad sales team. Together, the groups hire an editorial team of about 12 people, usually led by a prominent Ms Huffington-like figure, such as prominent French journalist Anne Sinclair for the Huffington Post's French outpost. The Huffington Post spends no more than $2m per market and splits the costs and the profits with its partners, said Jimmy Maymann, chief executive of the Huffington Post Media Group. Executives at Tomorrow Focus and Le Monde, which is working with the . Huffington Post in France, said that they decided to link up with the Huffington Post rather than go it alone so that they could tap into the new media group's tech knowhow. ""We are looking for a scalable model for news portals of the future,"" said Christoph Schuh, a member of the management board of Tomorrow Focus. The joint venture comes as the Huffington Post has agreed to a distribution deal with Mark Cuban's AXS TV network in the US to repurpose its live online video content for cable television. HuffPo Live, which launched last August and has been dubbed the CNN for the digital age, airs online. But under the deal with AXS, it will broadcast six hours a day on AXS TV, which is available in 41m US homes. ""We're in an era where social media drives live TV and live TV drives social media,"" said Mr Cuban, who owns and operates AXS, with partners that include Ryan Seacrest, Anschutz Entertainment Group and Creative Artists Agency. For HuffPo Live, the deal gives the nascent operation access to new viewers -- and potentially more lucrative advertising partners. The convergence of online video and traditional TV is accelerating, said Roy Sekoff, president and co-founder of HuffPo Live. ""We want people to engage with our programming.

"(CNN) -- Carly Fleischmann lived most of her childhood trapped in a body that could not communicate clearly with the outside world. She couldn't speak and had few fine motor skills. She'd been diagnosed with severe autism at age 2. Even with the progress that has been made with therapy techniques and medication, Fleischmann was still a mystery to her own family. Who was she? What would her voice be like if she could speak? These were all questions that would go unanswered until Fleischmann began to type. One day, during a session with one of her therapists, Fleischmann began to feel sick. Unable to speak to convey her condition, Fleischmann went out on a limb and took the keyboard. She typed ""Help teeth hurt."" This would be the breakthrough that eventually allowed Fleischmann to communicate with the outside world. A life without smartphones and other mobile devices would be hard to imagine for those of us who are phone-clutching, tablet-wielding mobile device addicts. How would we be able to live without Facebook or Instagram always in our pockets? How could I check my bank account balance while I'm out shopping? But for Fleischmann and many others like her these devices give so much more: a voice. The first-generation iPad was released in the U.S just after Fleischmann's 15th birthday. Her family immediately drove from their home in Toronto to purchase one. They knew that the iPad would be a turning point for her to have freedom and the ability to communicate like never before. Fleischmann began to type on a desktop computer at age 10, but it was a difficult and slow progress, one letter at a time. ""She finds typing extremely frustrating,"" said her father, Arthur Fleischmann. ""She wants a voice more than anything else. In her case, it's even worse, because she has very severe OCD, and she gets anxious, and when she gets anxious, she freezes. It's still frustrating that she can't get her thoughts and feelings out."" As Fleischmann began to type more, her family and her therapists got to know her. She was a sharp-witted, bright girl who knew pop culture. She cracked jokes and poked fun at her brother, complaining about his teenage boy smell. She had her own sense of style. But most important, Fleischmann was tenacious. She made it clear that she was willing to fight to achieve her goals. Before the iPad, she tried several mobile communication devices. These tools had text-to-speak functionality, but she didn't really take to them. ""She rejected her early communication devices like the Lightwriter and the DynaVox because she felt they made her look disabled,"" her parents said. ""She doesn't think of herself as disabled; she thinks of herself as a kid with autism. But she doesn't want that to define her."" For most people, the iPad opened a whole new way to send and receive information. It let us learn, communicate and socialize in a way we never had before. For Fleischmann, the iPad was a game-changer for a much different reason. It gave her independence, and the apps made it easy to communicate her thoughts without painstakingly typing each letter on a computer. And because it was deemed ""cool,"" it was enticing to her. It did not make her feel different. As with any other teenager, Fleischmann's ""cool"" points went up, and it helped her fit in. ""It looked totally cool to be walking around with an iPad, and she much prefers that,"" her father said. Fleischmann says she loves her iPad and says, ""thanks to it, I participate in class in a whole new way. "" Fleischmann now has two iPads and a laptop she uses regularly. The app she uses most is the fully customizable ProLoQuo2Go. When Fleischmann goes to camp, for example, she can pre-load photos and words associated with camp to more efficiently communicate with her peers. The app comes at a steep price of $189.99. But the freedom and ease with which she can communicate clearly make it worthwhile. Fleischmann and her father have written a book detailing her struggles and triumphs with autism. She has garnered the attention of celebrities and autism advocates like Ellen DeGeneres, Sen. John Kerry, Larry King and Temple Grandin. Recently, she joined Kerry on a panel to discuss how important technology is to those with autism. ""Technology has allowed me to communicate, learn social skills, implement relaxing techniques and played a crucial part in helping me how to spell,"" she said. ""To me, technology is the key to unlocking autism."" Watch: Carly Fleischmann speaks with Sen. John Kerry . Facebook, Twitter and blogging also play a big part in Fleischmann's ability to communicate with the world. She continues to amaze her family every day. Her assistant, Howard, found a dialer attachment, and using that, ProLoQuo2Go and a speakerphone, Fleischmann can call friends. Follow Carly on Facebook . Her dad says that while Fleischmann may not have the fine motor function to do things like tie her shoes, he hopes she will be able to attain more independence through technology. Fleischmann says her next goal is to attend university. She has her eye on UCLA and says she wants to get her bachelor's or her doctorate like her idol, Temple Grandin.

"(CNN) -- Scott Forstall, one of the most visible faces of Apple in the wake of Steve Jobs' death, is leaving the company in a surprise shakeup at the head of Apple' ranks. Forstall, a senior vice president in charge of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS, will act as an adviser to CEO Tim Cook until departing some time next year, according to a news release from the company. As the man behind the system that ran Apple's industry-changing iPhone and iPad, Forstall had been considered a favorite to replace Jobs as CEO after Jobs' death last October. More recently, Apple observers pegged Forstall, 43, as the next in line behind Cook. Along with marketing chief Phil Schiller and design guru Jonathan Ive, Forstall anchored the company's top tier of executives, frequently speaking at Apple's heralded product unveilings to showcase the ins and outs of operating-system upgrades. Inside Apple's major shakeup . Many felt he was the most logical choice to continue Jobs' legacy of innovation at Apple, where 70% of revenue now comes from the mobile devices that iOS powers. ""He was as close to Steve as anybody at the company,"" Andy Miller, former head of Apple's iAd group, told Businessweek last year. ""When he says stuff, people listen."" The Apple press release did not say what Forstall plans to do when he leaves the company. Apple did not immediately respond to a message seeking further details. The release Monday came as Wall Street was virtually shut down in advance of Hurricane Sandy, and more than a million customers along the East Coast were already without power because of the storm's onslaught. John Browett, Apple's head of retail, is also leaving, according to the release. The company is launching a search for his replacement, whereas it appears Forstall's duties will be divvied up for now among other Apple heavy hitters. Ive, Bob Mansfield, Eddy Cue and Craig Federighi ""will add more responsibilities to their roles,"" according to the announcement. Cue, the senior vice president for Internet software and services, will take over voice-controlled assistant Siri and Maps, two of iOS's most prominent features. Federighi, the vice president of Mac software, will now oversee both Mac and iOS. Almost universally lauded for its smooth, easily navigated design, iOS was dinged by many last month for a wonky Maps app and other problems. Replacing Google Maps for the first time as the system's default tool, users found the map product incomplete and sometimes comically wrong in many locations throughout the world. Some critics said iOS 6 didn't offer many significant advancements over its predecessors, while Google's Android system continues to evolve more rapidly. Monday's changes, particularly Forstall's departure, came as a major surprise. The only comment from Cook in the announcement didn't shed much light on them, either. ""We are in one of the most prolific periods of innovation and new products in Apple's history,"" Cook said in a written statement. ""The amazing products that we've introduced in September and October, iPhone 5, iOS 6, iPad mini, iPad, iMac, MacBook Pro, iPod touch, iPod nano and many of our applications, could only have been created at Apple and are the direct result of our relentless focus on tightly integrating world-class hardware, software and services."" Forstall did not speak at last week's unveiling of the iPad Mini. But he took the stage at September's iPhone 5 event, detailing the aforementioned operating-system updates. Forstall has been with Apple since 1997 and, in addition to guiding iOS, is one of the original architects of the company's desktop and laptop software, Mac OS X. He was responsible for several versions of the software, most notably Mac OS X Leopard in 2007. Before Apple, he worked with Jobs at his short-lived NeXT, the computer company he ran between stints at Apple.","Apple's Forstall out in shakeup at the top .

"(CNN) -- In Florida, some early-voting lines were longer than those for the new iPhone. In New Jersey, officials are allowing those displaced by Superstorm Sandy to vote via e-mail and fax. And a bitterly partisan presidential election is expected to be close. So it makes sense that people would be extra concerned about potential irregularities at polling places Tuesday. A few groups are using the Internet to urge people to document their experiences at the polls. See something abnormal, such as long lines, voter intimidation or combative volunteers? There are a few online venues where you can report it. One of the most promising is My Fair Election, a site from Archon Fung, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. The site encourages voters to rate their polling place experience -- from one to five stars -- and detail any problems. ""It's a little bit like Yelp for democracy,"" Fung says in a YouTube video about the project. ""Just as Yelp and Amazon allow people to rate restaurants and products, My Fair Election will allow voters to rate their polling place after they vote."" A national map on the site shows average wait times by state. As of late morning on Election Day, 379 reports had come in, he says. But Fung expects many, if not most, of the ratings to be filed online at the end of the working day. Before the project launched, he indicated he wanted to see 10,000 ratings filed by the public. CNN has tools for detecting and reporting voter disenfranchisement, too. The network has a ""voter irregularities hotline"" (800-CNN-NEWS) and e-mail address (votewatch@cnn.com). You can report issues by texting 55333. Type ""CNN"" and a space before entering your info. File a photo or video to CNN iReport. Or, finally, send messages to CNN on Twitter by tagging them #CNNVoteWatch. A site called Video the Vote is encouraging citizen journalists to take their smartphones with them to the polls and ""be prepared to ... document what is happening and then share that content on your YouTube, Twitter, Instagram or Ustream."" The group is collecting info from the hashtag #VideoTheVote. Its site has state-by-state reports collated from social media, including information about reported long lines in Florida on Tuesday morning. Would-be election monitors should be cognizant, however, of state laws about filming and photographing at polling places, says Harvard's Citizen Media Law Project. ""Photography and video can be critically important to document the election process and to preserve a record of any procedural improprieties and interference with voter rights,"" the group says on a page dedicated to ""Documenting the Vote 2012."" ""At the same time, however, voting is a very private matter, and attempts to record at the polling place are subject to strict regulation to safeguard voter privacy, protect against voter intimidation, and to ensure the proper functioning of the voting process."" The group published a helpful list of state laws on the topic. Fung, from the My Fair Election site, says all of these efforts could lead to a more detailed understanding of what goes on at the polls on Election Day. It's important to document the good as well as the bad, he says, so that a national picture emerges.","My Fair Election collects ratings on polling places .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The iPad Mini made its global sales debut Friday, but the lines of fans outside many stores were much smaller than previous Apple debuts. By midday, the line at Apple's flagship store in Hong Kong to pick up reserved devices had five people, a far cry from the throngs that turned out for the iPad 2 debut here last year. Hong Kong was among the first of 34 countries -- including the U.S. and major European markets -- where the iPad Mini went on sale Friday. Local press reports in Australia and Japan also suggested fewer fans were lining up to greet the thin 7.9-inch tablet. Buyers were required to pre-order the device and arrive to pick up at a scheduled time, which may have contributed to the muted response. In January Apple halted sales of its iPhone 4S in Beijing and Shanghai after scuffles broke out among fans waiting overnight to buy the phone. Apple wouldn't comment on how many iPad Minis were pre-ordered. Do people really want a smaller iPad? In recent years, lining up to be among the first to buy new Apple products has become a ritual around the globe. Yet news reports and anecdotal posts on Twitter found smaller-than-usual lines at Apple stores in London, Sydney and other cities. However, more than 750 people lined up to buy the tablet -- or other Apple gadgets -- Friday morning outside Apple's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, according to Fortune's Philip Elmer DeWitt. The size of the line was perhaps surprising given that Hurricane Sandy has disrupted access to Manhattan and some parts of the city are still without power. On Twitter, some observers criticized the priorities of New Yorkers lining up to buy a pricey electronic gadget when other city residents were suffering in the aftermath of the storm. In Hong Kong, the sale brought out the Apple faithful such as Thomas Wu, who added the Mini to his collection of products that include the iPhone, iTouch and iPad. ""I love Apple,"" Wu said. ""I'm going to use the Mini, and give my iPad to my family."" Those who crowded in the store over the iPad Mini display seemed more curious than ready to purchase the tablets, with models starting at $329. ""I have several other tablets, so I'm just going to wait,"" said one customer, who asked not to be named, as he tried out the iPad Mini. iPad Mini: iReporters weigh in . Unlike previous releases, Apple is not blazing new territory with its Mini tablet. Instead, it's getting into a small-tablet market already occupied by competitors such as Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire. The cost of the new iPad Mini was a chief complaint among reviewers when the tablet was previewed by the press last week. ""For $200 you can get a Nexus 7, you can get a Kindle Fire, with similar specs -- so you're really paying an Apple premium here,"" Jason Tanz, senior editor at Wired, told CNN last week. Hands-on with the iPad Mini . ""It's the first kind of defensive play we've seen from Apple in a while,"" Tanz said. ""This is the first time they're kind of playing catch up."" As CNNMoney reports, Apple shares fell below $600 earlier this week after a management shakeup and mixed iPad Mini reviews. Scott Forstall, one of the late Steve Jobs' top lieutenants, also was shown the door after some recent missteps, including Apple's heavily criticized release of Apple Maps -- which led to an apology from Apple CEO Tim Cook. CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","Apple's iPad Mini went on sale in 34 markets worldwide on Friday .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban have launched their spring offensive, their annual spate of attacks targeting foreign bases, government officials and Afghan police, a Taliban spokesman said Sunday. On Sunday morning, a roadside bomb killed three police officers in Afghanistan's Ghazni province, provincial spokesman Nabi Jan said. A Ghanzi deputy police chief was among those killed, and two other officers were injured, Jan said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack -- and said more will come. ""Today was our first day of the new operation, and we conducted many operations in several provinces such as Ghazni province, Kapisa province and Nangarhar province,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN. He said the new spring offensive will target foreign military bases and foreign convoys as well as attacks on Afghan National Police and the Kabul government. The group will use suicide attacks and rockets, Mujahid said. ""We hope to plan and conduct more attacks on foreign troops so as to force them to leave Afghanistan,"" the Taliban spokesman added. The Taliban regime in Afghanistan was sheltering the al Qaeda terror network when it launched attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001. The next month, the United States cranked up military operations that led to the toppling of the Taliban government. Ever since, international forces have been fighting radical Islamic militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan.","3 officers, including a deputy police chief, are killed in a roadside bombing .

"(CNN) -- In 2008, President Obama campaigned on a message of ""Hope and Change."" Thursday, speaking in Ohio, the president announced his re-election campaign message of ""Divide and Blame."" The president had to give another economic speech, nearly an hour long, because he has not given us economic results. America does not need excuses; we need leadership. The president's speech was a speech of excuses, basically blaming President Bush and tax cuts for all that ails the American economy. The president announced his intention to run against George Bush, but he is a little late -- he missed that election by eight years. By the way, even that is not a campaign he can win; I recommend that he should try to run against Nixon instead. President Obama cannot ask Americans if they are better off than they were four years ago, and so is trying to blame others for his record. Over half a million fewer Americans have jobs today than when he took office. After his advisers projected that his $800 billion stimulus bill would keep unemployment below 8%, it has remained above that benchmark for a record 40 months and counting. Median family net worth has hit a two-decade low, median household income has declined, more than 30% of borrowers are underwater on their mortgage, 23 million Americans remain unemployed or underemployed, and half of college graduates this year come out of school unemployed or underemployed. Being president is a hard job. One of the hardest parts is that you can't just make excuses. Harry Truman understood this. It's just not allowed from the president of the United States. Excuses make the president look small and weak. It is frankly a little embarrassing. Read Donna Brazile's view: Romney would let middle class pay tab for the rich . The president himself promised, after being elected, that if he didn't get the economy fixed in three years, then his presidency was ""going to be a one-term proposition."" President Clinton, speaking in 2010 at the same spot where the president spoke Thursday, said ""Give us two more years. If it doesn't work, vote us out."" Good advice. That was then. Now, the president is basically saying that he is a victim of circumstances, and we are all victims. Thursday's speech was also a speech of class warfare. The other campaign President Obama announced is a class warfare campaign of division. He plans to divide America along class lines, gender lines, party lines, age lines and any other lines he can find. He will run a campaign of rich against poor, men against women, Democrats against Republicans, young against old and liberals against conservatives. But America is fundamentally a young country at heart, and we know our best days are always ahead. We are an aspirational people who want our children to inherit more opportunity than we inherited from our parents. We know that our circumstances of birth, race, gender and zip code do not determine our outcomes as adults. We know we are promised equality of opportunity, not equality of outcomes. We are not an envious people who vilify success. We believe in an America where any child can succeed and pursue the American dream through hard work and a great education. We are not looking for a president who wants to make us more like Europe, manage the slow decline of a great nation, and redistribute the wealth. The president is completely correct when he says this election is a crucial choice between two paths. We must choose between the government path and the private sector Path. We must choose between the European path and the American path. The president promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term, and instead has amassed trillion dollar deficits every year he has been in office. At 24% of GDP, federal government spending now exceeds post-World War II norms, as the federal government grows in size and involvement in our daily lives. President Obama has gotten the federal government involved in bailouts, crony capitalism and running car companies, banks and health care; one can only imagine what would happen in a second term. Yet, amazingly, President Obama on Thursday doubled down on his failed policy of borrowing money from China to grow government spending, instead of growing the private sector. His entire philosophy can be encapsulated in one little line toward the end of his speech. He suggested we should put money into infrastructure and ""do some nation building here at home."" While this may be a cute turn of phrase, and certainly polls well, it is all you need to know about the outlook of this president. He believes that this nation was built by the government, and that more government spending is the key to our future. This is a speech that should have been delivered in France. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bobby Jindal.","Bobby Jindal: President Obama failed to deliver what he promised on the economy .

"(Wired) -- For the third year in a row, Apple was named number one in management consulting firm Booz & Company's annual survey of the top 10 most innovative companies. Almost 80 percent of the respondents in the 700-company survey (.pdf) named Apple as one of the top three most innovative companies in the world. Google, which took the second spot overall, ahead of 3M, was listed in the top three by 43 percent of respondents. But what is innovation? How can it be quantified, and what does it mean that Apple comes out on top? Reticle Research analyst Ross Rubin notes there are different kinds of innovation, and different companies excel in different areas. Apple and HTC end patent battle . ""Apple's innovation focuses on bringing together different parts of an ecosystem and tightly integrating them together with meticulous attention to detail"" Rubin told Wired via e-mail. ""They refine consumer capabilities in an approachable offering with broad appeal."" Samsung, number four on Booz's list, takes a different approach than Apple, making a point to incorporate the latest technologies into its products, like large OLED displays and NFC. ""Other companies, like Dell, focus on relatively unglamorous innovation in process and manufacturing,"" Rubin said. And then there are companies like Google, whose innovation is largely left to prototypes and concepts, things like Project Glass. ""I think Apple is a leading innovator among tech companies â€” but innovation comes from many companies, and it's easy to point to clear examples from many of Apple's competitors,"" Forrester analyst Charles Golvin told Wired. ""A big distinction for Apple is the breadth of areas in which it innovates: hardware, industrial design, software, usability, retail. Many of its competitors are strong in one or more of these areas but not across the board."" iPad Mini review: More than just a smaller face . Interestingly, innovation (at least in the surveyors' eyes) is not tied with R&D spending. Apple's absolute R&D expenditures rank it 16th within its industry. Microsoft, the top R&D spender in the software and Internet area, was ranked as the sixth most innovative company. In recent months, Apple has come under criticism for its products being largely ""evolutionary,"" rather than ""revolutionary"" (and even, in some respects, ""utterly boring""). Because of Apple's history of innovation, many of us hold higher expectations for Apple than for its competitors. Golvin thinks Apple will continue to be a leader in innovation in the coming years, despite doubts about the company now that Steve Jobs is out of the picture. ""[Jobs'] leadership and imprimatur persist in the people that he hired, like Jony Ive,"" Golvin said. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"San Francisco (CNN) -- A new iPhone is widely expected to debut next month for the three largest U.S. carriers, but T-Mobile will be left out, an executive for the carrier said at a technology conference on Monday. T-Mobile has expressed to Apple its desire to carry the iPhone, said Cole Brodman, T-Mobile USA's marketing chief. ""They know we want the phone,"" he said. ""We'll wait for that call."" But the iPhone will not be available for T-Mobile customers in October, he said onstage at the GigaOm Mobilize event. Last week, Brodman reportedly told employees at a meeting, ""We are not going to get the iPhone 5 this year."" Brodman issued a ""letter to T-Mobile customers"" on Tuesday explaining that customers disappointed about the carrier not having the iPhone should take a look at Android devices. He also noted that more than a million T-Mobile customers use iPhones that have been unlocked from AT&T or other international carriers. These cannot connect to T-Mobile's 3G or faster networks. ""Please know that we think the iPhone is a great device and Apple knows that we'd like to add it to our line-up,"" Brodman wrote. ""We are interested in offering all of our customers a no-compromise iPhone experience on our network."" Sprint Nextel is expected to begin selling iPhones in October, along with unlimited data plans, according to a report last month in the Wall Street Journal. The next iPhone will debut in October, said Apple board member Al Gore, and is set to be announced at an event October 4, according to a report from the Journal's AllThingsD website. AT&T Mobility and Verizon Wireless are currently the only U.S. operators that sell the iPhone. Sprint would be the only U.S. carrier offering an iPhone with an uncapped data subscription. T-Mobile also sells unlimited plans. Smartphones account for three-quarters of devices sold by T-Mobile, and 90% of those run Google's Android, an operating system that competes with Apple's, Brodman said on Monday. The fourth-largest U.S. carrier, T-Mobile has struggled to attract new customers, as well as retain the ones it has since AT&T announced plans in March to acquire the company. AT&T executives have said that T-Mobile's inability to negotiate for popular products like the iPhone and its lack of a viable plan to deploy a high-speed 4G LTE data network can explain its recent problems. ""We believe this transaction will eventually close,"" Brodman, the marketing exec, said of the proposed AT&T deal that has been challenged by the federal government for being potentially anticompetitive. ""In either outcome, I think T-Mobile customers will inevitably win."" T-Mobile also introduced new products at the event on Monday. Two Android phones, Samsung's Galaxy S II and HTC's Amaze 4G, are coming soon. Another device, the Sonic 4G Mobile Hotspot, will allow customers to wirelessly get online and share files between devices.","T-Mobile USA will not be carrying the iPhone this year, an exec says .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's Robin van Persie received a hostile reception on his return to the Emirates Stadium but had the last laugh Sunday by scoring the equalizer in a 1-1 draw against his former club Arsenal. Van Persie's 29 goals this season have fired United to the English Premier League title, grabbing a hat-trick last Monday as they beat Aston Villa to clinch their 20th top-flight crown. He left Arsenal in a $37 million switch to their EPL rivals in close season and the ill-feeling surrounding that move was reflected in the chorus of boos from the home fans every time he touched the ball. Arsenal afforded United the traditional guard of honor before the kick off, but once play got underway they showed little respect for the new champions. Van Persie's sloppy ball saw Arsenal charge forward and Theo Walcott took advantage of a marginal call for offside to advance and beat David de Gea in the visiting goal. They continued to dominate by playing with a ferocious intensity and with van Persie on the receiving end of some robust tackling, but the match turned near half-time. First van Persie saw his point blank header kept out by Wojciech Szczesny then a mistake by Bacary Sagna let the Dutch star free and the defender responded by pulling him down in the penalty area. Van Persie got up to coolly convert the penalty and draw United level. ""It takes bottle to take a penalty when the crowd are booing,"" Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports after the match. ""We have a great spirit of applauding players when they come back to our club. I expected the booing to be honest with you."" United were revitalized and had the better opportunities to claim the full three points in the second half, with Wayne Rooney denied by Szczesny and substitute Ryan Giggs seeing a late effort deflected wide. But the subsequent draw was a result neither team would be satisfied with and United cannot now beat Chelsea's all-time record for EPL points in a season. As Arsenal dropped a point, Chelsea moved above them into third with a 2-0 home win over Swansea earlier Sunday. Fifth placed Tottenham Hotspur, two points behind Arsenal in the battle for the final Champions League spot, have a game in hand over their North London rivals. Chelsea, who have a hectic program of league and Europa League commitments, showed no signs of tiredness with a comfortable win. Brazil's Oscar gave them the lead in the 43rd minute after a pass from Frank Lampard, who grabbed the second in first half stoppage time. Lampard, who is one short of the all-time Chelsea career goal tally by former legend Bobby Tambling, struck home a penalty after Leon Britton had fouled Juan Mata. The early kick off saw a 0-0 draw between Reading and QPR at the Madejski Stadium, which saw the basement pair relegated. After a match of few chances, both were left nine points behind fourth bottom Aston Villa and with no mathematical chance of avoiding the drop. Villa play Sunderland in a crucial relegation battle Monday.","Arsenal and Manchester United draw 1-1 at Emirates .

"(CNN) -- A coalition of protesters marched Saturday under sunny skies to a Royal Air Force base north of London to voice its opposition to the UK's use of armed drones in Afghanistan. ""People are pretty upset about the idea that Britain will be developing this drone warfare,"" said John Hilary, executive director of War on Want. Some 700 representatives of ""a whole range of different anti-war movements"" participated, many of them arriving in buses from around the country, he said. They made the 4-mile march from the town of Lincoln to Royal Air Force Waddington, about 130 miles north of London, he said. The coalition also includes members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the Drone Campaign Network and Stop the War Coalition. Their march was held two days after the RAF announced that it has begun remotely operating its Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles deployed to Afghanistan from the Lincolnshire airbase. Before that, they had been operated from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, where the U.S. drone program is located. In a statement, Britain's Ministry of Defence said its Reaper drone, which is operated in Afghanistan under the command of NATO International Security and Assistance Forces, ""is undoubtedly helping to save the lives of our forces, our allies and those of countless Afghan civilians."" But the Ministry of Defence itself, in a 2011 Joint Doctrine Note, raised concerns over the increasing use of drones. ""The robot does not care that the target is human or inanimate, terrorist or freedom fighter, savage or barbarian,"" it said. ""A robot cannot be driven by anger to carry out illegal actions such as those at My Lai. ""In theory, therefore, autonomy should enable more ethical and legal warfare. However, we must be sure that clear accountability for robotic thought exists and this in itself raises a number of difficult debates. ""Is a programmer guilty of a war crime if a system error leads to an illegal act? Where is the intent required for an accident to become a crime?"" Noting that the use of unmanned aerial vehicles is increasing, the report called for the establishment of clear policies outlining their acceptable use. ""There is a danger that time is running out,"" it concluded. ""Is debate and development of policy even still possible, or is the technological genie already out of the ethical bottle, embarking us all on an incremental and involuntary journey towards a Terminator-like reality?"" Experts in other countries have grappled with similar questions. The use of drones ""builds resentment, facilitates terrorist recruitment and alienates those we should seek to inspire,"" said Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, in an editorial published last October in the Washington Post. There is no way to be certain that there are no cases of mistaken identity or innocent deaths, he said. Drone use can radicalize populations, said Volker, who now is executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University and a senior adviser to the Atlantic Council of the United States. He noted that the United States has no monopoly on the technology. ""Imagine China killing Tibetan separatists that it deemed terrorists or Russia launching drone strikes on Chechens,"" he says. ""What would we say?"" But a former RAF ""Reaper"" pilot, David Cummins, who has worked in the United States and Britain, defended the program from its critics. ""I'm not 100% sure what they are marching against,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. There is little difference between drones and piloted planes, said the pilot, who joined the Combined Joint Predator Task Force in 2006 in Nevada and left in 2011. ""Same rules of engagement, same laws of armed conflict, same crews. ""It's just one is manned and one is unmanned."" If drone use is indeed immoral, does that mean it would be immoral to fire at an enemy from a naval vessel 50 miles off the coast, asked Cummins. ""Where do you draw the line?"" Cummins is now working as a vice president in charge of operations at Unmanned Experts, a company that specializes in drone training, equipment and business development. A study published last year by two U.S. universities argued that the ""dominant narrative"" that drones are ""surgically precise and effective"" is false. The strikes have killed far more people than the United States has acknowledged, traumatized innocent people and largely been ineffective, according to the study by the law schools of Stanford and New York University. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report from London .","""No to drones,"" says the Drone Campaign Network .

"(CNN) -- An Indiana mother who sent her gay son to school with a stun gun after administrators apparently didn't do enough to stop the bullying against him said she would do it again -- even though the teen now faces expulsion. ""I do not promote violence -- not at all -- but what is a parent to do when she has done everything that she felt she was supposed to do ... at the school?"" the mother, Chelisa Grimes, told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday. ""I did feel like there was nothing else left for me to do, but protect my child."" The school district held an expulsion hearing last week but no decision has been announced. Grimes sent her son, Darnell ""Dynasty"" Young, to Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis with the stun gun after he said he was taunted and bullied for months. ""I brought the stun gun 'cause I wasn't safe,"" the 17-year-old said. After six other students surrounded him at school on April 16, calling him names and threatening to beat him up, Young pulled the stun gun from his backpack. He raised it in the air, setting off an electric charge, and sending the group scurrying, Young said. Unlike a Taser, which fire barbs attached to long wires at a target, a stun gun has to be near or pressed against a person to shock them. ""I got kicked out of school for me bringing the weapon to school, but I honestly don't think that that was fair,"" Young said. ""I didn't use it on nobody. ... All I did was raise it up in the air and went back to my class."" School police officers arrested him a short time later and took him away in handcuffs, The Indianapolis Star reported. School officials are investigating the incident, but none of the students who allegedly surrounded Young has been positively identified. Young is known as a flamboyant dresser and Larry Yarrell, the Tech principal, said school staff had been trying to get him to ""tone down"" his accessories. ""If you wear female apparel, then kids are kids and they're going to say whatever it is that they want to say,"" Yarrell told The Star. ""Because you want to be different and because you choose to wear female apparel, it may happen. In the idealistic society, it shouldn't matter. People should be able to wear what they want to wear."" CNN could not immediately reach school officials for comment. Grimes contends that school officials haven't done enough to protect all students on campus. ""I think that the self-protection device is what's making the news, but the big picture is that my child is not the only one who does not feel safe at our school,"" she said. It a common complaint among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. A 2009 survey of 7,261 middle and high school students found that nearly nine out of 10 LGBT students had experienced harassment at school over the previous year and nearly two-thirds felt unsafe because of their sexual orientation. Young said rumors around campus suggested he was ""doing nasty stuff"" with teachers. The rumors took their toll. ""I was at my wit's end. I didn't know what to do and I thought about suicide,"" Young said. ""I hate saying that word because God blessed me with this life. I love life. I love my education. I would never ... but this bullying got so bad that I thought about that.""","""What is a parent to do when she has done everything?"" Chelisa Grimes says .

"London (CNN) -- The ""shutter shades"" most recently popularized by fashion-conscious rapper Kanye West are in the midst of a transformation from flash-in-the-pan style accessory to a clever technological learning aid that its makers hope will encourage more people to learn the art of computer coding. The Bright Eyes Kit contains a pair of glasses made entirely of circuit board and dotted with 174 LED's tacked onto the front. ""You can control each individual LED,"" explains Daniel Hirschmann, co-founder of Technology Will Save Us (TWSU), the London based start-up behind the idea. The small array can display scrolling text, videos of flickering flames or generate any moving image that the user desires. ""Bright Eyes is our mission to convince people to learn how to program,"" says Hirschmann, who expects that as more everyday items develop the capacity to send and receive data -- a trend sometimes referred to as the ""Internet of Things"" -- the more important it will be that we know how to operate and adapt them. TWSU are following in the footsteps of Rasberry Pi, the $25 computer designed to encourage children to learn to code. But the flashing lights of The Bright Eyes Kit is an added incentive: learn code, and look cool in the process. ""Without the incentive we don't have a convincing argument, so we thought let's create (one),"" says Hirschmann. Importantly, users can choose how far they want to delve into the code, ranging from an introdcutory level drag-and-drop interface to full, line-by-line coding. As technology creeps inexorably into every crevice of our lives, a rudimentary understanding of computer code is seen by some as an essential life skill. For Zach Simms, co-founder of Code Academy, an interactive online resource that teaches programming, it has become as important as learning to read. ""Coding is 21st century literacy,"" says Simms. ""With an economy in flux and a world in which everything is increasingly becoming revolutionized by technology, programming is becoming a core part of job competency. Even knowing basic programming and algorithms helps you throughout everyday life."" Unlike most products on the high street, Bright Eyes is built to be modified. As it is made entirely out of circuit board, users can solder components directly to it -- such as a light dependent resistor or a microphone to make it respond to sound. ""One of the first things people asked was if it could react to music. So we added a microphone as an added incentive,"" says Hirschmann. TWSU describe themselves as a ""haberdashery for technology and education dedicated to helping people produce and not just consume technology."" Bright Eyes is their latest piece of kit seeking to fill the gap between the technology we own and what we know about how it works. ""We all realize at some point that we want to make the things in life that we care about,"" says Hirschmann. ""We don't actually want microwavable TV dinners -- we care about food. Food is just one example of that maker revolution."" Hirschmann thinks the growth of interactive new media has encouraged a move away from 20th century-style consumerism. ""YouTube was a big precipitating factor in that,"" he says. ""All of a sudden people were not just consuming media, but creating it."" This so-called ""maker movement"" has been credited with heralding a new industrial revolution, with community-run DIY workshops, often known as hackspaces, gaining increasing popularity. ""We do see ourselves as part of the maker revolution,"" says Hirschmann. ""I think hackspaces are phenomenal, but they're servicing a very small community. If you're someone from the outside looking in, it can be a very frightening space. We're not at all like that."" Hirschmann reckons his kit is more approachable, targeted at an entry level tinkerer: ""It's really about opening the doorway to the world of technology and understanding what it is. It's about giving people just enough, and making it easy enough, to tantalize them to jump in, and hopefully start swimming."" TWSU spoke at a ""makers"" event in London last week alongside the creators of Sugru, local heroes of the maker revolution. Daniel Hirschmann thinks the movement is gaining momentum: ""We are part of this wave that is building. The maker revolution is like a paradigm shift in your own head.""","The Bright Eyes Kit DIY LED glasses teaches you basic programming, and makes you look cool too.

"(CNN) -- The timing couldn't be any better, or worse, for Mira Nair's film of Mohsin Hamid's novel, a sympathetic portrait of a gifted, intelligent young Pakistani whose love affair with the American dream ends in disenchantment, mistrust and violence. This would have been a provocative movie to release at any time since 9/11, but especially so in the immediate aftermath of the Boston bombings. Still, if we're to come to any understanding of the terrorist mentality, movies are a relatively safe and responsible place to start looking. In the opening scenes, the CIA responds to the kidnapping of a European academic in Lahore, Pakistan. A U.S. journalist who is also an undercover operative for the agency (Liev Schreiber) is sent to interview one of the professor's colleagues, a local whose classes are reported to be stirring up young Muslims and who is a known associate of jihadists. Changez (Riz Ahmed) agrees to talk, but only if the American promises to hear him out and get the full story. Changez, it's not pronounced like the David Bowie song, but it could easily be read that way, starts out as if he means to become one of Tom Wolfe's ""Masters of the Universe,"" a Princeton business grad whose ruthlessness puts him on the fast track at Underwood Sampson, a Wall Street valuations firm. He even dates the chairman's daughter (Kate Hudson, valiantly trying to find roots for an elusive character). The business saga is entertaining in a snappy, sub-Oliver Stone finger-wagging vein -- Kiefer Sutherland is in strong form as his steely mentor -- but things sour for Changez when the World Trade Center comes down. Suddenly the up-and-coming executive is being strip-searched at airports and advised to shave his beard. He's treated like an alien and comes to feel like one. It forces him to rethink his own identity, his heritage and spiritual values and for the first time he questions the profit-motive that has driven his success. The film's twin-track structure doesn't really work: the lengthy reminiscences of the disenchanted capitalist completely overwhelm the present tense against-the-clock hostage drama. Is Changez playing for time, to aid his al-Qaeda buddies? Nair doesn't seem interested in fleshing out that suggestion, and melodramatic scenes with Martin Donovan as the CIA field chief eavesdropping on the conversation fall well below the authenticity of ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Still, the exchanges between Schreiber and Ahmed -- an intense, edgy British actor some may recognize from the black comedy ""Four Lions"" and Michael Winterbottom's ""Trishna"" -- do shed some light on the 21st century's most volatile culture clash. In the starkest of these, Changez confesses that his first reaction to the planes hitting the towers was... pleasure. It's a brave acknowledgment of an unspeakable emotion, a moment that will repel many in the audience just as clearly as it disgusts Schreiber, but which is worth hearing not because it's provocative, but because it rings true. There are hard shards of brutal honesty dispersed elsewhere too. When Changez and his American girlfriend first make love, she stops; she's still mourning the love of her life. ""Pretend I'm him,"" he urges, an impulse that doesn't just speak to the male's desire, but also to the immigrant's need to fit in. And then, later, the other side of the equation, when, teaching in Lahore, he challenges his students to articulate what a ""Pakistan Dream"" might look like...? Too prescriptive and too novelistic to fully come to life, at least ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" doesn't demean its characters or its audience.

"(CNN) -- Plenty of French comedies have been adapted for the American audience (""Three Men and a Baby,"" ""Dinner for Schmucks"" and ""The Birdcage"" among others). But French-Canadian comedies? Not so much. ""Starbuck"" is the rare QuÃ©bÃ©cois film that will get the Hollywood treatment. The story of a prolific sperm donor who learns he has fathered more than 500 children will open next fall under the title ""Delivery Man,"" with Vince Vaughn in the starring role. But months before ""Delivery Man"" comes out, American moviegoers are getting a chance to see the French-language original. ""Starbuck"" is about to expand to theaters in Dallas, Houston and other cities after opening in New York, Los Angeles and Boston. It's earned positive reviews from many American critics including The Washington Post's Michael O'Sullivan, who called the film a crowd-pleaser with ""charm to burn."" The Post and The New York Times praised actor Patrick Huard's performance as David Wozniak (the Vaughn role), an affable underachiever who only learns of his prodigious reproductive record after 142 of his offspring file a class action suit seeking to reveal the identity of the donor known only as Starbuck. ""We felt that it was a great premise to explore what fatherhood is all about today,"" says director and co-writer Ken Scott. In a conversation with CNN in Los Angeles, Scott and his star described ""Starbuck"" as the rare comedy that translates across cultures. ""We've had a great success in Quebec and now the film is traveling throughout the world,"" Scott said. ""Comedies don't always travel as well as other genres, so it's a pleasant surprise."" Huard attributes the film's widespread appeal to its earnest tone. ""When you have the tagline, 'This guy is the father of 533 kids,' you're expecting a kind of, maybe almost goofy comedy. And that's not the case (with this film),"" he told CNN. ""The movie (is) actually touching and more human than just being funny. I think people responded very well to that ... And I think that's why it talks to people outside of Montreal and Quebec -- it's just universal themes."" That universal quality apparently wasn't lost on the people at DreamWorks, who snapped up the English-language rights. Scott adapted his original script (co-written with Martin Petit). In another coup, DreamWorks also tapped him to direct the remake. ""We felt that there was that potential to have a movie made here with the American culture -- with this story but with the American culture embedded into it,"" Scott said. Scott wouldn't reveal what changes he made for Hollywood other than the title (the studio perhaps thinking ""Starbuck"" would suggest a film about coffee). But given how middle-of-the-road many American comedies can be, it seems unlikely ""Delivery Man"" will begin, as ""Starbuck"" does, with a masturbation scene. The constant between both films is the main character's journey -- from carefree lug to a guy with greater maturity who tries to play a positive role in the lives of his many, many children. Scott expresses surprise at how quickly the Hollywood version came together, right down to casting the leading man. ""We hooked up right away with Vince Vaughn and he was great. He loved the story, loved the original, and he had a window of availability for us in September (2012), so it all just happened very smoothly,"" Scott said. Huard praises his American counterpart. ""I've seen a lot of Vince Vaughn's comedies, like 'Made' and 'Swingers.' The guy is great. I think it's going to be a great part for him."" Huard denies feeling proprietary about the role he originated. ""A part is a part,"" he told CNN. ""It's like music. I happen to be the luckiest guy because I was the first to play that symphony, but there'll be a remake also in France and one in India in a Bollywood kind of way, and I think I'm just privileged to be the first to do it. But it's such a great part I'm very happy that it's going to be played again but in a different way."" ""Delivery Man"" is due for release in October. Scott said if this new version meets with success, it will be icing on the cake. ""Our greatest expectations have been exceeded a long time ago.""","French-language ""Starbuck"" undergoes a Hollywood remake .

"(CNN) -- Connie Lester was concerned when she heard that a deadly meningitis outbreak had been linked to spinal steroid injections. Anxiously watching the news for reports of cases in her home state of Kentucky, she debated whether to call her doctor. ""I thought, 'Let's just wait and see,' "" she said. ""Not anything you can do about it after it's already done."" Lester has been receiving steroid injections in her lower back for several months because of a herniated disk. The disk is pushing one of her nerves against a bone; friction between the two causes pain when she walks or stands for even short periods of time and can lead to numbness in her leg. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that as many as 14,000 patients may have received injections of a contaminated preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate. Steroids are commonly injected in patients with back pain, according to Dr. Irene Wu with the UCLA Pain Management Center. They're also used to help with joint pain, arthritis or other inflammatory diseases. Inflammation occurs when the body is trying to heal itself, like when your muscle tissue tears or something is irritating your cells. Unfortunately, inflammation can be self-perpetuating, leading to more inflammation and pain. Steroids help combat that effect, Wu says. Injections are usually a last resort after patients have tried anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy. The steroids are usually injected into the same location as epidurals. Most patients receive two or three shots over the course of a month. ""It depends on how bad the pain is,"" Wu said. ""Eighty percent of people need more than one to feel better."" The contaminated steroids in the meningitis outbreak are linked to the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. The CDC says 184 people in 12 states have been sickened with non-contagious meningitis as of Friday; 14 have died. What is a compounding pharmacy? Infections with steroid spinal injections are rare, says Dr. Nick Shamie, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery at UCLA.In his 12 years in practice, he says, he's had only two patients develop bacterial infections. These typically happen in people with a compromised immune system. Woman sues over meningitis outbreak . Shamie says spinal steroid injections are only a temporary plan for patients. ""Unfortunately, most of these patients will continue suffering from their pain,"" he said. ""The only thing that has helped is surgery."" Lester's spinal fusion surgery is set for November 7.

"(CNN) -- The big cats are out of the bag after the British and Irish players selected for rugby union's prestigious Lions tour of Australia were unveiled in London. Lions coach Warren Gatland has chosen 15 Welsh, 10 English, nine Irish and three Scottish players in his combined 37-man squad for the three-Test tour which begins in June. The announcement was a relief for Welsh flanker Sam Warburton, who had been sworn to secrecy by Gatland after being named as captain on his debut Lions tour. ""It's been the hardest thing, lying to my friends for over a week!"" said the 24-year-old, who is the youngest tour captain in Lions history. ""Warren phoned me up to tell me nine days ago. I put the phone down and punching the air was my first reaction. ""I've had to tell hardly anybody and that's been very difficult. I told my fiancee and parents but that was it. ""The boys at the Cardiff Blues were asking me if I wanted to go out for food and things like that,"" added Warburton, referring to his Welsh club. ""They were trying to catch me out but I wouldn't let anything slip. ""If I went through my career without playing for the Lions, I'd be so gutted. It's by far the biggest accolade any British or Irish player could achieve -- it's the ultimate, so I'm absolutely thrilled."" There was no place in the squad, however, for England captain Chris Robshaw or England's 2003 World-Cup winning hero Jonny Wilkinson. Wilkinson, who now plays in France for Toulon, effectively ruled himself out of contention for the Lions tour, pointing instead to young fly-halves Owen Farrell and Jonathan Sexton, who have both been selected for Lions kicking duties. ""I asked Jonny if he could tour and he said he wasn't available. I wouldn't have made the phone call if it wasn't to offer him a place on the tour,"" Gatland said. ""He appreciated the call, but I think physically he would struggle to do a tour. He was honest about himself and said 'I'm hanging on with my fingernails here at the moment and I probably need another operation'. ""We asked him about what happens if there is an injury later in the tour and he said 'we can have that conversation later if that crops up.'"" Ireland great and 2005 Lions captain Brian O'Driscoll was also included, with the 34-year-old centre chosen for his fourth successive tour. Despite retiring from England duty last season, England prop Matt Stevens was added to the Lions squad. Scotland's New Zealand-born wing Sean Maitland was also included although there was no place for outside half Greig Laidlaw. ""We spent a long time selecting this squad and there were some close calls with a lot of competition for places,"" said New Zealander Gatland, who coached Wales to Six Nations -- the northern hemisphere's annual tournament -- success in 2013. ""When it came down to it there were three or four positions where we had to make a call between one player and another. ""There's been so much speculation and so many opinions. And that's what selection is - it's a matter of opinion, and it's our opinion. ""But ultimately we chose the players who will give us the best chance of a Test series victory. A Lions tour to Australia only comes around once every 12 years and we believe we have the right balance in the squad to be successful."" The concept of a combined touring Lions side began in 1891 when a group of English and Scottish players took part in a three-Test series against South Africa under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union. In 1899, the tourists fielded players from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland for the first time as they traveled to Australia to provide them with their first international competition. The Lions head Down Under again in 2013 determined to avenge their defeat by the Australians in 2001. The tour begins in Hong Kong against the Barbarians -- an international invitational side based in Britain -- on June 1 and the first Test against Australia follows on June 22 in Brisbane.","Coach Warren Gatland names a 37-man squad for British & Irish Lions tour of Australia .

"(CNN) -- Algeria's president was in France on Saturday where he was being treated for a ""mini-stroke,"" medical and government officials told the state-run Algerian news agency. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's condition was characterized as ""not serious,"" Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal told the Algerian Press Service. The news agency reported the 76-year-old president was transferred to a Paris hospital for treatment. ""There was no reason for worry,"" Rachid Bougherbal, the director of the National Center of Sports Medicine told the news agency. He said the president ""needs rest before continuing examinations."" Bouteflika was first elected president in 1999. He is considered central to the stability of the country, overseeing the end of the country's civil war, staving off Arab Spring uprisings and cooperating with Western powers in the fight against al Qaeda. He has said he will step down at the end of his term next year. Bouteflika has been rarely seen in public in recent years, which has led to speculation over his health. In 2005 and 2006 he underwent treatment at a hospital in France for what the Algerian government characterized as a stomach ailment, which prompted rumors he was suffering from stomach cancer. A U.S. diplomatic cable, released by WikiLeaks in 2011, said the Algerian president was suffering from cancer, but was in remission. According to the Mayo Clinic website, the medical term for what is often called a mini-stroke is ""transient ischemic attack,"" and produces symptoms similar to a stroke but usually causes no permanent damage. Such an attack ""may be a warning ... About 1 in 3 people who have a transient ischemic attack eventually has a stroke,"" the website says.","Abdelaziz Bouteflika is being treated at a Paris hospital, state-run news reports .

"(CNN) -- The Boston Marathon bombings were horrific and senseless crimes. Thus far, all the publicly released evidence suggests that the crimes were the work of just two individuals, the Tsarnaev brothers. The elder brother, Tamerlan, is dead, and the younger brother, Dzhokhar, is in serious condition at a Boston hospital. Assuming that he recovers and is mentally fit, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev must face trial. The question is where: in state court or federal court? Both are legitimate possibilities. As with the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, the acts of which he is accused constitute a variety of crimes under both state and federal law. There have been numerous calls to prosecute Tsarnaev in federal court because federal law offers the possibility of the death penalty, but Massachusetts law does not. This would be a very poor basis upon which to make the choice. The decision of where to prosecute should be based on which jurisdiction has a greater interest in the case, not where the potential for vengeance is greater. In the Oklahoma City bombing, the federal prosecution was given priority because Timothy McVeigh was motivated by hatred of the federal government to directly attack it, destroying a federal building and killing scores of federal employees and their children in the process. Did one brother brainwash the other? There does not appear to be a similar federal interest here. The Boston Marathon is the quintessential Boston event, and the victims were predominantly Massachusetts residents. Those killed by the blast were a local restaurant manager, a schoolchild and an international student attending Boston University. The law enforcement officer victims were an MBTA Transit Police officer and an MIT campus police officer. The crimes, in addition to the bombings, included an attempted convenience store robbery and a carjacking, crimes typically prosecuted in state court. The elected representatives of Massachusetts have rejected numerous attempts to reinstate the death penalty since it was invalidated by the state's Supreme Judicial Court in 1984. Gov. Deval Patrick and other state authorities should resist allowing the passion and grief of the moment to override the will of the people of Massachusetts not to execute its citizens by turning the case over to the feds. Comments by Mayor Thomas Menino expressing a hope that the U.S. attorney will ""throw the book"" at Tsarnaev, although understandable after what his city has been through, do not represent the sober reflection we expect of our leaders. Of course, we do not yet know what motivated the bombers. If investigation reveals that the attack was an attempt to terrorize the United States as a whole as part of some jihadist ideology, then the federal interest in prosecution would be stronger. But at the moment, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a much stronger claim to prosecute. Opinion: Nine questions about the bombers . One option that clearly should not be on the table is any effort to treat Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. He is an American citizen. Just like McVeigh, he is entitled to all the rights and privileges afforded citizens under the U.S. Constitution and does not forfeit them because he appears to have committed heinous crimes. We must resist the tendency to treat every act of violence as an act of war just because we are in a ""war on terror"" and to reflexively label every criminal of foreign origin or Muslim faith as a terrorist. And if and when Tsarnaev is well enough to be questioned, the interrogation should start with a Miranda warning. Now that the crisis has passed, there is no urgent need to invoke the New York v. Quarles ""public safety exception"" as a means of circumventing this young man's constitutional rights. Boston is the cradle of American liberty and is justifiably famous for its rejection of oppressive and tyrannical government. Let us not sully that reputation by sacrificing Tsarnaev's civil liberties in the heat of the moment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frakt.","Many say bombing suspect's trial should be in federal court due to death penalty .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council signed off Thursday on a 12,600-member peacekeeping force in Mali that will be authorized ""to use all necessary means"" to protect civilians and cultural artifacts. ""We know it's going to be a fairly volatile environment,"" Herve Ladsous, the U.N. undersecretary for peacekeeping operations, said. The resolution was proposed by France, which deployed about 4,000 troops to Mali in January to drive out Islamist militants who attempted to take control of the country. The peacekeeping force -- known as the U.N. Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali -- will take over July 1 and include some 6,000 troops from Chad and other West African nations already providing security in the country, according to the resolution adopted by the Security Council. ""This is not an enforcement mission. This is not an anti-terrorist operation,"" Ladsous said. Rather, he said, the mission will help Malian authorities restore constitutional order and governance. Elections there are set for July. Islamic extremists with links to al Qaeda carved out a large portion of northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup in March 2012. France took military action this year after the militants began to push into the southern portion of the country. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the region. World leaders feared that militants would turn the area into a terrorist haven. The Security Council resolution provides for a peacekeeping force for 12 months. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","A U.N. Security Council calls for peacekeepers to takeover in July .

"(CNN) -- An explosion outside a police station in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Saturday morning caused severe damage to the building, said the state news agency, LANA. No casualties were reported in the early morning attack, which shattered several weeks of relative calm for the city's residents. Over the past year, Benghazi, the birthplace of Libya's 2011 revolution, has been the scene of multiple attacks targeting security forces. Many of the attacks have been blamed on Islamist militants. On Friday evening, armed men attacked the headquarters of a government-affiliated militia in the city of Derna, about 120 miles (200 kilometers) east of Benghazi, killing one of its members, LANA reported. After the attack, a car bomb with more than 50 kilograms of explosives was found and defused, the news agency said. Western intelligence sources believe that Islamist militant groups some with links to al Qaeda are active in and around Derna. Earlier in the week, a car bomb carrying a large amount of explosives detonated outside the French Embassy in Tripoli, injuring two French security guards and a Libyan girl. There has been no claim of responsibility for Tuesday's attack. After the French military intervention in Mali in January, there were fears militants could strike French interests in the region, including Libya, which has been struggling to impose security across the country since the 2011 revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi. Libyan officials said an investigation was under way to determine who carried out the attack on the embassy. The bomb also damaged surrounding buildings in a residential part of the capital. A team of French investigators has been in the Libyan capital collecting evidence and investigating the bombing. The French Embassy bombing followed a series of attacks last year that targeted foreign diplomatic missions and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Benghazi. The attacks are believed to have been the work of Islamist extremist groups with ties to al Qaeda. Last September, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. After Tuesday's bombing, the first targeting a foreign diplomatic mission in Tripoli, Libyan officials said security would be increased around such facilities. The high level of unease was evident when a bomb threat at a cultural event Friday evening led to its cancellation and the evacuation of the foreign diplomats in attendance. The Libya Movie Awards, an event organized by the European Union, the Italian Cultural Institute and the Libyan nongovernmental organization 1 Libya, was being held at a theater adjacent to the Radisson Blu Hotel in central Tripoli. In a news release on Saturday, organizers said they ""regret to announce the decision to postpone the First Edition of the Libya Movie Awards (LMA) in light of yesterday evening's security threat."" The statement said the rest of the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been postponed until further notice ""while insecurity persists"" A management source at the Radisson Blu Hotel told CNN the hotel did not receive any threats and was functioning as normal on Saturday. A security official told the Libyan state news agency that security precautions were taken Friday after a member of the security forces guarding the hotel received a call from an unidentified person saying there was a car bomb in the vicinity. The official said security measures were taken immediately and the report appeared to be ""baseless.""","Explosion outside police station damages the building, reports state news agency .

"(CNN) -- Former World No.1 Vijay Singh says he has been left '""shocked"" and ""angry"" after the revelation that he used a spray which may have contained a banned substance under the PGA TOUR Anti-Doping Policy. The PGA Tour said Wednesday that it was investigating claims that Singh had used a banned drug contained in deer antler spray. The 49-year-old Fijian star told Sports Illustrated that he used the spray ""every couple of hours..every day."" He is quoted as saying: ""I'm looking forward to some change in my body. ""It's really hard to feel the difference if you're only doing it for a couple of months."" But the spray is reported to be contain a substance called IGF-1, which is a ""natural, anabolic hormone that stimulates muscle growth."" IGF-1 is banned by several professional sports organizations, including the PGA Tour. Statement . In a statement issued through the PGA Wednesday, Singh said he had no idea that the spray may contain a banned substance. ""While I have used deer antler spray, at no time was I aware that it may contain a substance that is banned under the PGA Tour Anti-Doping Policy,"" said the statement. ""In fact, when I first received the product, I reviewed the list of ingredients and did not see any prohibited substances. ""I am absolutely shocked that deer antler spray may contain a banned substance and am angry that I have put myself in this position. ""I have been in contact with the PGA Tour and am cooperating fully with their review of this matter. I will not be commenting further at this time."" Singh upstages McIlroy and Woods . Two years ago, 1999 British Open champion Mark Calcavecchia was advised by golf officials to stop using the spray. It is manufactured by an Alabama-based company Sports With Alternatives to Steroids (SWATS), who have links to other major sports in the United States. Deer velvet . CNN Senior Managing Editor of Medical News Tim Langmaid says the spray, which is also known as deer velvet, is purportedly used to boost strength and endurance, while it also improves immune system function. He said: ""It contains small amounts of deer IGF-1, or Insulin-like Growth Factor-1, which mediates the level of HGH in the body. ""It comes from the deer velvet that covers the growing bone and cartilage that develop into deer antlers. ""It's the IGF-1 that is on WADA's banned substance list. Excessive use in humans can lead to metabolic dysfunction, including glucose intolerance."" The spray is derived from deer harvested in New Zealand. The Sports Illustrated article claimed Singh paid $9,000 for the product. A PGA spokesman told CNN that the ""matter regarding Mr Singh is pending review"" but could not give an indication of how long the investigation would take. ""There is no timetable at the moment,"" he added . The 49-year-old Singh was scheduled to play in the Phoenix Open in Arizona starting Thursday, but pulled out citing a back injury, the PGA Tour website reported. Controversy . Singh's illustrious career has in the past been dogged by controversies, not least back in 1985 when he was banned from the Asian Tour over allegations he changed his scorecard to his advantage during a round. He shrugged off that setback to gradually make his mark, first on the European Tour, then over in the United States, where he has campaigned on the PGA Tour since 1993. He has won three majors and was the money list winner in 2003, relegating Tiger Woods to second spot. But the same year, Singh's veiled criticism of women's No.1 Annika Sorenstam for competing against the men in the Colonial tournament led to negative publicity. However, in 2004 Singh took the No.1 spot in the rankings from Woods and won the PGA Championship, his final major. Despite his advancing years, he qualifies for the Champions Tour next month, Singh has continued to compete at the highest level of golf and is regularly in the upper reaches of the leader board in PGA events.","Vijay Singh under scrutiny for alleged use of banned product .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama confidently declared that his administration will get things done in Washington despite an atmosphere he described as divided and politically dysfunctional. Speaking at a press conference 100 days into his second term, Obama fielded a range of questions on topics including Syria and the Boston Marathon attack, and he defended his administration's actions and positions. Noting that lawmakers have blocked initiatives like averting forced budget cuts and expanding gun control, one questioner asked if Obama still had ""the juice"" to get his agenda through Congress. ""I think it's a little, as Mark Twain said, you know, 'Rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point,"" Obama said at the White House. ""We understand that we're a divided government right now. Republicans control the House of Representatives. In the Senate, this habit of requiring 60 votes for even the most modest piece of legislation has gummed up the works there. And I think it comes to no surprise, not even to the American people, but even members of Congress themselves that right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on Capitol Hill,"" Obama said. The president said he is confident that a range of priorities will get done, like immigration reform. He praised the bipartisan work on that bill. ""That's going to be historic achievement,"" Obama said. ""I've been very complimentary of the efforts of both Republicans and Democrats in those efforts."" Overhauling immigration policy . Obama said an immigration reform bill proposed by the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" senators meets criteria that he believes is necessary. This includes more effective border security, a crackdown on employers ""gaming the system,"" making the legal immigration system work more effectively, and making sure there is a pathway to citizenship for immigrants already in the country. Obama said he hasn't seen what House members are proposing and promised to be open-minded about whether they can address the issue better. But, he added, ""the bottom line is they still have to meet those basic criteria."" Forced budget cuts . As for the sweeping $85 billion in forced spending cuts that took effect in March due to congressional inaction on deficit reduction, Obama said the austerity is ""damaging our economy"" and ""hurting our people."" He said lifting them will require compromise. ""I've had some good conversations with Republican senators so far. Those conversations are continuing. I think there's a genuine desire on many of their parts to move past not only sequester, but Washington dysfunction. Whether we can get it done or not, you know, we'll see."" FAA suspends furloughs . Obama said short-term fixes, such as legislation heading for his desk aimed at ending sequester-related air traffic control furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays last week, aren't enough. He said that if ""they are seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety, they should not just be thinking about tomorrow. ... They should be thinking about five years form now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now."" Obama said both parties must ""sit down"" and commit themselves to reduce ""our deficit sensibly"" and ensure investment in infrastructure, education and basic research that will help the economy and the country grow. ""That's what the American people want,"" he said. Budget-cut layoffs deal a blow to investigations of gun-related crimes . Partisan politics . Obama said he believes lawmakers understand the need for compromise and ""common sense solutions."" But he noted that it's a challenge to get Republicans to embrace them. ""I can urge them to. I can put pressure on them. I can, you know, rally the American people around those -- you know, those commonsense solutions. But ultimately they, themselves, are going to have to say we want to do the right thing,"" he said. ""I think there are members, certainly in the Senate right now, and I suspect members in the House as well who -- who understand that deep down. But they're worried about their politics. It's tough. Their base thinks that compromise with me is somehow a betrayal. They're worried about primaries. And I understand all that."" Closing Guantanamo . Asked about the hunger strikes at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility, Obama said he continues to believe it should be closed, repeating a stance he took when he became president in 2009. ""I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us, in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counter-terrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed,"" he said. For the past decade, the Guantanamo detention center has held people captured outside the United States in counterterrorism operations. There are about 166 detainees at the facility, according to the latest figures, with half participating in hunger strikes over complaints about their treatment. Obama said Congress would not allow the facility to be closed but he promised to press the issue again. ""Despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in Guantanamo, who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country, I'm gonna go back at this. I've asked my team to review everything that's currently being done in Guantanamo, everything that we can do administratively, and I'm gonna reengage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that's in the best interest of the American people,"" he said. Proud of NBA's Jason Collins . Obama also said he spoke to Jason Collins, the NBA player who on Monday became the first member of a major American pro-sports team to come out as gay. ""I told him I couldn't be prouder. You know, one of the extraordinary measures of progress that we've seen in this country has been the recognition that the LGBT community deserves full equality, not just partial equality, not just tolerance, but a recognition that they're fully a part of the American family,"" he said. ""And, you know, given the importance of sports in our society for an individual who -- who's excelled at the highest levels in one of the major sports go ahead and say, 'This is who I am.' I'm proud of it. I'm still a great competitor. I'm still seven-foot tall and can bang with Shaq."" ""And,"" he said, ""deliver a hard foul.""","Obama took a wide range of questions from reporters .

"New York (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad slammed Sunday an anti-Islam film and the violent and deadly protests it triggered in the Muslim world. Ahmadinejad spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan in New York, ahead of the president's visit to the U.N. General Assembly this week. ""Fundamentally, first of all, any action that is provocative, offends the religious thoughts and feelings of any people, we condemn,"" he said about the inflammatory film that mocks the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. Pakistani minister offers reward for anti-Islam filmmaker's death . ""Likewise, we condemn any type of extremism. Of course, what took place was ugly. Offending the Holy Prophet is quite ugly. This has very little or nothing to do with freedom and freedom of speech. This is the weakness of and the abuse of freedom, and in many places it is a crime. It shouldn't take place and I do hope the day will come in which politicians will not seek to offend those whom others hold holy,"" said Ahmadinejad. ""We also believe that this must also be resolved in a humane atmosphere, in a participatory environment and we do not like anyone losing their lives or being killed for any reason, anywhere in the world."" The privately produced film sparked protests against the United States, where it was made. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, some were marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans killed in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that reportedly followed a demonstration against the film. When asked by Morgan whether he thought protesters should stop threatening U.S. staff abroad, Ahmadinejad responded that he cannot say what other people or nations should do, but that he believes ""extremism gives birth to following and subsequent extremists. ""Perhaps if the politicians take a better position in the West vis-a-vis offensive words or thoughts or pictures towards what we hold holy, I think conditions will improve,"" the president said. Sunni Islam leader urges Muslims to exercise 'patience and wisdom' During the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast Monday, Ahmadinejad discussed what Iran would do if Israel were to attack it. ""Any nation has the right and will indeed defend herself. But my question is this: Why should the world be managed in such a way that an individual can allow himself to threaten a rich and deeply rooted historical, ancient country, such as Iran. A great country, such as Iran, based on an excuse of his own fabrication ... Another country can say, I am guessing that country B is doing activity X, therefore I will attack that country ... can this be ... a successful formula for the management of the world?"" Ahmadinejad asked. The president was likely referring to his country's disputed nuclear program. Some world powers, particularly Western nations, suspect that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons. Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. In response to whether he feared a war, or military conflict, with Israel was imminent, Ahmadinejad said: ""The Zionists are very much, very adventuresome, very much seeking to fabricate things and I think they see themselves at the end of the line and I do firmly believe that they seek to create new opportunities for themselves and their adventurous behaviors."" In related news Sunday, a top general in Iran said his country would be capable of defeating Israel within a day, according to Iran's state-run Press TV. Netanyahu urges U.S. to set 'red line' for Iran . ""A regime (with a frontier) that in some spots is only 24 kilometers wide could have its back broken by one of our infantry battalions in 24 hours,"" Brigadier General Hossein Salami reportedly said. ""Our strategic doctrines are all defensive, but our tactics are invasive. It means that we do not initiate any war, but if anyone wages a war against us, we will counterattack incessantly and will not stop,"" he said, Press TV reported. ""The enemy could initiate a war, but its ending would be up to us."" President Ahmadinejad also spoke strongly about his views on homosexuality. ""I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behavior, that they're denying your freedom?"" he asked Morgan. ""Proper education must be given ... the education system must be revamped. The political system must be revamped. And these must be also reformed, revamped along the way. But if you, if a group recognizes an ugly behavior or ugly deed as legitimate, you must not expect other countries or other groups to give it the same recognition.""

"New York (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, who once sat next to the terror leader and bellicosely threatened the United States, softly answered a judge's questions Friday. Prosecutors say Sulaiman Abu Ghaith conspired to kill Americans as part of bin Laden's al Qaeda terror network, according to a federal indictment unveiled Thursday. Through his attorney, the Kuwaiti pleaded not guilty to the charges in a federal courtroom in New York on Friday, nearly a week after his arrest. Read the indictment . A member of bin Laden's inner circle, Abu Ghaith had spent most of his time since the September 11 terrorist attacks in Iran, according to the federal indictment. Before joining al Qaeda in 2001, he taught high school and preached in his native Kuwait before he was banned from his mosque for using his sermons to attack the government, according to the U.S. government. He also fought in Afghanistan and Bosnia-Herzegovina. He spent the months before the September 11 attacks recruiting candidates for training in his father-in-law's terror training camps in Afghanistan, according to the indictment. After the attacks that destroyed the twin World Trade Center towers in New York and heavily damaged the Pentagon in Washington, Abu Ghaith served as al Qaeda's official spokesman. In a video made the day after the 9/11 attacks, Abu Ghaith sat next to bin Laden and al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri -- an AK-47 behind him resting on a rock wall -- urging Muslims to fight ""the Jews, the Christians and America."" He later warned that ""the storms shall not stop, especially, the airplane storms,"" and warned Muslims and foes of the United States not to board aircraft or live in high-rise buildings, according to the indictment. U.S. authorities have charged that Abu Ghaith supported a major attack on America and urged people at a Kandahar, Afghanistan, guest house to swear an oath of allegiance to bin Laden. While Attorney General Eric Holder said the arrest sends a message to terror suspects that ""there is no corner of the world where you can escape from justice,"" some analysts said Abu Ghaith is small potatoes in the world of international terrorism. ""This is overblown,"" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said. ""Though he was Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Abu Ghaith is far from a big fish in al Qaeda."" U.S. officials arrested him on February 28 in Jordan, according to a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. Prosecutors have not said where he was arrested. According to a report in the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, Turkish officials detained Abu Ghaith on a tip from the CIA after he had slipped into the country from Iran. After deciding he had not committed a crime in Turkey, Turkish officials decided to send him to Kuwait via Jordan. While Abu Ghaith was in Jordan, U.S. officials captured him, the newspaper said. The U.S. government has not confirmed the report. Abu Ghaith -- wearing dark prison-issued clothing, his once dark beard sprinkled with gray -- said little during Friday's hearing. He spoke softly through an interpreter, answering ""yes"" to several questions from the judge. According to prosecutors, Abu Ghaith gave investigators a 22-page statement after his arrest, but they didn't reveal any of what the terror suspect allegedly said. Evidence in the case has been sealed, and prosecutors said they were reviewing classified evidence to see if it would be used in Abu Ghaith's trial. No trial date has yet been set. The decision to handle Abu Ghaith's case in civilian court has irked some Republicans, who say the Obama administration is setting a bad precedent and missing an opportunity to get valuable intelligence from someone who had been so close to bin Laden, who died in a 2011 U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan.

"(CNN) -- Today is the 11th anniversary of the opening of the prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and like the past three anniversaries, it comes with President Barack Obama's campaign promises to close it unmet. From Day 1, the story of Guantanamo, or Gitmo as it came to be called, has been one of injustice and illegality, the violation of human rights and a stain on America's global reputation. Locked within its walls are the stories of hundreds of men who have lost years -- and, for nine of those men, their lives. In 2013, the story of Guantanamo is not just one of the failure to close the prison after so much time but also one of pragmatic failure of missed opportunities to take available, practical steps to reduce the prison's population. Eighty-six of the men still languishing at Guantanamo were cleared for release in 2009 by an interagency task force created by the Obama administration. They remain there because Obama chooses, at every turn, to acquiesce to an intransigent Congress that is bent on keeping Guantanamo open for its own cynical political purposes. This is particularly tragic because several countries have plans to help former Guantanamo prisoners reintegrate into society and have asked that their citizens be returned. For those prisoners who cannot go home because they face persecution or torture, there are third-party countries in Europe, the Americas and the Middle East that have volunteered to accept former Guantanamo prisoners for resettlement. Many of the 86 men cleared for release are ideal candidates for these repatriation or resettlement options. Among them is Center for Constitutional Rights client Djamel Ameziane -- cleared for transfer by Presidents George W. Bush and Obama. He is educated, speaks four languages and has lived and worked legally in Austria and Canada. Inexplicably, the U.S. has refused offers from foreign governments to resettle him or to take other similar opportunities to reduce the prison population. One of the biggest obstacles to closing Guantanamo is one the president created himself: a blanket refusal to transfer any prisoner to Yemen because of the ""unsettled situation"" there. Apart from the fact that detention based on citizenship is discriminatory and illegal, concerns about returning people to unsettled countries does not explain why cleared Yemenis at Guantanamo cannot be temporarily resettled in third countries. More fundamentally, birthplace is not an indicator of criminal proclivity. If they were treated rationally, as individuals, rather maligned as a group, the government would surely concede at least some men at Guantanamo could go home to Yemen and not become threats to the U.S. -- not least of all because most of these men, according to leaked U.S. documents, were never involved in hostilities of any kind, and more than half have long been deemed suitable for transfer by every relevant U.S. national security agency. This collective punishment is particularly troublesome given the stakes. In September 2012, Adnan Latif, who was cleared for release, died in his cell. According to conversations with dozens of other Guantanamo attorneys, there are many other detainees at the prison who are gravely ill. How many more will live out their remaining days behinds bars merely because Obama has deemed Yemen an unsuitable place? The Center for Constitutional Rights represents several clients who we hope will be spared such a fate. Tariq Ba Odah has maintained a hunger strike to protest his unjust detention since 2007 and is force-fed by the military through his nose. Mohammed Al-Hamiri and Ghaleb Al-Bihani are suffering the inevitable psychological and physical effects of more than a decade of indefinite detention. None of these three men has ever been charged. Finally, Obama has made no effort toward solving the central, inherent Guantanamo problem: indefinite detention. In addition to the dozens of men subject to de facto indefinite detention, 46 are officially slated to that fate. Two of the initial 48 have died. According to the president, the U.S. can neither charge and try the 46 men, nor can they be released. Such a category violates the most fundamental principles of due process, summarily depriving people of their freedom by way of executive fiat. Obama has created this category without any plan for how to move men out of it. We are simply warehousing them. Do we plan to operate a prison at Guantanamo for the next several decades, holding these men as they age and die, outlasting the logistical problem even as we ignore -- and worsen -- the moral and constitutional one? What the president lacks is not the political power to act, but the political will. Interim steps are critical to closing the prison. Indeed, without them, it is hard to see how his promise to close it can ever be achieved -- and even more difficult to believe that Obama is truly committed to a world without Guantanamo. As Obama stands again to take the presidential oath to protect and defend the Constitution, looming behind him will be his institutionalized policy of indefinite detention without charge or trial -- a policy that has no place in a democratic society. Unless and until he uses the political power of his office to end this shameful chapter in American history, the story of Guantanamo will be one with no end in sight. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Vince Warren.","Vince Warren: Another Gitmo anniversary, the 11th, comes with vows to close it unmet .

"New York (CNN) -- No ""potential human remains"" have been found in the Manhattan location where a 9/11 aircraft part was recently discovered, New York's chief medical examiner said Wednesday. The announcement followed an inspection at 51 Park Place, where a piece of one of the planes in the September 11, 2001, terror attack was found Friday. It was removed Wednesday. The piece was wedged in an 18-inch space behind the building, the site of the controversial Islamic community center known by its critics as the ""ground zero mosque."" The office said soil-sifting operations have been completed at the site, where the 5-foot-long, 4-foot-wide, and 17-inch-deep part was found. A Boeing Company technician confirmed that the piece is a support structure from a trailing edge flap on the wing of a Boeing 767 like the ones that were flown into the World Trade Center. Police officers hoisted the 255-pound piece out of the location with a pulley and loaded it onto a truck bound for a police property facility in Brooklyn. One police official described the mood at the scene as ""eerie."" Some of the personnel there responded to the attack. ""It's a piece of history and we tried to preserve it as best we could,"" said Police Deputy Chief William Aubry. ""It brought back a lot of memories.""","A Boeing Company technician confirms the piece is from a Boeing 767 .

"(CNN) -- Much of the nation was set to mark the passage of a week since last Friday, when a young Connecticut man fatally shot 27 people -- 20 of them children -- and then turned a gun on himself in a rampage that has breathed new life into the gun-control movement. Church bells are to toll across the region at 9:30 a.m. and some websites plan to go dark in honor of the victims at the urging of Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway, who came up with the idea at a Christmas party attended by Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting that killed six. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Texas Gov. Rick Perry have called for residents of their states to pause to reflect one week after the shooting rampage. Perry also asked that churches ring their bells 26 times in honor of the victims at the school. The observances are to come a day after President Barack Obama's administration put into motion an effort to change U.S. gun laws, less than a week after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings. Vice President Joe Biden met with Cabinet members and law enforcement leaders at the White House to start formulating what Obama called ""real reforms right now"" in the wake of the shootings that killed 27 people -- including 20 children -- and the shooter himself. ""We have to take action, and there are a number of things ... we can immediately do,"" Biden said moments before the meeting began. ""For anything to get done, we're going to need your advocacy."" Also Thursday, burials were held for three children and two teachers killed when Adam Lanza opened fire inside Sandy Hook Elementary School. ""It's an assembly line of wakes and funerals,"" said Lillian Bittman, former chairwoman of the Newtown School Board. ""We can't even figure out which ones to go to. There are so many."" The assembly line stretched more than 2,200 miles west to Ogden, Utah, the hometown of shooting victim Emilie Parker. The town was festooned with pink ribbons as her parents brought her body back for burial. ""This sucks -- there's no reason for us to be here tonight,"" her father, Robbie Parker, told friends and well-wishers at a memorial service Thursday night. ""And I'm so thankful for everybody that's here."" His voice trailed off as he struggled for composure. Seeing the pink -- his slain daughter's favorite color -- made him and his wife, Alissa, ""feel like we were getting a big hug from everybody."" ""A lot of you don't even know who she is. A lot of you never even met her,"" he said. ""And to see your love be expressed in that way for us was so meaningful, and we were so comforted."" Parker drew laughter when he said, ""A lot of people have been asking how we're doing. My opinion is, we need to come with an alternate way to greet somebody in this country."" He said the first days after the shooting felt like ""we were mourning inside of a glass house, because there was so much attention on the whole situation, and it was really hard to deal with. ""But then, as we come here and we start to see and feel all your love, we just know that everybody's just deeply concerned and we can feel that love and it's from a pure place and your intentions are so pure, we don't feel like people are prying,"" he continued. ""We understand that you guys are there with us and that your pain and your sorrow is real and it's deep."" Also buried Thursday, at an undisclosed location, was Nancy Lanza, the shooter's mother, said Donald Briggs, a friend of the family who grew up with her in Kingston, New Hampshire. Plans had not been finalized for the burial of her son, Adam, who fatally shot her Friday at their home before targeting the Newtown school and eventually taking his own life. ""That's still under discussion,"" Briggs said. ""If anything, it would be in the spring."" Three 6-year-olds were among those buried Thursday: Allison Wyatt, who loved to draw and wanted to be an artist; Benjamin Wheeler, who loved the Beatles; and red-haired Catherine Hubbard, who loved animals. Teachers Lauren Gabrielle Rousseau and Anne Marie Murphy were also to be buried. Victims of the slaying . The deaths have prompted a national outpouring of sympathy that continued Thursday. Carloads of teenagers from a Minnesota school that suffered a mass shooting in 2005 headed toward Newtown to offer their support. The bloodshed has prompted an outcry among many to address gun laws and violence. A slight majority of Americans favor major restrictions on guns: 52%, up 5 points from a survey taken in August after the July shooting inside a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, where 12 people died, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday. And 46% say they believe the government must play a role in solving the issue, up 13 points from January 2011, after the Tucson, Arizona, shooting that killed six and wounded Gabby Giffords, who was then a member of Congress. Task force begins work . Joining Biden at Thursday's task force meeting on gun violence were Attorney General Eric Holder, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Law enforcement officials also attended. On Wednesday, Obama ordered the group to provide proposals by the end of January. ""The fact that this problem is complex can no longer be an excuse for doing nothing,"" he said. ""The fact that we can't prevent every act of violence doesn't mean we can't steadily reduce the violence and prevent the very worst violence."" Obama highlighted suggestions to restrict gun sales to criminals and the mentally ill and to improve access to mental health care. Holder was to travel later in the day to Connecticut to meet with law enforcement officials and first responders, a Justice Department official said. Since the shootings, a number of conservative Democrats and some Republicans who have supported gun rights have said they are open to discussing the issue. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said she will introduce legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. The White House has said that the president supports that effort. More than 195,000 people have signed an online White House petition supporting new gun-control legislation. The gun industry itself has been largely silent on the issue; the National Rifle Association said Tuesday it would offer ""meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again."" The group has scheduled a news conference for Friday morning. Gun control advocates say they believe the killings have so shocked the nation's conscience that change may be possible. ""I think that we are at a historic moment,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Strengthening security . In Ontario, Premier Dalton McGuinty made $10 million available to pay for security upgrades to establish a locked-door policy at 4,000 of the province's elementary schools. ""We're not going to brick up these windows; that would be unreasonable. But I believe there is a reasonable expectation by parents that when their kids go to elementary school in Ontario that we will have a locked-door policy in place,"" he said. HLN journalist Rita Cosby and CNN's Matt Smith, Deborah Feyerick, Ben Brumfield, Jessica Yellin, Dave Alsup, Susan Candiotti, Sandra Endo, Faith Karimi and Daphne Sashin contributed to this report.","""We have to take action,"" Vice President Joe Biden says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- If you earn your living driving at speeds upward of 200 mph, chances are you don't slow down even when you're on vacation. That's certainly the case for NASCAR driver Brian Vickers. When not behind the wheel of the No. 83 car in the Sprint Cup Series, Vickers is known as a bit of a daredevil: an avid skydiver, spear fisherman and scuba diver, to name a few of his extracurricular actives. In fact, CNN caught up with Vickers on a recent trip to Atlanta to promote Atlanta Motor Speedway. But he didn't just hold a press conference; instead, he invited the media to watch him scuba dive in the Ocean Voyager exhibit at the Georgia Aquarium. The four whale sharks that live in this exhibit were a new sight for the seasoned diver, and it was clear he was enjoying the experience. He also took notice of several of the groupers that seemed to be paying special attention to him. ""I had a couple of groupers sneak up on me more than once. Those are sneaky little guys. I guess it's their mating season, so they were a little fired up. There's a couple of guys on the track that will sneak up on you,"" Vickers said. After the dive, he took a moment to reflect on the top five destinations that satisfy his need for high-octane adventure. First on the list: Jackson Hole, Wyoming. ""Jackson Hole, Wyoming, I'm a huge fan of. It's just so beautiful out there. In the summer and the winter. ... The summer is incredible just because of the beauty and the nature, the mountains and the hiking and the rafting and fishing. So many great outdoor activities, and I really love to be outdoors."" Second on Vickers' list is the Exumas in the Bahamas, where he enjoys the natural beauty as well. ""The water's incredible. There's a lot of great diving and snorkeling and swimming and spear fishing."" Vickers also looks forward to eating well when vacationing here. ""There's some good restaurants. More hole in the wall, island type places. It's a very small community down there,"" he said. Destination number three is Aspen, Colorado. ""I really enjoy Aspen. Very similar to Jackson Hole but unique in its own way. A little bit bigger town ... a little bit more vibrant night life,"" Vickers said. No. 4 on Vickers' list strays a little from the other favorites, but it feeds into two more of his passions: food and history. ""I always really liked Rome because I absolutely am a history buff, and you can find something from almost every century in Rome. And obviously the food. It's just to die for. Italian food is my favorite food, so that's another reason I like it there."" And the final destination in Vickers' top five takes him back to the islands. ""St. Barts is another favorite ... similar but different from the Caribbean, the Exumas. A lot more mountainous where the Exumas are very, very flat."" Vickers also enjoys swimming, diving and hiking here. He continued with his comparison between his two favorite island spots: . ""Similar to comparing Jackson (Hole) to Aspen, I kinda compare the Exumas to St. Barts. One is very raw and natural and great in its own way, and the other has that, but is more modern and (has) better night life."" This is Vickers' top five list, but he's quick to point out that it's only five locations, and he loves exploring new places, cultures, experiences and of course, thrills. He is by no means ready to slow down on or off the track. ""You know when you start to look at a globe, you start to realize even if you've been a lot of places, you've been nowhere. There's just so much out there to explore, see and do. So I'm anxious and excited to go do that.""","NASCAR driver Brian Vickers enjoys skydiving, spear fishing and scuba diving .

"Luanda, Angola (CNN) -- Angola, Africa's second-largest oil producer, has launched a $5 billion sovereign wealth fund in an attempt to diversify its economy -- a move more associated with wealthy Gulf States like Qatar and the UAE. The state-owned investment fund, known as the Fundo Soberano de Angola, will invest domestically and internationally, focusing on infrastructure development and the hospitality industry. These are two areas the Government of Angola believes is ""likely to exhibit strong growth"". In an exclusive interview with CNN, Jose Filomeno de Sousa dos Santos, the son of Angola's longtime president who is on the board of the fund, said ""now is a very good time."" He added: ""The country has had around five years of steady growth, good growth, mostly based on oil production increases, and it plans to diversify the economy. The best way to do that is to do that is to intervene directly in the economy through investments."" More than 90% of Angola's revenue comes from oil production -- reaching around 1.9 million barrels a day -- and it is second only to Nigeria in its exports. But despite its oil wealth, the country remains largely impoverished. Dos Santos says the aim of the fund is to invest profits accrued from oil to promote social development in the country. ""It is very easy to have oil money and spend it but it is very difficult to have a positive impact to improve people's lives on a daily basis,"" he said, ""and that is an area we intend to invest on a lot with the sovereign wealth fund."" Read related: Is oil-rich Angola a development success? Critics of the government say that Angola's oil wealth has been used to enrich a small section of society -- dominated by allies of president Dos Santos and his family, along with generals associated with Angola's lengthy civil war. ""We don't see the money that is being generated from oil having a direct impact on people's lives"" says Elias Isaac, Angola country director for George Soros' Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa. ""Just look at the schools, look at the hospitals, look at the issue of water, electricity. Angola makes a lot of money out of oil, there is no doubt about this, Angola really is one of the few countries that can pay its national budget without donor funding, which is great, but where this money goes, that's the biggest issue"". Isaac's also argues that a $135 million development project of the capital city's waterfront is a sign of the government getting its spending priorities wrong. Luanda's once shabby waterfront has been transformed after land was reclaimed from the sea. Portuguese expats, many of whom have sought sanctuary here from the eurozone crisis, now jog past manicured lawns each morning. But wedged between the shiny offices and apartments that line this new waterfront, Angolans often struggle to survive in a shacks and ramshackle houses. Beyond the capital lies a large underdeveloped country with a widening income gap. Only around one in three Angolans are literate and more than half drop out before finishing primary school. Angola has faced huge challenges to develop a country decimated by the war for independence and lengthy civil war. But civil society and human rights groups say that institutionalized corruption has helped cause the widening gap between the very rich and the rest of society. Read related: Angola officials held in oil stakes . Critics of the fund also point to the its board being dominated by cabinet members close to president dos Santos. And the younger dos Santos says he -- despite being the president's son -- is qualified for the position because his financial background. Transparency International recently ranked Angola a lowly 168 out of 182 countries in its ""Corruption Perceptions Index"" but Dos Santos says that the fund will be beholden to international best practices, and transparent. ""We are familiar with the fact that this perception exists and we are taking a lot of care to make sure all of our investments are within an approved investment policy and our accounts will be audited annually by an independent renowned auditor."" The pledge of transparency is a departure from Angola's often opaque oil wealth where oil receipts are withheld by strict confidentiality agreements with international oil companies. ""The way the government manages the oil receipts, we think we still have a lot of corruption"" says Manuel Jose Alves da Rocha, Economics Professor from Angola's Catholic University. ""We think the lack of transparency is also another situation we have to look at to understand why the oil income does not go to the majority of the people"". Angola's oil industry is dominated by Sonangol, the state-owned company that gives concessions to international oil companies and, over time, takes in the lion's share of the profits. Many observers believe that Sonangol was already acting as a sovereign wealth fund by investing its profits in many areas outside of the oil industry -- including buying up key stakes in Portugal's biggest bank by assets, Millennium BCP. The formation of a formalized fund was first announced by Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. But the global financial crisis caused the oil price to plunge, hammering Angola's economy. The government had to offset the crisis by securing a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the form of a Stand By Arrangement of around $1.4 billion. With new deep water oil finds announced by the government, Angola hopes to outstrip Nigeria to become Africa's largest oil producer. But the revenue from Angola's black gold won't last forever. The government hopes the sovereign wealth fund will help diversify Angola's profits to secure its future.","Angola launches $5bn Sovereign Wealth Fund to decrease future reliance on oil revenues .

"(CNN) -- If you don't think Hispanics are a major force in the American marketplace, think again. Hispanic entrepreneurs like Art Pesqueira, pictured last year at his El Grande Tortilla Factory in Tucson, Arizona, are growing rapidly, statistics show. Hispanic business ownership is growing three times as fast as the national average and Hispanic purchasing power is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2011, according to the Census Bureau and other studies. All too aware of this growing force, many companies are wooing Hispanic consumers and their spending power. ""The Hispanic consumer market here in the U.S. is actually as big or bigger than the GDP [gross domestic product] of Mexico or Canada,"" Michael Barrera, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told CNN. ""We're the second largest economy in North America."" Latino wage-earners still lag behind the national average, with median personal income of $20,000 in 2005, compared to $26,900 for the nation as a whole, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. But the income gap is narrowing and business ownership is booming. A U.S. Census bureau report issued last year tracked the growth of Hispanic-owned businesses between 1997 and 2002. The number of Latino-owned companies grew 31 percent over that period -- three times the national average. The bureau identified nearly 1.6 million Hispanic-owned businesses, producing nearly $222 billion in revenue, in 2002. ""It's part of our entrepreneurial spirit,"" says Juan Guillermo Tornoe, a marketing expert who moved to Austin, Texas, from his native Guatemala. ""You come here and you want to get a job, but eventually you want to move forward and start something of your own, something that you can create a legacy for your family."" That's clear in Arturo Rico's story. He entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico more than 20 years ago at age 17. ""I just crossed the border like everyone else,"" and started out picking grapes in California, he said. Rico got his green card and became a supervisor of shipping and receiving at a lettuce farm, then spent time working in restaurants. He moved to North Carolina and began construction work and discovered he really liked it. As he got more involved in the business, he saw the checks that business owners were collecting from clients. ""They showed me the checks, 'Oh, look at how much I get this time!' I'm like, man, I like those numbers!"" he said. Rico started taking classes on the business aspects of construction -- permits, licenses, insurance. Four years ago, he opened his own business, which now has five employees. He's a subcontractor, building high-end log homes and working to get his general contractor's license. He's also teaching some of his employees the tricks of the trade and hopes eventually they'll go into business for themselves. ""I told them 'Look, you can do it, and you're going to make more money,'"" he said. ""'Listen and learn how to do things right, and I'm going to help you guys to do it.'"" A growing number of Hispanic business owners are women, generating nearly $46 billion in sales nationwide last year, according to a study published this year by the Center for Women's Business Research. The study estimates that in 2006, almost 750,000 businesses in the United States were majority-owned by Hispanic women -- an increase of 121 percent in the period from 1997 to 2006. They represent about 37 percent of all Hispanic businesses. For the nation as a whole, about 30 percent of businesses are majority-owned by women, the Center reports. ""[Women] have been setting the pace as far as opening businesses and the way the businesses are growing,"" Tornoe said. ""They are definitely a force to be reckoned with within the Latino community."" Advertising agency owner Nannette Rodriguez is one of those Latina entrepreneurs. She was born and raised in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States. to go to college and graduate school. She started working in corporate communications, but said, ""I was too much of an individual thinker to really fit with corporate America."" She started her own agency in 1986 in Des Moines, Iowa. About five years later, she said, ""We got the sense that we could really lead this curve of ... specialization in Hispanic marketing as an agency in our market and really differentiate ourselves that way."" Rodriguez said marketing her clients' products to Hispanic consumers is good for her business and for theirs. ""The advertisers that don't do it are missing out on new markets and new people to sell to,"" she said. Fueled by immigration and population growth, Hispanic buying power will reach almost $1.2 trillion by 2011 -- about six times what it was in 1990 -- according to an estimate by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia in a study released last year. The center estimated Hispanic buying power will be just over $860 billion in 2007, an 8 percent increase from 2006. If that proves accurate, the Hispanic community will top all minority groups for purchasing power, the center said. Companies are taking notice. Advertisers spent more than $3.3 billion in the United States to market products to Hispanics in 2005, a nearly 7 percent increase from 2004, according to Hispanicbusiness.com. Tornoe, the marketing expert, said the Hispanic community's growing economic clout is reflective of a spirit that's a good fit with the wider sense of American entrepreneurship. ""Most of the time we come here with nothing and we have to make something out of nothing,"" he said. ""And this country's so amazing that if you work hard, you are able to attain that.""

"(CNN) -- Newtown's legislative council had heard enough: residents complaining about loud gunfire, the Connecticut town's small police station inundated with phone calls from frightened residents. So, a few months ago, they tried to restrict when and where residents could shoot their guns in an effort to quiet the complaints. Instead, they got an earful from gun-control opponents. Today, there's a much deeper debate over gun rights in Newtown and around the country in the wake of Friday's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary school. And the battle line in that debate runs straight through towns such as the once-sleepy Connecticut community. ""It's a town with a longstanding history and cultural tradition of guns,"" explained council member Paul Lundquist. Newtown's longstanding gun culture manifested itself as a family outing for Adam Lanza, 20, who authorities say shot and killed his mother -- who introduced him to target shooting -- before killing 20 children and six adults at the elementary school and then taking his own life. For several years, Lanza and his mother frequented several gun ranges in the area, according to federal authorities. That's nothing out of the ordinary in this Connecticut town, where shooting sports are a popular pastime. ""In Newtown right now, you can shoot any gun at anytime on your property,"" said town police commission member Joel Faxon. Lawmakers seem prepared to tackle gun control . The commission's attempt earlier this year to curb the city's lax attitude toward gun use was stonewalled by gun-control opponents in August, which Faxon said he couldn't understand. ""All we wanted to do was make sure that all the guns that are fired in Newtown are fired in a safe fashion and aren't going to injure anybody and aren't going to infringe on anybody else's property and create a danger,"" Faxson explained. ""Even that safety-based solution was staunchly and vigorously opposed by gun rights individuals."" It shows just how sensitive the debate over gun control can be in Newtown -- and the nation. But what about now? Has the climate for gun control changed in the wake of Friday's horrible attack? Might Newton's gun culture change as a result of what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary? ""I would hope so,"" Faxon says. ""The time has come now for people to be reasonable. It's unreasonable not to have a safety ordinance about where you're going to have a shooting range. If that can't pass, I mean, what CAN pass?"" Gun-control opponents say even small restrictions represent a slippery slope that threatens Second Amendment constitutional rights. ""You can make as many laws as you want it will NOT change people who want to hurt others,"" said CNN commenter Steve Lahey. ""We all need to arm ourselves now. That is the only way."" Another CNN commenter, Hector Rodriguez, disagrees. He suggests the nation should ""start by banning all assault weapons. You don't need them unless you want to be the next mass shooter!"" These comments and other similarly entrenched positions on both sides of the debate show that gun rights are connected with deep-seated moral issues for many Americans, explained constitutional expert David Kopel. ""Just as some people believe there can be absolutely no restrictions on the First Amendment right of freedom of speech and of the press, some other people take a similar view to the Second Amendment about the right to bear arms,"" said Kopel of the Denver-based think tank Independence Institute. ""At the other end of the spectrum, some advocates of gun prohibition view the idea of owning guns to defend yourself as intrinsically immoral."" Analysis: Guns and the law . In Washington, the gun-control issue has lain virtually dormant for years since a 1994 federal ban on semi-automatic assault rifles elapsed in 2004. But that was before Friday. Newtown has lit a legislative flame. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has vowed to introduce new legislation banning weapons such as the Newtown gunman's Bushmaster rifle. ""Six-year-olds with three to 11 bullets from this Bushmaster in their body. Twenty of them. Is this America? I don't think so,"" said Feinstein. ""And I think these incidents are going to continue until we do something to change the supply mode of these weapons out in our society."" The California Democrat said her bill will propose banning ""the sale, the transfer, the importation, and the possession"" of such weapons. Feinstein, who helped champion the 1994 ban, said she and her staff have looked at the initial bill and tried to ""perfect it."" Even Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat and self-described ""proud gun owner,"" said the Newtown massacre should be the tipping point in the debate over limiting gun rights. A new ABC/Washington Post survey taken shortly after Friday's shooting in Newtown suggests that American attitudes are already shifting. According to the survey, 44% of Americans now strongly support stricter gun laws, with 32% opposed. That's the first time in five years of ABC/Washington Post polling where significantly more people favor rather than oppose stricter gun-control measures. And for the first time in surveys dating back to 2000, less than 50% of respondents said the best way to reduce gun violence is to enforce existing laws, a common mantra for those who oppose gun restrictions. The number of people who say the best way to cut gun violence is to pass new laws has risen to 32%, the highest level in an ABC/Washington Post poll since 2000. In the months and years ahead, Newtown will become a symbol -- not for its rolling hills or for being ""nicer"" than other busy parts of the Northeast -- but for the worst tragedy ever imaginable. It will join that dark list of names, such Columbine, or even Dunblane, the Scottish town where a gunman killed a teacher and 16 students who were about the same age as those in Newtown. In Australia, say ""the Port Arthur,"" and most folks will immediately think of the horrific slaughter of 35 people by a man with a semi-automatic rifle. Both of those 1996 massacres in Dunblane and Port Arthur sparked widespread outrage that led to restrictions on weapons. Twelve days after Port Arthur, Australia's prime minister announced gun reforms. High-caliber rifles and shotguns were banned and other restrictions were enacted. Dunblane sparked a national anti-gun campaign and petition drive that resulted in a UK ban on the private ownership of handguns. The question is: Will the outrage over Newtown have similar results? After shooting, cops take no-tolerance approach to copycat threats .

"(CNN) -- When I was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis, I was told it wasn't going to be a big deal. Things may change, but hopefully not much. Unfortunately, my form of the genetic disorder has caused thousands of tumors throughout my body, and pain that I never thought possible. I spent more than 180 days in a hospital room 1,000 miles from home and have had basically every plan in my life change. But through these immense trials, when I was ready to give up, when I wanted to let go, my family, my community and my doctors were there to fight for me. When I first heard what my brother Chad's friend Brendan Hanrahan had come up with, I thought it was hilarious, and would surely get them arrested. But leave it to them to make it actually work. I mean, it is incredible really, what the Cupid's Undie Run team has been able to do in three years. This year alone, the events raised more than $1.3 million for neurofibromatosis research. Who would have thought that running around in your underwear could do such good? Seemingly every day, I am reminded how amazing and dedicated our friends are. Hanrahan, his fiancee, Tamara Forys, and Bobby Gill, to name just a few, take hours and hours of their spare time to make this race work. They get nothing in return, other than the joy of seeing a good idea make a difference in people's lives. I'm just lucky to be one of those people. Since my brother joined the Children's Tumor Foundation to raise money for research and increase awareness of neurofibromatosis, I have been prescribed the off-label use of a cancer drug to shrink my tumors, and the results have been nothing short of miraculous. Cupid's Undie Run: Benefiting the Children's Tumor Foundation sans pants . I have gone from being bedridden to driving, from a regiment of pain killers to almost none, and now I'm planning to go back to school to become a math teacher. I would never have chosen to have this disorder or to fight this fight, but it does give a unique opportunity to see the best in people. This year, Cupid's was held in 18 cities, with countless volunteers dedicating their free time. People often tell me that I'm an ""inspiration,"" but to me, these volunteers, this team -- they are my inspiration. Neurofibromatosis is a terrible thing, but with an organization like the Children's Tumor Foundation, and with people like those who make Cupid's possible, I have an unwavering belief that nothing will stop us from ending this disease. The neurofibromatosis community will be forever grateful for their gift, and all I can do is say thank you.","Drew Leathers says he has faced ""immense trials"" living with neurofibromatosis .

"(CNN) -- Rafi Kopelan is a typical 5-year-old. She's mastered Candyland. She's learning to read. Given a choice, she'd spend hours on the swings at the playground. But unlike her classmates, Rafi's body is covered in blisters from her scalp to her feet. Her corneas are scratched. Her toes are fused together. And her esophagus is lined with so much scar tissue that she can barely swallow. That's because Rafi was born with a rare connective tissue disorder called epidermolysis bullosa (EB). The genetic disease causes her skin to break down in response to the slightest friction. Even minor contact -- the scratch of a fingernail, the tag on the back of her shirt -- causes her skin to tear or to erupt in blisters, leaving 75% of her body covered in painful, open lesions. Likewise, EB ravages her organs, damaging her heart, eyes, teeth and esophagus. Virtually no part of her tiny body is left untouched. ""It's literally the worst disease you've never heard of,"" said her father, Brett Kopelan. An estimated 15,000 children in the United States suffer from EB, according to the Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association of America. The disease, which occurs when the body lacks the ability to produce a specific type of collagen, is so rare that few treatments exist. Eventually, EB proves fatal, either through organ failure, secondary skin cancer or infection. Worst of all, there is no cure. But in New York City, where Rafi lives, a group of neighborhood mothers is hoping to change that, and in doing so, they are helping to change the way rare disease research is funded in the United States. Group leaders Jill Arnold Pallad and Jamie Granet Bederman met the Kopelans when their children were enrolled at the Montclare Children's School in Manhattan. Moved by Rafi's struggle, they felt an urgency to act. ""I became consumed by it,"" said Bederman, ""Here was this family in my neighborhood, who was so like my own, except that their little girl had an awful disease no one had heard of."" Armed with nothing more than their personal e-mail accounts and their networks on Facebook, they launched Rafi's Run, an annual 5K that raises money for EB research. Last year, they raised $200,000 that went to Dr. Jakub Tolar, director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University Of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who conducts early-stage research on EB treatments. Bederman and Pallad were confident they could reach out online to find runners -- and donors -- who would participate. ""We had no media plan or press plan, and no big corporate fund,"" said Bederman. ""We all just networked through our friends and family."" Sickle cell patient refuses to let disease define her . ""Social media was huge in reaching people both inside and outside our community,"" recalled Pallad. ""We all started fundraising pages, and it was amazing watching people come out of the woodwork."" While private foundations often funnel money into disease research, the ability of a community of people to come together so quickly and deliver funding directly to an early stage researcher is a newer phenomenon. Thirty years ago, the Orphan Drug Act provided financial incentives to pharmaceutical companies to develop treatments for rare diseases -- diseases that afflict fewer than 200,000 people. According to the National Organization of Rare Disorders, there are nearly 7,000 such diseases in the United States, affecting a total of 30 million people. Today, nearly 1 in 10 Americans are currently battling a rare disease. But while the Orphan Drug Act increased the amount of research into rare diseases, the field is still vastly underfunded. So, increasingly, individual patients and their private social networks of friends, co-workers and other casual affiliates are playing a vital role -- not just in raising awareness about a disease but in directing money into R&D for new therapies. Tolar applauds this type of fundraising. As a pediatric oncologist and stem cell transplant specialist, his area of focus was initially cancer research, but he saw a challenge -- and an unmet need -- in rare diseases like EB. A rare disease in the smallest of patients . The transferability of his gene therapies from treating cancer to treating EB is an object lesson in itself, as a breakthrough in one disease often leads to new treatments in another. ""It is a misconception that rare disease research only helps a small number of patients,"" said Tolar. ""Finding a treatment for a rare condition often informs treatment for a more common disease."" Still, Tolar admits that his greatest allies in finding support for his research are his patients and their families. ""To fund great leaps in research, there needs to be an urge to succeed,"" said Tolar. ""We get this from parents, and patient communities. They are working every minute to find a cure."" Under his care in 2010, Rafi was the eighth child in the world to undergo a stem cell transplant for treatment of EB. While it hasn't cured her symptoms, the treatment was a success at the cellular level, as her bone marrow now produces the collagen that she had been unable to make on her own. Since then, Tolar has transplanted a total of 24 children with EB, and continues to conduct research in gene therapy for EB and other rare diseases. He describes the money from Rafi's Run as vitally important to his work. ""The fact is, we need more brainpower to develop new therapies,"" said Tolar. ""The more people who wake up in the morning and spend their entire day dedicated to studying EB, the faster we can move the research forward."" Living with a rare disease, making a difference . Next month, the second annual Rafi's Run will take place in New York. Bederman and Pallad are hoping to match last year's total and look forward to once again putting the money in the hands of an early-stage researcher. In the meantime, the Kopelans continue treating Rafi's disease. To fight the high risk of infection that comes from having so many open wounds, Rafi endures a daily bath in a solution of diluted bleach, followed by an application of specialized bandages. From start to finish, it takes two hours, and the pain it causes Rafi is excruciating. ""It's physically and emotionally exhausting,"" said Jackie Kopelan, Rafi's mother. ""I wish we had more hugs and kisses than baths and bandages.""","5-year-old Rafi Kopelan suffers from a rare connective tissue disorder .

"Editor's Note: Alberto Gonzales is the former Attorney General of the United States. His commentary is part of CNN's Uncovering America series, focusing on the Hispanic experience today. Former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales says his worst day at work was probably better than his dad's best. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Over the next few weeks, America recognizes what many in this country know from personal experience. The most admired values of the Hispanic community are the same values that sustain our nation's greatness: sacrifice, hard work, personal initiative, dedication to family, and perseverance in the face of adversity. I saw these values every day in the life of my father, Pablo. My father was not an educated man. But he worked every day to help his eight children find the American dream. As a young man, he picked crops in the fields of South Texas, where he met another migrant worker -- a young woman named Maria, who would become my mother. He and two of my uncles built the house in Houston that I grew up in -- my mother lives there still today. I can remember when I was a small boy playing in the field as they laid the cinder blocks for the house's foundation. They nailed together the two-by-fours, hung the drywall, and hammered the composition shingles onto the roof. From their sweat, toil and vision arose the small two-bedroom house that became our home. That home is my past, but it also represents our heritage, as Americans who always dream and work for a better tomorrow. As a young boy I would ask my mother to wake me before dawn so I could eat scrambled eggs and tortillas with my father before he left for work. As dad and I ate breakfast together, my mother would prepare a modest lunch of beans and tortillas and carefully place them in a brown paper sack. I can picture my dad walking down the street to catch a ride to the construction site and me running outside and waving goodbye. The memories of this daily ritual burn strong in my chest as I recall this simple time, that simple food, and those deep, enduring American values of family, hard work, and sacrifice. Those are the principles that my parents instilled in me. And those principles are the best heritage of our community. They are the values our nation reaffirms during Hispanic Heritage Month. I'm telling you this story not because there's something so remarkable about my life, but because of how frankly unremarkable it has been in many ways. And that's what is so wonderful about this great country. The story of America is a story of constant renewal and reaffirmation of our founding ideals and our enduring values of faith, family, and freedom. I have drawn on the strength of my heritage and the insights of my background to try to make America a better place for everyone. Over the past 2 ½ years as attorney general, I have seen crimes involving dishonesty, corruption and depravity of types I never thought possible. I've seen things I didn't know man was capable of. But I will tell you here and now that I am still hopeful. Because every time I see a glimmer of what the evil man can do, I see the defenders of liberty, truth, and justice who stand ready to fight it. I see the courage of our soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen and I am hopeful, and so very proud. My time in public service has had its share of difficulties, but even more moments of inspiration. My trips to Iraq have been among them. Being part of a department that plays a vital role in stopping terrorists has been a humbling experience. I have often said that my worst day in office was better than my father's best day. My work has not been easy, but it has been unbelievably rewarding. Because I knew that every day when I got up, I was being given a new opportunity to work for the American people. When I first went into public service, I told my wife, Rebecca, it would only be for a couple of years. It's been longer than that, but I have truly enjoyed myself. And I left public service proud to know that other Hispanics will carry on the mantle of service. My hopes, and those of many others with stories similar to mine, are reflected in those words of the founders of this nation more than two centuries ago: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" Those words are a simple, clear expression of the American dream. I believe in that dream with all my heart. I have lived it in a way I never would have thought possible. I am the son of a Mexican cotton picker and a construction worker who never finished grade school, and I served as the Attorney General of the United States. If anyone ever tries to tell you the American dream doesn't exist, or that you can't achieve it, I hope you'll prove them wrong.

"Oxford, Mississippi (CNN) -- From a dust mask that tested positive for ricin, to an enigmatic dump of a coffee grinder, to talk of making and mailing ""poison,"" an affidavit unsealed Tuesday shed light on the case against a Mississippi man accused of sending potentially deadly letters to President Barack Obama and others. Just more than a week ago, James Everett Dutschke described the man then jailed in the case -- an Elvis, Buddy Holly and Randy Travis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis -- as a ""little nutty."" Now Curtis is free, and the 41-year-old Dutschke is behind bars. The document unsealed Tuesday explains what led authorities to arrest Dutschke -- but not why he allegedly concocted the poison and sent it to elected officials. Read the affidavit . Lawyers for Dutschke did not respond immediately to CNN's calls Tuesday for comment on the new details. But the affidavit in support of a criminal complaint indicated that his name was brought up as a possible suspect by none other than Curtis, following the latter's April 17 arrest. Curtis had been detained on allegations that he was responsible for mailing letters with suspicious substances to Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi. Soon, though, authorities began to set their focus on Dutschke as well. That includes one person's claim, made on April 19 to law enforcement agents, that Dutschke years ago said he could make a ""poison,"" the affidavit said. What is ricin? ""Dutschke stated that he could place the poison in envelopes and send them to elected officials,"" said the witness, who had accused Dutschke of making sexual advances against his or her daughter. ""... According to the witness ... Dutschke made reference to having 'a secret knowledge' for 'getting rid of people in office.'"" Document claims Dutschke repeatedly lied . On April 22, federal authorities searched a trash receptacle from Dutschke's Tupelo home and found, among other items, different types of yellow paper, address labels and a dust mask. The letters to Obama, Wicker and Holland were all on yellow paper. That same day, FBI agents spotted Dutschke leaving his former tae kwon do facility, or dojo, loading things into his car, then placing several items from his window into a public trash can. According to the affidavit, these items included a coffee grinder, a box with latex gloves, a dust mask and an empty bucket of floor adhesive. Three subsequent tests of the mask by the National Bioforensic Analysis Center came back positive for ricin, the document states. Authorities further searched Dutschke's former tae kwon do dojo and tested six other samples, including liquid removed from a drain and swabs taken from inside the building. At the time, Dutschke told CNN affiliate WMC-TV that he had agreed to the FBI search ""to help clear my name."" ""I had absolutely nothing to do with those letters,"" he said. Yet the affidavit states that laboratory tests showed five of the six samples taken from his dojo tested positive for ricin. The document alleges that Dutschke lied to authorities on other fronts as well. For example, he insisted that he hadn't been back to his tae kwon do dojo since April 15, before changing his story to say that he'd returned briefly one week later for a mop bucket, two pails and a fire extinguisher. He also claimed he had not stopped while leaving that building on his way to a pawn shop and seemed to be flummoxed when authorities told him they'd spotted him tossing items into a trash can. The affidavit also alludes to Dutschke's or his family's possible frame of mind earlier this month, as seen in text messages on his wife's cell phone. ""We're coming over to burn some things,"" one such message from April 20 reads. Another from the same day states, ""We are gonna clean house."" Twisted relationships and more . The letters -- all postmarked April 8 -- each had a suspicious substance inside, a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address. They also contained a letter that read, in part: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" On April 17, authorities arrested Curtis. He emphatically denied sending the letters, insisting he'd been framed and pointing the finger at Dutschke. The two men knew each other because Dutschke used to work for Curtis' brother at an insurance company, under the direction of Curtis' ex-wife. Curtis has said that while Dutschke worked for his brother, the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out. He has accused Dutschke of stalking him online, a claim the latter has denied. As for Dutschke, he told reporters last week that he didn't have a relationship with Curtis. ""He's just a little nutty,"" he said. Yet while the last line of the letters to Obama, Wicker and Holland all contain Curtis's signature online catchphrase -- ""I am KC and I approve this message"" -- the newly unsealed affidavit ties them to Dutschke. Among them, it states that marks on the paper for all those letters match those of paper found in Dutschke's home and trash. Businessman, musician and convicted criminal . So who is James Everett Dutschke? He's held several jobs, including at the insurance company and owner of his tae kwon do dojo. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal described him as a musician. He was also an aspiring politician. He ran as a Republican against Democratic state Rep. Steve Holland, the son of Judge Sadie Holland, and lost. Judge Holland dismissed a civil lawsuit that Dutschke had filed against the witness who told investigators that Dutschke had talked about ""poison."" Dutschke is also no stranger to law enforcement. Last year, residents in his Tupelo neighborhood sought police help after, one neighbor says, Dutschke repeatedly exposed himself to young girls. The case resulted in a conviction on indecent exposure charges and a 90-day jail sentence. He's appealed the conviction, according to the Daily Journal newspaper. Then came another arrest on January 18, that is tied to the ricin case in two ways. In that case, according to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by CNN, Dutschke is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16. This arrest prompted him to close his tae kwon do dojo. After the arrest, he consented to the seizure of his laptop computer, a hard drive and several flash drives, the affidavit in the ricin case states. Investigators searched these and found that on New Year's Eve 2012 someone had downloaded a publication, ""Standard Operating Procedure for Ricin,"" about safely handling the toxin. They also found that another file, about a method for detecting ricin, had been downloaded about two hours later. But according to the affidavit, Dutschke insisted that he'd never researched anything about ricin and that he'd never even seen a castor bean. Whether it was Dutschke or someone else, and whatever their motivation, the ricin-tainted letters could have done more than make headlines or scare people. They could have killed. If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours due to the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote. In a seeming acknowledgment of these dangers, the FBI issued a statement Tuesday stating it had ""immediately sealed off"" Dutschke's former tae kwon do facility -- which is near an auto body shop and an ice cream parlor -- and contacted public health authorities in the interest of public safety. ""The FBI is now conducting further forensic examination for the purpose of identifying trace evidence, residues and signatures of production that could provide evidence to support the investigation,"" the agency said. CNN's Vivian Kuo reported from Mississippi, and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","NEW: FBI says tae kwon do site is ""sealed off"" and that a forensic examination is ongoing .

"(CNN) -- The Israel Defense Forces arrested two people it identified as responsible for the massacre of an Israeli family in the West Bank settlement of Itamar, officials said Sunday. The two suspects, Amjad Awad. 19. and Hakim Awad, 28, were caught in the nearby Palestinian village of Awarta, Israeli General Security Services said. Six others have been arrested for helping them. The pair are accused of killing Udi and Ruth Fogel and three of their children last month. The children were ages 11 years, 4 years and 3 months. The two men were members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, but acted independently, the security services said. They decided on the attack a few days before the killings, the officials said. According to the investigation, the pair were unsuccessful in an initial attempt to acquire a gun, but on the night of the killings broke into an empty house in the settlement and stole an M-16 rifle. They entered the Fogel's home and stabbed two of the children, before struggling with the parents and stabbing and shooting them, the security services said. They fled the house, fearing the shots would have been heard, but then returned to steal another weapon and stabbed the baby, the officials said. ""For the country, the fact that we promised and carried out the promise is witness to the fact that no such murder will ever leave our daily agenda,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday. ""We will get to such murderers whereever they are. This expresses our obligation to the idea of justice and our security."" The IDF continues to search for more perpetrators of the killing of the Fogel family, an IDF spokesman said. ""The murders of five family members including a 3-month (old) baby constitute a crossing of all red lines,"" Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said. ""The IDF has invested in numerous operational and intelligence efforts, and has worked closely with other security forces in order to find those responsible for this vicious murder."" The day after the five members of the Fogel family were killed, Israel approved the construction of several hundred housing units in the West Bank. The government approved the construction in the settlements of Gush Etzion, Maale Adumim, Ariel and Kiryat Sefer in a rare Saturday-night decision. Three Fogel children survived, including a 12-year-old daughter who was not home, and two younger children whose room the killers apparently did not notice.","Israel arrested two suspects .

"(CNN) -- Haleigh Jacobs and her husband, David, have spent the last two months in the hospital, hovering over their 8-pound newborn, Brantley. He has yet to spend a day outside the incubator, smell fresh air or go home to meet his siblings. Brantley's right leg juts out like a reddish brown lump of flesh that is thicker than his torso. His toes, indistinguishable from each other, look like dimples. The leg is studded with damaged blood vessels, veins and capillaries that look like raisins. Another lump protrudes from his abdomen. ""It is frustrating,"" his mother said. ""For one, being a parent, you feel helpless, and then, you've got a baby that's hurting."" But this is an improvement from what Brantley has endured. He had a rectal tear that spontaneously gushed blood and fluids. That has been healing. For families dealing with rare diseases, the road to a diagnosis is a long, winding one, riddled with confusion, complications and expenses. Although pop culture has left an impression that there is a genius doctor somewhere, like the fictional Dr. House who can identify and cure rare diseases, the reality is far different. After the diagnosis, the lack of answers or effective treatment can be completely unsatisfying. ""Two-thirds of the people with rare diseases are children, because these are genetic diseases,"" said Mary Dunkle, the vice president for communications at the National Organization for Rare Disorders. ""It's very often young parents with a new baby and they're very, very worried and very much in unfamiliar territory."" On December 28, the Jacobses, who are from Blanchard, Oklahoma, welcomed their second son. Brantley Lane Jacobs was born eight weeks early. ""I didn't get to see him,"" Haleigh Jacobs said, about after the birth. ""But I saw his leg. It was hard not to see his leg. ... I started bawling."" Brantley weighed 4 pounds, 3 ounces. His leg weighed 1 pound. The leg had puffed up because of a buildup of blood vessels, called hemangioma. The skin of his legs had stretched thin to encase the increasing swelling and had become fragile like a burn patient's. The leg required constant wrapping and moisturizing to prevent chapping and bleeding. Jacobs had learned before giving birth there was something unusual about her third baby. Twenty-one weeks into her pregnancy, she and her husband went to get an ultrasound to find out whether the baby was a boy or a girl. The specialists noticed an unusual lump on the fetus. When he was delivered, Brantley's physical state was perplexing. The doctors were baffled, Jacobs said. The swelling on Brantley's leg kept growing. Every time Brantley was moved or his leg touched, he would wince or scream. The hole near his rectum would bleed whenever someone tried to wipe him during a diaper change. Brantley has never been breastfed, because he's too fragile. His mother gingerly feeds him with a bottle, worried that any jerks or sudden movements could bother his skin. His doctors in Oklahoma called specialists and sent images and test results to other pediatricians and specialists around the country. Maybe, one of the doctor speculated, Brantley had Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, a rare childhood genetic disease. Another doctor suggested it could be CLOVES Syndrome, another rare vascular disease that causes malformations and has only been found in 80 people. Another doctor thought it could be a combination of both diseases, possibly a new condition. There are almost 7,000 rare diseases in the United States, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders. These tend to be complex diseases,"" said Dunkle. ""It's really not in any way bashing the professional medical community. People have a hard time getting a diagnosis, it's obviously distressing and difficult for families and patients."" The parents wanted to find someone who could help their son. Haleigh Jacobs e-mailed doctors and worked with doctors in Oklahoma to get referrals to other hospitals. In mid-February, Brantley was referred to Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. Jacobs took a leave from her job as a dispatcher for the police department and so did her husband, who works for a company that locates and marks underground gas and electric lines. Families are often encouraged to go to teaching hospitals on the theory that they will have a better chance there of interacting with medical professionals who may have seen something similar to their situations. When Brantley arrived in Arkansas, the diagnosis was Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, a rare disorder that appears in one in 100,000 children, said Dr. Gresham Richter, associate professor at the University of Arkansas for medical sciences. Richter sees about 30 cases a year at the hospital. The way Brantley presented with the disease was so unusual Richter said he has only seen it in two other patients. Some Klippel-Trenaunay patients have internal bleeding because of the malformation of blood vessels in organs such as the liver, heart, lungs and rectum. They usually have port wine marks on the skin and the growth of masses of blood vessels and varicose veins. ""It's usually a cutaneous birthmark that is red and inflamed. It becomes bigger and bigger,"" Richter said. ""It usually does not appear at birth like Brantley's does. It's a rare form of KTS, and the one that is most dangerous because it grows very quickly."" The swelling in Brantley's leg is caused by accumulating lymphatic fluids collecting in his leg. The muscles, tendons and bones in Brantley's right leg are being infiltrated, Richter said. There is no cure for the disease, which is often the case when dealing with rare diagnoses. ""The worst thing is to get a diagnosis and find out there's no treatment, no support group,"" Dunkle said. Sometimes that's how patient advocacy groups are formed, she added. Although the appearance of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is shocking, Richter said patients can have a normal life expectancy. Brantley will need laser surgery continually to remove the damaged blood vessels in his leg. The surgery does not address the underlying cause of the disease, which is believed to be genetic. His leg will have to be amputated at some point, Richter said. Brantley's parents are seeking a second opinion and another hospital as they contemplate their next step. They brought Brantley home for the first time this week. But the homecoming has been overshadowed by a looming medical decision. ""We have been going back and forth,"" she said. ""Do we tell them to take the leg? Is he going to be mad at us when he gets older?"" Her husband added that when they first learned of the malformation during pregnancy, they were given two options: abort Brantley or give birth and see what happens. ""That was an easy decision on our part,"" he said. ""This whole leg amputation, it has been left up to us. That's a tough decision because the decisions we have to make have nothing to do with us. It's for the betterment of him. Do we leave the leg and hope someone can fix it three or four years down the line?""","Brantley was born with 25% of his birth weight coming from a malformed leg .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Authorities accused pro-British extremists of exploiting protests in Northern Ireland over the Belfast City Council decision to stop a century-old tradition of flying the Union Jack year-round. The protests calling for the council to reverse its ruling over the flag continued Monday evening, police said. About 400 people gathered at Belfast City Hall as the City Council met for the first time since it voted to fly the British flag only on certain days, police said. The protest, which was mostly peaceful, was organized via social media, authorities said. In East Belfast, about 250 protestors gathered, and missiles such as petrol and paint bombs, fireworks and heavy masonry were thrown at police. Police responded with water cannon, authorities said, and overall calm had been restored Monday night. Four people, two males and two females, were arrested, accused of riot and public order violations, police said. Authorities say at least 52 officers have been wounded in protests. Read more: Fresh protests break out in Northern Ireland after night of violence . The chief constable for the Police Service of Northern Island put the blame for the violence on members of the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force, who were ""orchestrating violence for their own selfish motives."" The British flag, the Union Jack, has long been a flashpoint between British loyalists -- primarily Protestants -- who want to remain part of the United Kingdom and Irish nationalists calling for Northern Ireland to join Ireland. Northern Ireland's political leaders have called for an end to the pro-British protests, and politicians, clergy and community met Sunday to discuss possible ways to bring about an end to the unrest. ""Everyone involved needs to step back. The lack of control is very worrying,"" Chief Constable Matt Baggott told CNN. ""The only answer is a political solution."" A large number of police officers have been pulled away from their normal duties to deal with the demonstrations, Baggott said. If this continues, ""it will eat into our ability to deal with drugs, into our ability to deal with alcohol issues, and deal with what is a very severe dissident threat."" Among the more than 70 arrested since the protests began was a 38-year-old man who was arrested Saturday on suspicion of attempted murder and being in possession of a gun. Police said that at the time of the man's arrest, there were reports of shots being fired at police. Read more: Policewoman targeted as Northern Ireland tensions rise . The vote on the flag followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers injured. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as ""the Troubles."" Read more: Police: Loyalist paramilitaries behind Northern Ireland violence . The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, also known as the Belfast Agreement, effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants. Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.

"(CNN) -- Two months after a California mall was closed following a devastating fire, authorities had to close it again Monday night after Christmas singers clogged the shopping center. ""The enthusiasm for the Halleluiah event tonight was far greater than anticipated by organizers,"" said a statement from the Westfield Galleria at Roseville. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the center was evacuated. We apologize for this inconvenience."" The Sacramento Choral Society was holding what police called a ""well-publicized"" event to sing the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" in the mall's food court, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ""Come join our large Chorus of area Singers as they burst into Handel's Hallelujah Chorus much to the surprise and delight of Shoppers in the Food Court of the recently reopened Westfield Galleria at Roseville,"" the society's website trumpeted ahead of the event. But less than an hour beforehand, too many people had crowded into the mall. ""At 6:45 p.m., the Roseville Police and Fire communications center received reports that people in the food court heard popping noises and felt floor movement,"" a police statement said. Engineers later checked the structural integrity of the mall and found it to be safe. The holiday crowd and choral singers eventually got to raise their voices in song, but in the parking lot. Police said the mall, located about 18 miles northwest of Sacramento, will reopen Tuesday at 8 a.m. A large section of the mall burned on October 21, after a man set it on fire while barricaded inside a video game store, during a standoff with police. An investigation later showed that the sprinker system was shut off for more than an hour during the blaze. The damage was so severe that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency at the time. The governor's order suspended the normal one-week waiting period for mall employees to seek unemployment benefits.","A massive fire shut down the mall in late October .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The long lines of parked cars outside Dodger Stadium could have been the typical sign of an afternoon game featuring the Boys in Blue. But the massive crowd of cars at the stadium during the weekend had more to do with income than infield plays. Applicants wait their turn for an interview at the Dodger Stadium job fair on Saturday. A two-day job fair to fill some 500 part-time jobs during the baseball season, from stadium security to hawking beer during the games, attracted nearly 7,000 applicants. While many are no doubt fans of the Dodgers and would enjoy spending summer evenings at the ballpark, all were eager to convert their summer time into cash. With the team in Glendale, Arizona, for spring training, the stadium became a human resources arena for six hours both Saturday and Sunday during the 2009 Dodgertown Job Fair. Dodgers officials said they had expected as many as 10,000 applicants to show up during the weekend, based on similar job fairs held by other teams across the country as unemployment climbs and economic conditions worsen for many people. Despite a lower turnout, this year's crowd was ""significantly more"" than similar job fairs in previous years, team officials said, although no numbers for previous years were released. Joe Walsh, vice president of human resources for the Dodgers, said he wasn't surprised by the uptick in applicant numbers, with the downturn in the economy. ""The expectations (for the job fair) are much higher based on what we see in the unemployment rate,"" Walsh said. The jobs to be filled from the fair pay from $9.50 to $17 an hour, and they drew applicants from a broad spectrum of ages and backgrounds. Bob Reider, 68, came looking for a beer-cart job to supplement his Social Security check. For Reider, the money would help pay for tuition and books for his two youngest children in their final years of college. ""This is supposed to be the golden years, whatever that means,"" Reider said, adding, ""I am in excellent health, and I don't mind working and I got a good cause. So it all fits."" It's the economic downturn, Reider said, that has caused him to look for work in his senior years. ""It is very difficult to live on what we have today,"" he declared, noting the difficulty of the job search. ""It's almost impossible for me to find a reasonable daytime job at my age."" Security job applicant Jose Soto, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, made it clear he would be willing -- indeed, eager -- to work at all 81 of the team's home games. ""This is a great organization. Everyone would like to come to L.A. and work for the Dodgers,"" Soto said. On both days, applicants were handed individual, numbered wristbands at the entrance to the stadium. They sat and waited,  listening for their number to be called. Numbers were called in groups, and the groups filed to the suite level, where they filled out applications, then sat down for a preliminary interview that could last a few seconds or a few minutes, depending upon an applicant's experience and interest in a job. By many assessments, anyone looking for summer work will have a tough time this year. In January, the unemployment rate in California rose to 10.1 percent. ""We think the economy might reach bottom by this summer,"" said Nancy D. Sidhu, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. At the Dodgertown Job Fair, though, spirits were high. Reider, for example, got a boost of confidence after being told to expect a call back in the next week. ""I nailed it!"" he said with a laugh. As the thousands of applicants waited, some talked about the team that will take to the field here in a few weeks. One job they talked about was filling the Dodgers' high-profile opening in left field. The position, and a $45-million, two-year contract, was offered to slugger Manny Ramirez, but so far, no deal. At the job fair, applicant and Dodgers fan Jose Soto had some simple advice for Ramirez: . ""Don't wait for more,"" he said. ""Take the money now.""","Part-time jobs go from stadium security to hawking beer during the games .

"(CNN) -- A court in Pakistan has banned former President Pervez Musharraf from politics for life. Tuesday's move -- which can appealed by the controversial figure -- is another barrier in the roadblock Musharraf faces as he tries to get back into his country's political mix. The ruling by the high court in Peshawar follows similar ruling from lower courts and the Election Commission. Musharraf can pursue an appeal in the Peshawar court or take it to the country's Supreme Court. There was no immediate comment from Musharraf's camp. National elections are scheduled for next month. Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan recently under heavy security. After his return, Musharraf was placed in house arrest by an anti-terrorism court over allegations he illegally ordered the detention of judges in 2007. He denies the charges against him. The ex-military strongman still has to face two other cases dating from his time in power. The first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan -- before she was assassinated in 2007, weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office. Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006.","The ruling by the high court in Peshawar follows similar rulings from lower courts .

"(CNN) -- Russian authorities are stepping up security after a threat of violence at Madonna concerts this week, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow warned. ""The U.S. Consulate General in St. Petersburg has received information regarding a threat of physical violence against spectators and performers at the St. Petersburg concert on August 9,"" the embassy said in a statement Tuesday. State Department officials did not provide details about the reported threat targeting Madonna's Thursday show. ""U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant regarding their personal security, and to be aware of their surroundings at all times, especially in crowded areas,"" the embassy said. Madonna's spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg said the singer was aware of the threat and the embassy's warning. ""Concerts are going on as scheduled,"" Rosenberg said. Madonna performed Tuesday night at a packed Moscow stadium, where she expressed her support for the Russian female punk rock band Pussy Riot, whose members face up to seven years in prison for performing a song critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Madonna said she was praying for the three band members, who went on trial Monday charged with hooliganism, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. A verdict was reached in their case Wednesday but it won't be announced until August 17. ""Everyone has the right to free speech, everywhere in the world. Maria, Katya, Nadia, I pray for you,"" Madonna said at Tuesday's concert, according to RIA Novosti. ""They did something brave with their action. And I am praying for their freedom."" ""Are you with me?"" Madonna shouted. According to the state news agency, thousands of fans cheered, ""Yes!"" Music stars including Pete Townshend of The Who, Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand and Corinne Bailey Rae have also called on Russia to free the band members. Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square. In February, they screamed ""Mother Mary please drive Putin away"" during a concert inside Christ Savior Cathedral, one of Moscow's grandest cathedrals, outraging many of the country's faithful. The punk prayer was inspired by the women's anger about the relationship between the Russian government and the Orthodox Church, according to the band's manager, who is married to one of the suspects. The Orthodox leader Patriarch Kyril has been widely reported as saying Putin's years in power have been a miracle from God. CNN's Rachel Wells, Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva, Elise Labott and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: A verdict will be announced later in the case of a jailed punk rock band .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Forest Service is urging hunters and fishermen to keep their eyes open for marijuana growing operations in Wisconsin's Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest. Since 2008, nine marijuana growing operations have been discovered on public land within the state. Most recently, in late August, a fisherman visiting the forest happened upon a marijuana field that netted more than 8,000 plants worth $8 million. ""The fisherman was walking along the banks of the Oconto River and noticed these patches that had been cleared and disturbed. Trees were down, things didn't look right, and he reported that to authorities, and a surveillance operation was established,"" said Jane Cliff, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service eastern region. Marijuana legalization: Worth pursuing? Approximately 150 federal, state, tribal and local law enforcement agents were involved in the sting that followed, leading to the arrest of seven people. All of the suspects pleaded guilty and are in prison awaiting trial. The suspects each face anywhere from 10 years to life in prison, a maximum fine of $10 million and five years to life of supervised release. The Department of Justice could not comment on details of the investigation because the case is still working its way through the judicial system. But this isn't the first time this has happened, the Forest Service says. It's actually the third big bust in three years at the forest, resulting in the eradication of more than 80,000 marijuana plants that were cultivated by large drug trafficking organizations. That's why authorities say they are reaching out to hunters in their regulation books and offering them training programs, warning them to be careful and asking them to note the GPS location of any suspicious areas and call the authorities as soon as they can. ""Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest is large, secluded and heavily roaded, so our personnel cannot by themselves keep an eye on every acre,"" Cliff said. ""That's why we are relying on forest users to share information with us."" By using covert digital cameras, GPS devices and ground and aerial surveillance, law enforcement officials do what they can to apprehend illegal marijuana growers who frequently switch up their patterns to avoid detection. ""We conduct aerial surveillance, and we have seen a change in the growers' tactics. A number of years ago, there would be large multithousand plant fields concentrated in one area, and now they have a couple of hundred plants in one location and then another couple hundred plants a couple hundred yards away which makes aerial detection more difficult,"" said David Spakowicz, the director of field operations for the Wisconsin Department of Justice's criminal investigation division. Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said he and special agents at the Wisconsin Department of Justice are ""not only aggressively investigating and eradicating these grows, but also working with our local and federal partners to hold accountable the individuals responsible for operating such grow operations."" Highs and lows of using marijuana . ""That kind of aggressive eradication and enforcement ought to send a message to those who think they can profit from growing illegal drugs on Wisconsin's public lands, threatening our natural resources and potentially the people who enjoy them,"" he said in a statement to CNN. Spakowicz says that every occupied marijuana growing operation that led to arrests has also resulted in the seizure of firearms, and they've also found ammunition left behind by other growers. The concern is that a person walking through the forest will come across not only an illegal grow operation, but also heavily armed growers. ""If they are protecting $10 million of marijuana plants, that's a lot of money, and there have been gun battles with law enforcement in other states such as California,"" Spakowicz said. ""We worry that they will bring the same level of violence with them."" Because the concern for public safety is so great, the state attorney general's office works in conjunction with the Department of Justice to strongly prosecute marijuana growers. ""We believe we need to arrest people in order to send a message to these marijuana growers that they are not welcome in Wisconsin and that their activities will be not be accepted,"" Spakowicz said. Wisconsin is targeting illegal marijuana growers because it has millions of acres of remote public land. According to the state Department of Justice, 32 people have been arrested for illegally growing marijuana since 2008, and most were non-U.S. citizens in the country illegally. All of the suspects are expected to serve their sentences before they are deported, the department says. Several suspects interviewed by law enforcement said they were recruited from California to come to Wisconsin. In some cases they were told openly that they are to work in a marijuana growing operation, while in other cases they came believing they were to work in a restaurant. Some suspects also said they didn't even know what state they were in. Suzanne Flory, public affairs officer for the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, said that these growers operate on a large scale. ""They are large, drug trafficking organizations; they are not mom and pop operations,"" she said. ""These are people doing this to make a lot of money."" The operations also cause serious damage to the forest. The growers chop down trees to let sunlight filter through to their plants, divert water away from trout streams and filter harmful chemicals back into the water. ""It causes a lot of environmental damage from soil erosion and it increases sedimentation in rivers and streams which affects the fish. There is possibility of chemical runoff from poisons and other wastes,"" Flory said. ""They destroy the vegetation and leave their garbage behind. ""It leaves a scar on the landscape,"" she said.","80,000 marijuana plants eradicated in Wisconsin forest .

"(CNN) -- Bradley Wiggins is hot favorite for overall victory, but Mark Cavendish will be keeping the race leader's Maglia Rosa jersey warm for his fellow countryman after a blistering finish to win the opening stage of the Giro d'Italia Saturday. Cavendish came with a late charge on the seafront in Naples to pip home rider Elia Viviani of the Cannondale team on the line. Frenchman Nacer Bouhanni was third in the 130km opener around the southern Italian city. It was a reminder, if any was needed, of Cavendish's incredible finishing speed as he claimed his 11th Giro stage victory and his first in a Grand Tour for new team Omega Pharma Quick Step. The 27-year-old had to do it the hard way as lead out man Gert Steegmans had a mechanical problem in the final kilometer and Cavendish was left to make up a small gap before unleashing his late burst. Viviani was left thumping his handlebars in frustration at such a near miss while Cavendish acknowledged it had been a hard fought win. ""That was a difficult, difficult stage for me. The team were incredible in staying in front but we didn't get it right at the end. ""It's cost us a lot recently but I managed to come round and win. I really wanted that so badly. He will take an eight second time bonus lead over Viviani, with Bouhanni 12 seconds behind, into Sunday's 17.5km team time trial on the island of Ischia. Cavendish spent a single season with Wiggins at Team Sky last season, claiming the final stage of the Tour de France as his teammate made history by becoming the first Briton to win the historic race. But with Sky placing the emphasis on riders like Wiggins and Chris Froome in winning the overall classification at races such as the Tour and Giro, he left to join Omega in the close season. Wiggins and his Sky team will be expected to make their move on Sunday's stage. The reigning Tour de France champion finished safely in the bunch, which split after a late crash, leaving Cavendish and a clutch of other sprint specialists to fight out the finish. Canada's Ryder Hesjedal of the Garmin-Sharp team is the defending champion at the Giro with Astana's Vincenzo Nibali carrying the main home hopes.","Mark Cavendish wins Giro d'Italia opening stage in Naples .

"(CNN) -- In an era when shadowy hackers can snatch secret government files and humble big businesses with seeming ease, it's an unavoidable question as Election Day approaches: When we go to the polls, could our very votes be at risk? According to voting-security experts, the answer can be boiled down to a bit of campaign-speak: There are reasons for concern and there is work to be done but, by and large, we're better off now than we were four years ago. ""In general terms, the nation as a whole is moving toward more resilient, more recountable, evidence-based voting systems and that's a good thing,"" said Pamela Smith, president of the Verified Voting Foundation. ""We're better off than we were a couple of election cycles ago by a long shot and we're better off than we were in the last election, too. ""We're seeing improvement, but we're still seeing immense challenges."" Since there have been elections, there has been tampering with votes. Archaeologists digging in a well discovered a dumped stash of 190 broken pottery shards that appear to have been used by ancient Athenians for a vote in 471 B.C. But in 2012, election-security advocates are most worried about the bits and bytes of data stored on the electronic voting machines that millions of Americans will use to cast their ballot. More than 45 million U.S. voters, or one out of every four who go to the polls, will cast a ballot on a machine that stores votes electronically, but doesn't create a paper ballot, according to Verified Voting. Six states -- Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey and South Carolina -- use those machines exclusively and they're used by a ""heavy majority"" of voters in another five -- including presidential battleground states Pennsylvania and Virginia. Some of these paperless machines are also used in the key states of Ohio, Florida and Colorado, where the presidential race is expected to be close. Hacking the vote: Internet systems remain insecure . Paper trails . Here's the problem, advocates say. When there's no physical ballot, it becomes next to impossible to determine whether there has been tampering, or some other kind of irregularity, in a close election. ""If the election is predicted to be a landslide, and then it is, really the problems we're concerned about aren't that big a deal, because everyone knows the election went the way it was supposed to,"" said Avi Rubin, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in computer security. But in cases like 2000's razor-thin Bush-Gore race, ""a lot of the Democratic supporters felt like the election was stolen from them. That's a situation you can end up with in a very, very close election, so it's even more important to have confidence in the election machinery."" That appears to be the case again in 2012. Most national polls place President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney in a dead heat. Ironically, the electronic machines that experts now worry about began showing up in polling places as a reaction to Florida's messy 2000 vote count, with its butterfly ballots and dimpled chads. In a nightmare for election officials, that race ended in controversy, with the U.S. Supreme Court halting a manual recount and awarding the state, and the presidency, to George W. Bush. In the wake of that election, federal and state money flowed to update voting systems. Election officials acted quickly -- too quickly, some experts say, to see potential problems. Sandy has election officials scrambling . Machine error . As cumbersome and unsightly as Florida's recount was, at least it was a recount. With electronic voting, analysts say that if there's a question about vote totals, there is little to do other than press ""Enter"" again and let the same computer system that counted the votes the first time count them again. ""Spending money on a problem works best for well-understood problems, such as building roads or fixing bridges ...,"" reads a recent report from the CalTech/MIT Voting Technology Project, created by the two schools in the wake of the 2000 election. ""Congress gave funds to the states immediately, so the states bought large numbers of voting systems that were then available, before new standards were developed and adopted; it's a good example of the maxim denoting precipitous action, 'Ready, fire, aim!' "" Analysts like Smith and Rubin agree that the first concern with these systems is mechanical failure or human error. They cite cases like a 2006 Florida election, in which electronic machines in one county recorded no vote in a congressional race on 18,000 ballots, even though it was the most high-profile contest on the ticket. Or the 2004 election in North Carolina when an overloaded machine lost 4,500 votes, affecting a race for state agriculture commissioner that was decided by fewer votes than that. ""Imagine how nervous you would be if the only copy of your term paper was on one disc somewhere,"" Rubin said. ""Now, we're talking about a whole bunch of votes sitting on a cartridge somewhere. Even before we worry about tampering, we have to worry about accidental loss."" Vote hacking . While there have been no documented cases of foul play, experts say the potential for malicious hacking is very real. ""It would be a simple, high-school level programming project to do something like this,"" Rubin said. ""I've seen the code. A lot of the code has already been seen on the Internet. You could see exactly how to encode a ballot. Someone with a proficient high-school level programming capability would be able to do it. Definitely any experienced programmer could do it."" He said a standard, touchscreen voting machine could have its data changed with $20 worth of hardware and a paper clip, a fact that gets more troubling now that expanded early voting has put votes on machines stored in schools, churches and other polling places for weeks before Election Day. As early as 2003, a team of researchers commissioned by the state of Maryland reported that machines from vendor Diebold were poorly engineered and showed a ""high risk of compromise."" Their findings, as noted by the CalTech/MIT report, included the fact that every one of the company's voting systems used the exact same ""secret"" encryption key. After a wave of negative press, including a 2006 HBO documentary called ""Hacking Democracy"" that explored the vulnerability of its electronic voting machines, Diebold removed its name from its voting systems in 2007 and was later bought by another company. Thankfully, critics say, such issues are now being minimized on multiple fronts. However, there are still some concerns in hotly contested states like Ohio. While all machines in Ohio are equipped with printers that create paper ballots, about half the counties in the state use the sort of touchscreen electronic machines that concern observers like Smith. Those machines have been retrofitted with printers, but tampering risks still exist and comparing electronic ballots with separately created paper ones can be confusing, analysts say. More secure? In the short term, observers like California Institute of Technology political science professor R. Michael Alvarez say elections officials are almost universally aware of the security risks that electronic voting presents. ""There are security issues associated with both the electronic voting machines that are used in polling places, as well as the ballot reading devices. ... In many cases, those kinds of security vulnerabilities are relatively well known at this point,"" said Alvarez, whose research includes voting technology. ""Many of them have been studied, although certainly new ones may arise,"" he said. ""Over the last four to six years, elections officials throughout the country have tested and really tried to work to better secure those voting systems."" With an eye to the future, elections officials throughout the United States have stopped purchasing machines that don't create a paper trail, with a return to optical- or digital-scanner machines using paper ballots being the preferred alternative. Some states are retrofitting electronic voting machines with hardware that creates a paper ballot as well. Smith said it has been about seven years since the last significant purchase of electronic-only voting machines in the United States. ""It's not always the newest, shiniest thing that's the best thing and, in voting, that tends to be particularly true,"" she said. In the meantime, she's got a simple piece of advice for anyone worried about the security of their ballot. ""The most important thing for voters to keep in mind is that one way to make sure your vote won't count is to not show up,"" she said. ""Whatever system is presented to you, avail yourself of it.""","Experts say voting security in the U.S. is improving, but there's work to do .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've slaughtered more than a million chickens infected with bird flu. Investigators detected the virus in 18 farms in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, Mexico's Agriculture Ministry said this week. Chickens there were infected with the H7N3 virus, which Mexican authorities said does not pose a threat to humans. ""This virus is exclusive to birds, so there is no risk for public safety,"" the Agriculture Ministry said earlier this month. Authorities offered different tallies of how many infected birds had been slaughtered. Agriculture Minister Enrique Martinez said Monday that more than 2.1 million chickens had been killed -- including 519,000 egg-producing chickens, 722,265 breeding chickens and 900,000 chickens raised for meat. On Tuesday, Javier Usabiaga Arroyo, a state agriculture official, said the total number of infected chickens killed was about 1.2 million, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported. Officials have vaccinated 1.9 million birds since the outbreak began earlier this month, and they plan to vaccinate millions more, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement this week. The outbreak has sparked concern about a possible spike in food prices, but authorities said Monday that the number of slaughtered chickens is a small fraction of the country's overall population and there is no reason for egg or chicken prices to increase. ""The outbreak of avian influenza is controlled,"" Mexico's food safety agency said in a statement. Other strains of bird flu have spread to humans and prompted authorities to slaughter animals. In 1997, authorities in Hong Kong killed about 1.5 million chickens after H5N1 avian influenza passed from birds to humans there. Last year a new strain of H3N8 flu jumped from birds to mammals and was responsible for the death of more than 160 seals off the New England coast. Cambodia sees spike in bird flu deaths .

"London, England (CNN) -- Female role models are a very powerful and positive image to implant into young girls' psyches. In a recent study of 1000 UK women aged 18 to 60, the lack of role-models emerged as one of the top barriers to female success in the workplace. A mindset shift in girls cannot be achieved by inspirational Instagram memes and philosophical Facebook statuses, but by closing the gap between the success they see or have heard of, and the ideas that they hold about themselves. Founded in 2011, I'mPOSSIBLE seeks to empower young girls and women, specifically those of color, to define success on their own terms, and inspire them through life stories of those who never lost sight of their possibilities. Last Thursday I held the first youth edition of the I'mPOSSIBLE conversation at the UK House of Commons, in partnership with UK MP Diane Abbott. The event was organized to commemorate the 21st anniversary of Bring Your Daughters to Work Day, which shares the same goals of giving young girls the opportunity to express how they envisage their future. Having the chance to see parental figures in professional roles helps schoolgirls combat gender stereotypes, addresses self-esteem issues, and provides them with tangible examples of role models from their own culture and ethnicity. Michelle Obama is a strong supporter of the day and brings over 180 children to the White House to spend the morning discovering different paths their futures may hold. Over 37 million participants marked the day in the U.S. last year, and we took part in the only official UK event of the program, which was acknowledged by the Obamas in a personal message sent to us. Leading by example . In its short existence I'mPOSSIBLE has already hosted numerous trailblazing professionals such as Margaret Casely-Hayford, head of legal services at John Lewis, Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock MBE, a space scientist, and Hope Powell CBE, England women's football coach. The youth edition welcomed five successful young women of color from the worlds of media, film, and law who all shared their life stories with girls aged 12 to 18 from London schools and youth projects. We hope that these girls, sitting in the home of the UK government, felt inspired by leading women from similar backgrounds to theirs, who faced many of the same challenges but nonetheless carved a path to success, while staying true to themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simone Bresi-Ando.","I'mPOSSIBLE is a social enterprise aiming to inspire young girls of color by promoting role models .

"(CNN) -- Frankel and Black Caviar. The burning question in the horse racing world is whether its two biggest stars will ever get together. While that once meant ""Who would win if they went head to head?"" now all the talk is about what they might produce given time and a bit of privacy. And, just as importantly, how much would that coupling be worth in the mega-bucks breeding stakes? Both horses have swept all before them in illustrious careers. Frankel has posted nearly $3 million in prize money for the Juddmonte Farm stables, with an unbeaten run in 12 encounters. Black Caviar has also done well for her owners, with 22 wins on courses in Australia and the UK in the past four years. Frankel is now rated as the best performer on the flat in the world by race statistics company Timeform -- which since 1948 has been using a mathematical equation comparing race results to the weight of the horse plus distance run to create a hierarchy which is used in many form guides for racegoers and owners. While performance on the turf is not always a leading indication of performance in retirement, top bloodstock experts say Frankel's lifetime value in stud could be around $155 million. ""Frankel will have the pick of the best mares when it is time for him to stud, and there is no mare out there at the moment attracting as much attention as Black Caviar,"" says Johnny McKeever, who has 25 years of experience in buying horses which have gone on to win major Group One meets around the world. ""If you own a good mare and you can afford the stud fees Frankel will command, why wouldn't you want to put forward your horse to breed with him?"" he told CNN. And that initial stud fee is set to break the current world record held by Irish horse Sea The Stars, who earned nearly $7 million in prize money from a series of wins in major Group One races such as the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe and the Epsom Derby. ""Sea The Stars commanded a $133,000 fee at the start, so it is not impossible that Frankel's first valuation will be around $155,000 and that may be a touch on the conservative side,"" McKeever said. ""There are no guarantees with this, and the performance of a horse on the course is not always a marker it can be successful in creating the next generation. But Frankel's achievements in racing, coupled with his bloodline, means he would be more likely to sire a good racing performer."" Bloodstock valuations have come down from the crazy prices of a decade ago, when horses would sell for $10 million as purchasers found it difficult to secure a return on their investment with falling prize money at racecourses around the world. But the high end of the market is still very lucrative, with yearlings from top breeds selling at $2 million. The statistics show exactly why a Frankel-Black Caviar horse would be much fancied on a racetrack. Frankel commands a Timeform rating of 147, which is well above the average for a Group One race winner of 129. Black Caviar is the highest rated filly of all time, rated at 136. ""Ever since he was a three-year-old, Frankel has seemed determined to get better and better,"" Timeform's flat racing editor David Johnson told CNN. ""He had already rated at 140 by his first 2000 Guineas victory last year, and by the Queen Anne Stakes at Ascot this year he had overtaken Seabird as the greatest horse since records began. ""It seems a shame that his owners do not want to test him at the longer distances, and I think what we are possibly seeing now is a winding down of his attendances with the chance he will be at stud by next year. It is unlikely we will see him at the Breeders' Cup or the Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe."" Black Caviar, who turns six this month, may be retiring at roughly the same time. Trainer Peter Moody is still undecided whether she will get a few more run-outs as part of a farewell tour of Australian courses, or whether June's Ascot appearance was her last race. The cult status achieved by both horses has spawned a lucrative sideline business, with everything from Black Caviar cufflinks priced at $42 to a $15 Frankel coffee mug available through online stores. Goodwood's recent sellout crowd was largely down to the attendance of Frankel and both have their own Twitter pages. Despite the desires of the racing industry to see these giants of flat racing procreate, there are two hurdles to overcome. First is whether Frankel's owners want this to happen. There is a feeling in the industry at the moment that, come the day Juddmonte decide to put him out to stud, they may want him to pair with mares already in their stable so they get to reap the rewards of whatever he will produce. However, that may be just for the first crop of the next generation, and they may be happy to let Frankel go to stud elsewhere later on in his career. The second problem might be a little bit harder to overcome. The path of true love is not easy for humans, and it is no less an issue for horses. ""At the end of the day there is no guarantee that Frankel and Black Caviar will take to each other. They might not like one another, much like some humans are unlikely to mate,"" McKeever said. ""That is why, however much racehorse fans would like to see this happen, and however much money is offered to make it happen, the only two beings that can ensure it does are Black Caviar and Frankel.""","Frankel has won $1.8 million in prize money so far but he could be worth $155 million in stud .

"(CNN) -- The three men who the FBI announced it is seeking information about could ""possibly be implicated"" in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday. The official said the men were at the scene of the September 11 attack, and it is unclear if they were involved or just could have knowledge about what occurred that night. The men are not characterized as suspects in the FBI's material, said the source, who has been briefed on the investigation. Another federal law enforcement official would only comment: ""We want to talk to them."" The men ""may be able to provide information to help in the investigation,"" the FBI said in a statement. The FBI released pictures of the three men -- each labeled as ""unknown person"" -- on its website and asked people to e-mail tips to BenghaziTips@ic.fbi.gov. The photos came from surveillance video taken the night of the attack on a diplomatic facility and CIA annex.

"(CNN) -- Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell, no stranger to provocative opinions, is at it again. During a recent interview in Toronto, Gladwell said that people a half-century from now will revere Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates but will have no clear memory of his longtime tech rival, Apple chief Steve Jobs. ""Of the great entrepreneurs of this era, people will have forgotten Steve Jobs. 'Who was Steve Jobs again?' But ... there will be statues of Bill Gates across the Third World,"" Gladwell said. ""There's a reasonable shot that -- because of his money -- we will cure malaria."" Of Gates, whose foundation has given more than $2 billion to causes around the world, Gladwell said: ""I firmly believe that 50 years from now he will be remembered for his charitable work. No one will even remember what Microsoft is."" Gladwell made the comments late last month during a public appearance at the Toronto Public Library. His remarks began drawing attention this week after the library posted a video clip of the interview online (the Gates-Jobs stuff starts around the 9:30 mark). Gladwell's popular nonfiction books include ""Blink"" and ""The Tipping Point."" His most recent book, ""Outliers,"" attempts to explain what factors separate highly successful people from average ones. ""We need to be clear when we venerate entrepreneurs what we are venerating,"" Gladwell said in Toronto. ""They are not moral leaders. If they were moral leaders, they wouldn't be great businessmen."" Gladwell did not elaborate on why he believes Jobs' legacy won't endure, although he made some unflattering comments about the late Apple co-founder, who died in October 2011. ""Every single idea he ever had came from somebody else. And he would be the first to say this. He would also take credit for things. He was shameless. He was an extraordinarily brilliant businessman and entrepreneur. He was also a self-promoter on a level that we have rarely seen."" Even so, Gladwell said he was fascinated by Walter Isaacson's recent biography of Jobs. For him, the most extraordinary moment in the book came near the end, when Jobs lay on his deathbed but refused to wear an oxygen mask because of its inelegant design. ""To him it was like making him send his final e-mails using Windows,"" Gladwell said, to laughter from the audience. ""A man has to draw the line somewhere, right?""","Author Malcolm Gladwell: In time, ""people will have forgotten Steve Jobs""

"(CNN) -- One person was killed and 17 others injured after a freight train derailed in northwestern Belgium, a local official told CNN. Several explosions and a fire broke out following the derailment, according to Infrabel, the state-owned company that operates Belgian railways. The exact cause of the reported death was not immediately known. The train, owned the by the Belgian freight company SNCB Logistics, derailed between the towns of Schellebelle and Wetteren, near Ghent. Some 350 area residents were evacuated from the area because some of the derailed wagons were carrying the toxic chemical compound acrylonitrile, said Peter Mertens spokesman for the local governor. Mertens reported the casualties. Exposure to acrylonitrile, can cause mucus membrane irritation, headaches, dizziness, and nausea, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","One person was killed after a train derailed in Belgium .

"(CNN) -- During the past 57 years, I have crossed paths with some amazingly inspirational people. A few of these are friendships from my childhood that have endured the test of time. Others are special bonds I've formed with a handful of people that I have met during my adult life, and include both personal and professional acquaintances. For reasons that are as unique as the individuals themselves, each of them motivates me to dig deep within myself and find whatever it takes to succeed whenever the going gets tough. On March 19, Tom Clements was fatally shot when he answered his door in El Paso County, Colorado. Mr. Clements was the executive director of Colorado's prison system -- where I've worked for 25 years. Since his death, much has been said about the leadership, vision and direction that he provided to the Colorado Department of Corrections. As significant as this impact was, the inspiration that I gained from him comes from the way that he lived his life as a husband, father, brother, son and friend. The key to fitness? Schedule it in . This inspiration is not based on a close personal friendship between Mr. Clements and I. The most powerful and effective leaders are those who lead based on the same core values that they use in their personal lives. Tom Clements was that type of leader. When I found out that I was accepted to the Fit Nation team, I e-mailed my entry video to my immediate supervisor, the director, and Mr. Clements so they would know what I would be doing this year and why. I knew they would be supportive of me, as they always have been. What I didn't anticipate was the genuine enthusiasm and encouragement I would receive from Mr. Clements. From the very beginning, he let me know that not only did I have his full support, but that he himself would have loved to have the same opportunity. He made me promise that I would share every article, blog and update on my adventure with him. His response stemmed from his own passion for staying physically fit and taking advantage of the great outdoors, especially all that Colorado has to offer. He told me that one of his goals when he retired from his 31-year career with the Missouri Department of Corrections was to ride his bicycle through each of the lower 48 states. Turns out he was an avid cyclist. The last time that I saw Mr. Clements was about a month before he was killed. It was at a two-day meeting in Denver. It was customary for him to open these meetings by speaking to the group about how we were doing on meeting our strategic goals and objectives, and to listen to any questions or concerns that we had. This time was no different. But what I will remember the most is that before the meeting started he sat down next to me and asked how my training was going. He didn't ask just to be asking -- he really wanted to know, and smiled when I told him how I was already way outside of my comfort zone (in a good way). As he always did, he made me promise to keep him posted on my progress. He even opened the meeting by making sure everyone in the group knew I was training for a triathlon. He added that I was his inspiration. 6 people who will inspire you this year . I was so surprised that I could be an inspiration to someone of his stature. I was very honored and humbled. From that moment forward, any time I felt like I was too tired, too stressed, or didn't have time to train, I would hear him telling my peers that I was his inspiration. There was no way I was going to let him down. I cannot begin to compare the impact his death has had on me personally to the tremendous loss that his family and friends will experience for the rest of their lives. But those that have led our corrections system since that tragic night have made it clear that, as a tribute to Mr. Clements, we will keep moving forward. With that in mind, I have decided to dedicate my training for the Nautica Malibu Triathlon, and the event itself on September 8, to him. I am now even more committed to making sure he is proud of me each step along the way. For those of you that, like me, sometimes doubt your own ability or motivation when the going gets tough, try focusing on a personal hero, and do it for them. It works!","Tom Clements was fatally shot when he answered his door on March 19 .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government has said it will let the United Nations enter the country and deliver humanitarian aid to people in need, a U.N. official said Tuesday. ""After a long time of very intense negotiations, we now have an agreement in writing with the Syrian government on the scale, scope and modality of humanitarian action in Syria,"" John Ging, director of operations at the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in Geneva, Switzerland. ""Whether it's a breakthrough or not will depend on the action on the ground. I cannot predict what that will be, but we will work very hard to make it a breakthrough, because the people of Syria need us to break through with a much bigger humanitarian response."" Ging said the Syrian government has signed a memorandum that describes the planned humanitarian response for the approximately 1 million people who need humanitarian aid urgently. 'Audacious steps' needed in Syria, Arab diplomats says . The announcement followed a meeting between international aid organizations and representatives of the Syrian Arab Republic, the third such meeting and the first to result in an agreement, he said. In New York, the U.N. Undersecretary for Humanitarian Affairs, Valerie Amos, said the need is urgent. ""If we don't get significant numbers of people in on the ground supporting the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, supporting those small NGOs (nongovernmental organizations) that are doing what they can, we are not going to be able to shift this,"" she told CNN International's ""Amanpour."" The announcement of the delivery of humanitarian aid came the same day that Syria announced that it was expelling diplomats from 11 countries. The tit-for-tat move comes a week after those nations expelled Syrian officials in response to a massacre. Residents of Houla, where more than 100 people were killed, nearly half of them children, pleaded via Skype for basic necessities. Houla massacre: Tipping point, but in what direction? ""For more than 10 days now, the criminal regime forces have cut off basic food items from entering Houla area,"" said the statement from the opposition Houla Media Center. ""They stopped flour, gas and medicine from coming in, and they continue to cut off electricity because the main supplying plant was hit by the sporadic shelling. ... We call on relief and human rights organizations to help us and open humanitarian corridors for basic items so you do not become collaborators in the (regime's) massacres."" President Bashar al-Assad's regime denies responsibility for the massacre and has said it is fighting to stop ""armed terrorist groups."" To press for tough action against the Syrian regime, the United States is sending a delegation to Russia this week led by special adviser Frederic Hof, a senior Obama administration official said. The official was not authorized to speak on the record. Russia and China have previously used their veto power to block passage of U.N. resolutions condemning al-Assad's regime. Both countries have major trade deals with Syria. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said talks between Russia and the United States ""continue at various levels,"" the state-run news agency RIA Novosti said. Could Russia help push out al-Assad? Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, spoke out against Russia on Tuesday after a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Jeddah. ""We feel that the position which Russia has taken so far at the Security Council is unjustified,"" he said. ""And we hope that Russia will re-evaluate its stance towards this region, especially Syria. If Russia is careful about its relations with Syria, then I believe it is mistaken to stand as an obstacle against the popular Syrian position. ""It is time for Russia to change its position from standing by the Syrian regime to sincerely try to stop the violence and support a peaceful transition of power,"" al-Faisal added. Syria's Foreign Ministry said diplomats from the United States, Britain, Switzerland, Turkey, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany and Canada were being declared persona non grata. Among them is U.S. Ambassador Robert Ford, who has been in the United States since February, when the U.S. government closed its embassy in Damascus. But a U.S. official said Ford will keep working. ""This certainly isn't going to stop Ambassador Ford from continuing his important outreach to the Syrian people,"" Deputy State Department Spokesman Mark Toner said in Washington. ""He's going to continue our efforts to support a peaceful political transition for which the Syrian people have so bravely fought."" British Ambassador Simon Collis, who is in Britain, is on the list as well. Turkey's ambassador and all members of the embassy -- diplomats and administrators -- are expelled, the Syrian Foreign Ministry said. All members of the Canadian Embassy are listed as well. Last week, Syria expelled the Dutch charge d'affaires after the Netherlands was among countries expelling Syrian diplomats. Despite the expulsions, Syria ""stresses the importance of dialogue based on principles of equality and mutual respect between nations, and diplomacy is the necessary vehicle to connect with countries to resolve conflicts between countries, and pending issues,"" the Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. ""We hope that those countries that took this step believe in adopting these principles to allow the relationship to go back to its normal state of being."" The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that 51 people were killed Tuesday in the nation, including 12 in Latakia province, where the opposition clashed with regime forces on the outskirts of Hiffa. Residents of the Hiffa area ""have issued a call for help to the U.N. observers after the regime's shelling in the area, and are warning of an impending massacre with the entry of Shabiha to the city,"" the Local Coordination Committees said. U.N. and U.S. officials have blamed the Shabiha militia, acting on behalf of the government, for the massacre in Houla. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition group, also reported the clashes Tuesday on the outskirts of Hiffa, saying at least 11 opposition members were killed: two civilians and nine rebel fighters. Dozens of civilians were wounded, the group said. Medical sources and activists reported at least 22 members of the Syrian security forces and government militia killed as well, the observatory said. Separately, ""A colonel in the Syrian army was shot and killed outside his house, in the city of Deir Ezzor, by unknown gunmen,"" the observatory said on its Facebook page. Syria, on state-run news agency SANA, said ""armed terrorist groups"" killed three officers. Seventeen ""army and law enforcement martyrs"" were buried Tuesday, Syria said. The head of the U.N. observer mission in Syria, Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, met in Damascus on Tuesday for more than an hour with Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad, the United Nations said. Meanwhile, U.N. observers in Hama found the atmosphere tense, the United Nations said. ""There is heavy military presence and several roadblocks where residents are stopped and screened. Tanks and armored vehicles are still visible on the outskirts of the city. The streets are empty, and many shops are closed. Many residents have fled their homes, and those that remain are mourning the loved ones they have lost,"" a U.N. statement said.

"(CNN) -- Four weeks after inconclusive elections left Italy without a functioning government, Italy's president on Friday asked center-left politician Pier Luigi Bersani to try to form one. The decision came after meetings this week between political leaders and ceremonial president Giorgio Napolitano, as they tried to determine what to do after February's elections left a three-way split between the right, the left and the wild-card party of Beppe Grillo. Bersani fared the best in the February elections by leading a leftist coalition to a small majority in the lower house of parliament. But he was unable to win a majority in the Senate, where it counts. Instead, power in the Senate was divided between Bersani and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's center-right coalition, anchored by his party, Popolo della Liberta, or People of Freedom. Bersani and Berlusconi are archrivals who indicated they would not work together. The post-election gridlock has helped to hobble Italy's economy. After the elections failed to produce a government, international ratings agency Fitch downgraded Italy's credit rating from A- to BBB+ and warned of further risks if political uncertainty continues and reforms and austerity measures are stalled. The nation is in its longest recession in 20 years. Its economy -- Europe's third-largest with a government debt the Treasury Ministry puts at $2.6 trillion -- shrank by 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012, Eurobarometer says.

"(CNN) -- It appeared an unlikely meeting: Earlier this month, representatives from Hollywood, home of the anything-goes lifestyle and anything-can-happen film, traveled to Iran, where censorship and constant government supervision are a fact of life for the film industry. American actress Annette Bening, right, attends a workshop with Iranian actresses during her stay in Iran. But the two sides had more in common than it would appear, said Sid Ganis, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. ""It was thrilling to be in Iran, just plain old thrilling,"" said Ganis. ""We talked. ... We spoke the same language, the language of movies."" In Iran, ""the language of movies"" has thrived since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, despite strict censorship laws, said Duke professor Negar Mottahedeh, author of ""Displaced Allegories: Post-Revolutionary Iranian Cinema."" A number of post-revolution Iranian films have screened at international film festivals, and some, such as Abbas Kiarostami's ""Taste of Cherry,"" have won international awards. Creativity and prohibition often have an ""intimate relationship,"" Mottahedeh said, observing that ""film cultures have flourished oftentimes when they have been under restrictions."" Iran's film association, known as the House of Cinema, was host of the Hollywood trip. The American delegation, which included Ganis, producer Bill Horberg and actress Annette Bening, took part in a cultural dialogue with prominent Iranian screenwriters, actors and directors, sharing their ideas on filmmaking and taking part in workshops and film screenings. ""It's hard to get Iranian films distributed in Iran because ... there aren't that many cinemas,"" Ganis said. ""And then, of course, the government intrudes on the process with a certain censorship set of rules and [regulations]."" But, citing a recent Iranian film called ""About Elly,"" directed by Asghar Farhadi -- scheduled to be screened at this year's Tribeca Film Festival -- Ganis said Iranian filmmakers are still able to release high-quality films. ""We are expecting the Iranian film industry to continue to flourish in terms of the creativity that we saw when we were there,"" Ganis said. ""At the moment, I think [Iranian cinema] does have wide exposure,"" Mottahedeh said. ""I do think that Iranian filmmakers are already thinking about the foreign market."" Ironically, things were different before the revolution, Mottahedeh said. Iranian cinema generally emulated American film instead of finding its own niche, which didn't endear it to a number of Iranians. ""Iranian melodrama from the 1960s and 1970s replicates American melodrama,"" she said. ""What the [Shah Mohammed Reza] Pahlavi regime did was to make a commodity of women ... make them wear Western fashion and become alien to Iranians."" The Islamic Republic has also enforced constraints on the film industry with its requirement of modesty, Mottahedeh said. But Iranian cinema has actually had its greatest artistic success in recent years, taking on issues raised by the 1979 revolution and the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. The impact of those events ""has created a condition of creativity to express the trauma that the nation has experienced,"" said Columbia University Iranian studies professor Hamid Dabashi. ""This is not in defense of censorship, obviously,"" Dabashi added, but when it comes to Iran, censorship ""creates a creative barrier that filmmakers have to cross."" Horberg, a producer who worked with Iranian actors on the set of ""The Kite Runner,"" said that members of the House of Cinema did not openly discuss the government's policies, although censorship is ""a real issue for them."" ""It's a paradox that cinema there is known for its ultra-realism and ultra-naturalism and that feeling like you're not even watching a movie, you're watching life. But a lot of what they're able to dramatize is limited,"" Horberg said. Despite their limitations, filmmakers have raised Iranian cinema to new heights, winning awards and critics' praise across the globe. Officially, Iran's citizens are unable to watch a number of these films, including director Jafar Panahi's films ""Offside"" (2006) and ""Circle"" (2000), which address women's rights, and Kiarostami's award-winning ""Taste of Cherry,"" which deals with suicide. All are banned inside the country. But that doesn't stop Iranian moviegoers from seeing the films. ""When a film is banned, people are even more eager to see it,"" Dabashi said, pointing out that many Iranians acquire films through the black market. ""The Iranian audience is among the most appreciative audience for film anywhere,"" said Horberg. ""They seem to have seen everything."" People outside the country are also eager for the country's production and talent. Dabashi said Iranian cinema has been prominent on the international scene for years, adding that many Iranian actors are beginning to cross over to the American film industry -- from veteran Iranian film actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, who starred opposite Ben Kingsley in 2003's ""House of Sand and Fog,"" to newcomer Golshifte Farahani, who starred as Leonardo DiCaprio's love interest in the 2008 thriller ""Body of Lies."" Iran's House of Cinema was enthusiastic about the Hollywood delegation's visit, according to CNN International Correspondent Reza Sayah. ""This was very special to them,"" Sayah said. ""They're the best in the business in Iran and what I did see was that connection and camaraderie between filmmakers. ...

Ganis added that he hopes the visit will help relations between Iran and the United States. ""It's a start,"" Ganis said.

"Washington (CNN) -- In one of the most immediate consequences of the pending spending cuts, the Federal Aviation Administration has informed contractors that -- lacking any last-minute agreement -- the agency will move Monday to close some 168 contractor-staffed air traffic control towers nationwide on April 1, and another 21 towers by Sept. 30, industry officials tell CNN. All of the control towers are at small- and medium-size airports, but together they handle about 5.8% of all commercial airline traffic, and considerably more business and private airplane traffic. The cuts will not force the closure of the airports, because aircraft can land without air traffic control help, and some operations can be switched to other FAA facilities. But airport authorities say the move will eliminate one level of safety at affected airports and will reduce the efficiency of the entire airspace system. The FAA's first concrete action to address the $85 billion in spending cuts -- known in Washington as the sequestration -- is aimed at three contractors. While the FAA uses its own workforce of some 14,700 controllers to staff about 280 control towers at major airports, it contracts with three companies to staff roughly another 250 towers, generally at smaller airports. Spending cuts threaten military town's business . Representatives of those companies told CNN the FAA has notified them verbally that they will be receiving written notice by Monday about the pending tower closures. ""To us and our people, it's extremely significant,"" said Shane Cordes, CEO of Midwest Air Traffic Control Service, which provides controllers to towers in about 23 states in the East, Northeast, Great Lakes and central regions of the United States. ""We're talking not only about a loss of jobs but, from my perspective, a negative impact to the safety and efficiency of the national airspace system,"" he said. Cordes said the FAA's contract tower program ""has been repeatedly lauded by the (DOT's) office of inspector general as a cost effective and safe program."" The program ""enhanced the FAA's attempts to be fiscally responsible while remaining operationally safe and efficient,"" he said. In addition to the contract towers, the FAA has said it is contemplating closing 49 FAA-staffed towers. And it has notified most of its 47,000 employees of the possibility of furloughs, expected to be one or two days every two-week pay period. Spencer Dickerson of the U.S. Contract Tower Association, an airport industry group, said contract towers are taking a disproportionate brunt of the closures. In addition to the 168 towers to be closed April 1, some 16 towers that are operated on a cost-sharing basis with other governments, and five operated with the Air National Guard, will be closed Sept. 30. ""We're very discouraged and we still think that the Department of Transportation and FAA ought to scrub the budget harder to find savings that don't affect the control towers,"" Dickerson said. Budget cuts would hit private air traffic in effort to spare airlines . ""Will it be unsafe? No. They'll figure it out, but are there concerns about safety? Absolutely. Are there concerns about efficiency? Absolutely. Is this a job killer? Absolutely,"" Dickerson said. ""It's unprecedented that we're going to turn the lights off on 168 towers on April 1, and we don't have any information from the FAA on how that's going to work,"" he said. The FAA targeted airfields with fewer than 150,000 operations -- an operation is a takeoff or landing -- or 10,000 commercial operations in a year. The agency said it is open to reconsidering closures on a ""case by case"" basis, but would have to offset any changes with other spending cuts. Congressional Republicans have criticized the planned tower closures, saying the administration is ""creating alarm"" as a negotiating gambit. In a statement, three Republicans said, ""The agency is well positioned to absorb spending reductions without compromising the safety or efficiency of the National Airspace System."" The statement was released by House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pennsylvania, Senate Commerce Committee Ranking Member John Thune, R-South Dakoka, and House Subcommittee on Aviation Chairman Frank LoBiondo, R-New Jersey. Wes Cozart, head of Robinson Aviation (RVA) Inc., which staffs control towers in the FAA's Southern and Southwest regions, said he is ""saddened"" by the pending closures. Cozart said an FAA contracting official gave him notice that it intends to close 77 of his towers, jeopardizing the jobs of more than 400 of his employees. ""We're not sure how the process worked to get to this point, so I really can't comment on that. We really don't know. If they had cut 20%, maybe that would be understandable. But it looks like they cut almost the entire program out,"" Cozart said. ""We're hopeful that somebody will come to a conclusion that changes this,"" Cozart said. ""Personally, I'm not hopeful that they'll make it."" ""I'm hopeful,"" he said, correcting himself. ""But I'm not confident.""

"(CNN) -- Today on Valentine's Day, my daughter and I will sift through the candy she receives from her third-grade classmates and throw most of it away. Although the tradition of trading chocolate and sugared hearts seems harmless, it actually poses a risk to my daughter and the millions of other American children who suffer from severe food allergies. This threat became all too real at the beginning of January with the death of 7-year-old Ammaria Johnson. Ammaria died of an allergic reaction to a peanut, and her Chesterfield, Virginia, school did not give her any medication. The emotional devastation of this loss is compounded by its senselessness: Ammaria's death could have been easily prevented by epinephrine. A form of adrenaline, epinephrine immediately counters the symptoms of anaphylaxis: hives, breathing difficulties and, without intervention, death. In our family, we are well-acquainted with epinephrine, administered by an automatic injector and sold under the brand names of Twinject or EpiPen. My daughter has needed multiple shots of epinephrine in four emergencies, and those shots saved her life. These experiences taught us how serious her allergies are. Our simple rule is that we don't leave home without it. But kids forget. Parents, too. We're pretty vigilant, and yet we've left EpiPens at birthday parties, friend's houses and in the middle of a park. With the benefit of health insurance, we can afford to buy another one. Not all families can. The School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, a bipartisan bill introduced at the end of last year and being considered in committee, encourages states to pass laws introducing incentives for schools to stock epinephrine for all students -- not just those who have a prescription. Having epinephrine on hand would protect everyone, including those who have not yet been diagnosed with a food allergy. The latter represents a significant group: Studies have shown that up to 25% of all epinephrine administrations at school involve someone whose allergy was previously unknown. Of the eight top food allergens, research suggests the most common ones are peanuts, followed by milk, shellfish and tree nuts. Chocolate often has milk or nuts in it and can be cross-contaminated: Even if a piece of chocolate does not contain any allergens, it might have been produced on the same line as chocolates that do. Stocking epinephrine at schools will help to ease concerns about using another child's medication for someone who needs it but does not have an EpiPen at school. As Maria Acebal, CEO of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, explains, this legislation ""puts into place the laws we need to encourage people to do the right thing."" Granted, buying auto-injectors and training adults to use them will require time and money. It's hard to imagine adding another expense when school budgets continue to dwindle. But for just a few hundred dollars every year, schools can ensure that all students are covered. Some schools, including ours, already do this. Initiatives in the private sector can help mitigate the costs: Dey Pharma, the manufacturer of EpiPen and EpiPen Jr., has already offered its auto-injector at a 50% reduced rate to schools. That comes to about $112 for two injectors. We should especially make sure that low-income districts can stock epinephrine. No parent should fear that his or her child might never come home from school. If the first step is having epinephrine, the second is knowing when and how to use it -- and not being afraid to do so. Dr. Scott Sicherer, professor of pediatrics at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, explains some of the most common reasons people don't give epinephrine immediately: ""Not recognizing a reaction. Being worried that the child is not 'sick enough.' Being worried about side effects of the medication or that they might hurt the child."" I learned this the hard way. The second time my daughter had an allergic reaction, I failed to use her EpiPen. She was 3, and I was eight months pregnant, home alone and paralyzed with fear. I did call 911 -- and luckily they arrived within minutes. But this experience taught me that her life depends upon the immediate use of epinephrine. All adults who supervise children should be trained to recognize an allergic reaction and use an auto-injector. At the moment, parents bear the burden of educating teachers, which isn't easy. Creative collaborations may help schools take the lead, such as a free online tutorial for educators recently introduced by the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, the Food Allergy Initiative and several Canadian organizations. Food allergies have become a part of American childhood, just like childhood obesity, diabetes and asthma. According to a 2011 study in Pediatrics, 8% of children in the United States have a food allergy. Surely initiatives focusing on healthy habits, such as Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign, can incorporate teaching kids that not all foods are safe for everyone and that washing hands after eating can help to prevent spreading food allergens. Often the healthiest option is also the safe one -- like sending stickers to school on Valentine's Day instead of candy. And if we continue to indulge our sweet tooth on special occasions, let's at least focus on making school safe for everyone. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- Several major Midwest metropolitan areas are bracing for a massive winter storm system that threatened to dump a foot or more of snow and bring potentially debilitating winds. Political and emergency personnel leaders in Oklahoma City, St. Louis and Chicago, among other locales, vowed they were prepared to weather the storm. The leaders of several states, many of which have already had a difficult winter, also commandeered their forces even as they urged people to stay home. ""Folks should batten down the hatches and hold on,"" Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said. ""The most likely place to get hurt is out on the road."" As much of its strength, the system's immense size sets it apart. As  of Monday evening, the National Weather Service had posted winter storm warnings, watches or  advisories in at least 29 states in a 2,000-mile space stretching from the Southwest to the Northeast. ""A  storm of this size and scope needs to be taken seriously,"" said Craig  Fugate, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The worst conditions are expected in parts of seven states where blizzard warnings were in effect Monday night. The Monday night forecast of fierce winds, strong snow and minimal visibility covered an area as far south and west as Oklahoma, as far north as Wisconsin and as far as east as Indiana. Several inches linked to the system had fallen by 7 p.m. Monday in Albuquerque,  New Mexico, where a winter storm warning extended throughout the state. A similar warning was in effect as far away as Boston, where snow could start Tuesday and continue through Wednesday night. Still, some of the biggest concerns entering Tuesday were in cities like Chicago. ""This storm could be one of the top 10 biggest snowstorms ever in the city,"" said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. According to the National Weather Service, snowstorms that drop over 15 inches of snow occur about once every 19 years in Chicago. The last time this happened was in January 1999, when 21.6 inches of snow was recorded in the city. Officials have added 120 garbage trucks with specially attached snow plows to the city's fleet normal of 274 trucks in expectation of heavy snowfall, said Jose A. Santiago, executive director of the city's Office of Emergency Management. Snowfall could reach a rate of two and three inches per hour with northeasterly winds of 25 mph to 40 mph, creating dangerous ""white-out"" conditions across the entire Chicago metropolitan area, the weather service reported. Blizzard or near blizzard conditions are expected as far south as Oklahoma City on Tuesday, where snow accumulations there will be measured in feet, not in inches. Oklahoma's governor, Mary Fallin, released a statement on Monday declaring a state of emergency for all 77 counties in the state. ""This disaster declaration will make sure we can prepare for the winter weather ahead of the storm,"" Fallin said.  ""We encourage all Oklahomans to prepare for the storm before it arrives."" The mayor of Oklahoma City, where snow was set to start falling late Monday, had a message for citizens as well: stay off the streets.  Mick Cornett noted that most city and state government offices would be closed Tuesday and asked that local businesses do their best to keep their employees home as well. Oklahoma City officials are urging residents to make early provisions --  such as stocking up on water, batteries, medications and canned foods  in case power outages occur.  The storm is expected to have snowfall  rates of up to 3 inches per hour, according to the weather service. ""We're not strangers to weather,"" said Michelann Ooten, public information officer with Oklahoma City's emergency management operations.  ""We've been working on this since last week."" Ooten said her office had already contacted FEMA to secure generators and supplies in case emergency shelters are needed. Very heavy snowfall is expected from Oklahoma northeastward through Kansas, Missouri and Illinois.  The National Weather Service forecast office in Norman, Oklahoma, warns that a ""potentially dangerous winter situation"" is developing, with travel becoming extremely dangerous or impossible across the state by Tuesday morning. ""Combined snow totals from the Monday afternoon through Wednesday may exceed a foot and a half across much of northern Illinois and far northwest Indiana,"" the weather service said. St.  Louis Mayor Francis Slay tried to cut short a trip to New Mexico to head  home in time for the storm, only to have his flight canceled due to  the weather, his chief of staff Jeff Rainford said. ""So he's one of the (thousands) stranded as well,"" said Rainford. CNN St. Louis affiliate KSDK indicated the storm could be ""historic"" in that eastern Missouri metropolis, saying it could rival a 1981 system that left 13.9 inches of snow in St. Louis and some surrounding areas with more than 2 feet. By early afternoon on Monday, a long list of early school closures was already being released by media in Missouri. ""It's precautionary,"" said Terry Gravemann, president of Duchesne High School, a private school in St. Charles, a small city northwest of St. Louis.  Gravemann said worried parents were eager to know what time school will be closing. Other cities likely to be affected during the week include Milwaukee, Cleveland, Providence and the New York state cities of Buffalo, Syracuse and Albany. Heavy snowfall won't be the only hazard from this major storm system. Subfreezing temperatures could coat trees, power lines and roads in ice from Missouri to southern Illinois and eastward into central Indiana, forecasters said. Ice accumulations of up to three-quarters of an inch will be possible, and they are likely to combine with gusty winds to cause tree branches to fall on power lines, according to forecasters. With temperatures expected to drop well below zero by Wednesday, parts of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma will experience some of the coldest air this season, Morris said. Strong winds will combine with the cold temperatures to create extremely dangerous wind chills of 20 to 35 below zero across the southern Plains, according to forecasts. But the storm's wrath won't end there. Severe thunderstorms are likely to develop along a trailing cold front from a main low-pressure area.  That sets up a significant potential for tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama. High winds, heavy snow and ice could present major problems for travelers, on the roads and in the air. Monday will be the best day to travel over the next four or five, said HLN meteorologist Bob Van Dillen. For people who have plans to fly in the region this week, several carriers will let them make changes to their itineraries. United Airlines has issued a travel waiver  for passengers traveling to, from or through Chicago from Tuesday through Thursday. Travelers will be able to alter their travel plans without fees or get a full refund if their flight is canceled. American Airlines is allowing travelers who are scheduled to fly on Monday through Thursday from more than 30 airports in the Midwest -- including those in Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee -- to change their plans without penalty. Delta was planning to issue a travel waiver for the Midwest and another for the Northeast on Monday, said spokesman Anthony Black. AirTran passengers traveling through two dozen cities, including Chicago, St. Louis and Boston, can change their reservation without penalty.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- In 2004, even after being captured by U.S. forces, Saddam Hussein told an FBI interrogator he believed Iran was a greater threat to Iraq than the United States, according to newly released FBI documents. Baghdad's Al Mutamar newspaper shows Saddam Hussein, right, with Ahmed Chalabi of Iraq's governing council in 2003. The FBI interviews took place while Hussein, then identified by the FBI as ""High Value Detainee 1"" was held captive by U.S. military forces at Baghdad International Airport between February and June of 2004. Hussein regarded the Iranian threat as so serious that it was the major factor in his decision not to allow United Nations weapons inspectors to return, he said. Citing their shared border and his belief Iran would intend to annex southern Iraq, Hussein said he was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq's weaknesses than repercussions from the United States and the international community. He believed that the inspectors would have directly identified to the Iranians where to inflict maximum damage to Iraq. Approximately 100 pages of declassified interview summaries, previously classified as secret, were obtained by the National Security Archive at the George Washington University through a Freedom of Information Act request. The FBI declined CNN's request to interview special agent George L. Piro, the agent who interviewed Hussein. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the declassified documents. ""As a general rule, the FBI does not discuss FOIA'd documents. We let the information stand on its own,"" Bresson told CNN. Piro, an FBI agent fluent in Arabic, conducted the interviews along with another agent whose name has been redacted from the documents. Although Hussein had been a prisoner for months, at one point during an interview he said, ""I am not the ex-president of Iraq. I am still the president of Iraq."" Hussein also described al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden as a ""zealot"" and said he had never met or seen him. He also said the United States used the September 11 attacks as justification to attack Iraq, and that the United States had ""lost sight of the cause.""  Despite Piro citing evidence of Iraq's contacts with al Qaeda, Hussein said, ""The Iraqi government did not cooperate with bin Laden"" and that the two ""did not have the same belief or vision."" The former regime's alleged weapons of mass destruction and alleged ties to al Qaeda were the Bush administration's primary justifications for invading Iraq in March of 2003. Piro and Hussein spoke extensively about Iraq's chemical weapons during the Iran war, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and in the years before the second U.S. invasion. Hussein refused to answer a question about whether Iraq would have lost the war it fought with Iran from 1980 to 1988 if it had not used chemical weapons. He also said neither he nor any other Iraqi officials discussed using chemical weapons during the first Gulf War. Hussein admitted that Iraq made a mistake by destroying some weapons without U.N. supervision. In his view, the inspectors wanted all of their expenses paid for by Iraq. Instead of waiting for the inspectors and paying the expenses, Iraq began destroying the weapons. ""We destroyed them. We told you, with documents. That's it,"" Hussein said. When asked about restrictions he placed on weapons inspectors regarding which locations they could visit, Hussein responded, ""By God, if I had such weapons, I would have used them in the fight against the United States."" Hussein commented about the mental state of U.S. soldiers occupying Iraq. ""If you asked the American soldier -- who came to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction, but none could be found, and who came to remove the leaders of the Hussein dictatorship, who are all in jail now, but are replaced with other dictators -- whether he wanted to stay or go, he would say go."" Hussein said he alone gave the orders to fire SCUD missiles at Israel during the first Gulf War, adding, ""Everything that happened to us was because of Israel."" He said he figured that the United States would stop the war if Israel was ""hurt,"" and he wanted to punish the country he viewed as the source of all his problems. Hussein recalled a meeting in Switzerland between his foreign minister Tariq Aziz and then-U.S. Secretary of State James Baker in January of 1991 shortly before Operation Desert Storm. According to Hussein, Baker offered no solutions to resolve the Kuwait situation and gave specific steps to Aziz that the United States wanted Iraq to do first, and Baker added ""otherwise, we'll take you back to the pre-industrial age."" He also told Piro he wanted to have a relationship with the United States but was not given the opportunity because in his view the United States was not listening to anything Iraq had to say. Hussein also revealed details about his security measures and movements before and after the second U.S. invasion of Iraq in March of 2003. He says he had only used a telephone on two occasions since March of 1990. He denied ever using body doubles, claiming, ""This is movie magic, not reality."" He also said he never saw his sons use body doubles. ""Do not think I am getting upset when you mention my sons. I still think about them and the fact that they were martyred. They will be examples to everyone throughout the world,"" he said. Hussein also states he was not in the Dora neighborhood of Baghdad on March 19, 2003, when it was bombed by coalition forces in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him. He says he remained in Baghdad until April 10 or 11 of 2003, when it appeared the city was about to fall to coalition forces. Before leaving the city, he said he held one final meeting with the senior Iraqi leadership and told them, ""We will struggle in secret."" Shortly after his departure from the capital, Hussein began to gradually disperse his bodyguards, telling them they had completed their duty, so as not to draw attention. Hussein also admitted that after participating in the failed assassination attempt against then-Iraqi president Gen. Abdul Karim Qasim in 1959, he had stayed at the same farm where he was captured by U.S. forces in December of 2003. CNN's Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Saddam Hussein calls Iran a factor in keeping U.N. inspectors out of Iraq .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile's president said Wednesday that conditions were ""inhumane"" at a prison south of Santiago where a fire killed 81 prisoners. President Sebastian Pinero visited a hospital where five injured inmates were hospitalized and afterward told reporters that the San Miguel prison was vastly overcrowded. ""The conditions that existed at the prison were inhumane,"" Pinera said. ""Chile does not deserve a prison system as we have. This is a problem that has dragged on for a long time."" The prison housed 1,961 inmates at the time of the fire Wednesday, said Felipe Bulnes, the justice minister. The prison was built to hold only 1,000 inmates, CNN Chile reported. Health minister Jaime Manalich said 14 inmates were in critical condition after the fire. A firefighter and three policemen were also injured, CNN Chile reported. Another 200 inmates were evacuated. ""This is a terrible tragedy,"" Manalich said, calling it the worst incident to strike the country's penal system. Chilean Senator Guido Girardi said that the tragedy could not be blamed entirely on overcrowding, noting that only five guards and a single paramedic were on duty at the time of the blaze. ""I think there is a state responsibility, of Chilean society, of all governments,"" Girardi, a member of the Party for Democracy, told CNN Chile, "" ... and I think it is not possible that all the responsibility should be attributed to overcrowded conditions."" The fire started on the fourth floor of San Miguel prison's Tower 5 after a riot among inmates, metropolitan regional commissioner Fernando Echeverria said. The call came in at shortly before 6 a.m. -- nearly an hour after the fire started, the fire department said. The cause of the blaze is under investigation, the department said. Meanwhile, a large crowd of inmates' relatives gathered outside the prison, worried about the fate of their loved ones. ""Why won't they give us information?"" one woman asked. Echeverria said authorities will inform the relatives of deceased prisoners before making the names public. ""Our main concern is to attend to those people who were injured and to handle the information regarding those who died diligently,"" Bulnes said. Earlier reports indicated 83 people died in the fire, but Manalich said the number was 81.","NEW: Overcrowded conditions at prison were ""inhuman,"" president says .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Soccer fans in the restive Egyptian city of Port Said clashed with security forces and torched a police station Saturday, the Interior Ministry said. At least 10 people were injured in the fighting, the latest over the last year. Violent clashes in Port Said have highlighted the longstanding resentment residents there feel toward Cairo and President Mohamed Morsy. The Green Ultras -- fans of the city's al-Masry football club long in the middle of political violence -- threw rocks at police vehicles that were transporting prisoners from jail to a court for their hearing. After the incident, about 500 people gathered in front of a police station. They threw rocks and Molotov cocktails and set fire to the building. The people also prevented emergency vehicles from arriving at the scene to help put out the fire. The Interior Ministry said the situation is now under control. The violence comes during a civil disobedience movement in the runup to a March 9 final verdict for people involved in deadly clashes after Port Said-based al-Masry defeated Cairo's al-Ahry 3-1 in a February 2012 soccer game. The fighting, dubbed the massacre at Port Said, left 74 dead and 1,000 injured. The history of tense relations between Port Said and Cairo dates back about 60 years, as residents of Port Said have felt betrayed by Egyptian security forces during a series of wars with Israel. Thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the Suez War, the Six Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition with Israel, and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. Egyptian opposition leader calls for election boycott . Residents of Port Said, in the northeastern corner of the country, believed security forces did not adequately defend their city. In addition, some say Cairo has not invested enough in Port Said's infrastructure, and that their city doesn't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though Port Said via the critical Suez Canal. Some also contend that Port Said is still getting the cold shoulder from Cairo after a 1999 assassination attempt of then-President Hosni Mubarak, who was visiting the city. Elsewhere, tensions flared in Mansoura, in the Nile Delta region. Thousands poured into the streets for the funeral of Housam Abdelazim, killed Friday night in clashes between protesters and members of the security forces, the state-run Ahram news outlet said. The death occurred when the forces were preventing an attack by protesters against a complex of buildings that houses Dakahliya provincial headquarters. He was killed after a police vehicle drove over him, witnesses said. The security forces fired tear gas as the protesters threw Molotov cocktails and cut off roads leading to the provincial government buildings. Scores injured in anti-government protests in Egypt . Kerry visits Egypt . A protest erupted in Cairo as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry paid a visit to Egypt on Saturday, part of his first trip overseas as America's top diplomat. Dozens of protesters in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs set on fire pictures of Kerry, according to the state-run MENA news outlet. Other protesters laid on the ground at the front gate of the ministry. Some formed a human chain on a bridge leading to the ministry and held banners rejecting Kerry's visit to Egypt. The demonstration caused congestion with many cars backed up on Corniche Nile Road. The protesters chanted anti-U.S. and anti-Israel slogans. This came before Kerry's meeting with Foreign Ministry Mohamed Kamel Amr. His stopover comes amid political quarreling in Egypt. The Obama administration has been stressing to Morsy and other political figures the importance of political consensus. Secretary Kerry sees 'urgent' need to revive Egyptian economy . Speaking at a meeting with business leaders, Kerry said it is ""paramount, essential, urgent that the Egyptian economy get stronger, that it get back on its feet."" Kerry said that there needs to be a sense of security and an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to help jump-start the economy. Kerry said he spoke with the leaders of Great Britain, France, Germany and Turkey and all want to be helpful ""but all of them believe Egypt must make some fundamental economic choices."" Kerry met with Amre Moussa and Nabil El Araby, the former and current heads of the Arab League. He met with opposition leaders on Saturday, but state news said opposition leaders Hamdeen Sabahy and Mohamed Elbaradei decided not to meet with Kerry. He will meet with representatives of non-governmental organizations and Morsy on Sunday. In his visit with Morsy, he will broach ""very specific ways"" in which Obama wants to help Egypt, including economic assistance, support for private business, increasing Egyptian exports to the United States and investing in education. In remarks to reporters on Sunday, he reiterated the importance of economic and political strides. ""There must be a willingness on all sides"" in Egypt to make ""meaningful compromises,"" and Egyptians must stay focused on economic and political opportunities to succeed in forging a successful democracy. His visit comes as Egypt has been engulfed in political unrest for months. He said the United States will help Egyptians achieve their aspirations for democracy and economic opportunity without interference. ""We come here as friends"" of Egyptians, not favoring a particular group, person or ideology. He said ""the best way to ensure human rights"" in the country is through the ""broadest possible"" political and economic participation. Kerry also said he appreciated Morsy's role in helping bring about a cease-fire between Israel and militants in Gaza in fighting there last year. CNN's Amir Ahmed reported from Atlanta.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British businessman jailed in Dubai after being convicted with a female companion for having sex on a beach said he had acted naively as he spoke publicly Monday for the first time since returning to the UK.

Vince Acors, 34, and Michelle Palmer, 36, were arrested on a Dubai beach in July and convicted to three-month jail terms in October on charges of public indecency and for having sex outside marriage. Their jail sentences were suspended on appeal and both returned to the UK last week. Acors, a telecommunications executive, admitted being drunk at the time of the incident after an afternoon of drinking but denied that sex between the couple had occurred and said that worldwide media interest in the case had given authorities no choice but to convict them. ""Sex in this country (the UK) is not the same as sex in Dubai,"" Acors told a news conference, adding that there was ""physical contact but intercourse did not take place.""  Watch as Acors gives his side of the story » . But Acors admitted he had been ""extremely naive"" about Muslim law in the Middle Eastern country. He described how drinking was commonplace in the Emirate's Western hotels, and how his ""champagne glass was never empty"" during a Friday afternoon ""all-you-can-drink"" reception where he met Palmer. Acors said the Dubai authorities had confiscated his passport during deportation proceedings that took three months. He returned to Britain on Christmas Eve and is now looking to sell his story. He said he and Palmer had since spoken only to discuss the case and don't have a relationship. She was not at the news conference.","British man convicted of having sex on a beach in Dubai denies sex took place .

"(CNN) -- The young girl whispered in a hushed tone. She looked down as she spoke, only glancing up from her dark round eyes every now and then. She wanted to tell more, but she was too ashamed. She was just 9 years old when, she says, Congolese soldiers gang-raped her on her way to school. The young girl on the right says she was raped by Congolese soldiers. She was just 9 when it happened. ""These two soldiers nabbed her, put a bag over her head and pulled her into the bushes. She explains it as, 'They got me,' "" says Sherrlyn Borkgren, who spent a month in the Democratic Republic of the Congo late last year. Borkgren, a wedding photographer and freelance journalist, traveled to the war-torn region of eastern Congo after being awarded the ShootQ Grant, a $10,000 award to free photographers from everyday life to pursue a project that raises awareness of an important global issue. Borkgren pauses when she speaks of meeting the girl. ""She was obviously very traumatized to repeat this out loud, and I don't think she had repeated it to anyone."" The young girl lied to her about her age when they first spoke. ""She said she was 15 when she was raped,"" Borkgren says. ""I figured she probably wanted to say she was 15 because it's more acceptable than to say, 'I was 9 when they raped me.' "" The United Nations estimates 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Congo over the last 12 years, when war broke out with Rwanda and Uganda backing Congolese rebels seeking to oust then-Congo President Laurent Kabila. Rape became a weapon of war, aid groups say. ""It is one of the worst places in the world to be a woman or girl,"" says Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch who has spent the last 10 years focusing on Congo. ""These are often soldiers and combatants deliberately targeting women and raping them as a strategy of war, either to punish a community, to terrorize a community or to humiliate them."" Most times, the women are raped by at least two perpetrators. ""Sometimes, that is done in front of the family, in front of the children,"" Van Woudenberg says. She sighs, ""What causes men to rape -- I wish I had an answer to that."" Against this backdrop, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, one of the world's strongest voices for women's rights, traveled to Congo as part of her whirlwind trip to Africa.  Watch Clinton detail expectations for Africa » . Clinton arrived in Goma in eastern Congo Tuesday where she is to meet with rape victims during her visit. ""I hope that here in the [Congo] there will be a concerted effort to demand justice for women who are violently attacked, and to make sure that their attackers are punished,"" Clinton said Monday after a tour of a Kinshasa hospital. Human rights groups are eager to see if Clinton pressures Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the son of Laurent Kabila, to do more to pursue charges against top army commanders accused of rape. ""Soldiers have committed gang rapes, rapes leading to injury and death, and abductions of girls and women,"" a report released last month by Human Rights Watch says. ""Their crimes are serious violations of international humanitarian law. Commanders have frequently failed to stop sexual violence and may themselves be guilty of war crimes or crimes against humanity as a consequence."" Van Woudenberg says punishment, unfortunately, is all too rare for sex crimes. ""If you rape, you get away with it,"" she says. According to the United Nations, there were 15,996 new cases of sexual violence registered throughout Congo in 2008. Nearly two out of every three rapes were carried out against children, most of them adolescent girls, the Human Rights Watch report says. A paltry 27 soldiers were convicted in military courts last year. Under the current court system, the military handles accusations of rape against its soldiers -- something aid groups say must be changed for real accountability. Since January of this year, aid organizations say there's been a surge of violence against civilians as a result of Congolese operations against Rwandan Hutu rebels, some of whom are believed to have participated in 1994's Rwandan genocide. The fighting has left more than 1.8 million people displaced in the volatile region, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Aid groups have started to see an uptick of rapes of men this year, although women and girls remain the primary targets. ""The brutality has increased on a huge scale,"" Van Woudenberg says. She says she interviewed one 15-year-old girl who was held in a hole for five months and gang-raped nearly every day. She had gone out shopping when soldiers approached. ""They asked me to take off my clothes, and I did. There wasn't much I could do,"" the girl told her. ""They took me into the bush. I stayed for five months with these people, and when I came back, I was five months pregnant."" Van Woudenberg adds, ""Gosh, the brutality against the women and girls is unimaginable."" Congo has taken some measures to try to curb the sexual violence. In 2006, its parliament passed a law criminalizing rape, with penalties ranging from five to 20 years. Penalties are doubled under certain circumstances, including gang-rape and if the perpetrator is a public official. Kabila's wife, Olive Lemba Kabila, has launched a public campaign speaking out against rapes of the nation's women and girls. The army has also started a zero-tolerance campaign in which commanders have emphasized to troops that they must respect human rights and protect civilians from harm, according to the U.N. In May, the United Nations handed over the names of five top military officers accused of rape. Two of the senior officers are now detained in the capital of Kinshasa and the three others must report to authorities under close observation. ""It's expected that a trial could happen soon,"" said U.N. spokesman Yves Sorokobi. ""It certainly is a big development. ... It's important. It's significant."" Still more must be done, aid groups say, starting with the establishment of a special court made up of Congolese and international judges and prosecutors to investigate rape allegations. Borkgren, the photographer from Eugene, Oregon, says she went to the Congo after having a dream in which two women yelled at her to ""come over here."" She won the grant and traveled there for four weeks, beginning in November of last year. She hitchhiked her way around the country, something she now admits was ""a little bit stupid."" She says she once came face-to-face with soldiers when she was shopping at a market by herself. One of the men said he wanted to ""take me up to his camp."" She still can't shake the looks of the local women who were there. ""That was interesting,"" she says. ""When the soldiers were harassing me, the women looked ashamed of the soldiers. And when they saw me tell them, 'No, go away,' the women looked at me quite surprised."" Eventually, she found the girl who touched her heart -- ""the great, great kid."" Borkgren first spoke with her father, who was initially reluctant to introduce her to his daughter. He explained that the family had gone to authorities, only to be ignored. Borkgren says that when she met the girl, they got along instantly. At times, the young child didn't know how to describe what happened. ""She would say, 'I don't understand what it is, and I don't know what words to use.' "" ""It just turned my heart to think that here's this little girl who doesn't even have the words to describe what happened to her, and has to live her life having had this violence put upon her. Just this thoughtless violence that she didn't deserve or ask for. It's so inhumane."" Her images capture a glimpse into that world, of savagery and lost innocence. The soldiers and rebels carrying out the rapes, she says, are misguided people who need help. Caught in the middle are the innocents: women, girls and fathers struggling to get justice.","UN: 200,000 women, girls raped in Democratic Republic of Congo in last 12 years .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The scene was more reminiscent of a Hollywood production than an elaborate prank by the Punk'd-master himself. A banner with Ashton Kutcher's Twitter name, aplusk, was unfurled Wednesday over the CNN logo at CNN Center. Ashton Kutcher, along with his wife, Demi Moore, dropped by Atlanta, Georgia's CNN Center on Wednesday to fulfill his promise to ""ding-dong-ditch"" CNN founder Ted Turner's house after winning last April's race to attract 1 million followers on the micro-blogging site Twitter. With the precision of a Hollywood director, Kutcher barked into his two-way radio as his light and sound crews followed with the Twitter entourage hot on their heels and an Internet audience watching on Ustream. Moments after Kutcher yelled ""lights"" into his two-way, his crew unfurled a banner with his Twitter name, aplusk, over the CNN's neon logo on the building.  Watch how Kutcher's prank turned out » . ""You know, CNN lost. That's what happened,"" Kutcher told a tag-along crowd of more than 100 fans whom he calls ""tweeps."" ""I'm just fulfilling a promise I made ... that I'd do this thing and I'm doing it."" Kutcher had challenged CNN to the Twitter race, saying he would donate 10,000 mosquito bed nets to charity for World Malaria Day if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to do the same.

""Ted doesn't really have an accessible home, and Ted doesn't really have an accessible doorbell,"" he said. In an earlier prank Wednesday, Kutcher and his crew arrived at a Ted's Montana Grill restaurant, which is named after the media mogul. The group neatly stacked hundreds of boxes of Ding Dongs in front of the restaurant, then each person banged a bronze bell out front. ""Don't be shy; get involved,"" Kutcher crowed from the top of a U-Haul van filled with Hostess Ding Dongs. ""There are 800 boxes of Ding Dongs.

"(CNN) -- Michael Clarke Duncan, nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the 1999 film ""The Green Mile,"" died Monday morning at age 54, according to a representative for his family. Duncan ""suffered a myocardial infarction on July 13 and never fully recovered,"" a written statement from Joy Fehily said. Clarke died at a Los Angeles hospital where he had been since having the heart attack more than seven weeks ago. According to TMZ, it was Duncan's girlfriend Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, a reality star and former contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" who had acted quickly and provided lifesaving efforts when he had the heart attack. Most recently he was on the TV series, ""The Finder,"" on the Fox network. His co-star Mercedes Masohn tweeted: ""Today is a sad day. Michael Clark Duncan passed away this morning. Known for his moving performance in The Green Mile. RIP MCD. You'll b missed."" Read other tributes to the late actor . According to Entertainment Weekly, the TV series was canceled in May. A towering and hulking figure, the 6-foot-5-inch Duncan also was known for his deep voice. A Chicago native, Duncan went to college at Alcorn State University in Mississippi with plans to major in communications, but he dropped out and moved home. In his 20s, he worked digging ditches for Peoples Gas during the day and as a bouncer at night. He told CNN in 1999 that his coworkers at the gas company called him ""Hollywood"" because he'd often talk about becoming a movie star. ""I'd be digging a ditch and they'd say, 'Hey, man, Bruce Willis wants to talk to you about a movie.' And they'd just crack up laughing,"" he said while doing press for 'The Green Mile.' ""Those coworkers had no way of knowing how that joke would turn on them."" In 1990, he decided to measure up his nickname and he moved to Los Angeles. He worked as a bodyguard then got a part in a commercial as a drill sergeant. More roles followed -- often ones that depended more on his 315-pound frame than his acting ability. He was a guard in ""Back in Business,"" a bouncer in ""A Night at the Roxbury,"" a bouncer for 2 Live Crew in ""The Players Club,"" and a bouncer at a bar in the Warren Beatty film ""Bulworth."" In 1998, he landed his first significant movie part, playing Bear in the film ""Armageddon,"" where a crew of drillers from an oil rig save the Earth from an asteroid. ""Armageddon"" was the beginning of his friendship with Bruce Willis. They appeared in four films together. And it was Willis who called 'The Green Mile' director Frank Darabont to put in a good word for Duncan. In the Oscar-nominated film, Duncan played John Coffey, the huge black man wrongly convicted in a Louisiana town for the rapes and murders of two white girls. Coffey has supernatural powers, though; his hands can heal, even bring back the dead. A microcosm of faith, Coffey is a messenger of hope and lost hope who develops a relationship with Tom Hanks' character, a guard named Paul Edgecomb. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that Duncan's performance ""is both acting and being."" Ebert tweeted Monday that Duncan was ""A striking screen presence."" Duncan was nominated for an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, which was won that year by Michael Caine for ""The Cider House Rules."" Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who starred with Duncan in the movie ""The Scorpion King"" said on Twitter: ""When something happens, we always say it happens for a reason ... Michael Clarke Duncan 12/10/57 - 9/3/12 I'll miss you my brother."" According to the Internet Movie Database, Duncan had two completed projects that have yet to be released on a nationwide basis. He is slated to appear in ""The Challenger,"" a boxing movie written and directed by Kent Moran. He will also appear in the Robert Townsend film, ""In the Hive,"" about an alternative school for boys who have been kicked out of other schools. One of his co-stars in that film was Vivica A. Fox.

"(CNN) -- Referring to two American hikers in custody for more than two years, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters Tuesday: ""I am helping to arrange for the release in a couple of days so they will be able to return home."" The semi-official Mehr News Agency quickly echoed the president with a headline, ""Iran's Judiciary agrees to release two U.S. citizens on bail."" Within 24 hours, however, the Shiite clerics who run Iran's legal system seemed to pour cold water on hopes of a quick release by declaring the ""request to release two U.S. citizens on bail was under study."" They went on to warn the media and the United States that ""only reports published by the judiciary could be trusted."" At first glance these developments present the Iranian president as a loose cannon, adding to his reputation as a Holocaust denier and 9/11 conspiracy adherent. All those characterizations do apply to Ahmadinejad. But the recent twist in the hikers' plight reflects more than an erratic chief executive or a regime in Tehran that lacks coordination. It represents the latest skirmish in an increasingly high-stakes battle for the future of Iran's politics and society. At the heart of the tussle between Ahmadinejad and his former clerical mentors is the question of whether the Islamic republic and its system of velayat-e faqih, or governance by an Islamic jurist, should endure or be discarded as a disastrous experiment just as a previous attempt by clergymen to rule Iran failed during the Persian Empire of antiquity. Regarding those hikers, the Iranian government's executive branch, including its Foreign Ministry, lobbied publicly for dropping the charges. Ahmadinejad and his appointees, like many other Iranians, see little to gain from continued imprisonment of the two Americans. The presidential office has more pressing matters -- such as a deteriorating economy -- that demand attention. It needs a deal with the West that allows oversight of Iran's nuclear program by the International Atomic Energy Agency in exchange for a lifting of sanctions that would permit foreign capital and goods to reinvigorate local business. The executive branch also has bigger fish to fry ideologically -- its officials realize many Iranians are tired of the Islamic Revolution and of paying for the negative implications of preserving theocracy. So Ahmadinejad and his appointees have learned from the protests of 2009 and launched their own rebellion within the governing elite. Mullahs who subscribe to Shiite fundamentalist politics endorsed Ahmadinejad for the presidency in 2005, expecting him to implement their will through the executive branch. They even went along with much-contested results of the 2009 presidential election despite Ahmadinejad's increasing disregard of mandates from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the theocratic branch of the government, hoping he could be forced to toe their line. What the mullahs did not fully realize until recently is that Ahmadinejad and his supporters have little reason to be loyal to Khamenei and other clergymen for the system of velayat-e faqih is closed to nonclerics. Rather than ascribe to Shiite fundamentalism, as do members of the theocratic and judicial branches of Iran's government, Ahmadinejad, his chief of staff and close confidant, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, and those who support them have been championing Iran's past. They laud prophets, kings and poets such as Zarathushtra, who preached the world's first monotheism in the second millennium B.C.; Cyrus the Great, who founded the first Persian Empire in the sixth century B.C.; and Ferdowsi, who composed the country's national epic in the 11th century -- referring to that past as the ""school of Iran."" Islam pales when compared to those achievements and so does the theocratic state of modern Iran, they insist. Not surprisingly the mullahs have begun denouncing Ahmadinejad and his appointees as a ""deviant current"" that seeks to ""restrict the powers of the supreme leader, increase the authority of the elected president, base authority within the executive and parliamentary branches of government, use public referendums rather than clerical edicts, and change the Islamic Constitution ... in order to dismantle clerical rule."" The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leadership finds its ranks divided between the warring factions of Iran's polity. Like the president, military officers and conscripts are rarely from clerical families and historically have thrown their lot in with Iran's secular leadership. Consequently when Revolutionary Guards commander Mohammad Ali Jafari, who was appointed by and is loyal to the mullahs, threatened ""military action against the president and all others who disavow the Islamic Revolution,"" accusations of contemplating a coup were leveled. Even the Islamic republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was quoted posthumously as prohibiting military units from intervening in politics. Within the context of Iran's intra-regime struggle, the hikers' conviction on charges of illegal entry and espionage by a judiciary under cleric Sadeq Larijani emerges as yet another attempt by xenophobic mullahs to thwart Ahmadinejad's albeit fumbling attempts to re-engage the United States. Ahmadinejad's offer of a ""unilateral pardon of course on behalf of the Iranian nation"" was in turn a warning shot to those clergymen that he could exercise the presidency's constitutional authority if this matter is not resolved satisfactorily. Like his other defiant acts, which include ousting fundamentalists from the Cabinet and bureaucracy, it also was a means of conveying to Iranians that the president is seeking ""closure of the era in which clergy call the shots."" Even in ideal circumstances, Iran's supreme leader has to navigate most cautiously between competing political factions within the branches of government to retain his position. These are far from the best of times in Tehran. Khamenei conceded recently that ""the supreme Islamic jurist cannot act solely according to his inclination."" Ahmadinejad, although rightly abhorred on the world stage for his bad words and deeds, is far from politically impotent and will likely continue to press an increasingly secularist vision of government upon the mullahs, knowing his new stances make him one of the three most popular politicians, none of them fundamentalists, within Iran. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jamsheed K. Choksy.","Jamsheed K. Choksy: The uncertain status of two U.S. hikers reflects Iran divisions .

"(CNN) -- Rosa Brooks says ""keep calm and shut the bleep up."" The witty Foreign Policy writer is sick of what she calls ""self-indulgent vicarious trauma"" following the blasts at the marathon finish line in Boston last week, which killed three people, injured more than 100 and set off a manhunt that left an MIT cop dead. ""You don't need to keep changing your Facebook status to let us all know that you're still extremely shocked and sad about the Boston bombing,"" she wrote last week. ""Let's just stipulate that everyone is shocked and sad, except the perpetrators and some other scattered sociopaths."" CNN iReport: Run for Boston . Part of me loves her piece. It's a worthy critique of the faux-concern and needless commercialism that can grow out of tragedy. But I think Brooks is selling people short by writing that ""there just isn't much most ordinary people should do in immediate response to events such as the Boston bombings."" There's plenty to do, as runners have shown in the week since the bombing. Within hours of the blasts, people all over the world were lacing up their running shoes and going outside to run. It's a simple, selfish act. Some did it to clear their heads. Others to process what had just happened to fellow runners and those cheering them on. I did it because I felt like I just needed to do something. And I feel all the more compelled to keep training because of inspirational stories like those of Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dance instructor who lost her foot in the bombing but vows to dance and run again. On their own, none of these runs means much. But when people started sharing their stories on Twitter with the hashtag #runforboston, they took on a greater significance. The collective runs started to feel like a form of protest -- a global show of solidarity with victims and a middle finger to violence and its perpetrators. Some runners started raising money for charity or to help with relief efforts. Others, like Becca Obergefell, from Ohio, who started a website for people to log the miles they were running for Boston (more than 4,000 runs have been logged so far), wanted Boston's victims, some of whom were robbed of their legs and possibly their abilities to run, that the world was thinking of them. Sutter: Why I'm running for Boston . Perhaps that's childish and naive, but I do think that matters. That's why CNN iReport is asking runners and would-be runners to sign up to run a race -- maybe a marathon? -- as a show of solidarity with, and support for, the victims of the Boston bombing. More than 250 people have signed up to run a race. They're from Boston, Ohio, California, Australia and Germany. Some are raising money for charity with an app called Charity Miles. Others are running because of personal connections to Boston, because they felt the bombing was an attack on runners everywhere, or because they were moved by a particular story. ""I refuse to forget what I witness,"" wrote Andrew Bunyard, 28, who lives near the site of the bombing in Boston. ""Let's reclaim our city,"" wrote Karin Kenney, a 45-year-old from Massachusetts. ""I'd like to show marathon runners and those watching that I'm inspired by so many of them,"" wrote Jessica Pilkington, a 27-year-old who works in Boston. ""As runners, we are resilient by nature,"" wrote Megan Biller, 29, from Michigan. All of them have pledged to run a race as a way to work through the tragedy. I'd encourage you to join in. I'm going to run a marathon by next April as part of this Run for Boston project. And if you'd like to sign up, you have until May 1 to do so. All you have to do is take a picture of your sneakers and tell us a little bit about why you're running. Then look for updates. We'll post new instructions and challenges in the weeks ahead.

"(CNN) -- At the 1964 New York World's Fair, people stood in line for hours to look at a strange sight. If only the future looked like ""Star Trek,"" with its nifty gadgets that seem to solve every problem. They wanted to see the ""Futurama,"" a miniaturized replica of a typical 21st century American city that featured moving sidewalks, computer-guided cars zipping along congestion-free highways and resort hotels beneath the sea. Forty years later, we're still waiting for those congestion-free highways -- along with the jet pack, the paperless office and all those ""Star Trek""-like gadgets that were supposed to make 21st-century life so easy.

He's looked at the future we imagined for ourselves in pulp comic books, old science magazines and cheesy sci-fi movies from the 1950s, and came up with one question. Why isn't the future what it used to be? ""I feel entitled to have all this technology that's been promised at a certain time,"" says Wilson, author of ""Where's My Jetpack?"" ""I look up and say, 'Where's all this stuff?' '' Some of that futuristic stuff, it turns out, is already here. Visionaries actually invented objects like flying cars, but they could never work out the real world applications, Wilson says. Other inventions had the same problem. Ordinary people didn't want to have anything to do with them. These futuristic follies include everything from ""Smell-O-Vision,"" an invention that helped moviegoers smell as well as see movies; Sanyo's ""ultrasonic ultra-squeaky clean human washing machine"" (it was dubbed the ""human washing machine,"" but wouldn't fit in an ordinary bathroom) and, of course, the jet pack. ""Scientists are OK at predicting what technology is going to happen in the future,"" Wilson says. ""They're really bad at predicting how it's going to affect us."" What happened to my jet pack? The jet pack is a perfect example of predicting the future, Wilson says. He says the jet pack first appeared in 1928 in an Amazing Stories comic book, which featured the hero Buck Rogers zooming though the sky in a jet pack. The jet pack was actually developed by 1961, Wilson says. An inventor mounted a rocket onto a backpack and called it a rocket belt. A variation of the rocket belt even appeared in the 1965 James Bond movie, ""Thunderball."" Today, the jet pack continues to grab inventors' imaginations. A daredevil wearing a jet pack flew across a 1,500-foot-wide canyon in Colorado in November. A Swiss pilot, dubbed ""Fusion Man,"" flew across the English Channel last year using a single jet-propelled wing. And a New Zealand inventor recently invented a jet pack, which weighs about 250 pounds, that reportedly can run for 30 minutes. The jet pack, though, has never really taken off, Wilson says. The problem is its practical application. While a rocket belt could propel a screaming human to 60 mph in seconds, its fuel lasted for only about half a minute, ""which led to more screaming,"" Wilson says. The military couldn't find a useful application for it either. A soldier with a jet pack might look cool, but he's an easy target. Nor could a jet pack be of use to ordinary people who wanted to avoid rush-hour traffic, Wilson says. Jet-packing hordes could transform the skies into an aerial demolition derby, with air rage and drunk drivers turned into wobbly human torpedoes. Yet other bold visions of the future have come true. Remember Rosey the Robot? That was the name of the robotic maid that waited on the Jetsons, the popular cartoon family from the future. Rosey has become ""Wakamaru."" That's the name of a 3-foot-tall robot with a goofy grin that the Mitsubishi conglomerate in Japan invented to assist elderly people at home by doing everything from reminding them to take their medicine to looking out for burglars. Wakamaru can recognize faces and up to 10,000 words, Wilson says. ""Beam me Up Scotty,"" is a tagline from another television show, ""Star Trek"". But teleportation has been invented, Wilson says. He says a group of international scientists successfully transported a photon -- a bundle of electromagnetic energy -- from one side of a room to another in 1993. Physicists routinely conduct teleportation experiments today, Wilson says. ""Teleporting anything, even elementary particles, is mind-blowing,"" Wilson says. ""Why is it that most people don't know it exists? It hasn't been put into practice yet. In real life, it's always about, 'What can you do for me?' "" A darker view of technology's future . People's fascination with technology's imprint on the future didn't start, however, in the mid-20th century with shows like ""The Jetsons"" or ""Star Trek."" Joseph Corn, co-author of ""Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future,"" found an inflated optimism about technology's impact on the future as far back as the 19th century, when writers like Jules Verne (""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"") were creating wondrous versions of the future. Even then, people had a misplaced faith in the power of inventions to make life easier, Corn says. For example, the typical 19th-century American city was crowded and smelly. The problem was horses. They created traffic jams, filled the streets with their droppings and, when they died, their carcasses. But around the turn of the 20th century, Americans were predicting that another miraculous invention would deliver them from the burden of the horse and hurried urban life -- the automobile, Corn says. ""There were a lot of predictions associated with early automobiles,"" Corn says. ""They would help eliminate congestion in the city and the messy, unsanitary streets of the city."" Corn says Americans' faith in the power of technology to reshape the future is due in part to their history. Americans have never accepted a radical political transformation that would change their future. They prefer technology, not radical politics, to propel social change. ""Technology has been seen by many Americans as a way to get a better tomorrow without having to deal with revolutionary change,"" Corn says. Today, however, a more sober view of technology has sneaked into the nation's popular culture. In dystopian sci-fi films like ""Blade Runner,"" and ""Terminator,"" technology creates more problems than it solves. ""Battlestar Galactica,'' the recent television series, is a prime example. It depicts a world where human beings have created amazing technology that has brought them to the precipice of extinction. There's no Buck Rogers zooming blissfully through the sky. The show follows the journey of a group of humans who created a race of robots called Cylons. The Cylons rebel, virtually wipe out humanity with nuclear weapons, and pursue the survivors through space. Mark Verheiden, a Battlestar writer, says the show's writers pay attention to current events when plotting their story lines. The contemporary world is filled with the unintended consequences of technology, he says. ""There are so many things you can't anticipate when you create a new technology,"" he says. ""Who would have predicted that the Internet would be taking down shopping malls and wiping out newspapers?'' In Battlestar's finale, human beings abandon their faith in technology's ability to improve the future. They destroy their fancy machines and start again as simple hunter-gatherers. ""At some point, you can't expect a miracle to come in the form of technology to save us,"" Verheiden says. ""At some point, the miracle has to come from a change in attitude and a new outlook."" That doesn't mean, however, that Verheiden isn't a fan of imagining future technology. He says he grew up watching ""Star Trek"" and immersing himself in Futurama-like exhibits. The elevated cities and the ""Star Trek"" voyages of yesteryear may now seem corny, but at least they show humanity has a future, he says. "" 'Star Trek' was saying [that] a thousand years from now, people [will] figure out how to get along,"" Verheiden says. ""In some ways, sci-fi says that the future is still optimistic, because no matter how bleak things are, it suggests that we're still here.""","Visionaries have long predicted how inventions will alter the future .
Some miracle inventions never had impact desired by creators .

"(CNN) -- The Sultanate of Oman is a rarity in the diplomatic world: It enjoys ""cordial"" relations with both the United States and Iran. And once again, it is closely involved in trying to help win the freedom of Americans held in Iran. In 2010, Omani sources paid $500,000 bail to help win the release of American hiker Sarah Shourd, who with her fiancÃ© Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal was detained in 2009 after allegedly straying across an unmarked stretch of the Iran-Iraq border. The Omanis are now involved in brokering the release of Bauer and Fattal. Sultan Qaboos, who has ruled Oman for more than 40 years, has gone to great lengths to strike a balance in relations with Iran -- Oman's neighbor across the Strait of Hormuz -- and his traditional allies in the west, especially the UK and U.S. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable from December 2009, the Omani foreign minister, Yusuf bin Alawi, offered to set up discreet talks between the United States and Iran. ""When thanked by the Ambassador for Oman's ongoing advice to Iran to work with the West, YbA offered Oman as both an organizer and a venue for any meeting the U.S. would want with Iran - if kept quiet,"" the cable said. Anything to avoid ""heated atmospherics,"" in the words of another Omani official. The same cable showed that the Omanis are more relaxed than others in the Gulf about Iran's nuclear ambitions, with bin Alawi telling the U.S. ambassador that ""even if Iran developed nuclear weapons, this action would not destabilize the region, a point vigorously countered by the Ambassador."" The open door to Tehran is part dictated by geographical necessity but also helps Oman follow a foreign policy independent of its giant neighbor, Saudi Arabia, the most powerful member of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Qatar has a similar approach, much to the annoyance of the Saudis. Theodore Karasik of the Institute of Near East and Gulf Military Analysis says that ""from the Omani point of view, they see the other GCC states as being 'over there' behind the mountains; we're in front of the mountains. That separates them from the rest of what the GCC states are thinking. That's why they feel that they can have a special relationship with Iran."" Oman is separated from other Gulf states by the long and largely impenetrable Al Hajar mountain range. At its northern end, the range gives way to the Persian Gulf and the narrow Strait of Hormuz, where the territory of Oman and Iran is just 18 miles apart. More than 15 million barrels of oil (40% of the world's total output) pass through the Strait every day, which makes it a security headache for both countries. They have a joint military commission dealing with security in the shipping lanes (which are mostly in Omani waters) and smuggling. Omani sources say smuggling gangs use fishing boats to traffic Afghan and Pakistani migrants, as well as weapons and drugs across the Strait from Iran to Oman. Not that Qaboos feels any ideological affinity with the Islamic regime across the water. A friend of the Shah of Iran's, he is said to have been deeply troubled by the 1979 revolution. The sultan, who has no designated successor, is by all accounts an erudite figure equally at home in traditional Arab and modern Western society. One dispatch from 2008 prepared for a visiting U.S. envoy said, ""You will find the Sultan an engaging interlocutor. He is an intellectual whose interests range from sustainable agriculture to classical music."" He is also a pragmatist who has personally steered Oman's foreign policy. As one U.S. diplomatic cable from the Embassy in Oman puts it, ""A common saying in the region is that Oman is a friend to all and the enemy of none."" Qaboos visited Iran in 2009 (for the first time since 1974), signing a number of agreements while urging Ayatollah Khamenei to engage in dialogue with the U.S. over Iran's nuclear program and other disputes. A U.S. diplomatic cable from 2010 published by WikiLeaks described Oman's perspective this way: ""Although they do not find the threat imminent, Iran is Oman's number one strategic threat; however, the GoO fundamentally believes the threat can be mitigated through careful management of the relationship."" One example of that management is the recent establishment of a joint Oman-Iran investment company. Given its proximity, Iran should be a natural trading partner for Oman, but it can't offer the help Oman needs in developing its mineral wealth and diversifying its economy. For those goals, Qaboos looks west. Oman has a free trade agreement with the U.S., allowing American companies to establish businesses there. It also buys U.S. military hardware, such as F-16s. Even so, Omani authorities are careful not to antagonize public opinion by too close an association with the United States. The Omanis were quick to reject reports last year that they would host U.S. Patriot anti-missile batteries, with a senior official stressing that Oman ""does not allow its territory to be used to carry out any military operations against any country in the region."" Similarly, both in private and public, Oman has been highly critical of U.S. policy toward Israel, repeatedly appealing for Washington to exert greater pressure on Israel in negotiations with the Palestinians. One diplomat in the region likens Oman's role to that of the Swiss or Swedes elsewhere: avoid making enemies but avoid entangling alliances.","Sultanate has ""cordial"" relations with U.S., Iran .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Making good on a threat of election day violence, the Taliban sliced off the index fingers of at least two people in Kandahar province, according to a vote monitoring group. Electoral workers count votes at a school in Kabul. After they cast their ballots, the fingers of Afghan voters are stained with ink to prevent them from voting multiple times. The fingers of the two women in Kandahar, a stronghold of the Taliban, were cut off because they voted, said Nader Naderi of the Free and Fair Election Foundation. The Taliban had vowed to disrupt Thursday's election and the risk was too great for some Afghans to venture out, especially in the southern provinces that form the heartland of the radical Islamist group. Just days ahead of the election, U.S. Marines and other NATO forces carried out military operations to clear and hold sectors that have long been in the Taliban grip, and free up the population to vote. Sporadic attacks on election day killed 26 people and injured scores more. Still, Afghan officials hailed the voting as a success. On Friday, the European Union echoed those sentiments and congratulated Afghanistan for holding elections under what it called challenging circumstances. Watch how counting is under way in Afghan provinces . ""While deploring the loss of life, we believe that the security measures successfully prevented any major disruptions of the elections,"" the E.U. said in a statement. Preliminary results will be announced on a piecemeal basis from Tuesday to September 5, according to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan. Zekeria Barakzi, the deputy chief electoral officer for the commission, told CNN that as of Friday, the counting was complete in 30 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Barakzi said that after September 5 there would be a period -- which could last a month -- of accepting objections and complaints about the elections. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Kabul said the United States has ""every confidence that they (the commission members) will be able to finish this part of the electoral process in a transparent fashion"" Meanwhile, the top two presidential candidates -- President Hamid Karzai and his chief rival Abdullah Abdullah -- positioned themselves as the likely winners in the race. Karzai's campaign team claimed Friday he was on track for victory in the country's presidential election, while Abdullah also said he was leading the vote. Their claims came as election officials said the results of the vote, seen as a judgment on the Karzai government's efforts in tackling Taliban insurgents, poverty and corruption, would be rolled out starting August 25. Meanwhile Abdullah, seen as Karzai's main challenger, told Associated Press Television that he believed he was leading, characterizing the vote count as ""promising"" despite what he described as sporadic ""rigging"" across the country. Thursday's election, the country's second since the 2001 fall of the Taliban, was held amid a climate of fear as militants threatened to violently disrupt the process. Violence on voting day killed 26 Afghans and injured scores more. U.S. President Barack Obama offered strong praise Friday for the election, calling it ""an important step forward"" in Afghanistan's struggle for democracy in the face of ideological extremists. ""The future belongs to those who want to build, not ... destroy,"" Obama said at the White House, adding that he was struck by the ""courage in the face of intimidation"" demonstrated by the millions of Afghans who went to the polls.","Taliban slice off fingers of two people in Kandahar province, vote monitors say .

"(CNN) -- For nearly two weeks, Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body lay unclaimed at the Boston medical examiner's office. A funeral home now has the remains and a quest is underway to find him a resting place in Massachusetts. But first, he will undergo a second ""independent"" autopsy demanded by his relatives, a family spokeswoman said. Other hurdles remain. His death certificate has yet to be filed with the Boston city clerk, and there is no burial plot yet, according to the funeral home holding the remains. If no grave site is found after the second autopsy, Peter Stefan, the owner of the funeral home, plans to ask the government to find a grave. Three cemeteries that Stefan contacted said they feared reprisals, but the funeral home owner said you can't pick and choose when it comes to a burial. ""This is what we do in a civilized society, regardless of the circumstances,"" Stefan said. ""As I told some of them, at the immediate moment you may fear (reprisal), but later on, when things calm down, people are going to resent you because you didn't do it."" Tsarnaev died on April 19 after he and his brother shot a university police officer to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them, according to authorities. A few days earlier -- April 15 -- he and his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly bombed the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding more than 260. CNN obtained a copy of Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's death certificate, which lists the cause of death as ""gunshot wounds of torso and extremities"" and ""blunt trauma to head and torso."" The document notes that Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over and dragged by a car. It lists the manner of death as homicide, and denotes that he was ""DOA,"" or dead on arrival. Authorities have said his younger brother may have run him over as they resisted arrest days after the marathon attacks. Separately, 12 people remained hospitalized with bombing-related injuries on Saturday, according to a count by CNN. None were in serious condition. Also, the frantic manhunt two weeks ago for the surviving bombing suspect drew the attention of gun rights advocates at their convention in Houston. National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said residents were ""imprisoned"" in their homes with no means to protect themselves while police searched for the younger Tsarnaev. ""How many Bostonians wished they had a gun two weeks ago?"" he asked. ""Boston proves it. When brave law enforcement officers did their job in that city so courageously, good guys with guns stopped terrorists with guns,"" he said. 'Everyone deserves to be buried' Tsarnaev's body remained unclaimed until Thursday, when an uncle, who had previously publicly condemned his alleged attacks, had a funeral parlor pick up the body. The uncle, Maryland resident Ruslan Tsarni, had decried the alleged bombers as ""losers"" after the attacks. Their parents in Dagestan have said they will not fly his body back to Russia for burial, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. CNN affiliate WCVB reported that the hearse that picked up Tsarnaev's body ferried it to a funeral home 30 miles away from Boston, near the Rhode Island state line. Residents of North Attleboro, Massachusetts, took to the streets to boo Tsarnaev, when they heard about the presence of the corpse in their town, The Sun Chronicle reported. Others took to social media to vent anger at the funeral home for accepting the body. It was later transported to Stefan's funeral home, Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester. ""Everyone deserves to be buried,"" he said. The marathon bombings . Authorities say the brothers carried out the Boston Marathon bombings using explosive devices made of pressure cookers. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts, charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries the death penalty. He is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother's death. Investigators found explosives residue in the apartment that the elder Tsarnaev shared with his wife and young daughter, a source briefed on the investigation said Friday. It has turned up in at least three places at the small apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the source said: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has said they built the bombs there, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said. Other target, a cover-up . The marathon was not the original target, the officials said. The brothers had set their sights on a suicide attack on the city's massive Independence Day celebration, which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally. But the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated and a day or two before the Boston Marathon, they changed their plans, the officials said. They spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. One key question involves whether intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security agencies could have done more in their investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in recent years before the attack and whether they shared information effectively enough. An independent government review is underway. In an interview with Univision published on its website on Saturday, President Barack Obama said cooperation among agencies can always get better. But he again defended U.S. efforts. ""I think we can continue to improve and refine how we're engaging and countering terrorist activity,"" Obama said. ""I don't think it's fair to say though that law enforcement dropped the ball."" It is very difficult to prevent attacks when dealing with individuals who are self-radicalized and not part of a massive conspiracy or network, he said about the current belief of investigators looking at the origins of the Boston bombing. Tsarnaev's widow, Katherine Russell, has remained largely out of view since her husband's death, staying in her parents' Rhode Island home. Her attorney, Amato DeLuca, says the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an ""absolute shock"" to Russell and her family. Three of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends have been accused of covering for the bombing suspects. Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both from Kazakhstan, were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was charged with making false statements to investigators. All three are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. According to FBI affidavits released this week, they left with the backpack and Vaseline -- which Tazhayakov believed could be used to make bombs -- and Tsarnaev's laptop. Investigators found the backpack, fireworks and Vaseline in a landfill last week after a two-day search. The laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19, the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev's attorney Robert Stahl said. The FBI is examining the laptop, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or have been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Susan Candiotti, Eric Feigel, Carol Cratty, Marina Carver and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report.","NEW: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's laptop was turned over the night of an FBI raid, attorney says .

"Editor's note: Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also hosts a conservative national radio talk show. ""If you have any respect for humanity, you shouldn't be wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt,"" Glenn Beck says. NEW YORK (CNN) -- What T-shirt should you wear when you need to blend in with terrorists? Incredibly, we have an answer to that question. Robin Meade conducted an exclusive interview that aired this past weekend on Headline News with Thomas Howes, Keith Stansell and Marc Gonsalves, three of the 15 now-former captives of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. It is a leftist terror group that has specialized in kidnapping during its war with the Colombian state and capitalism in general. After their plane crashed, the captives spent five torturous years hoping to see their families again, at times being locked in boxes at night around rats, pigs and bats. Sometimes they had weights chained around their neck and were led around at gunpoint with a dog leash. Upon finally escaping, Keith Stansell emotionally described the moment he laid eyes on his 5-year-old twins for the first time. It took a rescue by the Colombian Army to reunite them with freedom and probably save their lives. The army posed as terrorists, persuading FARC to turn the prisoners over to them, saving 15 innocent victims of the brutal terrorism that has ripped Colombia apart for years. But how did this happen? How did FARC get fooled? Colombian Army members infiltrated the highest levels of the organization, telling FARC they were going to take the hostages to meet an ""international mission."" They landed in a helicopter and spent 22 minutes on the ground collecting the captives and speaking in code to one another before taking off and letting the victims (who included a former Colombian presidential candidate) know that they were safe. So, what is the uniform of choice when fooling terrorists in Colombia? Sure, there's plenty of talk of one intelligence team member, nervous about the mission, who wore a Red Cross symbol against orders. But other accounts confirm the use of something you can probably pick up at any mall: a Che Guevara T-shirt.  That's right, the same T-shirts you see Hollywood celebrities, starving pseudo-artists and confused hipster teens wearing around local coffee shops. To all those who decide that you want to be coffee house communist-chic, remember this: When you are wearing a Che T-shirt, you're wearing the same shirt that makes terrorists believe you're just one of the gang. I hope that latte is tasty. How Che became such a revered superhero of the hard-core left is laughable. First of all, he wasn't even a good revolutionary. He failed in his attempt at world revolution almost as badly as communism has failed in the places it was actually tried. ""This is a history of a failure"" is how he himself described his efforts in the Congo. He was killed in Bolivia, trying to fire up another failure of a war. Earlier, he even managed to drop his gun and shoot himself in the face. But more important than his incompetence is the fact that the man was a mass killer. Hundreds were reportedly executed on his watch, and that doesn't include the deaths incurred in the wars he was constantly trying to start. He described his maniacal lust for war in his writings, saying he savored ""the acrid smell of gunpowder and blood of the enemy's death."" How this guy is a hero to the anti-war crowd is truly perplexing. I should also point out what seemingly gets eliminated from the Hollywood movies attempting to glorify him: his bouts with racism. When describing the differences in the strife between ""Europeans"" and ""the black,"" the supposedly progressive-minded Che wrote, ""their different attitudes of life separate them completely: the black is indolent and fanciful, he spends his money on frivolity and drink; the European comes from a tradition of working and saving which follows him to this corner of America and drives him to get ahead."" Ohhhhh, so the ""European"" is a hard worker while ""the black"" is a fanciful drunk. Now I understand the difference. I wonder if that quote would inspire the volunteer office of Barack Obama's Houston supporters to remove their Che flag. After it was spotted on the wall in a local news video, Obama's campaign, far from a haven for right-wing nut jobs, went out of its way to make sure everyone knew that it had nothing to do with the flag and didn't approve of its use. If Che were such a hero, why would that be necessary? Revisionist history's fusion with fashion sense isn't exactly new, but its popularity seems to be growing. When actress Cameron Diaz showed up in Peru, she thought she had a trendy bag that might garner some jealous stares. People were staring, sure, but for all the wrong reasons. The bag, purchased in China, featured a red star and the words ""Serve the people"" on it. The problem? That was Mao Zedong's most famous political slogan, and it stirred up memories of the Maoist Shining Path insurgency, which, according to the BBC, was responsible for 70,000 deaths in Peru during the '80s and '90s. Diaz apologized later for ""inadvertently"" offending anyone.   It's been five years since the story of convicted abortion clinic bomber and Olympic park bomber Eric Rudolph led the news. As he was evading police capture for months, stories of townspeople donning ""Run Rudolph Run"" bumper stickers were correctly greeted with horrified disdain. With the exception of the fact that Che killed a lot more people, what's the difference? You shouldn't be wearing an ""I heart abortion clinic bombers"" T-shirt, and if you have any respect for humanity, you shouldn't be wearing a Che Guevara T-shirt, either. Perhaps I should cash in on a Che T-shirt featuring his clichéd image too. Except this time, instead of glorifying him, it could specifically be designed to point out his pathetic and brutal legacy. Honestly, though, I'm afraid I'd be sued. The communist revolutionary who dedicated his life to fight capitalism has now become nothing more than a piece of merchandise. Lesson learned: In the end, capitalism always wins. When your only option is a Che shirt, maybe it's just better to go topless.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","The Colombian Army infiltrated highest level of terror group to free 15 hostages .

"(CNN) -- The bow of a U.S. Navy warship that grounded on a Philippine reef in January was cut from the rest of the hull on Tuesday, lifted by a massive crane and dropped on a waiting barge. ""The bow section of the USS Guardian was lifted out of the water around 2:45 p.m.,"" said Enrico Efren Evangelista, head of the Philippine coast guard Palawan District, according to the official Philippine News Agency. ""The lifting of the first large hull section was a significant accomplishment. Each of these sections weigh about 250 tons,"" Capt. Mark Matthews, supervisor of the salvage operation, said in a U.S. Navy 7th Fleet blog post. The hull will be removed in four sections, the Navy said. ""Preparing the ship for this sectioning has been extremely challenging. We have had to painstakingly clear about a two-foot path inside the ship, removing everything that is in our way,"" Matthews said. ""Once the path is clear, the hull cutting is done manually by Navy divers and salvage contractors using chainsaws and reciprocating saws, and some of this cutting is underwater using hydraulically driven tools."" Big parts coming off ship on reef . The removal of the bow of the U.S. Navy minesweeper was followed by that of the ship's auxiliary engine room, a 200-ton piece that was removed Wednesday afternoon. With the removal of the two sections, about 900 tons of the formerly 1,312-ton warship remain on Tubbataha Reef, the news agency reported. The U.S. Navy expects the Guardian to be completely removed from the reef by the second week of April, Evangelista said. It was decommissioned and stricken from the naval registry on February 15. The minesweeper ran onto the reef on January 17. An investigation into the grounding is ongoing, but Navy officials said in January that the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which prepares the digital navigation charts used by the Navy, has reported the location of the reef was misplaced on a chart by nine miles. Tubbataha Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to about 500 species of fish, 350 species of coral as well as whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles and breeding seabirds, according to UNESCO. The Guardian is estimated to have damaged about 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet) of the reef. The Navy has pledged to clean up the debris created when waves stripped off pieces of fiberglass covering the wooden hull of the ship and to try to restore the reef as much as possible. Philippine officials said that the country would seek compensation for reef damage. Harry K. Thomas Jr., the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, has assured Filipinos that the United States ""will provide appropriate compensation for damage to the reef caused by the ship.""","Two huge chunks of USS Guardian have been removed from the reef .

""But in light of Jamey's death, it became clear to me in an instant that living a gay life without publicly acknowledging it is simply not enough to make any significant contribution to the immense work that lies ahead on the road to complete equality."" Rodemeyer was found dead September 18 outside his parents' home in Buffalo, New York. His parents said he had experienced years of bullying over his sexual orientation.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russia's attacks against the former Soviet republic of Georgia have ""substantially damaged Russia's standing in the world,"" President Bush told reporters Monday after returning from his trip to Asia. President Bush tells reporters that Russia is jeopardizing its relations with the United States and Europe. Bush also warned Russia against trying to depose Georgia's government, saying evidence suggests Russia may be preparing to do so. ""Russia must reverse the course it appears to be on,"" Bush said in the Rose Garden of the White House. The Russian military advanced farther into Georgia on Monday, moving beyond Georgia's two breakaway provinces, according to Georgia's government, which has called for a cease-fire. Russian and Georgian officials said Russia had entered Senaki, in western Georgia, outside of breakaway Abkhazia. But Russia has not confirmed any other advance of its ground forces beyond South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Bush said evidence suggests Russia would soon begin bombing the civilian airport in Georgia's capital city, Tbilisi. ""If these reports are accurate ... these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from Russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in [Georgian breakaway region] South Ossetia that existed before the fighting began on August 6,"" Bush said.  Watch Bush demand a cease-fire » . World powers have urged Russia to agree to an immediate cease-fire with Georgia and accept international mediation on the crisis in South Ossetia.  See photos from the conflict »  Bush said Russia's invasion of Georgia and the threat to Georgia's democratically elected government ""is unacceptable in the 21st century"" and has ""substantially damaged Russia's standing in the world."" ""These actions jeopardize Russians' relations ... with the United States and Europe,"" Bush said. Earlier Monday, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said his nation will take its efforts to their ""logical conclusion."" Russian officials insisted their efforts were aimed at stopping Georgian military actions against Russian peacekeepers in the breakaway regions and against Ossetians loyal to Russia. Over several years, Russia has given passports to many residents of South Ossetia -- which borders Russia -- and declared them Russian citizens. Georgia's ambassador to Washington said he hopes Putin ""will listen to what President Bush had to say."" ""The time is very critical for my country,"" Vasil Sikharulidze said. ""Georgia faces extinction under this brutal Russian invasion."" The conflict began last week after Georgia said it launched a military operation Thursday in South Ossetia after artillery fire from separatists killed 10 people. Russia sent its forces there Friday, accusing Georgia of plotting to wipe out Ossetians loyal to Russia. By the weekend, Russia had sent forces to Abkhazia, a second breakaway Georgian territory. Georgia has contended that Russia merely wants control of an oil pipeline, and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said Monday that Russia seeks to stamp out his country's ""democratic ambitions."" South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali, lay in smoldering ruins Monday after four days of fighting. Each side accused the other of killing large numbers of civilians. Russia said at least 2,000 people had been killed in Tskhinvali. At the United Nations in New York on Monday, Russia refused to sign off on a resolution calling for a cease-fire with Georgia despite mounting pressure from world powers. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the proposed U.N. resolution, drafted by French officials, was lacking in a ""serious number"" of areas. ""I can't see us accepting this French draft of this resolution,"" Churkin told reporters late Monday. ""We will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this."" One of the issues Churkin mentioned was that the draft resolution, which has not been made public, did not mention Georgia's previous ""aggression"" in South Ossetia. Russia argues that it is acting in response to a Georgian attack on the territory, whose separatist government is backed by Moscow. The details of the draft -- backed by the United States and the other European members of the Security Council -- include calls for an immediate cease-fire, a complete withdrawal of Russian and Georgian forces and participation in mediation. The council could take up the proposal on Tuesday -- but as one of five permanent members of the Security Council, Russia could veto any resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke by telephone Monday with most of the foreign ministers belonging to the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations about the conflict. The G-8 consists of the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia. Russia, which officially joined the group in 1998, was absent from Monday's discussions. The ministers reiterated their support for Georgian sovereignty and called for a diplomatic solution, Deputy State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters. Rice and the ministers voiced concern over the increasing civilian casualties and pressed Russia to accept a cease-fire. Saakashvili said Monday he signed an internationally brokered cease-fire proposal that was to be taken to Moscow on Monday evening by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb. NATO also is involved in efforts to broker a deal between Georgia and Russia. The U.S. is trying to transport 2,000 Georgian troops serving in Iraq back home to fend off Russian advances, but beyond that ""there are no discussions about the U.S. getting involved militarily,"" Wood said. The United States has begun to provide humanitarian assistance to Georgia, however. The first package of supplies is expected to be depleted by Monday evening. The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi declared a ""disaster"" in Georgia and has authorized $250,000 in initial funding for supplies to assist about 10,000 people. Wood said the U.S. is pre-positioning other supplies such as tents and blankets and bringing in additional replacement supplies from Germany. Over the weekend, the State Department allowed families of U.S. diplomats in Georgia to leave the country. Diplomats, however, would remain, the department said. The United States also has helped about 170 Americans leave Georgia in two convoys, with a third planned Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, international headlines were dominated by the shocking emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a new and quick-spreading deadly virus that began in Southern China and took just weeks to spread to 37 different countries. Perhaps the illness's biggest legacy though is illustrating the speed and ease with which a disease can traverse the global travel network and how frequent flyers can often be in the front line. ""They're more exposed because they're in contact with a higher number of (potentially infected) individuals,"" says Yamir Moreno of University of Zaragoza, an expert in the spreading patterns of epidemics. ""While traveling, they remain confined in a relatively small space, where they interact with other passengers that, again, might already be infected."" Though passengers often consider a plane pumping recycled air as an incubator for disease, such a viewpoint is inaccurate, according to Martin Fendt, a spokesman from plane manufacturing company Airbus. Only a portion of the air inside a plane is recirculated; the rest is fresh air sourced from outside. The recycled air is passed through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters, which removes viruses, bacteria and dust. ""Because air is circulated vertically around each row and drawn out through under-seat floor vents, it cannot move forward or aft. So the ability of viruses to transfer beyond a seat row is almost zero,"" he adds. Read more: Is the travel industry prepared for the next epidemic? Fortunately, many of the health risks faced by road warriors can be easily mitigated with a little education. According to Gregory Hartl, a spokesman at the World Health Organization, ""if frequent travelers are aware of the risks, and take the required precautions, they can minimize the risk of acquiring disease."" Phyllis Kozarsky, a medical consultant with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirms that reading up on an area before setting off is one of the best ways to safeguard one's health. ""People need to be alert to pubic health messages and what's emerging, be it SARS or H1N1,"" she says. She adds that disease prevention isn't too different abroad as it is on the ground. ""Do the same things you would at home to avoid illness, mainly, wash your hands frequently. You can pick things up on your hands that you can transfer by rubbing your eyes, or touching your face."" While epidemics attract the headlines sexually transmitted infections and vector- and food-borne illnesses still top the charts when it comes to mortality rates. ""Sometimes, when people are going to exotic places, they focus on strange diseases that don't happen very often, like Ebola, that are strong media contenders, when actually, influenza or malaria might be the biggest risk,"" says Kozarsky. Andy Tatem, a reader in the Geology and Environmental Science department at the University of Southampton is the developer of vbd-air.com, a web tool developed for the Transportation Research Board to help track the spread of mosquito-transmitted illnesses via air travel. He believes the most prevalent travel-related ailments are also avoidable. ""Most of the diseases people contract abroad are preventable. In some instances, it's just a matter of getting the right vaccine, or wearing insecticide and sleeping under a bed net,"" he says. ""Truthfully, outbreaks like SARS and H1N1 can be more difficult to avoid, because they can hit a city before you even know it. Whereas you can lower the risks of diarrhoeal diseases (which are among the most prevalent) simply by being careful with drinking water and making sure all the food you eat is cooked."" Kozarsky reiterates the point, adding that many traveler afflictions are also self-treatable. ""If you have the right medication with you, you can feel better in a matter of minutes, instead of days,"" she notes. She advises consulting a good travel doctor for a list of recommended vaccines and medications (the International Society of Travel Medicine has a global directory online). She also recommends venturing out to the drug store prior to travel. ""Go to your favorite pharmacy and walk up and down the aisles, and take the things off the shelf you'd like to have at home,"" she advises, adding that Imodium and antibiotics are essential additions to any travel medical kit. Really, though, the biggest suitcase essential is common sense, ""which most people forget to pack when they travel,"" she says.","Frequent flyers in frontline of potential infectious diseases .

"Berlin (CNN) -- It happens more often than you might think: Streets cordoned off and bomb disposal experts called in to deal with unexploded bombs that were dropped on Germany nearly 70 years ago. Commuters in Berlin Wednesday were the latest to suffer the inconvenience of dealing with ordnance dating back to World War II. This time the culprit was a Russian-made aerial bomb weighing in at 100 kilograms (220 pounds), unearthed just two meters away from a train track leading into the city's main train station. Nearly 840 people were evacuated from the central Berlin area, police said, before bomb disposal experts moved in to defuse the device. About 25 minutes after they started their delicate task, the mechanical fuse was unscrewed and the bomb was disabled. Alert over, Berliners could return home and go back to their everyday business. A member of the bomb disposal team told CNN the bomb could have blown a crater 3 to 4 meters wide and 3 meters (10 feet) deep, had it gone off. The device was discovered by Heidestrasse, a lightly populated street with an industrial feel in the former ""no man's land"" between East Berlin and West Berlin. ""They do risk a lot, but they have a lot of experience,"" Berlin police spokesman Jens Berger told CNN as the bomb disposal team set to work. ""Here in Berlin it is a fact of daily life to defuse bombs, but without question they are risking a lot."" Wednesday's operation was made more complicated because there was a depot for freight trains on one side of the site and houses on the other, Berger said. The device was found Tuesday afternoon by a bomb disposal team that was checking out a construction site near the Hauptbahnhof, the central station. Roads were closed in the area overnight as the experts assessed the best way to deal with the device. Some train services were delayed Wednesday, said Holger Auferkamp, spokesman for national railway operator Deutsche Bahn, but Berlin's metro system, or S-Bahn, was not affected. It may seem surprising that unexploded bombs remain undiscovered in Berlin and other German cities decades after World War II ended. But so many were dropped by Allied forces during the war that finding them all will still take years. From the archives: WWII bombs defused, allowing 45,000 evacuated residents to return . Their presence is sufficiently common that private bomb disposal teams are contracted by German railway operator Deutsche Bahn and other companies to check that sites are safe when building works are planned. Some bigger devices have been found elsewhere. A 250-kilogram (550-pound) bomb discovered in central Munich last August had to be detonated where it lay because the fuse was unstable. The explosion damaged nearby buildings. In 2011, 45,000 residents were evacuated from the city of Koblenz, situated on the Rhine and Moselle rivers, as bomb squads dealt with two bombs and a military fog-producing device that were dropped by American and British warplanes in the last years of the war. One was a 1.8-metric ton British air bomb that could have wiped out the city center, according to the local fire brigade. They were exposed 65 years after being dropped when water levels in the Rhine River fell to record lows, prompting what officials said was the biggest evacuation since the war's end. Sometimes the bombs can have a more deadly impact. Three members of a bomb-disposal squad were killed in 2010 when the device they were trying to defuse in the German town Gottingen went off.

CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Berlin and Stephanie Halasz from London, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","NEW: The bomb squad says the device could have blown a crater 10 feet deep .

"New York (CNN) -- A multi-million-dollar intrusion-detection system at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport failed to notice a man who walked onto a runway Sunday, authorities said. The man, who was arrested after he was spotted by an airline employee, told police he was on a jet ski on Jamaica Bay adjacent to the runway and became stranded, according to Port Authority of New York & New Jersey official Anthony Hayes. The man climbed onto the tarmac from the water but the airport's security system did not detect him. The security system, called Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (PIDS), is manufactured by the Massachusetts-based Raytheon company. According to Raytheon's website, the mission of the $100 million system is ""to detect, assess and track intruders attempting to gain access into exterior secure areas."" The system includes ground surveillance radars, video cameras with motion detection and ""smart"" fencing, according to Raytheon's website. In a statement, the Port Authority, which oversees the airport, called for ""an expedited review of the incident and a complete investigation to determine how Raytheon's perimeter intrusion detection system -- which exceeds federal requirements -- could be improved. Our goal is to keep the region's airports safe and secure at all times."" Raytheon would not comment on the incident. The airport is located in Jamaica Bay in the southeast section of Queens County in New York City. The runway where the man was spotted juts out into water that is surrounded by marsh and wetlands. The bay is easily accessible from the Rockaway Penninsula. According to a complaint filed by the Queens district attorney, a Delta Air Lines employee observed the man ""walking across the run way,"" he was arrested and charged with criminal trespassing.

"(CNN) -- There is no reason to believe a little girl spotted in India is Madeleine McCann, the British girl who has been missing for more than four years, a family spokesman said Thursday. Reports of the spotting of a girl bearing a resemblance to the child who disappeared while on vacation with her parents in Portugal sparked a frenzy on Twitter. But Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for her parents, Kate and Gerry, said the latest reports were no more credible than other tips that proved incorrect over the years. ""They have learnt not to take these reports seriously,"" Mitchell said of the parents, adding: ""There is nothing to suggest that this is a breakthrough."" He said he was not aware of any requests for DNA to match with the girl seen in Leh, northern India.

"(CNN) -- J.J. Abrams won't say much about the next ""Star Wars"" film, which he is directing â€” though info about casting and the story has piled up in bits and pieces. Now a new bit, from Abrams' himself: At a Berlin press conference for ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" an entrepreneurial audience member asked the filmmaker about longtime collaborator and composer Michael Giacchino, who has provided the score for most every major Abrams work. The audience member asked: Would Giacchino also do the score for ""Star Wars?"" The short answer: No â€” John Williams, most famous for composing the six other ""Star Wars"" films, will, probably. The longer answer: Michael Giacchino is great! But so is John Williams! 'Veep' renewed by HBO for season 3 . Abrams was caught on tape saying this, so it'll be hard for him to drape it in much mystery, though questions persist: Have they had a formal meeting about working together? Requests to both Abrams and Williams for comment were not immediately returned. Updates to come. 'American Idol': Top 4 Power List revisited . See Abrams' full comments about Giacchino and Williams below: . Can you talk a little about Michael Giacchino's music and will he be scoring Star Wars too, or not? Michael Giacchino is an incredible composer who I was lucky enough to begin working with on Alias. He was doing videogame soundtracks and we started working together then and have done a number of films and television series since. He is brilliant and it's very easy for me to say to him, looking at a scene, ""Okay, this scene needs to be about the conflict between these characters. It's got to be hopeful but you also have to feel that there's a tension still."" I can say all these ridiculous things and he has to listen and say ""okay"" and go off and come back and present music that invariably does that but so much more. He's truly one of the most influential members of our crew and I think this score, he just really out did himself, especially with the score for Benedict's character. I think that suite that he wrote was just brilliant. Again, for Star Wars it is very early days to know but I believe that going forward John Williams will be doing that film, because apparently he was there long before I was.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama filled out his Cabinet nominations on Thursday when he tapped Penny Pritzker as commerce secretary and Michael Froman as U.S. trade representative. At an event in the White House Rose Garden, Obama heralded his two nominees as leaders with ""extraordinary experience"" who are about ""growing opportunity"" for the American middle class. ""One of the reasons I'm proud to nominate them is they don't forget what matters,"" Obama said standing between the two nominees. ""They know this is not about just growing balance sheets, it's about growing opportunity for people, it's about growing a sense of security for the middle class. And most of all, they operate with integrity and they understand that that public service is a privilege and you've got to do it right when you get involved on behalf of the American people."" If confirmed by the Senate, Pritzker and Froman would both step into economic posts although they have noticeably different backgrounds. Pritzker, one of the wealthiest women in America, is an heiress to the Hyatt hotel fortune. She heads the investment firm PSP Capital Partners and an associated property firm, Pritzker Realty Group. Forbes Magazine pegged her net worth at $1.85 billion as of March. Pritzker is a longtime Obama donor who was national finance chairwoman of his 2008 presidential campaign and national co-chairwoman of the 2012 re-election effort. Along with donations she solicited from other elite contributors as a ""bundler,"" Pritzker personally gave the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee $63,500 in 2008 and $117,400 in 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Froman is deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. In that role, he has served as a liaison to global economic summits and advised the president on international finance. Before working for the White House, Froman was an executive at Citigroup and was chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin in the 1990s. Froman also attended Harvard Law School with Obama and was the editor of the school's prestigious law review. The president described Pritzker as ""one of our countries most distinguished business leaders"" and said Froman ""has established himself as one of the world's foremost experts on our global economy."" ""We went to law school together,"" Obama said of Froman. ""He was much smarter than me then; he continues to be smarter than me now."" The announcements come ahead of the president's trip to Mexico and Costa Rica, where Obama said Thursday he hopes to ""deepen our economic and trade relationships across Latin America"" and ""offer our businesses growing markets where they can sell more American-made goods and services abroad. "" It's unclear when the Senate will take up the nominations but they must first be addressed by relevant committees. Pritzker is likely to face questions about her finances. Sen. Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican and a taxpayer watchdog, called for a Senate examination of her taxes in light of reports his office pointed to that suggested her family's finances benefited from off-shore havens over the years. ""If the Commerce Committee doesn't explore these questions with the nominee, I plan to do so, but I hope the committee will give the tax history a serious look,"" he said in a statement. If confirmed, Pritzker and Froman would replace acting secretaries. Rebecca Blank has served as acting secretary of the Commerce Department since June 2012, She stepped into the role after John Bryson resigned less than two weeks after an episode involving a seizure and two traffic accidents. Bryson had been on a medical leave of absence since his involvement in the auto accidents in California that his office said were linked to the seizure. In his resignation letter, he said his seizure was a ""distraction from my performance as secretary"" and that the country ""would be better served by a change of leadership of the department."" Ambassador Demetrios Marantis has served as acting U.S. trade representative since March 15 of this year, after Ron Kirk, a close confidant and regular golf partner to Obama, stepped down. With Thursday's announcements, Obama will have nominated people to all vacant Cabinet posts for his second term. Four of Obama's second-term nominations -- Secretary of State John Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell -- have already been confirmed by the Senate. A number of Obama's nominations have yet to be voted on by the Senate. These include labor secretary nominee Thomas Perez, transportation secretary nominee Anthony Foxx and energy secretary nominee Ernest Moniz.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid sealed a record-extending 32nd La Liga title after Wednesday's 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbao maintained an unassailable seven-point lead over arch rivals and defending Spanish champions Barcelona with two matches to play. Goals from Gonzalo Higuain, Mesut Ozil and Cristiano Ronaldo wrapped up the clinching victory for Jose Mourinho's men at San Mames. Mourinho has now won league titles in Portugal with Porto, England with Chelsea, Italy with Inter and Spain with Real, who broke Barcelona's three-year La Liga reign. ""This one has been the toughest. I've won seven league titles overall and I know what it feels like,"" Mourinho told the club's website. ""Barcelona won all their games, as befits the great team that they are. They've been winning to the very last day. They are a club with great tradition that knows we deserved to win this title."" Earlier on Wednesday, Barca thrashed fourth-placed Malaga 4-1 to keep up the pressure on Real as Lionel Messi scored his eighth hat-trick this season and broke Gerd Muller's record for a European season. Argentina's three-time world player of the year now has 68 goals in 2011-12, going past the mark Germany legend Muller set in 1972-73 for Bayern Munich. It took Messi's tally in La Liga to 46, two more than Ronaldo, but his efforts have proved in vain. Real's trip to the Europa League finalists looked a tough one, and when Ronaldo saw an early penalty saved by Gorka Iraizoz, their small band of supporters might have been worried. But Argentina striker Higuain settled nerves with a fine strike before Ronaldo played in Ozil for a second to make it 2-0 at halftime. Early in the second half the Portugal star netted his 44th in the league this season with a close-range header, and Bilbao's last hopes of salvaging something from the game ended when Javi Martinez was sent off for a second yellow card. At the finish Mourinho was hoisted high by his players as they celebrated the club's first championship since 2008. ""We have to celebrate this championship. We have to continue working after tomorrow because next season will also be tough and we have games to play still in this campaign,"" the 49-year-old said. ""This team deserves even more emotion and affection, and I expect the Bernabeu to give it to them in our match against Mallorca."" The Dutch title was also decided on Wednesday as Ajax Amsterdam beat VVV Venlo 2-0 with goals in each half from Siem De Jong. It is Ajax's second straight title under Frank de Boer and came after a late-season charge with 13 straight wins. Ajax were eight points behind joint leaders PSV Eindhoven and AZ Alkmaar in mid-February before their unstoppable run. In Serie A, Juventus' lead was cut to a single point after being held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Lecce. Second-placed AC Milan beat Atalanta 2-0 to revive their hopes on a night Juve could have clinched the title if results had gone in their favor. Sulley Muntari put Milan ahead in the San Siro and Robinho sealed a vital victory in injury time. In Turin, Juventus appeared to be cruising to a routine home win when Claudio Marchisio scored in the first half. Lecce's hopes appeared over when Juan Cuadrado was sent off for a second booking early in the second half, but the leaders wasted a string of chances before Andrea Bertolacci took advantage of a horrible error by home keeper Gianluigi Buffon to level. In other action, Inter Milan's Champions League chances receded with a 3-1 loss at Parma which left the 2010 European titleholders three points behind Napoli and Udinese in the race for third place.","Real Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 to clinch La Liga title .

"(CNN) -- Critics may have been divided over the MTV reality show ""Buckwild"" when it premiered last year, but fans weren't. According to the site TV By The Numbers, it ranked as the top-rated original cable series on Thursday nights among viewers 12 to 34, and pulled in an average of 3 million total viewers per episode since its premiere in January. So reports of the death of 21-year-old cast member Shain Gandee on Monday hit fans hard. Shain Gandee was happy with life before death . ""I still cannot get over the fact that Shain Gandee died he was my favorite,"" tweeted one fan named Buffy Sue. ""Rest In Peace. #Buckwild"" The series, which follows a group of young people as they have fun in Sissonville, West Virginia, was controversial before it even aired. Many believed the show would fill the void of the wildly successful ""Jersey Shore,"" which featured plenty of drunken shenanigans, hookups and fights. Before ""Buckwild"" premiered, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, sent MTV a letter calling it a ""travesty."" ""This show plays to ugly, inaccurate stereotypes about the people of West Virginia,"" he wrote. John Stevens, the executive producer of the show, countered that the series was actually unlike any others on television, as the ""Buckwild"" bunch's idea of a good time was more hanging out in the woods than on Twitter or Facebook. ""[I]t's not like looking at a train wreck. ... There is a certain coolness to it,"" Stevens told Entertainment Weekly. ""It's different than a lot of the stuff that has been produced. I think it's going to get people talking and it might change people's perspectives. These kids are totally wild and carefree. It will be very refreshing to the MTV audience."" In reviewing the show, The Hollywood Reporter said it ""follows a slew of wild, drunken West Virginians in their late teens and early 20s."" ""Not only is it another tired portrayal of Southern stereotypes, but it's also inexcusably poorly executed,"" the review said. ""The six girls and three boys (trouble is sure to brew with those odds) stumble through and stiffly carry out their force-fed cues."" Hollywood.com was a bit more forgiving. ""Sure, watching them might be amusing fun (I can't wait to see that insane lady in the red wig yell at them) but it's never going to be as good as 'Jersey Shore,' no matter how wild it purports to be,"" the website said. Despite the lackluster reviews, MTV recently renewed the show for a second season. On ""Buckwild,"" Gandee was shown as a charming Southern guy who early on competed with fellow castmate Tyler for the affections of Cara. Gandee noted that he lived in a community surrounded by relatives (""They call it a holler 'cause when you holler, everybody can hear ya"") and in a sneak peek of the show, his mother, Loretta, is shown expressing how much her son loved his job hauling trash. What happens when reality TV starts getting real . The nine cast members were shown partying, camping and ""mudding,"" where participants spin a vehicle in the mud until everyone inside is covered. Mud played a role in Gandee's death. His body was found, along with his uncle, David Dwight Gandee, 48, and Donald Robert Myers, 27, inside the family's Ford Bronco. Authorities said the vehicle was partially submerged in mud, including the muffler. On Tuesday, an MTV representative told CNN that production on the series had been suspended.

"(CNN) -- Perhaps somebody forgot to tell Rafael Benitez that the Oscars were last week. It doesn't matter. Benitez's extraordinary post-match performance Wednesday managed to combine the good, the bad and the ugly as the Chelsea manager launched a scathing attack on his employers and club's supporters before revealing he will quit at the end of this season. Here was Benitez, the victim. Here was the man in the middle of one of football's most high-pressure jobs being circled by an army of critics. Perhaps the adrenaline kicked in. Perhaps he had just had enough. It was fight or flight. Now he will await his fate, with the English club's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich -- who has employed nine managers in 10 years -- expected to take note. Foreign owners in UK football: The good the bad and the ugly . Since Benitez walked into Stamford Bridge last November, the former Liverpool boss has been a sitting duck. Protests, placards, songs about former managers from the stands -- even the most genial of men would have found their patience challenged. Replacing a Chelsea favorite and Champions League-winning manager in Roberto Di Matteo was never going to be easy, but for Benitez, it has been a losing battle. Out of the Champions League, beaten in the country's third cup competition by Swansea and 19 points off the league leader, Chelsea's season is in danger of collapsing. Contrast that with the fact that the Blues were third and four points behind then leader Manchester City when Di Matteo was given his marching orders. The Europa League is not seen as salvation -- not at least by those who sit in the stands with their thumbs pointed downwards in Benitez's direction. More woe for Chelsea boss Benitez . Then there's the speculation surrounding alleged disagreements with key players and the constant scrutiny of his side's failings, and it's easy to see why Benitez has found life in west London so difficult. Not even Wednesday's 2-0 win over second division Middlesbrough in the FA Cup -- which earned a quarterfinal clash with Manchester United -- could please the traveling Chelsea fans, who once again voiced their displeasure at the man they call the ""interim manager."" ""I have been in charge in football for 26 years,"" he told reporters. ""I have won the Champions League, won the FIFA Club World Cup, the FA Cup, the Italian Super Cup, the Spanish league twice, nine trophies, all the trophies you can win at club level. ""A group of fans, they are not doing any favors for the team when they are singing and wasting time preparing banners."" Benitez takes over Chelsea . While Benitez accepted the post until the end of the season, he hit out at the use of the term ""interim manager"" and the club's insistence on using the title. ""It's because someone made a mistake,"" he added. ""They put my title ""interim manager"" and I will leave at the end of the season, so they (the fans) don't need to waste time with me. ""They have to concentrate on supporting the team, that's what they have to do. In the end, they are not doing any favors to the club, to the rest of the fans and to the players. ""Every game they continue singing and they continue preparing banners, they are wasting time. What they have to do is support the team. ""If we cannot achieve what we expect to achieve, that is to be in the top four and be in the Champions League for next year, I will leave. They will stay in the Europa League. ""I am the manager. I will manage the players and I will make decisions. I will leave anyway -- I'm interim, as they say -- so they're wasting their time."" How much longer Benitez will have on screen in his current role is up for debate, but this is one performance his critics won't forget.","Rafael Benitez reveals he will leave Chelsea at the end of the season .

"New York (CNN) -- Seven decades after Nazi forces looted the National Museum in Warsaw during World War II, two paintings by treasured Polish artist Julian Falat were repatriated in a ceremony Thursday night, according to a statement from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The cultural artifacts were returned to Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski during the event at the Polish Consulate in New York City. Komorowski presented the Presidential Medal to ICE Special Agent Lennis Barrois and retired Special Agent Bonnie Goldblatt in honor of their investigative work leading to the paintings' repatriation. The president said, ""Behind every person who is here, we can find a very difficult history ... very difficult ties, tangled Polish-American ties. ""It is so good in difficult histories we were able to develop very good, strong relations between our nations. I want to thank you for your good actions, for everything you have done."" The oil-on-panels by Falat (1853-1929), both winter scenes, ""are two magnificent and very important pieces of art,"" said Bogdan Zdrojewski, minister of culture and national heritage, in an official statement. ""Off to the Hunt"" which features bundled hunters against a snowy woods backdrop, was originally displayed at the Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts in Warsaw November 1901 before it was sold to a private owner, given back to the society, and then transferred to the Polish National Museum in December 1939, the ICE news release stated. ""The Hunt,"" a wintry panorama with a sun-kissed glaze, was originally owned by Ludwik Norblin before it was endowed to the same fine arts society, and later moved to the national museum, the ICE news release stated. Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, and during the occupation of Warsaw the paintings were taken. The paintings were missing until 2006, when they were discovered by Polish officials at an auction in New York, according to the ICE press release. A complaint filed in federal court last December claimed they were taken from the national museum by Benne Von Arent, an SS lieutenant colonel, in 1944, according to press release from Manhattan U.S Attorney's office. ""No one can ever provide just compensation to the victims of the Nazis' atrocities, but it is very gratifying for our office to play a role in returning the art that they looted during World War II to its rightful owners,"" New York U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. Since 2007, the U.S. customs agency has repatriated more than 2,500 items to more than 22 countries.","NEW: Polish president praises ICE agents ""for everything you have done""

"(CNN) -- The head of Malaysia's police force has warned opposition supporters they face arrest if they attend a rally Wednesday evening organized by losing candidate Anwar Ibrahim. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Ismail Omar said the rally was illegal because organizers didn't apply for a permit. ""The organizer must comply with the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012. Marching without permit aimed at arousing anger is wrong according to the law,"" Ismail said, according to the country's state-run news agency Bernama. According to a statement from Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, the event is being held at a private location so is not bound by the law. The group said it had informed police but there was no need for a permit. Anwar has slammed the outcome of Sunday's general election, which extended the 56-year rule of the Barisan Nasional coalition, giving it a simple -- albeit reduced -- majority of 133 of 222 parliamentary seats. PR won 89. ""Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,"" Anwar said in a statement released Monday. He urged his supporters to wear black to the rally as a sign of mourning for Malaysia's democratic process. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were ""unsubstantiated"" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. ""Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',"" the spokesperson said in a statement. Prime Minister Najib Razak took his oath of office on Monday after 80% of the electorate turned out to cast their vote. During the weeks leading up to the election, reports emerged of escalating violence, including beatings and death threats. Human Rights Watch also claimed that cyber-attacks had been directed at a number of Malaysian news websites, restricting access to reporting on the election within the country. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. ""We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,"" it said in a statement.","Head of Malaysian police warns rally participants they risk arrest .

"(CNN) -- Eufemiano Fuentes, the man alleged to have masterminded one of the world's largest sports doping operations, was found guilty of endangering public health by a court in Madrid Tuesday. Fuentes was handed a $5,800 fine by Judge Julia Patricia Santamaria and banned from practicing sports medicine for four years on top of a one-year suspended jail term. Ignacio Labarta, a former official with the Kelme team, was given a four-month prison sentence, while Manolo Saiz, Vicente Belde and Fuentes' sister, Yolanda, were all found not guilty. But as Judge Santamaria announced that Fuentes, the man at the epicenter of the Operation Puerto doping scandal was guilty of supplying cyclists with illegal blood transfusions, she simultaneously extinguished the hopes of those seeking to discover the extent of his work. While doping was not illegal in Spain at the time of his arrest, Fuentes was charged with violating public health laws after police discovered around 200 frozen blood and plasma specimens in his offices in 2006. Fuentes emerged largely unscathed at the conclusion of the 10-week trial, but it is the Judge's proclamation that all evidence, documents and blood bags, be destroyed instead of being handed over to the Spanish Anti-Doping agency, which has stunned opponents of drug abuse. The news will come as a blow to protesters and the Spanish government, which is currently in the process of trying to push through new anti-doping legislation in a bid to bring the country level with international standards. Ana Munoz, the director general of the Spanish Anti-Doping Agency, had previously stated that her organization would push for the blood bags and specimens to be handed over at the conclusion of the trial. An appeal is expected to be launched on Monday following the decision by the court, while Fuentes will begin life with a four-year ban from practicing as a doctor as well as starting to pay off a $5,880 fine. Operation Puerto focused on doping within cycling and uncovered a whole host of cyclists which had been complicit in working with Fuentes. Although the case was limited to Fuentes' work within the realms of cycling, he confirmed during his trial that he also boasted clients in other sports such as tennis, athletics, football and boxing. During the trial, the court heard evidence from cyclists Jesus Manzano, U.S rider Tyler Hamilton and Germany's Jorg Jaksche, all of who gave details of their dealings with Fuentes. It was revealed that blood transfusions were often carried out by people without medical expertise in hotel rooms. According to evidence submitted to the court, banned substances such as EPO, HGH, testosterone, insulin and fertility drug Human Menopausal Gonadotropin were sometimes combined with the transfusions. In her summation of the case, the Judge said: ""The extractions and transfusions were not practiced in accordance with the sanitary norms but in a clandestine manner."" Dr. Yorck Olaf Schumacher, the World Anti-Doping Agency's own medical expert, gave a frightening insight into just how dangerous blood transfusions could have been during his testimony in Spain, according to Cycling News website which is covered the trial. ""Extracting half a liter or a liter of blood presents a greater risk than extracting the usual amounts. That's up to 20% of the body's total, whereas you would only extract 1% for a blood analysis,"" he said. ""A hotel does not fulfill the conditions required for a transfusion,"" he added, referring to the alleged unsanitary conditions in which the blood doping took place. ""A cool bag for picnics isn't the best thing for transporting blood."" Schumacher also claimed that those partaking in such practices may have exposed themselves to contracting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. Cycling's image has been shattered by doping with Lance Armstrong the biggest name to have admitted to taking drugs. Armstrong, who admitted his guilt last January following years of denials, revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO. EPO, a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cells, increases the amount of oxygen which can be transported to muscles to aid recovery and endurance. The U.S. cyclist was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles following his announcement after refusing to cooperate with the United States Anti-Doping Agency. He has since been banned for life after the organization accused him of running the ""most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program"" the sport had ever seen.","Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes handed one-year suspended prison sentence .

"(CNN) -- There was no space on the Inca Trail. ""Estás seguro?"" I pleaded with dormant Spanish, or ""Are you sure?"" in English. I was sitting face to face with the ninth Peruvian salesman that day to offer the same answer. He was positive. No space on the Inca Trail, entering Machu Picchu via the Sun Gate, but his alternative trek was the real deal, he said. Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911 by Yale University professor Hiram Bingham. I said, ""Gracias,"" grabbed my bag and went trudging out the door and back into the rain. At this point, I could not remember the smile I wore just hours before as I boarded my New Year's Eve flight and watched Atlanta grow smaller below me -- four days trekking in the Andes, a new adventure! That smile had vanished, the woman who grinned it, gone. In its place, a miserable downtrodden troll with fiercely angled brows, standing in the middle of the Plaza de Armas in Cusco, Peru -- with no Inca Trail booked. As a wind-follower, I always try to make travel arrangements as I go. I lay out rough plans, cities and dates, and see what adventures may come. The Inca Trail, however, does not afford such luxury. Over the years, the Inca Trail has become more a sales feature for adventure companies than a tranquil or mystical journey. The frat party of historic treks, it often comes fully equipped with booze, crowds and disgusting bathrooms. Similarly, the Inca Trail also has a maximum capacity before doors to the public close. Years of feet trampling Inca steps led the government to institute a 500 person per day limit in 2002 on the historic trail -- including trekkers, guides and porters -- to prevent over-saturation of the trail and to maintain the sanctity of the sites. As I entered company after company, each promising slight variations of alternate treks for drastically different prices, I nearly hung up my poncho and headed home. That is, until I finally swallowed my wind-follower pride, opened a guidebook and tracked down some of the recommended operators. This proved a worthwhile endeavor, as Cusco is a maze of adventure agencies among a few trek operators. Agencies sell customers to operators, collecting profits and, oftentimes, unsatisfied travelers. Once I learned I couldn't have the journey, I grew even more set on keeping the destination. Determined to stay Machu Picchu-bound and only able to squeeze in a short trek by this point, I opted for an alternate-Inca hybrid trek. The two-day Inca joins the traditional Inca Trail a short distance from the Sun Gate, the path the Incas took into Machu Picchu. Though it carries the Inca name - -and the 500-person regulation -- it arrives at the Sun Gate in the evening, sacrificing the most sought after sunrise view. It also does not include camping or any of that delicious, trek-cooked food. My two-person group ate bag lunches, spent the one night in Aguas Calientes, the base city to Machu Picchu, and looked on enviously at Inca Trail trekkers sharing beer, some grilled alpaca and a game of cards at the final rest stop where the trails unite. If I had looked beyond my Inca-only vision, I would have discovered that the Inca Trail is just the tip of the Peru trekking iceberg -- literally iceberg if you go during low season. Several alternate treks land right in Aguas Calientes that can be booked mere days in advance. Though these treks do not enter Machu Picchu through the Sun Gate, many locals and travelers prefer alternate routes through quiet villages and isolated peaks, as they offer an often less expensive, more serene, untouched vision of Peru.  See a map of the area around Machu Picchu » . Salkantay is the most frequented Inca Trail alternative. This trek is usually recommended for people who can't get on the Inca Trail, but still want a similar experience. Traditionally five days/four nights, it leads trekkers up Salkantay Mountain (one of the highest peaks in the Andes of Peru at over 20,000 feet) and passes by some Quechuan communities and lesser-known Inca ruins, traversing everything from snow-capped mountains to hot springs. However, as it has become increasingly known as the alternate trek to the Inca Trail, the serene views of the trek often compete with crowded trails and camping sites. While Salkantay offers a glimpse at Quechuan communities, the Lares trek offers a full panorama of the Quechuan lifestyle. Against a picturesque landscape, this four-day/three-night trek is famous for the textile villages it enters along the way. It ascends 13,000 feet, crosses two peaks, hot springs and lakes, and it offers a spectrum of regional animals to view, including llamas, vicuñas, alpacas and chinchillas. However, since the trek gained popularity five years ago, ""It has become a little more touristy. It has lost a little bit of its initial essence and purity,"" said Silvia Rico, general manager of Enigma Adventure Tour Operator. For those seeking even more of an adventure, Choquequirao is the ideal trek. This nine-day/eight-night trek passes the two largest Inca sites in the Cusco region: Machu Picchu and Choquequirao. The latter is a huge archaeological complex that is only about 30 percent excavated and thus has endured minimal tourist foot traffic. Surrounded by the Salkantay mountain, the trek dives into the Apurimac River canyon and passes waterfalls, villages, Inca ruins and frequently condors. It does have one major drawback: before continuing on to Machu Picchu, trekkers must backtrack the two days' journey it takes to arrive at Choquequirao, resulting in some repeated views. For solitude and serenity searchers, the Vilcabamba trek is ideal. ""Total isolation. There's nothing like doing a trek when there's no other people,"" says Michelle Graham of Llama Path Tours, as she describes why Vilcabamba is her favorite of the alternate treks. This trek enters the last refuge of the Incas, Vilcabamba, and like Salkantay, offers spectacular diverse views ranging from tropical jungles to snowy peaks. Unlike Salkantay, however, this trek combines Inca history with little interference from tourist passersby. Families, older people, and travelers who simply don't have the time can arrive in Aguas Calientes by train and continue up to Machu Picchu either by bus or by ascending the five-mile trail. Some companies offer jungle tours, in which cycling is combined with trekking. However, as with all treks, be aware of agencies that set up tourist traps with dilapidated bikes that turn into broken bikes and extra charges on the bill. Regardless of the trek you choose, the dry season -- from April through October -- is the ideal time to make the journey. Many tour companies don't operate these treks during rainy summer months. December through February are the worst (Excellent choice on my part). Though I never intended to fly to Peru for a two-day trek, once I wiped away the fog on my optimism lenses, I realized that many of the alternate treks to Machu Picchu are just as worthy of fame as the legendary Inca Trail. So I packed my backpack, laced my boots and wrapped myself in layers of water-resistant clothing. I trekked into the landscape where history meets present day. When I arrived at the hidden Inca city in all its breathtaking beauty, everything else was just icing on the llama.","There's a 500 person per day limit on the historic Inca Trail .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Armed men in trucks with anti-aircraft guns mounted on them occupied the Libyan Justice Ministry in Tripoli on Tuesday, forcing ministry staff to leave, Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani said. The militants consisted of 20 to 30 armed men in military fatigues, according to al-Marghani, who said he tried to talk to the men before fleeing. This comes as the nation's Foreign Ministry remains under siege for a third straight day. The armed protesters have said their main goal was to push the General National Congress to pass a proposed law that would ban Gadhafi-era officials from holding government posts. The political isolation law proposal has been a matter of contention among lawmakers for several months because it could push current senior officials out of office for serving under the former regime. Watchdog groups have been calling on Libyan authorities to rein in armed groups that they say continue to threaten the country's future. ""Unlawful armed groups that show up with heavy weapons and block access to government institutions, demanding grievance, crosses the line of peaceful protest; it is intimidating and threatening and there should be accountability for these actions"" Hanan Salah, the Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN on Sunday. In recent months, Libyans have resorted to armed protests in the capital. In some cases, protesters surrounded government offices, and sessions of the country's legislature have been interrupted by armed groups that stormed its meetings. Last month, armed protesters besieged the General National Congress for several hours in an attempt to force its members to pass the political isolation law. Gunmen later opened fire on the vehicle of the parliament speaker, who escaped unharmed. Eighteen months after the fall of the regime, Libya remains awash in weapons and militias that the government has been struggling to control to secure the country.

"London (CNN) -- To an outsider, Thursday's contest to elect the next mayor of London would appear to be a fight between two larger-than-life characters -- known best by their first names -- for control of the city's famous red buses. Among a wide field of candidates, only these two men have any realistic chance of taking a starring role at this summer's Olympic Games in London: Conservative Party incumbent Mayor Boris Johnson, 47, and his 66-year-old nemesis, Labour left-winger and former Mayor Ken Livingstone. Both men have devoted their energies to transport -- and attacking each other viciously on the issue, as well as on their complex personal tax arrangements. With his distinctive nasal south London accent, Livingstone rose to fame in the early 1980s as leader of the Greater London Council. Livingstone -- populist, socialist, environmentalist -- was one of the few who stood up to Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative prime minister at the time, earning him the moniker ""Red Ken."" Two decades later, Labour PM Tony Blair recreated the long-dormant job of London mayor, but if he hoped a similar-minded centrist would win, the move backfired. Livingstone was a feisty Labour member of Parliament, but when his party picked a blander, less troublesome candidate for mayor, he stood as an independent and cruised to victory. In revenge, he was expelled from Labour, though he was later brought back into the fold. One of his first, and most unpopular, acts was to scrap the much-loved but decrepit fleet of Routemaster double-decker buses, dating from the 1950s. He replaced them with the ""bendy bus,"" snake-like Mercedes vehicles that terrified road-users in the narrow streets. He also upgraded Underground trains and brought in a controversial congestion tax on motorists entering central London. Livingstone served two terms before he was beaten in 2008 by Johnson, another maverick politician on the right of the political spectrum. The scruffy-haired Old Etonian ex-journalist, who appears to have emerged straight from a PG Wodehouse novel, inspired a cult following with spirited performances on a satirical BBC TV show that highlighted his blustering, easygoing charm. Among Johnson's pledges was to scrap the accordion-like bendy buses and replace them with a British-built Routemaster, which appeared on the streets this year. The buses are stylish -- echoing the hop-on, hop-off design of the tourists' favorites -- but expensive: The first eight buses cost more than $18 million in total, although future buses will be $500,000 each. True to the bitter rivalry between the men, Livingstone has pledged to cancel orders for more Routemasters in favor of hybrid vehicles if Londoners vote him back into power, although he will allow the current eight buses to remain in service. ""I'm quite happy to have them running around London,"" Livingstone told The Guardian newspaper last month. ""We'll put a thing on the side saying: 'The most expensive bus, thanks to Boris.'"" In response, a spokesman for Johnson said: ""Ken Livingstone said that only some ghastly dehumanized moron would want to get rid of the Routemaster, then he scrapped it. ""Now he wants to cancel an order for one of the greenest buses, which costs, and he knows costs, no more than a hybrid bus. Such a decision would put hundreds of British jobs at risk and would once again deprive Londoners of the much-loved hop-on, hop-off service. Mr. Livingstone simply can't be trusted."" There's little love lost between the two candidates: At one point during the campaign, as both rivals accused each other of avoiding paying the full rate of income tax, Johnson -- who was born in New York to British parents -- accused Livingstone of being a ""f***ing liar."" And while the rising cost of public transport is one of the key issues in the election, many analysts say the difference between the two men themselves will be the deciding factor for most of the city's 5 million registered voters. ""There's a great deal riding on this election, but it's really all about personalities,"" said Joe Murphy, political editor of the capital's free daily newspaper, The Evening Standard, which has endorsed Johnson. ""These are the two best-known politicians in the country outside of the Cabinet."" And while the job of mayor is largely ceremonial, whoever holds it does have control of a Â£14 billion ($23 billion) budget to run the city's transport system and emergency services as well as promote business. One of Johnson's most eye-catching initiatives has been his fleet of bicycles -- known inevitably as ""Boris Bikes"" -- that can be hired from streets across the city for short periods. Johnson is an avid cyclist, but Livingstone has said the current scheme is elitist and plans to extend it south of the River Thames. This summer's Olympics will be another reason to win the election. Livingstone was instrumental in helping win the Games in 2005, and both candidates have claimed credit for the regeneration of east London near the Olympic site. At Beijing in 2008, a famously disheveled-looking Johnson waved the Olympic flag. ""When the job was created by Tony Blair in 2000, he was not looking to create a hugely powerful mayor,"" Murphy said. ""Compared with the New York mayor, the role in London is more of a bully pulpit."" Livingstone earned praise for his condemnation of the 2005 terrorist bombings on London's transport system. He issued a defiant message to the terrorists, and a rallying cry to Londoners in the wake of the attacks, which killed 52 people. ""Whatever you do, however many you kill, you will fail,"" Livingstone said. Three years later, though, he was voted out in favor of Johnson. So what does the election mean this time around, especially for Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative-led coalition government, currently lagging behind Labour in the polls? ""All the signs point to Boris winning by a small margin of between 2% and 8%,"" said Murphy. ""If he wins, Cameron will get a huge boost, and it may help to keep his party intact."" Conversely, a defeat for Livingstone will be a devastating loss for the young Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who is seen as struggling to establish himself in voters' eyes. ""If he loses London it will look as though Miliband's lost the whole country, even though it's not really about him. Everyone sees a bloody nose."" If Johnson wins, most analysts say his victory will be in spite of his party, not because of it. ""He lifts himself above politics,"" Murphy said. ""'Brand Boris' is simply not seen as a Conservative. The same has been said for Ken, but the price of celebrity is that if it fades, a politician's appeal fades, too."" Johnson has his critics, though, as an editorial in the left-leaning Guardian made clear: ""His overall substantive record is ... poor. Many of the big things that have happened on his watch -- Crossrail [a plan for a railway line across the city], the Olympics, even the eye-catching bikes -- were Labour initiatives. Since hard times came to London -- partly also Labour's doing -- Mr. Johnson has rarely attempted anything bold. He has been found wanting by recession. His environmental record is negligible. His police and crime policies have been destructive. ""In the end, though, this is a contest between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Livingstone. There is no ducking it. And that means voting for Mr. Livingstone as London's next mayor."" Whoever wins will play a vital role during the Olympics in terms of security, keeping transport running and ensuring athletes arrive on time. Johnson's plan to close sections of some roads to general traffic so VIPs and competitors are not delayed -- mockingly called ""Zil lanes"" after their use in Soviet Russia -- is proving controversial. Livingstone is among those who have criticized the plan. But as long as the capital's red buses -- however they look -- run on time, most Londoners will likely be happy.","About 6 million Londoners are voting to elect new mayor .

"(CNN) -- With its post-apocalyptic setting, Giancarlo Esposito in the role of endearing villain, and J.J. Abrams as an executive producer, creator Eric Kripke's ""Revolution"" is a surefire hit -- on paper. In fact, NBC ordered a full season of ""Revolution,"" which also stars Billy Burke, after airing just three episodes, which is the same amount of time it took the network to axe ""The Playboy Club"" last year. Yet, it seems viewers become more disillusioned with the freshman drama each week. Still, with its mid-season finale airing tonight, ""Revolution"" has garnered competitive ratings, and helped NBC win November sweeps for the first time in nine years. On Tuesday, CNN.com commenter Bret wrote, ""I've watched every episode, but I'm ready to give up"" on the show, which takes place 15 years after a global blackout causes the government to collapse and prompts militias to take over. ""The story moves at a snail's pace,"" Bret continued. ""Even if we buy the science behind the show's premise, the individual episodes are so infuriating with their slow pace and stupid and unbelievable character interaction that I'm not watching anymore."" As with many new shows, ratings for ""Revolution"" have declined since its September 17 premiere drew 11.7 million viewers and a 4.1 rating among adults 18 to 49. Of late, ratings leveled off at about 7 million viewers and a 2.6 rating. Despite NBC's apparent confidence, ""Revolution"" will soon embark on a three-month hiatus, to return on March 25, so it can continue benefiting from its current lead-in show, ""The Voice."" As Yahoo! TV's Dave Nemetz notes, a long hiatus ""could be deadly. There are a ton of new shows coming out in January that could step in and take that audience away."" But it's likely that if ""Revolution"" doesn't succeed during the second half of its first season, it won't be because of winter break. ""A lot of people wanted to see how the world reacted when the power went out,"" Nemetz said. ""They were disappointed that, basically, the story jumped forward and they didn't get to see the aftermath."" Sure the show revisits these moments in flashbacks, but viewers ""don't want to derail the storyline in the current time to keep going back,"" Nemetz said. ""People have been burned with shows like 'Lost' and 'Heroes.' They get invested in them, and seasons later they still don't have answers to the questions they tuned in for, so they get a little disillusioned and give up. That might be happening earlier than usual (with 'Revolution')."" As CNN.com commenter Martyr2 wrote on Wednesday, ""I can't believe 'Revolution' continues to be a success. I was really interested in it at first but I think it has really lost steam."" Apart from pace, it's the shows characters that seem to anger viewers. Though fans appear to enjoy Burke as protagonist Miles Matheson and Esposito (""Breaking Bad"") as Major Tom Neville of the Monroe Militia, Tracy Spiridakos in the driver's seat as Charlie Matheson hasn't been as well received. In October, The Huffington Post's Maureen Ryan wrote, ""If Spiridakos has any strengths as an actress (and that's not at all apparent), the show's writers haven't learned to write to them, and every week, despite 'Revolution's' general efficiency and the skills of its other cast members, there's a clunky Charlie moment that makes me want to delete the show's Season Pass from my DVR."" CNN.com commenter Bret agrees: ""Charlie is such an annoying, whiny, stupid character. It's not all the fault of the actor. The writers give her such dumb dialogue. Danny (Graham Rogers) is a much more interesting character, but the entire season is spent trying to rescue him (from the militia)."" While other supporting characters like Zak Orth's Aaron Pittman and Elizabeth Mitchell as Rachel Matheson have garnered more positive feedback, TVLine.com editor-at-large Matt Webb Mitovich reminded viewers not to get too attached in an October recap: ""NBC's 'Revolution,' in its fourth outing, busted out one of the oldest tricks in the book: inviting us to care, more than we had done to date, about a major-ish character, before killing that person off."" ""I believe that people love exploring 'What if?' scenarios, and the one at the heart of 'Revolution' is compelling, especially in an era where so many of us are 'wired in' and immersed in a digital age,"" Webb Mitovich told CNN via e-mail. ""If anything (detracts) from the 'Revolution' experience -- and mind you, this is a show whose producers vetted with a physicist the very foundation of the global blackout -- it is other 'leaps' and lapses in continuity,"" he continued, ""such as the seemingly fresh-from-Urban Outfitters wardrobe and a surprising dearth of bicycles.""","""Revolution"" has helped NBC win November sweeps for the first time in nine years .

"Washington (CNN) -- Obama administration handling of the terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, sparked outrage from certain Republicans, but none of that was evdident at the confirmation hearing of his successor. Only three members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee attended the hearing on Tuesday for Ambassador Deborah Jones, President Barack Obama's nominee to take over in Tripoli. She mentioned the armed assault last September 11 in her opening statement and in answering questions. Jones, a career diplomat, said stopping the flow of weapons through Libya's porous border will ""enable the defeat of volatile and deadly rogue militias, and prevent a repeat of the tragedy in Benghazi."" She said that she ""will work closely with the Libyan government to see that justice realized"" in the Benghazi attacks. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash afterward, Jones said she was pleased with the substance of the meeting and that her focus was on looking forward in Libya, not looking back. ""I was pleased that there was focus on the substance of Libya we got a lot of work to do there,"" Jones said. ""There are a lot of serious issues there that require having an ambassador on the ground. And I think that this town ... the politics is something completely different. I'm really focused not on the forensics but on the future."" Tuesday's muted atmosphere was a prelude to Wednesday's House Oversight Committee hearing on the Benghazi attack. Panel Chairman Darrell Issa has released testimony from three whistle blowers who plan to discuss what they feel were security failures at the compound during the attack. The testimony of Greg Hicks, a former top U.S. diplomat in Libya, has been the focus of Issa's hearing. Hicks is expected to discuss how the American military could have done more to protect those in Benghazi. Democrats on the House committee charge the hearing is a charade. The committee's senior Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, said members of Congress have an obligation to actually investigate claims before coming to conclusions and making public accusations. ""Unfortunately, House Republicans have taken the opposite approach,"" he said. Despite being nine months removed from the terrorist attack, the tragedy has maintained a steady drumbeat on Capitol Hill, particularly with Republicans, who claim to not yet know the full story of what transpired. But only three of the 18 members of the Foreign Relations Committee attended Tuesday's hearing for Jones -- Sens Bob Corker and fellow Republican John McCain and Democrat Bob Menendez. Senators paid tribute to those lost in Benghazi. ""We can never forget Ambassador Chris Stevens and the three other American public servants, Tyrone Woods, Sean Smith, and Glen Doherty, who tragically lost their lives on the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September,"" Menendez said. Jones said she would take responsibility for personnel security if confirmed as ambassador. ""On security -- and again this is something that is, well, as we know it is deadly serious for us,"" she said. ""It is the role of the ambassador -- the ambassador is the principal security officer at post. And it is the ambassador who has to decide whether to allow people to travel here or there, whether to ask for additional assets, whether to insist on additional assets."" She added that if you don't get the answers you need then ""pick up the phone and you speak to the people"" responsible for that information. ""That is what I intend to do. That is what I have always done,"" she said. Jones is a respected career diplomat who has held consulate and embassy posts in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iraq, Syria and Argentina. Most recently, she served as U.S. ambassador to Kuwait from 2008 to 2011. There has been a great deal of tension between Democrats and Republicans on Benghazi, partly stemming from televised comments after the attack by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who said it was a spontaneous act that grew out of a demonstration over an anti-Islam film made in the United States. Later, the administration called the Benghazi matter a terror attack. Rice and other officials said that her comments explaining the incident publicly relied on official talking points. Still, the initial statements and the resulting controversy cost her a likely nomination to succeed Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Certain GOP members also sharply questioned Clinton over the administration's explanation of events and the state of security at the compound prior to the attack. Clinton said she took responsibility for the deaths, stating that as secretary of state, she was ""in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world."" In January 2013, Clinton testified for more than five hours before the House and Senate Foreign Relations committees. In her testimony, she acknowledged a ""systematic breakdown"" on Benghazi and said her department was taking additional steps to increase U.S. security at diplomatic posts. Critics have questioned the validity of continued congressional scrutiny, especially Democrats who say Republicans are only interested in discrediting the administration and hurting Clinton's chances of running for president in 2016.","Few members of a Senate committee question Libya ambassador nominee .

"(CNN) -- In a world of mass-marketed gadgets designed to be trashed and replaced after a few years, is there room for the Egg-Bot, a machine that lets you design and draw images on ... you guessed it ... eggs? Or how about the DODOcase, a hand-crafted cover for the iPad and other tablets that can be personalized to look like your favorite book? Dominic Muren thinks so. That's why he started The Humblefactory. Located in Seattle, Washington, Humblefactory aims to develop and design tools that help ""makers"" around the world build items that more mainstream manufacturers can't ... or won't. From designing actual tools to researching the best ways to create small manufacturing businesses in urban areas, The Humblefactory is designed to spur a movement that, in itself, was spurred by modern business practices. Muren says that, even with history's largest range of mass-produced products available on the market, they're just that -- mass produced. Consumers, he says, actually have a harder time finding products that suit their personal wants and needs. Enter the ""makers."" Inspired in part by do-it-yourself Bible ""Make"" magazine and the book, ""Makers,"" that spun off from it, ""makers,"" Muren says, are an emerging subculture of designers and engineers inspired to create with individual interests, not mass-market appeal, in mind. ""In the U.S. and Europe, people are starting to realize that there's this opportunity to make again,"" Muren said. ""I think in the rest of the world, they're kind of like 'Well, isn't it funny you all call this 'making.' We've been doing this forever. That's one of the things that's exciting to me is the meeting of those two places. "" At last Fall's PopTech conference in Camden, Maine, he talked up some of the products that have been created with the help of Humblefactory, and other creations from the ""maker movement"" including the aforementioned Egg-Bot. ""They sell, actually, quite a lot of them,"" he said. ""Imagine trying to buy one of these at Best Buy. Probably not going to happen."" Or the DODOcase, which he says single-handedly saved a 50-year-old book-binding company in San Francisco and allowed them to add 10 new jobs during the height of the recession. The maker movement he aims to support, Muren says, isn't just about making new products available. In many cases, he says, it's the creator, not the consumer, who gets the most satisfaction. ""I think that's the fundamental thing behind the wonder in the maker movement,"" he said. ""This idea that, 'Wow ... the difference between nothing and something was me.'

"(CNN) -- it is common knowledge that Gareth Bale is a gifted footballer. But just how good is he? ""He will eventually work himself into the top one or two players in the world, he's that good,"" Spurs goalkeeper Brad Friedel told CNN. ""The future is in his hands."" On Sunday, Bale swept the boards at an annual award ceremony held by English Professional Footballers' Association. The Tottenham Hotspur star was voted as both the Player of the Year and the Young Player of the Year honors by his fellow professionals, becoming only the third man to do so. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo won both awards in 2007 while playing for Manchester United and Bale is now being compared to the Portuguese attacker and Barcelona's four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi. ""He's a great professional, he works at his game every day.,"" added Friedel, speaking ahead of the award ceremony. ""On top of that he's a very humble and good kid. He's a great servant to the game."" According to teammate Mousa Dembele, what makes Bale so talented is his ability to make match-winning contributions. ""He's an unbelievable player,"" said Dembele of the Welsh winger. ""Everybody can see he's top class, and he can make the difference for us every game."" Dembele, who arrived at Tottenham following a high-profile move from Fulham at the start of the season, believes Bale is one of the best players on the planet. And the Belgium international, who has impressed during his debut campaign at White Hart Lane, believes Bale is key to his club's chances of challenging the elite of European football. ""Everybody has a different style, but for me personally he's one of the best in the world,"" continued Dembele. ""If you know you have someone in your team who can do something and who can win games for us ... It's unbelievable."" The Welsh winger's hard work has paid dividends for Spurs this season. Andre Villas-Boas' team sit fifth in the English Premier League table, with Bale's 19 goals in the competition putting Tottenham firmly in the hunt for a top four finish and qualification for the lucrative European Champions League. Spurs have four matches left to play and sit two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who have just three games remaining. Tottenham will qualify for Europe's premier club competition if they win their remaining fixtures. While his teammates flocked to praise Bale, the former Southampton player was quick to acknowledge the contribution of his colleagues. ""It's a massive honor,"" the 23-year-old, who also picked up the Player of the Year award in 2011, told Spurs' official website. ""To be voted by your peers is one of the biggest things in the game. It's great to win it and I am delighted. ""When you look at the list there are some massive names on it but I couldn't have done it without the team. They have been fantastic this year and so has the manager. ""I couldn't have won it without them so I would like to give them all a big thank-you as well. ""The other nominees have been unbelievable, they have been outstanding for their clubs and it's a massive moment to win, especially as it's both awards and it's something that I'm extremely proud of."" Champions League qualification could be key to Spurs' hopes of keeping hold of Bale. One way or another, he looks destined to join Messi and Ronaldo at football's top table sooner rather than later.","Gareth Bale wins the PFA Player of the Year & Young Player of the Year .

"(CNN) -- The Governator is back! Retired from politics, Arnold Schwarzenegger is taking a leaf out of his ""Expendables"" buddy Sylvester Stallone's book and setting out to prove that he can still kick butt at 65. ""The Last Stand"" represents his first starring role in eight years, and it seems there's plenty more gas in his tank. The timing for a primed, pumped, itchy-trigger-finger shoot-em-up leaves something to be desired, no doubt, but with Nicolas Cage unaccountably AWOL this January, Arnie has the knucklehead R-rated action field pretty much to himself. What's more, ""The Last Stand"" brings it. If you park your brain outside, and double-park any misgivings about vicarious gun mayhem right alongside, it's passable fun. It's a modern-day Western -- a souped-up and dumbed-down ""Rio Bravo,"" if you will -- with Schwarzenegger making like John Wayne as border town Sheriff Ray Owens, the last man standing between a runaway bad guy (Mexican drug baron Eduardo Noreiga) and his freedom. Charting a spectacularly erratic 24-hour course, the movie juggles self-consciously hokey small-town comedy with slick (or at least semi-slick) high-tech chase scenes as the road-racing desperado leads Forest Whitaker and the feds on a merry chase through the Southwest in his prototype Corvette 01. The auto action seems a transparent pitch to sell high-end sports cars and inject a little momentum in a movie that's equally content to dawdle over its morning coffee, shooting the breeze with amusing (or at least semi-amusing) supporting players like Ray's deputies, ornery Mike (Luis Guzman in the Walter Brennan role), bumbling Jerry (Zach Gilford), and sexy Sarah (Jaimie Alexander). Johnny Knoxville gets unaccountably prominent billing for little more than an extended cameo as a guy named Dinkum, a screwy gun nut with a penchant for cavalier headgear. He's excruciating, but almost puppy-like he's so eager to please. The same might go for director Kim Jee-woon, a talented Korean known for macabre ghost stories like ""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" whacky adventures (""The Good, the Bad, the Weird""), and grisly cop thrillers (""I Saw the Devil""). His first U.S. effort is full of bold, broad comic book strokes -- some of them pleasingly original, like a car chase through a cornfield, the husks of corn thudding against the windscreens like oversized bugs. Listen to how he picks out the sound of a helmet rolling across the pavement. That's a filmmaker alert to his environment and the tools at this command. But there's just as much that's ham-fisted or tin-eared. At best these are stereotypes we might recognize from other B flicks. There's never a whiff of authenticity, except maybe when Harry Dean Stanton appears for a cruelly brief bit part as a cranky local farmer. The uninspired score by Kim's countryman Mowg doesn't lift the so-so climactic shoot-out any, but the movie's tongue in cheek humor will buy off most of the target audience. And Arnie? He's indestructible.","Movie is Schwarzenegger's first starring role in eight years .

"(CNN) -- As the Curiosity rover begins its exciting trek across the surface of Mars and up the dramatic peak of Mt. Sharp it is important to realize that the plans for this great success were incubated and acted upon more than 10 years ago. Exploration like this is not for the faint of heart -- it takes time and persistence. So what's next? What is in the funded pipeline now that will be revolutionizing our understanding of life in the solar system 10 or even 20 years from now? The short answer is -- nothing. Curiosity is it. After Curiosity there is, at present, no other mission in production that will explore potentially habitable worlds beyond Earth. But where do we want to go? Where do we hope we'll be? Along with continuing our exploration of Mars there are several moons of Jupiter and Saturn that we think might be good places for life. These moons -- worlds with names like Europa, Enceladus, and Titan -- are covered with solid water ice, beneath which we have very good reason to believe that vast liquid water oceans exist. And when I say liquid water I mean good old-fashioned H2O; if you drank this stuff it would probably taste similar to a big gulp of salty ocean water from our ocean here on Earth. These are oceans that exist today and have likely been in existence for much of the history of the solar system. Why is this important? Well, if we've learned anything about life on Earth it's that where you find liquid water you generally find life. These moons have lots and lots of water and they could be great homes for alien ecosystems (note that when I say ""alien ecosystems"" I'm referring primarily to microbes and simple life forms. As much as I'd love to discover creatures like those seen in the movie The Abyss, I'll be happy just to find a considerable speck of a microbe!) One moon in particular -- Jupiter's moon Europa -- may have the perfect combination of liquid water and the chemistry needed for life. Europa is about the size of our Moon and beneath its icy shell Europa harbors a global liquid water ocean of roughly 100 km in depth (by comparison, Earth's ocean has an average depth of 4 km and a maximum depth of 11 km). The ocean of Europa contains about 2-3 times the volume of all the liquid water on Earth. It's an ocean that's there today and has likely been in existence for much of the 4.6 billion years of our Solar System's history. As such, Europa provides an incredibly compelling place to go to search for a second, independent origin of life and it's a place where we might find lifeforms that are alive now, today. This is important for two reasons. First, we need to know if the origin of life is easy or hard. Does life arise wherever the conditions are right or is it a rare occurrence in our Universe? Second, all life on Earth -- from microbes to man -- runs on the same fundamental biochemistry of DNA, RNA, and proteins. See also: The search for dark matter . We want to probe the question of whether or not there exists another way to get the ""business"" of life done. Is there another game in town beyond the biochemistry we see here on Earth? By going to Europa we can address both of these fundamental questions. Mars may have once been habitable but on Mars we are looking for signs of life trapped in the rocks (essentially molecular fossils of microbes). In addition, Mars and the Earth are so close that asteroid impacts in the past might have seeded either world with life from the other. Europa is likely too far away for this kind of interplanetary ""seeding."" More: What we've done on Mars, and what's next . Why do we even think that life could exist on Europa? Here's where the exploration of our own ocean serves as an important guide. For much of human history we have focused on discovering new lands and exploring continents. For the most part, we've only skimmed across the top of the ocean. But in the spring of 1977 explorers cruising the dark depths of our ocean discovered that active geological regions on the ocean's floor -- known as hydrothermal vents -- were home to vibrant ecosystems of organisms large and small. These are ecosystems that thrive despite the tremendous pressure, and despite the lack of energy directly from the Sun. The base of the foodchain down there is not photosynthesis but rather chemosynthesis, since the microbes are deriving energy from the chemistry of the hydrothermal vents fluid. The discovery of ecosystems in the deepest parts of our ocean is continuing to change our understanding of habitable environments here on Earth, and also of potentially habitable environments beyond Earth. On Europa we expect that the temperature, pressure, and chemistry of the seafloor might not be that different from our own ocean's seafloor. In the decades to come our pipeline of exploration must include rigorous exploration of our own ocean so as to better understand the fundamental geological and biological cycles here on Earth. This research has the added benefit of feeding forward into our efforts to explore potentially habitable oceans in the far reaches of our solar system. But some may ask: Why? Why do these things? Granted, this is not going to change the way you make your coffee in the morning. Sure, there are spinoff technologies and many jobs created but that is not at the heart of why we do these things. The drumbeat of human civilization is the pursuit of new knowledge. We explore, we discover, and we advance. From fundamental research on cancer to revolutionizing our understanding of the universe, it is not an either/or: we must do it all. Anything less is a sign that our priorities as a race have been hijacked by agendas beneath our potential. As has become a refrain in my community, the drumbeat continues and we echo the wise words of Teddy Roosevelt: Dare mighty things. Read more about space and science on CNN's Light Years blog .

"Rockcastle County, Kentucky (CNN) -- This area of eastern Kentucky is known for lush, green hillsides and white picket fences. It is a place where bluegrass music may be heard trailing off when a car passes by, where ""downtown"" is a two-block stretch of quaint shops. Life here may seem simple, but a darkness has been quietly nestling itself into the community. ""Rockcastle County is averaging one drug-related death per week,"" said Nancy Hale, an anti-drug activist and educator. ""When your county is a little over 16,000 people and you're losing a person a week ... you're losing a whole generation."" The generation being lost, Hale said, is parents. An inordinate number of children in Rockcastle County -- and in neighboring areas in eastern Kentucky -- are living without them. According to 2010 census data, more than 86,000 children in Kentucky are being raised by someone who is not their biological parent -- mostly grandparents -- and many here blame those fractured families on prescription drugs. ""I know a little girl who found her father dead of a drug overdose, found her uncle dead of a drug overdose, and now she's living with her aunt,"" said Karen Kelly, executive director of Operation UNITE, a community coalition devoted to preventing overdose deaths in Kentucky. ""The kids really are the ones paying the biggest price."" 'You're always worried' ""It's a terrible thing,"" said Sean Watkins, 17, a junior at Rockcastle County High. ""Especially in our community, it's really bad."" When he was 10, Watkins and his family were expecting his mother for dinner, but she never showed up. He and a family friend went looking for her at her home. They walked into her bedroom and saw her face down, motionless. The friend quickly whisked Watkins out of the room. ""I don't know what was going on, but I knew something was wrong,"" said Watkins. His mother was dead after overdosing on Oxycontin. At the time, Watkins says that he and his mother had been estranged for years because of her prescription-drug addiction. His father had not been in his life since shortly after his birth. ""Growing up without parents, without a normal mom and dad, you feel different,"" said Watkins. ""You go to your friend's house and they have a happy family ... you're jealous. You want that."" Shortly after his mother's death, Watkins says his grandmother also became addicted to prescription drugs, and eventually vanished. Now he lives with his grandfather. ""I'm grateful that I have my grandfather who stepped in and takes care of me now,"" said Watkins. Still, he calls growing up without parents ""horrible."" Gupta: Let's end the prescription drug death epidemic . It sometimes feels is as if every student at his school has been touched by the epidemic, he said. ""The hardest part of growing up without a dad would be not having that model family that you always see,"" said Avery Bradshaw, 16, also a student at Rockcastle County High School. Bradshaw's father overdosed on Oxycontin when he was 7. His mother, he said, is in and out of his life, so he is being raised by his great-grandparents. Avery knows many children at school who are not so lucky. After their parents overdose or abscond because of prescription drugs, the kids go from couch to couch and from home to home -- living in a constant state of transience. For those children whose parents have not overdosed but are deep in their addiction, there is a sense of perpetual wariness about what they might find when they get home from school. ""You're always worried ... if your parents are even going to be there, you know, what's going on in your house?"" said Bradshaw. ""A lot of kids have to go through that every day and it definitely wears them down, you know."" Guardians' Day . The prescription drug overdose epidemic just recently began appearing on the national radar, so figures concerning the number of children orphaned after a parent overdoses are difficult to assess. What is known is the high number of overdoses, broadly: In the United States, someone dies of a prescription drug-related overdose about every 19 minutes. The epidemic affects every state in the nation, and has hit hardest in places like Washington, Utah, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada and New Mexico. Kentucky -- and the Appalachian ridge, generally -- is one of the regions hit hardest. Kentucky is the fourth most medicated state in the nation and it has the sixth highest rate of overdose deaths, according to the state's Attorney General. In Knott County, adjacent to Rockcastle, Kelly said more than half of the children have lost their parents due to death, abandonment or legal removal. Anecdotally, she says, the numbers in other aeas could be even higher. And in nearby Johnson County, so many children have lost parents that school administrators there changed ""Parents' Day"" to ""Guardians' Day."" Addiction and death are common concerns for families here, according to Kelly -- too common. Her voice wavering, Kelly recalled the story of a young girl who realized her mother was overdosing on prescription drugs right in front of her. ""She wanted to call the police and the other adults in the home were so high they wouldn't allow her to call,"" said Kelly. ""So she crawled up into her mother's arms while her mother died. Now she's just living with a lady she met at the local Boys and Girls Club. ""Those are the situations we're dealing with in eastern Kentucky."" Prescription drug deaths: Two stories . ""Someone has to take care of these kids, and we simply do not have the facilities to do that,"" said U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, whose district in Kentucky is mired in prescription drug abuse. ""So it's neighbors, it's churches, other civic groups that are trying to be parents to these kids who are orphaned by drug-abusing parents. ""That's a huge undertaking, because there's literally tens of thousands of these young children,"" he added. Rogers started the Operation UNITE drug task force in 2003 as a response to the broader prescription drug abuse epidemic in his state. Initially, he thought, ""If we could get the pushers off the streets, that the problem would be solved."" But years after he launched the task force, groups of children were showing up at community meetings to speak of their struggles after one parent -- or both -- overdosed. ""That hit me like a ton of bricks in the head,"" said Rogers. ""These are young people who are now thrown into the streets. So there are some real side effects to these parents using drugs."" Now, the UNITE program is channeling energy toward the children floundering socially, emotionally and academically after losing parents. They have programs set up at schools across Kentucky. 'It's time for it to stop' Hale, who worked in the local school system for 34 years, started a UNITE chapter at Rockcastle County High. ""It really got to the point where we were sick and tired of going to funerals,"" Hale said. ""We were tired of having kids come in and not being able to sit through physics class because they were worried about Mom who had overdosed. So we were like, 'What can we do? How can we help these families?'"" One way UNITE helps is by educating and counseling children who are having problems at home related to addiction. The group also empowers children like Bradshaw to speak out about their own loss. ""I know that a lot of kids deal with drug abuse from their parents,"" said Bradshaw. ""I don't know how many have lost parents, but I know a lot of kids definitely deal with that going home every day. I think right now we're definitely at a point where everybody needs to know about it and how it affects everybody."" ""It's time for it to stop,"" said Kelly. ""It's leaving our communities in shreds and we're left behind to pick up the pieces from that."" Advocates such as Hale and Kelly are desperate for an intervention to reach the thousands of children who are not being helped by programs like UNITE. Watkins said that the pain of having no parents is something that he will deal with for the rest of his life. ""People have to understand that this is a problem,"" he said. ""It doesn't affect just the person that uses, it affects the entire family.""","Many children and teens in eastern Kentucky have lost a parent to drug overdose .

"(CNN) -- One million lives uprooted. One million desperate souls trying to start anew with nothing, far away from home. The number of Syrians who have fled their country since the civil war began almost two years ago reached 1 million Wednesday, the U.N. refugee agency said. An average of almost 1,400 refugees spill across the border daily. The 1 million figure represents about 5% of Syria's total population. That's akin to the entire population of Prague, Czech Republic, walking away. ""With a million people in flight, millions more displaced internally, and thousands of people continuing to cross the border every day, Syria is spiraling towards full-scale disaster,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said. The pace of the exodus has spiked dramatically in recent months. Opinion: Refugee crisis 'spiraling out of control' More than 400,000 have fled since the beginning of this year to countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. About half the refugees are children. The news coincides almost exactly with the second anniversary of the Syrian civil war. And a day doesn't go by without a death toll. More than 60 people have been killed in the fighting Wednesday, and the United Nations and Syrian rebels are in a standoff over U.N. peacekeepers who've been detained amid the fighting. Here's where the refugee crisis stands now: . Many Syrians flee to other countries with few or no belongings, traumatized by the horrors of war and the pain of lost relatives. ""It was a very difficult decision to leave my home. I never wanted to -- ever,"" one refugee in Lebanon told Save the Children. But the missiles and cluster bombs left her no choice, she said. CNN special coverage: Syrian refugees . The scene at the Jordanian-Syrian border this week highlights the desperation. Elderly women, wounded men and entire families scampered across the border under the cover of night. A baby, wounded in the head by shrapnel, cried as the sound of shelling echoed in the distance. ""There are men left, but the families have fled in very large numbers in all of Daraa,"" one refugee said. ""You can now count the people left on your fingers. Syria is emptying."" While host families have taken in some refugees, others have endured frigid weather in tent camps or struggle to pay for shelter. A local administration office in Lebanon said it was running out of makeshift homes and heating fuel for refugees. Some must live in places where the only source of heat is a small outdoor fire for cooking. Read more: Syrians find calm after carnage . In Jordan, it's illegal for refugees to work, so some families have gone into deep debt to keep their children alive, Save the Children said. A 46-year-old refugee in Lebanon described the plight of his family, who has spent the past year living in an old sheep shed. ""I cry in my heart. I feel depressed. It's unjust. Is there a worse way to live than this?"" the refugee, identified as Ahmed, told the aid group. ""Our situation is terrible to the maximum. We didn't expect there were humans who could live the way we are living."" Host countries: Resources pushed to the limit . The endless flood of refugees has drained resources in neighboring countries in unpredictable ways. Lebanon's population has increased up to 10% because of Syrian refugees, the U.N. agency said. Syria's 'urban refugees' struggle for survival . Jordan's energy, water, health and education services have been severely strained. Turkey has spent more than $600 million setting up 17 refugee camps, with more under construction. And Iraq, already grappling with 1 million internally displaced citizens, has taken in more than 100,000 Syrian refugees in the past year. ""We are doing everything we can to help, but the international humanitarian response capacity is dangerously stretched,"" said Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ""This tragedy has to be stopped."" Dozens of countries and groups around the world pledged more than $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance for Syrians in January. But only $200 million had been received by the end of February, the United Nations said. The war: Shifting but endless . While the end of the war seems nowhere in sight, the opposition has made notable strides against government forces. This week, opposition fighters said they captured the major northern city of Raqqa -- the first time rebels have seized a provincial capital. State-run media responded by saying government forces were battling suspected members of the radical Islamist group al-Nusra Front in Raqqa. But footage from the city painted a different picture. Children climbed atop a fallen statue of former President Hafez al-Assad -- the current president's father -- and beat the cracked figure with a bat and shoes. Teen refugee: Prince Charming is dead . Some attribute the rebels' recent gains to shipments of arms from other countries. But rebels are still fighting to wrest the largest city, Aleppo, from government hands. They recently took over a military base near the city, but full control of Syria's economic hub remains elusive. While Damascus remains a regime stronghold, rebel and regime forces are battling very close to the city -- threatening to take the fight to the seat of President Bashar al-Assad's power. Rebels detain U.N. peacekeepers . Tension brewed Wednesday between the United Nations and rebels after about 30 rebels detained 20 U.N. peacekeepers and refused to let them go. The rebels say the peacekeepers entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces. The rebels say they suspect the peacekeepers were trying to aid their enemy, which is defending the al-Assad regime. The United Nations confirmed the peacekeepers' detention and said they were on a ""regular supply mission."" The United Nations offered no further details of that mission but said it is ""dispatching a team to assess the situation and attempt a resolution."" Intervention: Global attempts and failures . So far, international attempts to stymie the bloodshed have failed. Trouble brewed from the beginning, when the U.N. Security Council couldn't unify on an action plan for Syria. Western countries wanted tougher sanctions against the Syrian government, but Russia and China said they didn't want to meddle in another country's internal affairs. Syrian refugees on run: 'I want people to feel our pain' The United Nations and the Arab League sent two seasoned diplomats -- Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi -- to try to broker cease-fires in Syria, but negotiations never ended the violence. But the western Syrian town of Tal Kalakh may be a microcosm of hope. There, Syrian forces and rebels have agreed to a cease-fire, brokered in part by a parliamentarian and a sheikh. Residents in other parts of the country, though, aren't so fortunate. The death toll: Relentless carnage . The United Nations estimates more than 70,000 Syrians -- mostly civilians -- have been killed in the past two years. At least 10,000 people have died since early January, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday. ""That means more people have died in the first two months of this year than in the whole of the first year of the conflict,"" he said in remarks published online. Though there is ""no sign that the Assad regime currently intends to enter into a genuine political process,"" Hague said, securing ""a diplomatic breakthrough remains of course our objective."" On Wednesday, at least 62 people were killed in the conflict, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. But it's almost impossible to verify and keep up with the latest death figures. The Syrian government has severely restricted access by international journalists. Dissidents say many of the civilians killed were caught in aerial attacks from warplanes -- unable to predict when the next bomb will strike. U.N. Syria envoy: 'I am not a quitter' The war started when al-Assad's forces cracked down on civilians demanding more freedoms and government reform. The president's family has ruled Syria for almost 43 years. The violence led to an armed uprising and escalated into a civil war, with al-Assad trying to defend his rule against rebels demanding his ouster. Throughout the war, a lingering quandary has prevented any progress between the government and dissidents. Al-Assad has said he will not deal with ""terrorists,"" a term the government often uses to describe the opposition. Similarly, opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's ""criminal"" government, nor will they accept any plan that doesn't involve al-Assad's departure. With neither rebels nor government troops backing down, it's unclear how many more thousands of civilians may die.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Less than six months ago, eurozone watchers had been predicting the breakup of the 17-member bloc of nations as the euro plunged to a 25-month low against the U.S. dollar last July. Even as recently as November, Warren Buffett, the famed CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, said of the eurozone's future that ""it's hard to tell exactly how it comes out."" But since then, the euro has appreciated nearly 11% as its member countries battled to contain sovereign debt crises, rising unemployment and social unrest. The euro now stands at a 13-month high against the greenback. And flying in the face of last year's critics, former European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet told CNN's Nina dos Santos that the euro ""was never about to collapse"" and that its viability as a currency is solid. ""The euro as a currency has never been put in question,"" asserted Trichet, while at the same time admitting the euro area's financial stability and credit worthiness had been tested. As for the euro, he said it ""is certainly reliable and credible."" Yet, the euro's gains over the past seven months is a mixed blessing. Arguments have long-existed for and against a stronger currency. Appreciation means investors are more confident in the euro but eurozone exports become more expensive when sold overseas; devaluation makes the bloc's exports more competitive globally, which many eurozone officials would prefer. But if the world's major economies devalued their currencies to make exports more competitive and to spur their economies to growth again, it would be chaos, says Trichet. ""If the reasoning is the same in all constituencies you have nothing but...a 'beggar-thy-neighbor' policy which is a recipe for catastrophe."" That catastrophe could take the form of an all-out currency war. And this week, the world's leading banks called on the G20 group of richest nations to avoid such an outcome. ""We believe major central banks should focus on enhancing their cooperation...to guide market expectations and thus help avoid a disorderly interest rate adjustment process and undue exchange rate volatility,"" the Institute of International Finance wrote in a letter to Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who is chairing the G20 finance minister's meeting later this week. But with the eurozone in recession for the second time in four years, the desire to devalue the euro may be strong. The European Central Bank in December cut its 2013 growth forecast, with a best-case growth rate scenario of only 0.3%. ""It is no time for complacency,"" warned Trichet who added that the central banks of the United States, Japan and Europe as well as their private sectors should get their ""house(s) in order.""","Former European Central Bank chief says euro was never going to collapse .

"(CNN) -- University of Louisville guard Kevin Ware doesn't want to see any replays of his severely broken leg, suffered during a weekend basketball game on national television, he told CNN Wednesday. ""I don't plan on seeing the video. I honestly never want to see the video. It puts me in a mental state that I don't want to be,"" he said. The gruesome injury, in which his right shin bone snapped and protruded though the skin, was part of ""God's plan,"" he added. His teammates were horrified to see it on the court Sunday. ""This is all God. This is all God's plan. He would never let anything happen that He wouldn't want to happen,"" he told CNN. His mother, Lisa, who was sitting beside him during the interview, said the incident upset her badly. ""I just lost it,"" she said. ""It really did look that bad."" Ware intends to return the court some day. The broken leg, held together by two metal plates, will heal in eight to 12 weeks, he said. ""I will play basketball again,"" he asserted. ""I know patience is key."" Earlier Wednesday, Ware recounted his shock over the severely broken leg, which occurred Sunday in Indianapolis during the Midwest regional final of the NCAA men's tournament, against Duke. ""I look down and I see my bone is 6 inches out of my leg and I go into automatic shock,"" he told reporters at a news conference. Teammate Luke Hancock went to Ware and said a prayer for him. Ware said to himself that ""I'm either going to cry ... or I'm just going to try to say some words (to help the team). We beat Duke by 22, so I guess my word got through good enough."" ""Luke is a great guy,"" Ware said. The injury occurred after Ware jumped to try to block a shot. Louisville player, injured badly on Sunday, out of hospital . ""I kind of joke a little bit, like I should have blocked the shot because I jumped so high, but I guess I just landed wrong and didn't see where I was landing, so that's kind of what caused the injury,"" Ware said. He said he believes there's a reason for everything, but ""I don't know what the reason is going to be"" for the injury. ""It is just a process. I'm ready for it,"" he said. He said he was surprised to see his teammates' tearful and distressed reactions. ""Everybody was in real shock, and just looking around and seeing that, it was devastating,"" said Ware, who was using crutches Wednesday. ""But they pulled it through, and that's really most important right now. We still have a season, and we don't want our season to end, so got to get the job done,"" Ware said. Coach Rick Pitino sat beside Ware as the player recalled the incident. Ware could be playing again in less than a year . In a two-hour surgery, Ware's broken tibia was straightened and a rod was inserted into it, according to a statement from Kenneth Klein, senior associate athletic director for media relations at the university. A photo posted on the Internet shows Ware's jubilant teammates holding up his jersey as they celebrated their win over Duke, which sent them to the tournament's Final Four this coming weekend in Atlanta. Another showed Ware in his hospital bed, holding the trophy his teammates brought to him. Ware has been touched by the public support. ""I'm a very quiet guy, so a lot of this is really new to me, you know,"" Ware said. ""I really just appreciate everybody and the support I have right now. ""I'll be fine, but (we've) still got to win this championship,"" he added. His doctors asked Ware whether he had previous shin problems, but he told them he's never had such issues. Louisville will take on Wichita State at 6:05 p.m. ET on Saturday, with the winner advancing to the national championship game Monday. School officials told CNN that Ware will be able to travel with his teammates when they fly to Atlanta on Wednesday night.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sharon Osbourne's claim that she has information that would help Michael Jackson's mother and children in their wrongful death lawsuit against a concert promoter has landed the TV host/reality star on the trial's witness list. Osbourne made her revelation on Tuesday's ""The Talk,"" the same day jury selection began in the trial to decide if concert promoter AEG Live executives played a role in Jackson's death in the negligent hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray. ""There were certain people that worked at that company that knew that Michael Jackson was not well and didn't care because it was business,"" Osbourne said. ""And at the end of the day, whether he performed or he didn't, they would still make money, and I've had conversations with certain people at that company who have said exactly that to me."" Conrad Murray from jail: 'I was in the wrong place at the wrong time' Osbourne then suggested she could be a witness in the Los Angeles trial. ""If they would like me to go to court, the Jackson family, I will stand up and tell you who said that to me."" Jackson lawyers noticed her comments and added Osbourne to their witness list Wednesday. AEG Live's lawyers argue that Jackson -- not the promoter -- chose and hired Murray to be his personal physician as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts. The Jackson lawsuit contends that the doctor was an AEG Live employee when Jackson died. The coroner ruled that Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, was caused by a lethal combination of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic Propofol, which Murray used to treat the singer's insomnia.

"(CNN) -- Google chairman Eric Schmidt has declared Android the winner in its mobile war with Apple. In an interview with Bloomberg, Schmidt said Google's mobile platform is widening its lead over Apple in the mobile-software market. He compared its success to the way Microsoft dominated the iPhone maker in the desktop business two decades ago. ""This is a huge platform change; this is of the scale of 20 years ago -- Microsoft versus Apple,"" he said. ""We're winning that pretty clearly now."" Recent statistics support Schmidt's optimism, with Android capturing 72% of worldwide market share in the third quarter, while Apple took 14%, according to Gartner, which conducts information technology research. Unlike Apple, Google does not make its money on hardware; for this reason, it is willing to give away Android because the OS' widespread use helps the company make more money from ads. ""The core strategy is to make a bigger pie,"" Schmidt said. ""We will end up with a not perfectly controlled and not perfectly managed bigger pie by virtue of open systems."" Despite his confidence, however, other reports suggest that Apple is gaining ground in the U.S. smartphone market, particularly since its release of the iPhone 5.

"(CNN) -- For an institution that moves glacially, instant analysis is as impossible as it is unwise. Yet first impressions are important. Our initial glimpse of the new pope was curiously disconcerting. He stood there impassive and unemotional. He looked stunned, without almost any reaction at all except, perhaps, awe or even fear of the moment. Suddenly, his eyes seemed to open wide, as if he was really seeing the position for which he had been chosen less than an hour before. And then he spoke, not with the power of physical force or energy but with something stronger: humility. With the election of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires as pope, the Roman Catholic Church enters the next chapter of her history. And yet, as often happens in the church, she turns to her past for inspiration and even innovation. So we have the first pope to be elected from the Society of Jesus, known as the Jesuits, who were founded by Ignatius of Loyola in the 16th century while Catholicism reeled from Protestant challenges. Yet this Jesuit takes the name Francis from the humble servant of medieval Assisi who began the Franciscan order 300 years before Ignatius. Francis took to the balcony with the word ""bishop"" crossing his lips more than ""pope"" or ""pontiff."" He referred to himself first as the bishop of Rome and to Benedict XVI not as retired pope but emeritus bishop. There was something genuine about the way he referred to the journey of faith as one that he and the faithful take together in love and trust. He asked for help and the favor of a prayer -- but this wasn't the standard ""pray for me."" Pope Francis bowed to receive that prayer from the people of God he now serves. Opinion: Francis, open up the church . Looking back at the monthlong examination of conscience that Catholics, Vatican-watchers and the cardinals have undergone, what does Francis face? What will he do based on his own experience? The cardinals' pre-conclave meetings seemed to reveal a particular job description, but the rumors and leaks seemed to have been wrong. This man is 76 and not in his 60s. He has not worked full-time in the Vatican's headquarters, called the curia, raising immediate questions about how he will reform the institution's central administration. It is hard, at least initially and under deadline, to discover how he acted when faced with clerical sexual abuse, although we have heard less of this awful situation in Latin America than in the United States and Ireland. Francis does seem to be a moderate who is respected by and can work with people sitting on different benches along the ideological spectrum. He is friendly with the conservative organization Communione e Liberazione and yet like John Paul II embraces the church's lively sense of fairness and justice when it comes to the poor and middle class left out by rampant capitalism and its twin temptation, the gospel of prosperity. As archbishop, he took a bus to work and lived in a small apartment. Opinion: The biggest moment in the world . Like Ignatius, he has a reputation for using his mind to solve a problem but his heart to make a decision. Like Francis of Assisi, he operates within the world of an ordained clergy while not being drowned in self-serving clerical rank and privilege. So what Pope Francis seems to bring, at least at a first glance, is personal authenticity and credibility. Both are critical precursors to change. Many people want change, it is true, but any proposals that might or might not come won't mean a thing unless a new spirit of credibility and trust flows down the Tiber throughout the planet's oceans to the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. For too long, it seems that the curia has been about power, which is not the same thing as authentic authority. People respond with lasting love to authority but with only temporary fear to power. For too long, the people in the pews have felt distanced from their priests, bishops and the Vatican. That is not the gospel of love and service that Jesus preached. Yet it is precisely the gospel that Francis of Assisi and Ignatius Loyola learned from Jesus and shared with the world in word and deed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher M. Bellitto.","Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires is selected as pope .

"(CNN) -- A woman desperate to have a fourth child forced her adopted teenage daughter to artificially inseminate herself with semen purchased over the Internet so she could have the baby. The woman devised the plan after her efforts to adopt another daughter were thwarted. In addition to the victim, the woman also has two other younger adopted daughters. The astonishing revelations appear in documents released this week by a British court. The previously secret child welfare judgment from March 2012 was only published after the conclusion of the mother's criminal trial. The woman was sentenced to five years in prison for child cruelty, British media reported. Six attempts . The mother came up with the self-insemination plan when her oldest daughter was 13. ""There were six series of attempts over two years,"" Judge Peter Jackson said in the documents. ""She became pregnant at the age of 14, but miscarried, and ultimately became pregnant ... at the age of 16."" The mother spent 2,420 euros ($3,165) to purchase donor sperm from the Cryos sperm bank in Denmark. The court documents say she provided forged documents to get the semen. While the daughter said she didn't want to have a baby, she ultimately gave in because she loves her mother. ""My mum is a very determined person and she does her best not to let anything get in her way if she wants it,"" the daughter said, according to the court. Scheme unravels . The story they agreed on was this: The daughter would say she had met and had sex with an Australian boy, who was briefly visiting the United Kingdom. Despite all the planning, the mother's scheme began to unravel at the hospital after the birth of the baby. Midwives said she was aggressive in trying to make sure the baby didn't bond with her daughter. ""We don't want any of that attachment thing,"" the mother said, according to the midwives after breastfeeding was suggested. ""Is there much point to that, I will be the one giving him the bottle."" While hospital notes said the plan was for the daughter to relinquish the baby to her mother, the midwives became suspicious that something was going on as she became increasingly ""pushy and insensitive."" They also heard the woman apologize to her daughter for putting her through so much. They finally reported the mother's behavior after she tried to remove the child from the baby ward. It was the concerns raised by the midwives that led to the investigation. ""Their willingness to stand up for them (the daughter that had the baby and two other siblings) changed everything,"" the judge said. CNN's Allen Corinna, Nick Hunt, Antonia Mortensen, Andrew Carey and Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","The woman devised a plan to inseminate her oldest daughter .

"(CNN) -- Jim Grant was driving home in Carlsbad, California, when he came to a fork in the road. No, an actual fork. The oversized kitchen utensil was 6 feet high, made of wood, painted silver and mounted in the concrete island at the intersection of Levante Street and Anillo Way in south Carlsbad. Grant, a local photographer and a contributor to CNN iReport, knew he had to pull over. ""I actually laughed out loud in my truck and just knew I had to get some shots of this urban art before some city employee takes it down or it is vandalized,"" he said. He shot some photos Tuesday afternoon, posted them on CNN iReport and left a Post-it note on the sculpture in hopes of finding the artist. The literal fork in the road was short-lived. A city crew pulled it out of the concrete Wednesday morning, saying in a statement that ""although the fork in the road remains, the literal fork was removed this morning. We appreciate the creativity, but it's not legal or safe to put objects like this on public streets or medians."" CNN affiliate KFMB filmed the fork being taken away. Grant and other local residents, including the creator himself, are holding out hope that city officials will change their mind and return the quirky spectacle. Carlsbad Communications Manager Kristina Ray told CNN, ""If the artist would like to propose to donate this art to the city, we do have a process through our Cultural Arts Office to consider it. He or she could get in touch with us to learn more about this process."" Before the fork was ripped out, Grant's Post-it note made its way to the artist, who explained he was a retired teacher who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of getting fined or sued by the city. The 62-year-old retired math and physics teacher said he has wanted to make a fork for that island ever since he saw ""The Muppet Movie"" in 1979, in which Kermit tells Fozzie Bear, on their way to Hollywood, to bear left if he comes to a fork in the road. A moment later, a giant upside-down fork appears in the road. That was more than 30 years ago, but he never had the time to work on the project until he retired in June. He spent the summer on it, laminating pieces of wood together until they resembled the kitchen utensil. He bought a can of chrome paint and sprayed the fork until the can was empty. His brother, a middle-school wood shop teacher in El Cajon, helped him smooth out the edges. ""I'm not an artist. I have no talent, but I'm not afraid to try, and I'm quite surprised that the fork came out as good as it did,"" he said. With his 32-year-old son's help, they mounted it in the street on Tuesday morning. Knowing the city might object, they tried to stay discreet. He said they put on orange construction vests and cloaked the prongs in a black garbage bag while they installed it on the island. ""We tried to look official, didn't make eye contract with anybody driving by. ... It just looked like two construction workers putting up a sign post. And then when all the signs were gone, I removed the trash bag, and then people started taking pictures,"" he said. He and his son got a few pictures and were surprised it created such a commotion when it was taken down. Several news stations reported that neighbors wanted it put back. ""I just thought a couple people would drive by and smile and keep on driving. I didn't think anything more was going to happen,"" he said. ""I can't afford to pay any fines, and I don't want to get in trouble. It was just something I thought the folks in my neighborhood would appreciate, and apparently they did."" Ray said the placement of the fork would be considered a code violation. ""We normally impose a fine only if there is a repeated problem and requests for voluntary compliance don't work."" Wednesday, soon after the fork was removed, a neighbor put up a sign that said ""Why the fork not?"" Grant shot a photo of that too and posted it on iReport. ""Thank you for the laughs we all had looking at the Fork,"" Grant told the artist. ""Hopefully, the city changes its mind and lets the Fork return, even for a week or so."" Update: Jim Grant reports Thursday night that the ""Why the fork not?"" sign is gone, but people have been taping normal-sized forks to a nearby road sign. Meanwhile, readers in the comments below tell us about a giant fork with a happy ending in another part of California. In a similar guerilla art prank , an artist erected an 18-foot tall, 500-pound fork in the road in a Pasadena median in 2009. The city ordered it removed after 7 months (which required a forklift), but in 2011, it was properly permitted and permanently installed.","A retired teacher put a giant fork in the road .

"(CNN) -- Former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, who resigned because of an extramarital affair with Maria Belen Chapur, told CNN in an interview Wednesday he was ""completely"" surprised when Chapur -- now his fiancee -- showed up the night before to appear with him when he claimed victory in the runoff for the GOP nomination for his old U.S. House seat. ""I round the corner and there she is to give me a hug and surprise me,"" Sanford said on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" the day after his comeback political victory. ""It was not at all what I expected. It was an awfully, awfully nice surprise."" Chapur has rarely been seen in public with Sanford after the scandal of the affair, which was revealed after Sanford lied about hiking on the Appalachian Trail while he traveled to Argentina to visit her. He ended up getting divorced, and his victory in Tuesday's runoff vote was a the first step in a political comeback.","Former South Carolina Gov.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The facility Lindsay Lohan entered Thursday to comply with court-ordered rehab is not licensed to provide alcohol or drug rehab treatment, a state official said. Lohan, 26, flew from New York to California last night to check into Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, California, by the Thursday morning deadline for her to start her 90-day sentence. When Los Angeles Superior Judge James Dabney sentenced Lohan to 90 days in jail in March he gave her the option of serving the time in a ""lock down rehab"" facility. ""If a 24-hour residential facility is providing treatment or services to promote the recovery of alcohol and drug abuse then they must possess a license,"" deputy director for the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs Millicent Tidwell said. None of Morningside's several California locations are licensed, Tidwell said. The company previously had three licenses, but they were all revoked. The state's licensing agency is currently in litigation with Morningside's unlicensed Newport Beach facility, she said. It is not known if prosecutors will ask the judge to order Lohan to move to another facility or else be sent to jail to serve out the sentence. The city attorneys for Santa Monica and Los Angeles, who were jointly prosecuting the actress, did not immediately respond to CNN inquiries. Judge Dabney ordered the treatment after Lohan entered pleas of no contest on charges relating to a traffic accident and she was found in violation of her shoplifting probation with those convictions. ""It's not her fault,"" her father said. ""This poor kid was a mess before she left."" Her lawyer, Mark Heller, arranged for Lohan to check into Morningside Recovery without approval by the prosecutors, he said. ""Lindsay had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved,"" Michael Lohan said. Heller appeared in a Los Angeles court to discuss the matter with the judge and prosecutors Thursday morning. Her father, who has bitterly opposed Heller's representation of Lohan, said he has been urging his daughter to go the the Lukens Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which bills itself as a ""luxury rehab center."" ""The Lukens Institute is where she wanted to go all along -- a place she will get the right treatment and finally get better,"" Michael Lohan said. Her six years of legal troubles trace back to two drunken driving arrests in 2007 and include other incidents in which she was behind the wheel. Lohan was charged with reckless driving and lying to a police officer about a June 2012 car crash in which her Porsche crashed in to a dump truck on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica, California. Her arrest triggered the probation violation charge. The police report said Lohan denied being behind the wheel, but the prosecutor was expected to call witnesses who say she was driving. Lindsay Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances. She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered stint after a failed drug test. The actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail. Lohan has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the Los Angeles County jail, served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue.","NEW: Lohan checks into Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, California .

"(CNN) -- No-one has been awarded the world's most valuable prize, the $5 million Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership, which was due to be announced Monday. For the third time in six years, no African leader has been deemed worthy of the prize, awarded by Sudanese billionaire Mo Ibrahim's foundation. ""The Prize Committee reviewed a number of eligible candidates but none met the criteria needed to win this Award. The Award is about excellence in leadership."" the Mo Ibrahim Foundation Prize Committee said in a press release. The prize is a $5 million award paid over 10 years and $200,000 annually for life after that. It is awarded to democratically elected leaders who have stepped down in the past three years after serving their constitutionally mandated term, and have demonstrated ""excellence in office."" Ibrahim, chairman and founder of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, said: ""Since we launched the Prize six years ago, we have had three winners, and three years without."" Last year's winner was President Pedro Verona Pires of Cape Verde for his ""vision in transforming Cape Verde into a model of democracy, stability and increased prosperity."" Other previous winners have been Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique in 2007 and Festus Mogae of Botswana in 2008. Nelson Mandela was made the honorary inaugural Laureate in 2006. In 2009 and 2010 there was no winner. See also: Mo Ibrahim warns Africa's dictators . In a report on African governance released by the Mo Ibrahim Foundation Monday to coincide with the prize, Nigeria moved into the bottom 10 countries on the continent for governance for the first time. It was ranked 43rd out of 54 countries based on 88 indicators taking in factors such as human rights, rule of law, development, personal safety, participation in the political process, infrastructure, welfare, health and education. The Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) -- an annual study measuring accountability and good governance in 52 out of 54 African nations -- found four of the continent's powerhouses, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa, have declined in quality of governance since 2006. Abdoulie Janneh, former Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa and Board Member of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation said in a press release: ""Given the vast natural and human resources of these four regional powers, these governance results are a concern. ""Each of these countries plays a key role in the economic and political landscape of the continent. To continue to optimally play this role requires a sustained commitment to balanced and equitable governance."" Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa were all deemed to have deteriorated in their safety, rule of law, participation for citizens and human rights. Claims of corruption in Nigeria and Kenya have been common in recent years, with Transparency International ranking the two countries 143 and 154 respectively out of 183 nations for corruption. See also: Shaping Africa's tech revolution . South Africa and Kenya meanwhile also registered a drop in sustainable economic opportunity. The report uses data from 2000 to 2011 and does not take into account changes in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia since the Arab Spring. The report's authors used data from hundreds of sources but said a lack of data had hindered it. Ibrahim said in a press release: ""Good governance is about harnessing a country's resources to achieve the results any citizen living in the 21st century has a right to expect. One of Africa's biggest leadership and governance challenges going forward is to master its own robust statistical system. Political sovereignty begins with data autonomy."" The report said there was an overarching trend towards more inclusive and representative leadership since 2000, with improvements in 11 out of 14 of its subcategories. Significant improvements in the rule of law were registered in the formerly war-torn nations of Liberia and Sierra Leone, while Angola, Guinea and Liberia made major strides in human rights. Other countries to record strong performances in areas such as human development and sustainable economic performance included Rwanda, Mauritius and Zambia. Tanzania has climbed the IIAG's rankings over the past six years, making it into the top 10 for the first time. Across the continent the study noted particularly high improvements in gender equality in all regions bar west Africa. Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and Board Member of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation said, ""Africa's women have the capacity to bring about remarkable change and therefore equity and equality between men and women is in the strategic interests of African leaders and governments."" See also: Africa grows but youth gets left behind . Earlier this month, the foundation awarded Archbishop Desmond Tutu a one-off $1 million special prize for his lifelong commitment towards ""speaking truth to power,"" -- a trait emphasized throughout South African apartheid and more recently in his call for Tony Blair and George W. Bush to ""made to answer"" at the International Criminal Court for their role in the Iraq war. Which African leaders do you think are worthy of the prize?

"Above Gwangju, South Korea (CNN) -- ""I feel the need ... the need for speed!"" Those infamous words spoken by Maverick and Goose in the movie ""Top Gun"" enter my head as I walk across the tarmac to the fighter jet that I will soon fly in. With my helmet in hand and dressed in a pilot's jumpsuit, I look the part as I prepare for my maiden flight in South Korea's latest fighter jet -- the T-50 jet trainer. But I'm feeling anxious and slightly nauseous, and for good reason. The week before, the South Korean Air Force had put me through a rigorous training course at the Aerospace Medical Training Center in North Chungcheong Province. But it wasn't simply a case of a medical check-up and a few tests to make sure I was fit, healthy and good to fly. I was strapped into a simulator and forced to endure extreme gravitational forces for up to 20 seconds -- hardcore training that all fighter pilots must pass. I didn't just black out once but twice, so my fear was it would happen again but this time at 24,000 feet in the air. Major Young-Ho Cheon had heard about my training ordeal. The 35 year old has been a fighter pilot for the past 11 years -- fulfilling his childhood dream. ""There's nothing to be worried about Coren. Just relax -- I will look after you."" I'm not worried about my pilot, I'm worried about whether I can handle my nerves and nail the near impossible breathing technique that will stop the blood rushing from my head and causing me to lose consciousness once more. The pilots at the Gwangju airbase are all exceptionally fit. Their cardiovascular levels and core muscles are that of an elite athlete. They train in the gym every day, push weights and run countless kilometers, conditioning their bodies to endure the paralyzing G-forces; a force that for us mere mortals feels like a house collapsing on top of you as you gasp for air. I get into the back seat of the fighter jet and the ground crew strap me in. They point out the ejection seat lever that I will have to pull if something goes wrong. ""Other than that lever, don't touch any other buttons,"" warns one ground crewman. By this stage my mask is pumping oxygen and the pilot tells me to slow down my breathing. On the ground, in the cockpit I'm struggling for air -- I know I'm nervous. We soon taxi into position, the engines deafening. ""You OK Coren? We're ready to take off,"" Major Cheon informs me. Suddenly the roar becomes even louder and we're speeding along the runway, and within seconds we're in the air. We climb steadily above Gwangju, the sixth largest city in South Korea. It gets smaller and smaller until we make our way to 13,000 feet above the clouds. There are two other fighter jets traveling with us. One is carrying a film crew from the South Korean Air Force, the other is traveling as a buddy -- these jets always fly in tandem. After 15 minutes, Major Cheon pipes up, ""OK enough sight seeing, it's time to have some fun."" This ""fun"" includes performing an eye-popping list of textbook maneuvers -- B-roll, Loop, Cuban 8, Immelman-Turn, Split-S, Clover Leaf, Vertical Demo and Horn Recovery -- that will test this state-of-the-art aircraft and its nervous passenger to the limit. The maneuvers begin and suddenly the pressure hits me. It's so intense as we climb higher and higher, but unlike the training where I wasn't wearing an anti-G suit to protect me from the dynamic forces, this amazing device suddenly kicks to constrict my legs and keep the blood in the top half of my body. Every time there is a strong G-force this suit blows up and quite literally saves me. I'm seeing stars but I don't black out. I'm breathing deeply, clenching my body, trying desperately not to let the pain and pressure get on top of me. Suddenly we're upside down, with a punishing 6Gs -- six times that of the normal force of gravity -- against me and all I can see is the Earth beneath me. We come out of the turn and the pilot's voice comes through on my headset. ""Ready for 7Gs Coren? I think you can do it."" With his reassurance and my renewed confidence I scream through the microphone, ""Whoaaaaaaa ... let's do it!"" We thrust higher into the heavens and the jet feels likes it's vertical -- because it is -- and within seconds we're at 24,000 feet. ""Here we go,"" Major Cheon suddenly warns. And with that the jet twists and turns in ways I never thought were possible. I'm groaning in the backseat, the G-forces at this stage are so painful they feel like they're crushing my body. And then suddenly they release me and the pain is over. We're in the air for an hour -- an hour of my life filled with pain and ecstasy. An hour of life I will never forget.","CNN's Anna Coren flies in the South Korean Air Force's latest fighter jet .

"(CNN) -- Forensic experts exhumed the remains of former Chilean President Salvador Allende on Monday as part of an investigation into whether he killed himself or was assassinated during a 1973 military coup, the medical branch of the country's Justice Ministry said. Official accounts ruled the leftist leader's death a suicide, saying that he shot himself  -- with a gun that was reportedly a gift from Fidel Castro -- as Gen. Augusto Pinochet's troops closed in on the presidential palace. But some of Allende's supporters have long doubted that account. A judge ordered the exhumation in April as part of a massive investigation of 726 reported human rights violations during Pinochet's rule, CNN Chile reported. ""The people want to know. This is something that the country needs,"" said Minister Mario Carroza, the judge in charge of the investigation into Allende's death. Politicians stood solemnly beside the Allende family's crypt at a Santiago cemetery Monday as investigators wearing white gloves carried his remains in a flag-draped casket, images from CNN Chile showed. At a nearby laboratory, an international team of experts in archaeology, anthropology, forensics, pathology and ballistics had already begun taking X-ray images of the remains Monday morning, Chile's Legal Medical Service said in a statement. In the coming days, scientists will send bone specimens from the coffin and blood samples from Allende's two daughters and a granddaughter to a laboratory in Innsbruk, Austria, for DNA testing, the statement said. The agency's head said he was hesitant to establish a time frame for the investigation, noting that many steps remained in the analysis. ""It is necessary to open the casket, look at the preservation of the bone fragments, analyze if there is other related evidence, of clothing, et cetera. ... to obtain the information the judge has requested,"" said Dr. Patricio Bustos, national director of the agency, which is part of Chile's Justice Ministry. Whatever the investigation's results, they will likely resonate across the South American country, said Peter Hakim, president emeritus of the Inter-American Dialogue, a nonpartisan policy institute in Washington. ""Allende is still a hero for many on the left in Chile. He was a historic figure because he was the first socialist leader ever elected in the hemisphere. ... This is a man who still commands a considerable degree of respect,"" Hakim said. Allende's daughter, Sen. Isabel Allende, told CNN Chile her family believed the official account of what caused her father's death. ""The family has no doubt, we never have,"" she said. A statement posted on her website Monday said the family was ""reaffirming what we have said all these years, our conviction is that President Allende made the decision to die ... in defense of the mandate that was given to him by the people."" Human rights attorney Eduardo Contreras told reporters that Monday's exhumation was a key step. ""A process has started that could end in finally establishing that it was a suicide or that it involved a homicide,"" he said. ""The important thing is to know the truth."" CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Bone and blood samples will be sent to an Austrian lab for DNA tests .

"(CNN) -- The amateur video shows men, shirtless and seeming dangerously drunk, rolling on the ground or staggering near a counter top covered with booze bottles. Another part of the video shows a man babbling incoherently with a syringe nearby. This is not a scene at a college frat house. It is a video of employees of an American security contractor working in Kabul, Afghanistan. ""It reminded me of times I'd visit my friends going to college that were in fraternities,"" said John Melson, a former employee of Jorge Scientific who was based at that villa in Kabul on assignment to support efforts to train Afghan security personnel. The images in this video are now part of a lawsuit by two former employees of Jorge Scientific who allege that contractors with the firm were careless with their guns, abused local staffers, wrecked cars, destroyed furniture, and often could not perform their duties due to drunkenness. ""This behavior actually was almost every other night,"" said Kenny Smith, another former employee there, who filmed the videos in January and February. Smith and Melson have filed the lawsuit and cite an example of one night in February of 2012 where several employees were allegedly ""heavily intoxicated and grabbing at each other's weapons and firing them in the air. "" In one of the videos, which were obtained by CNN, a raging bonfire burns in a pit. The lawsuit alleges that drunken revelers threw ammunition on the fire which exploded, causing a serious laceration on the brow of a local employee. The result of the misconduct, it says, was undermanned security, missed work, and damage to relations with Afghan people and officials. ""Jorge employees were often too intoxicated to perform their duties,"" the lawsuit claims. In a statement, Jorge Scientific said the behavior was ""unacceptable"" and added, ""the Company is deeply concerned about any employee misconduct."" The firm has implemented a no-drinking policy as well as made management changes, a Jorge representative said. None of the people seen in the videos work for Jorge anymore, the firm says. Jorge ""pledges to fully investigate and correct any mistakes to preserve and continue its history of exemplary performance,"" the statement concluded. But Jorge Scientific rejected the suggestion that work was compromised. ""The Company remains confident that the personal misconduct did not impact the Company's contract performance,"" the statement said. David Scher, Smith and Melson's attorney, disagrees. ""These people were drunk beyond the point of incoherence, and could not possibly defend themselves if they were attacked,"" he said. The company says the workers seen in the videos would not have been tasked with defending the compound, since they had administrative roles and support roles, rather than top security jobs. But Scher disputes that and says the company is downplaying the roles of the men in the videos. ""That is a gross understatement of what these individuals did,"" said Scher. ""These individuals are the security manager for the facility, and the operations manager for security for the entire country of Afghanistan for the company."" CNN was unable to reach either of those men, or another man, seen in the video, which was first reported on by ABC News. The military is supposed to oversee such contractors, and the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation Division is now looking into the allegations. ""The International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces Afghanistan take all allegations of inappropriate behavior by contractors and service members very seriously,"" said an ISAF spokesman. But Danielle Brian, of the nonprofit watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, said she is concerned that the U.S. is relying too much on contractors, who work in miserable conditions, with too little oversight. The kind of misconduct seen in the videos - even if rare - risks undermining the American mission in Afghanistan, she said. ""This is the kind of behavior that is making people in the area - Afghans - have more disregard for the Americans who are there,"" she said.","The videos are part of a lawsuit by two former employees .

"ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- Two cadaver dogs working separately each showed interest in the same area of property belonging to kidnapping suspects Phillip and Nancy Garrido, a possible indication of human remains, police said Thursday. Police search for evidence relating to missing girls Ilene Misheloff and Michaela Garecht. Authorities will use ground-penetrating radar equipment on Friday to examine the area, and ""we will eventually be digging in that location,"" said Hayward police Lt. Chris Orrey. The Garridos face a combined 29 felony counts in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, then 11, from South Lake Tahoe, California. Authorities believe the couple held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years and have said Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, fathered her two children. On Tuesday, police from Hayward and Dublin, California, began executing search warrants simultaneously on the Garrido property and an adjacent property to which Garrido had access. They are seeking any evidence in the 1988 abduction of 9-year-old Michaela Garecht of Hayward and the 1989 disappearance of 13-year-old Ilene Misheloff of Dublin. Both agencies have said that while Garrido has not been named a suspect in either case, he cannot be eliminated as a suspect.  Watch police search the Garrido home » . On Wednesday, authorities said they had found bones on the Garrido property as well as the adjacent property but do not know whether they are animal or human. The bones are being analyzed, Orrey said on Thursday, and no new information was available about them. In addition, a bone fragment was found on the adjacent property last week. Police said it was probably human, and it is being tested at the state DNA lab. Police said the spot that the dogs showed interest in was in ""open ground"" on the Garrido property. The first dog gave a tentative indication of something there, so the second dog was brought in and made a more definite indication, said Sgt. J.D. Nelson of Alameda County Sheriff's Office. The dogs, which undergo between six months and a year of training, are trained to find human remains. It is possible for the dogs to give ""false positives,"" Nelson said -- a reason why the second dog was brought in. However, since both dogs showed interest, going forward with the other methods is recommended, he said. Orrey said the digging could begin as soon as Friday, but was not sure when it would occur. Police have disassembled some horse sheds and a deck on the properties, Orrey said, and plan to overturn the concrete slabs they were built on in order to have the dogs check the spots out. There are other slabs on the property as well, she said, some of which are ""randomly placed"" and ""piqued our interest,"" she said. Authorities have seized documents from the home, apparently some writings by Garrido -- ""it appears he was a pretty prolific writer,"" Orrey said.  Learn more about Phillip Garrido's history » . Police also have taken some things for Jaycee and her family, and ""a few things we want to take a second look at,"" she said, adding, ""nothing compelling so far has been taken."" Officers are ""doing a lot of photo-documentation"" in case anything turns out to be connected to another case, she said. The operation may wrap up midweek next week, Orrey said. The home is in unincorporated Contra Costa County, near Antioch, California. Meanwhile, officials at Contra Costa County Animal Services Department said Dugard and her daughters will be reunited with pets taken from the Garrido home after he and his wife were arrested in late August -- five cats, two dogs, three cockatiels, a pigeon, a white mouse and a parakeet. Officials said the animals appeared to be well cared-for. It was unclear when Dugard would get them back.

"(CNN) -- The charge against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for allegedly using low-grade explosives housed in pressure cookers to bomb the Boston Marathon is ""using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction."" For many, the term ""weapon of mass destruction"" -- or WMD -- means something far more apocalyptic than the Boston attack, tragic though that was. For those people it will forever be associated with the run-up to the Iraq War, when leaders of the U.S.-led coalition warned that Saddam Hussein was building up his stocks of WMD -- a claim that turned out to be incorrect. Watch: 10 years later -- Iraq's phantom WMD . So, when and how did a pressure cooker -- allegedly filled with low-grade explosives, metallic BBs and nails -- become a WMD and where did the phrase come from? Many sources point to a 1937 address by the then Archbishop of Canterbury Cosmo Gordon Lang, as the first time the phrase weapons of mass destruction was used. In a report at the time, London's Times newspaper quoted Lang as referring to wars in China and Spain and saying: ""Who can think without horror of what another widespread war would mean, waged as it would be with all the new weapons of mass destruction."" It is unclear exactly which weapons Lang was referring to, however, in April 1937 German bombers had systematically destroyed the Basque town of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, prompting Times correspondent George Steer to write on April 27, 1937: ""In the form of its execution and the scale of the destruction it wrought, no less than the selection of its objective, the raid on Guernica is unparalleled in military history."" He described ""first, hand grenades and heavy bombs to stampede the population, then machine-gunning to drive them below, next heavy and incendiary bombs to wreck the houses and burn them on top of their victims."" The same year, Japan had invaded China, where its troops were widely accused of gross human rights abuses, including raping tens of thousands of girls and women and killing several hundred thousand others in December 1937, in what has come to be called ""The Rape of Nanking."" Read more: Japan fires military chief over WWII denial . Nine years later, the Times referred to a report by the British mission to Hiroshima after the Japanese city became the first victim of an atom bomb. It quoted the report as opening: ""His Majesty's Government consider that a full understanding of the consequences of the new form of attack may assist the United Nations Organization in its task of securing the control of atomic energy for the common good and in abolishing the use of weapons of mass destruction."" Indeed, the U.N.'s first resolution in 1946 established a committee whose tasks included making specific proposals ""for the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction."" In their 2012 paper for the U.S. government's National Defense University, ""Defining Weapons of Mass Destruction,"" authors John F. Reichart and W. Seth Carus wrote that, in terms of disarmament policy, the definitive definition of WMD had emerged at the U.N. in 1948. It covered ""...atomic explosive weapons, radioactive material weapons, lethal chemical and biological weapons, and any weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above,"" they said. In May 2002, the then U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs, Jayantha Dhanapala, told the American Bar Association that WMD ""today consist of nuclear, biological, and chemical arms -- they all share one deadly trait: they are indiscriminately lethal."" Dhanapala went on to say: ""They are neither lightly nor inappropriately called 'weapons of mass destruction.'"" Reichart and Carus said they had identified ""more than 50 WMD definitions issued by a government or international organization."" The definition in the U.S. Criminal Code included high explosives and was ""inconsistent with most national guidance and with the usage preferred by the State Department and the international community,"" they said. ""Almost all crimes"" prosecuted under this definition could be prosecuted under other provisions of the U.S. criminal code, they suggested. Bombs, grenades, rockets ""having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, a missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce"" and mines, are among the explosives covered by the criminal code's definition of WMD. Robert Chesney -- professor of law at University of Texas -- said the statute Tsarnaev had been charged under -- U.S. Code title 18, section 2332a -- defined WMD ""far more broadly than that phrase is normally understood."" ""At the bottom, it is simply a statute that makes it a felony to set off bombs in public places, which certainly applies in this case. Unless the government were to try to take advantage of the WMD language to try to convince the public that this defendant was using a WMD in the usual narrow and scary sense of that phrase, there's really no harm in the situation in my view,"" he said. Chesney noted that in order for a prosecution for using WMD within the United States to be successful, at least one of four conditions relating to interstate or foreign commerce also needed to be proved against the defendant. In the case of the Boston bombings ""the easiest one to prove would be the impact-on-commerce condition -- there's just no real doubt that the bombing had a tremendously disruptive impact on interstate commerce,"" he said. Harvard Law School's Alan Dershowitz told CNN'S Becky Anderson he was surprised the WMD charge had been used against Tsarnaev. ""Everybody thought that the indictment would be under the federal terrorism statute,"" he said. ""Instead they charged him under a very rarely used statute involving explosion of weapons of mass destruction that result in the death of an individual."" Dershowitz said the charge put less emphasis on the intention behind the attack. ""Under the terrorism statute, you would have to, in effect, charge a jihadist or extreme Islamic motivation. Here you don't have to show any motivation at all,"" he said. ""So the government has made a decision not to charge this as a politically motivated crime."" U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Dean Boyd said the statute had been ""frequently used"" by the department. Among the recent examples cited by Boyd was the case of Saudi student Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari who was convicted and sentenced to life in 2012 for attempted use of a WMD. According to a departmental release, the charge followed Aldawsari's ""purchase of chemicals and equipment necessary to make an improvised explosive device (IED) and his research of potential U.S. targets."" The WMD law also applies to ""any national of the United States who, without lawful authority, uses or threatens, attempts, or conspires to use a weapon of mass destruction outside of the U.S.."" In March 2013, former U.S. soldier Eric Harroun was charged under this part of the statute for allegedly conspiring to use a rocket propelled grenade while fighting with an al Qaeda affiliated group in Syria. Read more: U.S. ex-soldier charged with using RPG . Jack Holland, lecturer in international relations at the University of Surrey, said that since 2002/2003, use of the term WMD had generally been ""political in use and political in implication."" WMD had been used to refer to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN), but the term had more recently been used for ""deliberate political reasons"" and broadened out, Holland said. ""It's increasingly just something explosive or destructive that makes the term so broad as to be meaningless,"" he said. ""In 2002, there weren't people talking about pressure cookers as WMDs."" In the build-up to the Iraq War, Holland said, the phrase was used strategically to create legitimacy for intervention. Reports out of the Bush Administration, he said, suggested that the need to combat a perceived WMD threat was something on which all of the ""coalition of the willing"" could agree. But he said the phrase had different connotations in the U.S. and Britain. Britain's then Prime Minister Tony Blair was a strident proponent of the argument, telling UK lawmakers that Hussein could launch a range of WMDs within 45 minutes. Read more: Blair adviser denies Iraq War intelligence 'sexed up' ""WMD was more controversial as a term and a rationale in the UK because Blair put more emphasis on the argument than [President George W.] Bush did,"" Holland said. This was because Blair needed to appeal to the British public with a ""legalistic, logical, pragmatic"" argument, he said, whereas Bush could ""employ a series of more emotive arguments"" and use WMD as a ""fallback argument to a far greater degree, because of American political culture."" ""Britons needed a 'pseudo-legalistic rationale',"" Holland said. ""It was about the 45-minute claim -- that was very much an argument that appealed peculiarly to the British,"" he said. ""Blair put all of his eggs in one basket with the WMD argument."" In Britain, the phrase was now tainted because of its political connotations that the administration had lied or had been just plain wrong. ""Now it's seen as a false premise for an unsuccessful intervention,"" Holland said. ""The strategic use of language to sell interventions to the public is an extremely long-standing phenomenon. More recently these arguments are ever more important for making the case for war,"" he said. ""There's a perceived need -- even if you've won an election -- to retain the image of speaking for a population,"" he said. ""To get the population onside is essential.""","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused of using explosives-filled pressure cookers as bombs .

"(Health.com) -- Progress in the fight against obesity, heart disease, and several other public-health scourges all but ground to a halt in the past year, although as usual a person's chances of being in good health varied widely by location, according to the latest state-by-state rankings of the nation's health. As they have in the past, northeastern states dominated the top of the rankings, while states in the southeastern United States were clustered at the bottom. Vermont -- with its low rate of infectious disease, high use of early prenatal care, and relative lack of violent crime -- was deemed the healthiest state for the second year in a row, followed by New Hampshire, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Massachusetts. The picture was far less bright across the nation as a whole, however. Increases in obesity, diabetes, and the percentage of children living in poverty are eroding the nation's health, and the gloomy economic situation is likely only compounding these problems, say public health experts who contributed to the report, known as America's Health Rankings. Health.com: The 10 most depressing states in the U.S. ""The economy, the despair that so many Americans are feeling, the anxieties, the tensions -- all of those things certainly could be leading people to make inappropriate behavioral choices,"" says Reed Tuckson, M.D., the chief of medical affairs for the Minneapolis-based health insurer UnitedHealth Group and a board member of the affiliated foundation that helped compile the rankings. For instance, Tuckson says, eating a healthy diet -- a challenge during the best of times -- requires even more thought and planning when families and individuals are on a tight budget. ""In a world where there's a $1 cheeseburger available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, everywhere, many people may be making those choices too often,"" he says. Health.com: States that consume too much fast food . The United Health Foundation has been publishing the annual state-by-state rankings since 1990, in conjunction with the American Public Health Association (APHA) and the Partnership for Prevention, a coalition of government, business, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to health promotion. The report collects data on 23 health and socioeconomic measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Census Bureau, and several other federal agencies. The measures include straightforward yardsticks of disease -- such as rates of diabetes, obesity, poor mental health, and deaths due to cancer and heart disease -- with data on societal factors known to influence health, such as the percentage of the population with health insurance or a high school diploma. Between 1990 and 2000, the overall health of the nation according to these combined measures improved by an average of 1.6% each year. After 2000, however, the upward trend slowed to 0.5% annually -- and this year there was no improvement at all. Health.com: U.S. cities with the worst air pollution . ""We really have had some stagnation in our health improvement over the last year,"" says Georges Benjamin, M.D., the executive director of the APHA, a professional organization for public health experts. ""One year a trend doesn't make, but it's something to think about."" The current report is based on figures from about a year ago, so it likely captures the early part of the economic downturn, Benjamin adds. At the other end of the scale from Vermont, Mississippi was again the unhealthiest state in the nation -- a spot it has held for the past decade, thanks in part to high rates of obesity, childhood poverty, and preventable hospitalizations. Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana rounded out the five least-healthy states. Health.com: The 50 fattiest foods in the states . The percentage of Americans who are obese rose from 26.9% to 27.5%, and the percentage of those with diabetes also edged upward, from 8.3% to 8.7%. If these trends continue, Tuckson says, one in five adults will have diabetes by 2050. Childhood poverty also is on the rise. Roughly 22% of U.S. children now live in poverty (which the Census Bureau defines as a four-person, two-child family making less than $22,113 a year), up from 16% a decade ago. And although children are more likely to have insurance coverage today than in the past, the opposite is true among adults, according to the report. There are some glimmers of good news, however: The percentage of American adults who smoke fell from 17.9% percent to 17.3% percent, for instance, and the number of preventable hospitalizations dropped from 82.5 to 68.2 per 1,000 Medicare enrollees. Health.com: The 10 states most addicted to smoking . Efforts to improve health in this country must focus on prevention, and should be tailored to individual states and communities, Benjamin says. ""Physical activity, nutrition, and tobacco: If we could get people focused on those three, we could take a huge bite out of the chronic disease epidemic,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Belgian police Thursday arrested a woman they called an ""al Qaeda living legend"" as part of an operation to thwart a terror attack being planned to coincide with an EU summit in Brussels, a Belgian police source told CNN. Malika El-Aroud is the widow of one of the men who killed Afghan anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. Police seized 14 people, one of whom was planning to carry out a suicide attack in Belgium, the source said. They had contacts at the ""highest levels of al Qaeda,"" the source said. The police source said officers ""had only 24 hours to act."" The leaders of the European Union's 27 member states are meeting in Brussels Thursday and Friday. It is not clear that the heads of state and government themselves were the target of the planned attack. The federal prosecutor's office in Belgium identified one of the suspects as Malika El-Aroud, the widow of one of the men who assassinated a key opponent of the Taliban in Afghanistan two days before September 11, 2001. El-Aroud's late husband was one of two men who killed Ahmed Shah Massoud, a leader of the Northern Alliance, in a suicide mission ordered by Osama Bin Laden. Belgian police aimed to prevent El-Aroud, whom the police source called an ""al-Qaeda living legend,"" from moving to Afghanistan to play a role in the fight against the coalition forces there, the source said. She is thought to be a recruiter for the anti-Western network, rather than a fighter, the source said. El-Aroud described the ""love"" she and her late husband felt for Osama bin Laden in a 2006 interview with CNN. ""Most Muslims love Osama. It was he who helped the oppressed. It was he who stood up against the biggest enemy in the world, the United States. We love him for that,"" she told CNN then. Gazing into CNN's cameras she said, ""It's the pinnacle in Islam to be the widow of a martyr. For a woman it's extraordinary."" ""Most of those arrested"" Thursday had Belgian passports, the police source said. All 14 are of Moroccan descent. Three of the suspects had traveled to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region to participate in fighting or training camps, and were in contact with an unnamed suspect who had direct links to important al Qaeda figures, police said. Two of those three returned to Belgium several months ago and started surveillance operations, and the third returned to Belgium a week ago, police said. Intelligence showed that third person was ready to carry out a suicide attack, police said. Information showed the suspect who was to carry out the attack had received the green light to execute the operation, police said. Investigators noted the suspect had said goodbye to his family ""because he wanted to go to paradise with a clear conscience,"" police said. Authorities also found a video meant for the suspect's family, which police said was probably a farewell tape. They did not find any explosives, the police said in a statement. The 14 suspects were arrested after police carried out 16 search warrants in Brussels and one in the western Belgian city of Liege. During those searches, police seized computer equipment and documents and the 14 people, including the three who traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and 11 others suspected of having given them logistical and material support. Police said their investigation has been under way intensively since the end of 2007. --CNN's Andrew Carey and Paula Newton contributed to this report.","Three suspects have alleged al Qaeda links, Belgian report says .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi helped Barcelona bounce back from Champions League heartache as he came off the bench to score twice against Real Betis on Sunday and edge the Catalan club closer to the Spanish title. The four-time world player of the year was an unused substitute in the 3-0 defeat by Bayern Munich in Wednesday's second leg of the semifinal at the Camp Nou, apparently not yet recovered from his hamstring problem. But he made an instant impact after coming on just before the hour mark against Betis, as David Villa was the man to make way straight after leveling the score at 2-2. The Argentina star curled in a superb free-kick on 59, then hit the crossbar with another set-piece before -- in the 70th minute -- finishing off a low cross from Alexis Sanchez, who had been put in space on the right by an exquisite backheel from Andres Iniesta. It put Barca 11 points clear of second-placed defending champions Real Madrid with four games to play, meaning victory at third-placed Atletico Madrid next Sunday will be enough to seal a 22nd domestic crown. Messi has now scored 60 goals this season, 46 of them in La Liga -- where he has found the net in his past 21 appearances. Barcelona had made the worst possible start as seventh-placed Betis took the lead in under two minutes through Colombia striker Dorlan Pabon, who scored his sixth goal since joining on loan in January. Sanchez equalized inside 10 minutes, heading his ninth league goal this season from Iniesta's cross, and Barca almost took the lead just before halftime when Cristian Tello smashed a shot against the underside of the bar -- the ball appeared to hit the line before bouncing to safety. However, Betis hit back with an even better effort as midfielder Ruben Perez -- on loan from Atletico Madrid -- fired in a piledriver from long range to give his side the lead at the interval. That lasted until the 55th minute, when Villa found space at the far post to nod in Dani Alves' right-wing cross before Messi took over. Sevilla moved up to eighth place with a 3-0 win over Espanyol that further dented the Barcelona-based side's faint hopes of European qualification. Real Zaragoza moved out of the bottom three with a 3-0 win that left Rayo Vallecano behind Sevilla on goal difference, while bottom club Mallorca drew 1-1 with midtable Levante.","Barcelona two points away from league title after Sunday's 4-2 win over Real Betis .

"(CNN) -- A wind of change blew through Hawaii Monday and thankfully it was gentle enough to allow the PGA's Tournament of Champions to finally get under way. For three days in a row the 30-strong field, all of whom won a PGA Tour event in 2012, had to sit idly by as play was canceled due to strong winds and driving rain. It led to the bizarre sight of Rickie Fowler officially starting the new campaign three times, after his first two attempts were derailed by the weather. But once the action began Dustin Johnson's detailed preparation for the competition showed, as his six practice rounds prior to teeing off in Maui helped him shoot rounds of 69 and 66 to lead on 11-under-par.

"(CNN) -- Justin Rose couldn't miss when he was part of Europe's triumphant Ryder Cup team last year but his putter let him down when his time came to force a playoff at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship. The Englishman's putt caught the lip but didn't drop meaning Jamie Donaldson was able to secure his second European Tour victory without the nerve-shredding tension of a head-to-head over an extra few holes. It took the 37-year-old Welshman 255 appearances to claim his maiden victory on the Tour -- at the Irish Open last year -- but only another 14 to land one of the most prestigious trophies on the circuit. Donaldson carded a four-under-par final round of 68 but he dropped a shot on the final hole, opening the door to Rose and Denmark's 23-year-old Thorbjorn Olesen, who was also one shot back. But both players missed with their birdie attempts to secure Donaldson a title he admitted he thought he had no chance of winning during a pro-am tournament at the course on Wednesday. ""It's pretty surreal,"" Donaldson said at the presentation. ""I played good golf all week, particularly today. I got away with murder up the last to be fair, but I'm very happy to be stood here with the trophy. ""It's a funny old game. I came during the week to play the pro-am and thought the course was too difficult. To be stood here holding the trophy is just mad. ""It was a nerve racking wait. I thought I hit a good putt on the last, I just misread it. I thought one of them would hole, if not both. I thought it was going to be a playoff, but when both slid by I knew it was my week."" Donaldson's impressive 2012 catapulted him to No. 47 in the world rankings -- he is set to climb higher with this latest triumph -- and secured him an invitation to the first major championship of the year, The Masters at Augusta in April. He carded five birdies in the opening 17 holes to overtake a stuttering Rose, who bogeyed three of his first 16. Rose, instrumental in Europe's Ryder Cup comeback at Medinah last October, struggled on the greens to relinquish his grip on the tournament. The lead was briefly held by England's David Howell, a member of Europe's winning Ryder Cup teams of 2004 and 2006, as he continued his resurgence having been 569th in the world rankings three years ago. But an inexplicable four-putt from four feet on the 13th saw him plummet down the leaderboard. In a sparkling round, Donaldson's only dropped shot came on the final hole, which opened the door to the chasing duo, but neither Rose nor Olesen could take advantage as they shared second place. Portugal's Ricardo Santos came fourth on 11-under while South Africa's Branden Grace was a shot further back on 10-under. Both Tiger Woods and world No. 1 Rory McIlroy failed to make the cut. Donaldson said he was delighted with his recent form, and to pick up another title so soon after his first triumph at the 2012 Irish Open. ""It's like buses I suppose, it took a while,"" he added. ""I had four years in wilderness if you like. To come through and win the Irish Open was fantastic and to top it off with this has been awesome."" As for his chances of winning the Masters he said: ""You never know in this game, like I say you are stood here thinking on Wednesday you've got no chance and here I am with the trophy. ""I've got to keep working hard and doing the things that enabled me to win this trophy.""","Welshman Jamie Donaldson usurps Justin Rose to win HSBC Abu Dhabi Golf Championship .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods kick started his 2013 season on his favorite golf course with a seven-under 65 Friday at Torrey Pines lifting him to the top of the leader board in the Farmers Insurance Open. Defying cold and wet conditions at La Jolla in California, the World No.2 carded a halfway total of 11-under 133 at the PGA Tour event. It left him two clear of fellow American Billy Horschel, who battled to a 69 on the more difficult South Course. Woods has won the tournament at the same venue six times and also famously claimed the 2008 U.S. Open, despite being handicapped by injury, . Woods, who began his campaign by missing the cut at at European Tour event in Abu Dhabi last week, the same fate befalling No.1 Rory McIlroy, showed that was a mere blip with inspired play on the easier North Course. Starting from the 10th, his round took off with a birdies on the 14th and 17th and an eagle on the 18th, set up by a superb iron approach. The American ace started his back nine with straight birdies and as the rain came down he continued his fine progress. Two birdies came in his final three holes, sandwiching his sole bogey on the day. Woods said he was delighted to have backed up his fine driving with good recovery play on the rare occasion he was off the fairway. ""I've got my short game back to where I want to have it,"" he said after his round. ""But there's a long way to go and this golf course is not going to get any easier with this rain,"" he added. He had opened his campaign with a four-under 68 on the tougher South Course as defending champion Brandt Snedeker shared the first round lead in the $6.1 million event after a 65 with Korea's' KJ Choi. Snedeker dropped back into the pack on four under while Choi was on six under after their second rounds. On the European Tour Friday, England's Chris Wood shot a brilliant 64 to take a three-shot lead into the final round of the Qatar Masters at the Doha Golf Club. Looking for his first victory on the Tour since turning pro in 2008, the 25-year-old Wood has the trio of compatriot Simon Khan, Swede Alexander and New Zealander Michael Campbell as his closest challengers going into Saturday's final round. Wood, he made his mark at the 2008 and 2009 British Opens eagled the 548-yard tenth to highlight his round. He has a three-round aggregate of 13 under-par 201. ""I'm very excited. I wouldn't say it was one of my best rounds, but I played very solidly and was giving myself loads of chances,"" he told the European Tour website. ""Obviously it's going to be hard.

"(CNN) -- Colin Montgomerie might have masterminded Europe's charge to wrest the Ryder Cup back from the United States in 2010 but a hat-trick of the continent's best players are adamant he should not be allowed to reprise his role. World No. 1 Rory McIlroy reiterated his support for 2012 vice captain Paul McGinley on the day he announced a new multi-year sponsorship deal with Nike. The 23-year-old -- a two-time major winner -- claimed Montgomerie would have ""nothing to gain"" from taking the job on again and his stance was backed by English pair Ian Poulter and Luke Donald. McGinley, a three-time Ryder Cup winner as a player, captained McIlroy at the Seve Trophy in 2009, when Great Britain and Ireland played against Continental Europe. ""It's something I feel quite strongly about; I feel Paul deserves his chance,"" McIlroy told CNN from Abu Dhabi. ""He's been vice captain a few times, he's holed the winning putt in the Ryder Cup. ""I played under him as a captain in the Seve Trophy a few years ago and thought he was the best captain I've ever played under. ""I think he's very deserving and I think it would almost be a little unfair if he didn't get it."" Earlier, at his Nike press conference, McIlroy said: ""I personally don't feel Monty has anything to gain over this. ""If we go to Gleneagles and lose, he's already a winning Ryder Cup captain. I'm fully behind Paul and I think Paul should get the job and hopefully he does."" Poulter was instrumental in Europe's comeback against the U.S. in the latest installment of the biannual team competition, as they recovered from a 10-6 deficit to retain the trophy in what was known as 'The Miracle of Medinah' in October. Donald delivered two vital points -- one in Saturday's fourballs and again in the crucial opening singles match against 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson. Along with McIlroy, both were instrumental in Montgomerie's winning turn at Celtic Manor in Wales in 2010 but none of the trio think the legendary Scot should be appointed again. It had seemed to be a straight battle between 2011 British Open champion Darren Clarke, and Irish compatriot McGinley, who both served as vice captains to Jose Maria Olazabal in Chicago. But when the Americans turned once again to Tom Watson, the last U.S. captain to triumph on European soil in 1993, Montgomerie's name began to circulate. Boulden: What kind of Nike poster boy will Rory McIlroy be? Ahead of the announcement on either Tuesday or Wednesday in Abu Dhabi, Montgomerie has emerged as favorite and the 49-year-old has confirmed he would do it again if asked. But Poulter took to micro-blogging site Twitter to say: ""Darren (Clarke) has taken his name out of the running for Ryder Cup captaincy. It would be fantastic to have Paul McGinley as the 2014 captain."" His view was shared by Donald, who became the first man to top the money lists on both the European and PGA Tour in 2011. He tweeted: ""I hope Paul McGinley gets his chance, he's been an amazing Vice Captain and deserves an opportunity."" The announcement will be made after a 15-man committee that includes Montgomerie, Clarke and McGinley meets to decide.","Rory McIlroy reiterates support for Paul McGinley in Ryder Cup captain race .

"(CNN) -- The deputy speaker of Britain's House of Commons said Sunday the allegations of rape and sexual assault leveled against him are false. Nigel Evans also said the incident has left him with ""a sense of incredulity"" because he considered the two accusers his friends. ""Yesterday I was interviewed by the police concerning two complaints - one of which dates back four years, made by two people who are well-known to each other, and who until yesterday I regarded as friends,"" he said in a statement. ""The complaints are completely false and I cannot understand why they have been made, especially as I have continued to socialise with one as recently as last week."" Evans was arrested Saturday in northwest England. Lancashire police did not confirm the identity of the man, but they said they had released a 55-year-old man on bail after questioning him Saturday over offenses alleged by two men in their 20s. One man alleged he was raped and, in a separate incident, another other man alleged he was sexually assaulted, a police spokesperson told CNN by telephone. The offenses are alleged ""to have been committed in Pendleton between July 2009 and March 2013,"" according to a statement released by police. The man was ordered to appear at the police station on June 19, according to the police spokesperson. British Prime Minister David Cameron has been made aware of the arrest, said another source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

"(CNN) -- Taken at face value, a Barack Obama presidency should be a big deal for Africa. On Election Day I attended an all-nighter organized in Lagos by the U.S. Diplomatic Mission to celebrate America's democracy. Two large screens relayed CNN's coverage while a succession of speakers -- including a recently re-elected Nigerian governor -- took to the stage to reflect on America and its democratic ideals. Outside the hall sat a mock polling booth, where guests filled a ballot paper and dropped it in a box, watched over by life-size cardboard cut-outs of the two contenders. In the early hours of the morning the results were tallied and announced. Obama took 219 Nigerian votes, to Mitt Romney's 30. A friend standing with me when the results were announced couldn't help wondering aloud who those 30 people were who had chosen Romney over Obama. As I pointed out in a recent CNN piece, Nigerians, like the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, have an ""instinctive fondness"" for Mr. Obama, and for an obvious reason: he is a ""son"" of the continent -- his father was born in Kenya; his grandmother still lives there. Just before I left the event, a friend observed that he still hadn't found a single Nigerian who could point to any reason why they were rooting for Obama, beyond his African roots. That obsession with Obama appears to obscure the fact that his predecessor -- the white, Republican George W. Bush -- demonstrated a more obvious commitment to the continent during his first presidential term. In 2003, a few months after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Bush signed into law a bill establishing the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), in fulfilment of a promise made during his State of the Union Address earlier that year. Under the terms of the plan, Bush pledged $15 billion towards fighting HIV/AIDS. In 2008 he renewed the commitment for another five years. Before him, President Bill Clinton -- honored by the Congressional Black Caucus, months after he left office, as America's ""first Black President"" -- created the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA), a landmark piece of legislation that opened up American markets to African countries. Obama, on the other hand, has demonstrated what has been interpreted as a studied detachment towards sub-Saharan Africa. His only visit in his first four years, to Ghana in 2009, lasted less than 24 hours. Dr. Folarin Gbadebo-Smith, Director of the Lagos-based Centre for Public Policy Analysis, argues that Obama is in a ""conflicted position"" -- compelled to exercise caution in his engagement with Africa ""for fear that such a position will become ammunition in the hands of the lunatic right, Tea Party types and those who insist he is not an American and is really a Muslim."" But if the affection of the continent towards Mr. Obama -- at an all time high in 2008 when he first took office -- has cooled in the last few years (ostensibly as a response to his perceived nonchalance), his re-election appears to have reawakened the enthusiasm. ""We look forward to the deepening of relations between our two countries during your second term in office,"" Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki said in a congratulatory message. From Nigeria came a message by a presidential spokesperson, saying ""President Jonathan looks forward to continuing to build on Nigeria and Africa's developmental collaboration with the United States in the next four years."" With the pressure of re-election now gone, Smith says ""the second term would be a more opportune time for Obama to work with Africa."" While Michelle Obama visited the continent in 2011, the least that many Africans will be expecting from Obama during his second term would be a powerfully symbolic visit of his own to Africa. But that trip, if it ever happens, would be the easiest of the Africa-focused tasks in the Oval Office in-tray. And it would also do little to clarify the monumental complexity of dealing with a rapidly changing African landscape. For one, there's China's aggressive engagement with the continent, which appears to be happening at the expense of countries like America. In 2009, Obama's first year in office, China overtook America as Africa's largest trading partner. America's discomfiture with that state of affairs bubbled to the surface most recently last August, when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, during a visit to Senegal, lamented that ""the days of having outsiders come and extract the wealth of Africa for themselves, leaving nothing or very little behind, should be over in the 21st century."" There is also the aftermath of the Arab Spring. The murder of the U.S. Ambassador to Libya is evidence of how much things have changed in the region in the last two years. And then there is the rise of extremist Islam in West Africa. In January 2009, Hillary Clinton told a U.S. Senate committee that ""combating al Qaeda's efforts to seek safe havens in failed states in the Horn of Africa"" would be a key part of America's Africa policy. The years since then have seen the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, and of extremists in Northern Mali. Last June, the White House unveiled a new sub-Saharan Africa strategy built around four ""objectives"": Democracy, Trade & Investment, Peace & Security, and Development. But it remains to be seen whether Obama will unveil an Africa project on a scale comparable to AGOA and PEPFAR. Not that he is obliged to, anyway. And with the American economy still in dire straits, and requiring full time attention, he is unlikely to get much backslapping at home for expending his energy on matters that have no direct bearing on America's near future. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Tolu Ogunlesi.","Obama, ""son"" of Africa, remains hugely popular on the continent .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League has retained its place as European football's most lucrative competition after revenues for the 2010/11 season increased by 12% to top £2.27 billion ($3.5 bn), according to a new report. But more than 80% of that increase was swallowed up by wages, which rose to £1.6 billion ($2.47 bn) and now make up 70% of the overall revenue, accountancy firm Deloitte said. The German Bundesliga remained the continent's most profitable league as operating profits rose to £154m ($238m), an increase of nearly a quarter on the previous year. In comparison, the Premier League's operating profits dropped by £16m ($24.8m) to £68m ($105m). Big-spending Man City top Premier League value table . Dan Jones, from the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: ""Top clubs in English football have continued to show impressive revenue growth despite a difficult economic climate. ""Premier League clubs' revenues increased by 12% in 2010/11, driven by broadcast revenue increasing by 13% to £1,17 bn ($1.8 bn) in the first year of a new three year broadcast cycle. ""This uplift was primarily due to an increase in overseas broadcast deal values, demonstrating once again the Premier League's unrivaled global popularity. "" Hugely popular it may be but with the Premier League again breaking a new record for spending on transfer fees, it will soon have to confront UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. Soccer's European governing body introduced FFP, which began its monitoring phase last season, to break the cycle of huge debts and force clubs to spend no more than they earn. The rules are also designed to prevent wealthy owners writing off big debts through their personal fortunes, like at Chelsea, where Russian owner Roman Abramovich has pumped in £819m ($1.2 bn), according to Deloitte. Adam Bull from Deloitte, said: ""Despite the increase in revenue generated by Premier League clubs, operating profits reduced by £16m ($24.8m) to £68m ($105m) in 2010/11 and combined pre-tax losses were £380m ($588m). ""Gross transfer spending by Premier League clubs increased by 38%, from £210m ($325m) to a record level of £769m ($1.1 bn). The challenge for clubs remains converting impressive revenue growth into sustainable profits. ""This will become even more important for a number of clubs as the financial results for 2011/12 will, for the first time, count towards their UEFA Financial Fair Play break-even calculation."" Although the net debt of Premier League clubs did fall to its lowest level since 2006, half of the 20 teams reported an increase in losses. Brand power: Football's most valuable clubs unveiled . But thanks to a large upgrade in facilities over the past decade the Premier League's clubs recorded an increase in their fixed assets to almost £1.9 billion ($2.9 bn). Paul Rawnsley, director in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said many Premier League clubs would have to make significant adjustments to meet FFP. ""This is the cornerstone of UEFA's financial fair play regulations which aim to help clubs across Europe achieve a more sustainable balance between their costs and revenues and encourages investment for the longer term benefit of football. ""A significant number of clubs around Europe have some distance to travel on the road towards compliance. ""For many clubs there is a renewed focus on increasing revenues and the cost-side of the business model of some clubs also needs adapting. ""Overall, we expect the effective implementation of these measures, at both domestic and international levels, will help deliver a better balance between clubs' costs and revenues.""","Report from accountancy firm Deloitte shows Premier League revenues rising rapidly .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- A colorful platter steams with heat, rising from seasoned fish and an assortment of fresh vegetables all on a plush bed of rice. This is Senegal's national dish and recently my task for ""Inside Africa"" was to search for its origins, prepare the ingredients and taste a sample of the West African culture. What I discovered were firm family bonds, handmade artwork and a flavorful surprise. So let's rewind. Africa's westernmost nation hugs the North Atlantic coastline and for generations, life in the sea has sustained life on land. Soumbedioune, one of the many fishing beaches of Dakar, is illustrative of this symbiotic bond. As I walk its crowded sandy shoreline, narrow wooden boats approach from the horizon. Men darkened by hours at sea hop out of the brightly colored vessels. Yellow, red, green, white, all dance along the hull in bold fashion revealing a variety of circular designs. These traditional boats are hand painted and crafted by teams of men working in this busy fishing community. See also: Taking a look inside Zambia . In fact, as I watch with confusion at the apparent chaos around me, a methodical process emerges. Young boys run up to the boats, placing rollers underneath as the men hand off large coolers of fresh fish, proceeding to push the boat inland. The boys, typically sons or nephews of the fishermen, then wheel or carry the coolers to the women in the family waiting on the beach nearby. But this is no leisurely endeavor. The women work as a sort of broker for their husbands, displaying the best catch prominently. I hear empassioned sales pitches in French as they try to attract restaurant vendors and others searching for a good price for buying in bulk. The entire process happens in two waves each and every day, each family member with their own essential role. I learned not to get in the way either. As I snap pictures of the frenetic scene around me a woman approaches, holds up her hands, reaches for my camera and wags her finger. I don't understand a single French word she's saying but the message is clear: ""Don't take my picture or I will take your camera."" I smile, apologize in broken French and move on. Fish is the primary component of ""Thiebou Jen,"" Senegal's national dish. Later I meet with local chef Ishmail N'Dour as he walks me through a Dakar market showing me what it takes to bring all the flavors together. The key is to only use the best, freshest vegetables; because they will become a stuffing for the fish. How is that stuffing made? With hard labor, I can tell you. See also: Sights and sounds of Sahara . Once we return to N'Dour's seaside restaurant, he hands me a deep wooden pot with a long, rounded, wooden handle. He tosses coriander (cilantro), onions, peppers and spices inside, telling me to get to work. I mash, push, pound and pulverize for 30 minutes, breaking a sweat. This type of food preparation is common in Senegal with each member of the family taking on one important role in the food preparation. N'Dour prepares and slices the fish into smaller portions each with a slit ready for the stuffing. The mashed vegetables are slimy in my hand, a testament to my good work, I think. I push them in each chuck of fish. N'Dour continues to cook the fish with vegetables inside, as well as surrounded by an assortment of carrots, potatoes and more. Hours later when he serves it, the taste is divine, far superior to anything I've ever cooked. The appearance may look quite messy but as I've learned in Dakar looks can be deceiving. This is a culture that begs for closer inspection, something that reveals strong family bonds, a stubbornness for good quality and vibrant, tasty cuisine.","CNN's Errol Barnett traveled to Senegal to find out secrets of its national dish .

"(CNN) -- Charlie Beljan ended 2012 on an incredible high after a fairytale first victory on the PGA Tour, but his hopes of capitalizing on that breakthrough win have been blown away in the season-opener in Hawaii. The U.S. golfer overcame a debilitating panic attack in Florida to qualify for the 30-man Tournament of Champions, returning to the course at Disney World after being taken to hospital. However, the traditional curtain-raiser for the elite U.S. circuit has yet to get going, with high winds and rain causing play to be canceled on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The $5.7 million event has been reduced from four rounds to three, with 36 holes to be played on Monday and the final 18 on Tuesday. Beljan: I thought I was going to die . If the wind continues to blow, even that is looking unlikely. Organizers face the prospect of it being reduced to ""unofficial"" status if only two rounds are possible -- while a cut to 18 holes would mean none of the purse counts for the 2013 money list. PGA Tour chief of operations Andy Pazder said the forecast is improving, with winds due to drop from nearly 50 miles per hour (80 kph) to 25-30 mph (40-50 kph). ""It's the gusts that creep up above 40 that have knocked us out. We had registered gusts up to 48 mph right before we suspended play today,"" Pazder told the PGA Tour website on Sunday. ""Somewhere in the low 40s is what puts us out of business."" While players actually got out on the course on Saturday and Sunday, they were left frustrated as balls blew off their tees and disappeared off putting greens after being placed. ""They have not mowed the greens in two days and the wind is still blowing balls off the green,"" Beljan wrote on Twitter. ""Brutal been in Hawaii for a week and still have not played a competitive round of golf."" English golf star Ian Poulter also took to Twitter after being accused of taking too long over a putt by NBC commentator Johnny Miller. ""Oh that was why I was taking a while.

"New York (CNN) -- Jacob Stevens scrambled to new wife Clara's side moments after she was struck by a car and whispered desperate entreaties for her to live. But in his heart, he knew that Clara Heyworth, 28, would soon die. Blood from a wound on her head was spilling onto the road, Stevens said, and it was clear that she was seriously injured. ""I don't think anyone can fix this,"" Stevens told friends that morning. ""We all know this can't be fixed."" A lawsuit filed Monday in Brooklyn federal court claims that the driver of the car that struck Heyworth was intoxicated, speeding and violating other traffic laws. But the civil suit -- which names the driver, Anthony Webb, and the New York City Police Department -- is far from open-and-shut. ""The New York City Police Department is legally required to investigate traffic accidents if there is a serious injury, but their current policy is not to do so,"" said a statement from Stevens, who is a plaintiff in the case along with his late wife's estate. ""They canceled their investigation into the crash that killed Clara that very night, destroying crucial evidence, and they've also failed to investigate hundreds of other similar cases."" The suit goes further, saying that rather than being a random lapse, the handling of Heyworth's case is consistent with an entrenched policy within the NYPD of failing to meaningfully investigate cyclist and pedestrian incidents crashes except when the victim's death is certain. ""NYPD systematically misclassifies vehicular crimes as 'accidents,' creating a false appearance of declining crime rates while motorists like Webb escape consequences,"" according to the lawsuit. Efforts to seek comment from the department and from Webb have been unsuccessful. The City of New York's law department has said they will review the case thoroughly once the legal papers are formally served. 'Likely to die' At the heart of the issue is a seemingly simple phrase: ""Likely to die."" When traffic crashes result in death, and sometimes when death is imminent, a specialized squad within the NYPD called the Accident Investigation Squad -- trained to perform a comprehensive canvas of the scene -- is called in to investigate. ""A sergeant or a lieutenant makes a determination after consultation with the doctors -- say, at the hospital to keep it simple -- that there is a likelihood (of death),"" said John Cassidy, executive officer of the NYPD Transportation Bureau, at a City Council hearing in February. ""At that point, the accident investigation technicians ... respond to the location, and they begin the examination of the scene."" The problem, according to Steve Vaccaro, Stevens' attorney, is that the NYPD has substituted a more restrictive and ill-defined standard of ""likely to die."" ""It is left to untrained officers, given no guidance as to what 'likely to die' means, to obtain a prognosis for the victim from emergency room personnel completely engrossed in saving the victim's life,"" Vaccaro said. Meanwhile, ""the decision of whether to gather and preserve evidence of how the crash occurred hangs in the balance."" The lawsuit says Webb's vehicle allegedly struck Heyworth just before 2 a.m. July 10 at an intersection in Brooklyn. ""I can still hear the screech of his brakes and the sound of the impact,"" said Stevens, who was steps away but has no visual memory of the accident. ""My friends saw the tire marks that (the car) left all over the road."" By 2:06 a.m., an officer who had arrived on the scene, according to the lawsuit, radioed that Heyworth ""may be likely"" to die. Two minutes after that, the officer asked for an Accident Investigation Squad detective to respond to the scene. Then, at 2:59 a.m., while Heyworth was being rushed to Bellevue Hospital, the Accident Investigation Squad inquiry was called off. ""Police canceled the investigation because Heyworth was still alive,"" Vaccaro said. ""No doctor was at that point willing to say she was likely to die."" Doctors later estimated that Heyworth was effectively brain dead when her head hit the pavement, so it is unclear why the Accident Investigation Squad inquiry was never started, Stevens said. Despite that, doctors at Bellevue offered an operation to save Heyworth's life, with the caveat that her quality of life would be questionable. Even if it succeeded, Stevens said, it was not clear whether she would regain normal functioning. ""The surgeon said, 'I need your guidance here,' "" he said. ""I was asked, in other words, whether to let her die or to bear the risk of her being severely brain damaged."" Stevens gave the go-ahead for the operation, but despite doctors' efforts, Heyworth died. This is where the ""likely to die"" policy -- which is a departure from state traffic law in which an investigation is triggered, at minimum, in the event of serious injury -- becomes murky for families of victims clamoring for an investigation. ""If Clara had survived that operation but come out of it severely brain damaged, what would NYPD's position be?"" Stevens asked. ""That they were right to cancel their investigation since she hadn't actually died?"" Three days after Heyworth's death, the Accident Investigation Squad opened an investigation of her case -- an act Stevens says came way too late to collect crucial evidence. Accidents or criminal acts? Vaccaro says that in many cases involving cyclists or pedestrians versus vehicles, deference is given to drivers, and the tendency is to treat them as accidents rather than potentially criminal acts. ""As a civilized society, we cannot classify every accident as lightning bolts from an angry God,"" Vaccaro said. ""These cases have causes that are understood and have to be investigated."" The lack of Accident Investigation Squad presence on the night of the crash meant Webb would probably not be criminally charged. ""I'm horrified that they canceled their investigation that night,"" Stevens said. ""I'm angry about the fact that this not only applies to Clara and myself, but that there seems to be a policy not to investigate violent road deaths in New York City."" What Stevens hopes to gain from the lawsuit is, of course, justice. But on a broader level, he wants the NYPD to make it the rule of law to investigate these cases. ""I want to see the law followed and for every case of serious injury or death on the road to be properly investigated,"" Stevens said. ""I want the police to solve the crimes that people want solved.""

"(CNN) -- A Minnesota man arrested after investigators found weapons and explosives in his home was scheduled to appear in federal court in St. Paul Monday afternoon. Buford ""Bucky"" Rogers was arrested Friday after a search of his Montevideo, Minnesota, home turned up several explosives including Molotov cocktails and a suspected pipe bomb, according to the affidavit written by an FBI agent. The agent said firearms also were discovered including a Romanian AK-M assault rifle. Rogers, a convicted felon, was arrested on a charge of illegally possessing a gun. ""The FBI believes that a terror attack was disrupted by law enforcement personnel and that the lives of several local residents were potentially saved,"" the FBI said in a press release. However, several law enforcement officials played down the possible threat. One law enforcement official said the suspect in the case had anti-government views and called the case a domestic terrorism investigation. The official added this is not a matter involving any international terrorism groups such as al Qaeda. According to court documents, Rogers told investigators he had fired the assault rifle at a gun range on two separate occasions. The court papers say Rogers, 24, is a felon legally barred from possessing firearms because he was convicted of third-degree burglary in 2011. The documents do not provide any information on what Rogers allegedly intended to do with the explosives and guns. There also is no mention of what led law enforcement officers to search Rogers' home.","The FBI says it believes a terror attack was disrupted .

"(CNN) -- When Chris Wood turned professional in 2009, he came agonizingly close to winning a major title in his rookie season -- but it's been tough going since then. The English golfer finished tied for third at that year's British Open after missing out on victory at his final hole, having been fifth the previous season as the leading amateur. Now he has finally tasted success on the European Tour, landing a spectacular eagle on the last hole to claim the Qatar Masters on Saturday. He headed off veteran Sergio Garcia and South African George Coetzee by one stroke to earn the â‚¬310,917 ($418,000) first prize, thanks to a 202-yard six iron over the water that finished 10 feet from the hole. ""There's an enormous weight lifted off my shoulders today. I feel like I can go on and win more,"" said Wood, whose only other professional win came at the OneAsia Tour-sanctioned Thailand Open last year. ""I knew it was going to be hard no matter how I played -- winning on The European Tour is not easy. ""I've been knocking on the door in previous times and it's not happened. To get it today, to get my first win, it's such an honor. I'm so pleased."" The 25-year-old had led by three shots going into the final round, but then dropped two off the pace after the opening nine holes to bring back memories of losing tournaments in 2010 and 2011 on the last day. ""I've seen a few mates picking up trophies and I've been waiting patiently for my time.

"(CNN) -- The 2013 Australian Open will boast the biggest prize pool in the history of tennis, organizers announced Tuesday. The increase of $4.12 million will see players compete for their share of a record $31.1 million in January's tournament in Melbourne. ""We are proud to announce this major increase in prize money,"" Tennis Australia chief executive Steve Wood told the official website of the grand slam event. ""We have led the world in prize money for these incredible athletes and we want to ensure that the Australian Open continues to make a major contribution to the financial well being of professional tennis players."" Wood revealed that officials will seek the views of ATP Tour players regarding the breakdown of the prize purse to make sure lower ranked players received greater compensation for their efforts. Tournament director Craig Tiley said he would meet leading players Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in Shanghai this weekend to discuss the issue, which had prompted reports of a possible player boycott of the opening grand slam of the season.

The move, which has been in the works for months, could be announced as early as this week. It will apply to as many as 50 YouTube channels, people familiar with the plan say. Viewers will be able to subscribe to each channel for as little as $1.99 a month. The subscription service will enable channel operators to produce different content, such as TV shows and films, a person familiar with the plan said. Advertising on YouTube and rival video sites has risen fast, but remains a fraction of television budgets. Digital video advertising will jump from $2.93bn to $4.14bn in 2013, eMarketer estimates, but will account for just 2.4 per cent of all ad spending. YouTube claims the lion's share of that revenue. Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research estimates that YouTube's ad revenues will rise from $1.3bn in 2012 to $2bn this year and Bernstein Research said on Friday that its revenues could exceed $15bn ""in the next several years"", roughly matching CBS or Viacom. YouTube told the Financial Times that it had ""nothing to announce"" regarding channel subscriptions but was ""looking into creating a subscription platform that could bring even more great content to YouTube for our users to enjoy and provide our creators with another vehicle to generate revenue from their content, beyond the rental and ad-supported models we offer"". YouTube's channel partners include Howcast, World Wrestling Entertainment, The Onion and Machinima -- a network for gamers. It is unclear which channels have signed on to the new service. Cable and satellite channels, which traditionally rely on a dual revenue stream model, are eyeing YouTube's subscription service to generate revenue from older shows and new programming, according to another person familiar with the project. YouTube has moved away from its early days as a destination for user-generated content to professionally produced video that would not look out of place on television. In the past 18 months it has spent more than $200m on advances to dozens of start-up channels. The new channels have helped expand YouTube's audience to 1bn users who watch 6bn hours of video each month. Every one of Ad Age's 100 largest brands has advertised on the site. ""We're seeing a myriad of brands increasing their media spend,"" said Robert Kyncl, global head of content partnerships for YouTube. Time Warner, The Chernin Group, Bertelsmann, Discovery Communications and Comcast have all invested in companies that create or aggregate YouTube content. Traditional media companies are also eyeing audiences flocking to individual YouTube channels: DreamWorks Animation, the company behind the Shrek movies, this week acquired Awesomeness TV, a ""teen-focused"" YouTube network in a deal that could be worth $117m if earnings targets are met. Subscription YouTube channels will compete with the likes of Netflix, the streaming service with more than 30m subscribers, and Hulu, owned by Walt Disney, News Corp and Comcast, which said last week it had surpassed 4m. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Google on verge of unveiling subscription service for YouTube's specialist video channels .

"(CNN) -- They've earned admiration around the world for their on-court prowess, not to mention the enviable sum of more than $160 million in prize money between them. Now the ""Big Four"" of the men's tennis world have helped negotiate a pay rise for their lower-ranked colleagues. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have joined forces to convince Wimbledon chiefs to increase the prize money for this year's tournament to £16.1 million ($25.9 million). It's a 10% increase on last year's £14.6 million ($23.5 million) total, representing the biggest rise in 19 years. The largest slice of the cash will go to players making an early exit in late June, with first-round singles losers to each scoop £14,500 ($23,400) -- up 26.1% on last year. The singles champions, meanwhile, will see their prize money rise by just 4.5%, though this will still leave them with a tidy sum of £1.15 million ($1.85 million) each. Djokovic won the men's title last year to become the new world No. 1, while Petra Kvitova will also be defending her title in London. Every round of the grass-court tournament will see increases, with those in the quarterfinals enjoying a rise of 5.5% to £145,000 ($233,720). The decision aims to quell growing grumblings within the sport over the amount of money being offered to lesser players who are failing to meet rising costs. Those knocked out in the earlier rounds are increasingly struggling to cover travel costs or employ a regular coach, and there had been rumors of players preparing a strike in protest. However this was denied by chairman of the host All England Club, Phillip Brook. The Wimbledon chief said the decision followed a meeting with the Big Four at Indian Wells last month. He insisted the issue of strikes was never discussed. ""Wimbledon continues to be successful and we are delighted to share that success with the players by increasing total prize money by 10%, the largest increase since 1993,"" he said. ""At the same time, we appreciate the need to help players meet the rising costs associated with professional tennis, so the majority of the record £1.5 million increase will be distributed to those who are knocked out in the early rounds of the championships."" Wimbledon follows the lead of the French Open, which last month increased its overall prize purse by 7% to $24.6 million. Similarly, the biggest rise went to first-round losers, who picked up a 20% boost -- a prize of $23,670. In comparison, singles champions at Roland Garos scored an increase of 4.17%, giving them total prizes of $1.64 million each. The pressure will now be on the two other grand slams to follow suit. Growing unrest started at last year's U.S. Open, where Murray and Nadal were particularly vocal about the uneven distribution of prize money. The New York event's singles champions earn $1.8 million and first-round knockouts get $19,000. At January's Australian Open, title winners earned $2.37 million each, compared with $21,500 for players who lost at the first hurdle.","'Big Four - Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray - secure prize rise .
