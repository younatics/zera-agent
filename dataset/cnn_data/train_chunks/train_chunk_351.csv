"(CNN) -- Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott set social media abuzz on Monday with a memorable slip of the tongue. ""No one -- however smart, however well-educated, however experienced -- is the suppository of all wisdom,"" Abbott told a Liberal Party event in the city of Melbourne. A suppository is ""a small piece of medicated substance, usually conical, ovoid, or cylindrical, introduced into a body passage, as the rectum or vagina, where body heat causes it to melt,"" according to Webster's New World College Dictionary. Not quite the same as a repository (a place in which things may be placed for safekeeping), the word typically used in the expression ""the repository of all wisdom."" Abbott's unwitting switch of the two words both shocked and amused his audience. ""There was an audible gasp in the room, a few people snickering,"" said Jonathan Swan, a political reporter for Fairfax Media who was at the event. As news of Abbott's unfortunate utterance filtered out, social media users quickly seized on the gaffe. The hashtag #suppository began trending on Twitter in Australia. And people couldn't resist exploiting the situation's comic and crude potential. ""Oh dear. Abbott - ""we are not the 'suppository"" of all wisdom.' Not sure where to stick this one,"" wrote Marcus Priest, a political reporter for the Australian Financial Review. 'I feel sorry for Abbott & his accidental use of the word suppository. Stop going on like he's the enema,"" quipped Felicity Reynolds, the head of a non-governmental organization in Sydney. It's not the kind of coverage Abbott's aides will have been hoping for ahead of national elections next month. The night before, he had been engaged in a televised debate with his key opponent, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Labor. As of Monday evening, Abbott hadn't joined in the Twitter flurry his malapropism had caused. He's not the first Australian politician whose words have caused a stir on social media during this election campaign. Stephanie Banister, a 27-year-old welder running for a seat in Rankin, Queensland, unleashed a series of blunders during an interview, including referring to Islam as a country. Her comments went viral and on Saturday, she withdrew from the race, citing threats to her family.","""No one ... is the suppository of all wisdom,"" Tony Abbott says at an event .

"(CNN) -- UEFA president Michel Platini repeated his support for moving the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to the winter Friday with a sideswipe at the English Premier League (EPL) who are opposed to the change of date. Platini, who heads Europe's governing body, has previously gone on record to call for a switch from the summer when temperatures soar in the Gulf region. FIFA is set to discuss the issue at an executive committee meeting in October, its president Sepp Blatter indicating recently he was in favor of change to the schedule. ""I was very happy to learn that FIFA president Joseph Blatter wants to move the 2022 World Cup to the winter, something I've long advocated,"" said Platini, who was addressing the media in Monaco as the Europa League draw was made. ""It's impossible to play in 50-degree heat in Qatar in the summer. We have to play the World Cup at the best time,"" Platini added. But the change to a winter date has been met with opposition from the major European leagues, with the EPL the most outspoken. Its chief executive Richard Scudamore said switching the World Cup was ""well nigh impossible,"" citing disruption to the calendar and the impact on lucrative television deals. Platini said he was unimpressed by those arguments. ""For 150 years, England has imposed its calendar and we've respected it. ""So for once, for one month, England could respect another calendar,"" he added. FIFA's executive committee meets in Zurich on October 3-4 to approve any change and begin a consultation with key stakeholders such as the EPL. Qatar won the right to host the tournament in December 2010, beating the United States in the final round of bidding. South Korea, Japan and Australia were also in the running. Platini was among the executive committee members to vote in favor of bring the global showpiece to the Middle East for the first time.","Michel Platini repeats call for 2022 World Cup to be played in winter .

"(CNN) -- What started as an expose of the harassment women face in public has turned into fodder for death- and rape threats against the woman in the viral video. ""There are people who've said a lot of things, but I'm not reading what they are saying,"" Shoshana Roberts told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night. ""We hit a nerve."" Roberts didn't say a word as she walked through the streets of Manhattan for 10 hours for the video. She didn't have to. How should men approach women? Over 100 passersby spoke up with catcalls and phrases such as, ""God bless you mami,"" ""Damn!"" and ""Hey, look it there!"" ""My nonverbal cues were saying, 'Don't talk to me.' No eye contact. No friendly demeanor,"" she said. ""But they were ignoring my nonverbal cues."" Accurate depiction . Roberts said the video is an accurate depiction of what she faces daily. For instance, there was a time when her grandfather died ""and someone told me that they liked the way I looked."" ""It is all day long. It is every day,"" she said. ""That's a typical day... It doesn't matter what you wear."" Where are the white men in the catcalling video? The 10 hours of footage was edited down to a 1:56 public service announcement for the anti-street harassment group Hollaback! It was shot by filmmaker Rob Bliss, who was wearing a hidden camera in his backpack. ""I have multiple experiences of sexual assault, which is why I wanted to be involved in this project,"" Roberts said in a separate interview with HLN. Scary feeling . Perhaps the most nerve-racking part of the video was when a man started walking alongside Roberts and continued following her for five minutes. ""I have been doing martial arts since I was nine, and I have a black belt in tae kwon do ... and I am scared,"" Roberts told Cooper. The video has been viewed more than 12 million times on YouTube. Despite numerous threats of violence against Roberts, many have been supportive. ""@ShoshanaBinya thank you for participating in that hollaback video, too many women go through the same thing,"" @Andrea_Misho said on Twitter. 'It needs to stop' Street harassment disproportionately impacts women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals and young people, Hollaback! says on its website. ""Although the degree to which Shoshana gets harassed is shocking, the reality is that the harassment that people of color and LGBTQ individuals face is oftentimes more severe and more likely to escalate into violence,"" the group said. Roberts said she's perplexed by why so many people harass when there is seldom a good outcome. ""I don't know what they expect people to do,"" she said. ""I mean, this is happening to so many women, and my story is not unique."" ""It needs to stop,"" she added. ""We can change hearts and minds.""

"London (CNN) -- When LEGO released a set of figures collectively called the Research Institute -- featuring a scientist, astronomer and a palaeontologist -- it sold out worldwide within a few days. Why the fuss about a few tiny plastic people? Because they are all female professionals. Previously, LEGO fans could only create professional females by building them out of existing parts. The only female figures supplied by LEGO fed into traditional stereotypes: Women hanging around the house, going to the beach or playing with pets. But then in January seven year old Charlotte Benjamin penned a letter that went viral, criticizing the company for the lack of professional female LEGO figures. ""All the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs, even swam with sharks,"" she wrote. This month, Charlotte got her researchers -- although LEGO said it was already developing the new female figures at the time of the letter. Scientist Ellen Koojiman first submitted the idea for all-female LEGO set to the company's website on 2012. She managed to get 10,000 supporters for her proposal, which was eventually turned into the new product by LEGO. ""As a female scientist I had noticed two things about the available LEGO sets: a skewed male/female minifigure ratio and a rather stereotypical representation of the available female figures,"" she wrote in the pitch. LEGO is now the world's top toy maker, after overtaking Mattel, the maker of Barbie. Its chief executive, Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, told CNN the company wants to expand in Asia and was eyeing markets such as China. ""The idea of the LEGO brand resonates really well with the Chinese consumers,"" Knudstorp said. ""They are highly focused on creativity, learning, education, and at the same time recognize that learning trough play is a unique way of learning, which is in many ways much more powerful,"" he added. LEGO has targeted the female market before, with its LEGO Friends set designed for young girls released in December 2011. The set, which revolved around close friends and featured a bakery, pet salon and juice bar, was criticized for pandering to gender stereotypes.

"(CNN) -- For the past five years, Austria-based art historian and photographer Alfred Weidinger has traveled across Africa in search of royalty. His photography project, The Last Kings of Africa, is his attempt to capture the beauty and mystique of the region's most powerful sovereigns. So far he has photographed 220 tribal kings and leaders, with many more to go. ""I have a sort of deadline for myself -- which is the end of next year. It's not a question of the amount of kings or tribal leaders, it's just a question of countries,"" says Weidinger, who plans to visit Africa twice this year and six times in 2015. ""There are still countries I definitely want to visit, for example Swaziland and the southern part of Sudan."" Weidinger's photographic endeavors in Africa started in 1979 but the cumbersome equipment typical to that era quickly deterred the photographer. Fast forward 30 years, and a chance commission for a photographic exhibition sparked a long-term project where the lavish culture of Africa's dynasties became the focus. Weidinger had no definitive guide to help him locate all of Africa's royals and tribal leaders. Armed with only two cameras and a tripod, his trips were mostly improvised. ""There is no list, there is nothing! So you just have to go there,"" says Weidinger. ""The most important thing is to find one king -- when I have one, he will guide me to the others."" The power game . There are hundreds of African monarchies scattered across the continent but in most cases governing power is either restricted or nonexistent. Government officials, however, know it's best not to overlook the influence these leaders possess over their respective communities. ""Some countries put the monarch system back into the constitution, they give power to the traditional leaders,"" says Weidinger. ""In effect, some politicians use it because every tribal leader (represents) an ethnic group and they still follow the words of the elder or the tribal leader, they are not following what is happening with the politicians in the capital."" According to Richard Dowden, the director of The Royal African Society and author of Africa: Authored States, Ordinary Miracles, monarchies tend to flourish in countries with a weak government structure or lacking a formal constitution. In these instances, tribal leaders and monarchs are deemed more trustworthy for getting things done. Niger, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso and Benin are a few examples of countries with a strong tribal leaders, some of whom occasionally tackle government functions. Fon Ndofoa Zofoa III, for example, makes official decisions over hereditary land in his chiefdom in Babungo in Cameroon. Other leaders, like Sarauniya Aljima, the queen of Lougou in Niger, weigh in on private matters, such as marriage. ""When there is a marriage to be made (in the village, monarchs) will return to sort it out. In these sorts of matters, they do retain a lot of power,"" says Dowden. Weidinger found that one thing that seems to distinguish African monarchs from royals across the globe is a keen religious focus: . ""Their power is in spirituality and this makes (African monarchs) so unique."" The danger of cell phones . Weidinger says that in his opinion, the biggest threat to Africa's last remaining monarchs isn't local government, but modernity. Though poised in luxurious cloths and perched on gilded thrones, the threat of globalization has disturbed the influence and social standing of many of Wedinger's subjects. ""When you come to a region and you see that they are working with mobile phones, it's a kind of sign. If you see mobile phones you definitely know that it's a dying ethnic group. African culture is changing, there are changes in communication. People are going to the capitals and living where there is no need for a king anymore,"" he says, adding that cell phones have made people living in rural communities less isolated. Now, the problems they would typically raise with their community leaders they can take to experts further afield. Dowden, however, thinks these monarchs will retain their power for a while yet. ""I think the chiefs will survive,"" he says. ""Depending on how local governments in Africa develop, they'll either become figures for tourists or they'll continue to play a very important role.""","Photographer Alfred Weidinger is traveling across Africa to capture the continent's last remaining monarchs .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's government has called off talks with pro-democracy protesters, as political rivals repeated calls for leader C.Y. Leung to resign -- this time over claims that he accepted multi-million dollar private payments while in office. The government negotiator, Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam announced the cancellation of talks Thursday, hours after protest leaders encouraged supporters to keep up their occupation of city streets. ""We cannot accept the linkage of dialog with occupying activities,"" Lam said, prompting protest groups to announce the official start of a ""non-cooperation"" movement, and new calls for supporters to pack the main protest site ""beyond its capacity"" on Friday night. Earlier on Thursday, political rivals rounded on Leung after a report by Australia's Fairfax Media that he received $6.4 million ($HK50 million) in undisclosed payouts from Australian engineering group UGL while in office. According to the report, Leung signed the contract in December 2011, entitling him to payouts from UGL, which had recently bought the assets of Leung's employer, troubled British property agent DTZ. Months after the deal was signed, Hong Kong's 1,200-member Election Committee appointed Leung as chief executive of the Special Administrative Region of China. Two payments of $3 million (HK$25 million) were allegedly made in 2012 and 2013, during the time Leung was in office. In a statement on Thursday, both UGL and Leung's office defended the contract, calling it a ""standard non-poach, non-compete arrangement."" Payments were staggered over a two-year period to ensure Leung complied with both obligations, UGL said. UGL said at the time the company ""specifically did not want Mr Leung working with a competitor nor establishing or assisting in the establishment of a business competing directly with DTZ."" It added that media reports referring to ""secret payments"" were ""baseless and misleading."" ""UGL was under no obligation, legal or otherwise, to disclose the agreement,"" it said. UGL said its bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland, was aware of the payments, and the total DTZ sale price was reduced to reflect them. Claims ""outrageous"" However, Leung's rivals in the Legislative Council described the claims as ""alarming"" and called for Leung to make a ""full and frank disclosure."" ""I don't think the Hong Kong people or our constitution would allow the chief executive, which is the head of the executive authorities, to have another job and to have an agreement to help a company -- this is outrageous,"" said Emily Lau, Chair of Hong Kong's Democratic Party. Lau said members of the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's governing body, would seek to launch an investigation into the payments. But she acknowledged that a majority vote would be needed to approve a formal investigation -- and that the pro-Beijing majority, which backs Leung, would be unlikely to vote in its favor. The Neo-Democrat Party said it had filed a complaint over the payments with the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), with the request that it be investigated. However, Leung's allies, including pro-Beijing legislator, Starry Lee, who is a member of the Executive Council, said she didn't consider the payments to be a conflict of interest. ""Up to now, I think it is a normal business dealing and it has been confirmed by some of the business people,"" she said. Pressure intensifies . Leung had already been under pressure to resign from pro-democracy protesters who for the last two weeks have blocked access to the city's business district, demanding a greater say in how Hong Kong's leader is chosen. Pro-democracy campaigner, former Democrat Party leader and council member, Albert Ho said the group was in the ""final stages"" of preparing documents to impeach Leung for the way he had handled protests -- and it was too early to talk about impeaching him on the matter of the payments. He called on the chief executive to explain the agreement, though he added: ""I can hardly see how an explanation can be satisfactory, but he's entitled to answer, he's entitled to be heard."" Why was the deal struck? The contract came about during UGL's purchase of DTZ's assets in December 2011. The property group had been struggling and in early November Leung and his fellow DTZ directors decided to call in administrators, according to Fairfax. Leung resigned on November 24, and the sale went through in early December for $125 million (HK$970 million), UGL said in a statement on Thursday. As founder of DTZ's North Asia business, Leung was considered crucial to the company, something that UGL chief executive Richard Leupen made clear in an interview with the South China Morning Post in September 2012. ""CY's history of having set this company up will always be with DTZ. He's been an important part of the history of the company and has been an important part for us in buying the company,"" Leupen was reported to have said. Leung's office said Thursday that without the contract UGL would not have proceeded with the deal. ""No services provided"" The Hong Kong Information Services Department confirmed on Thursday that under the contract Leung would ""provide assistance in the promotion of the UGL Group and the DTZ Group as UGL may reasonably required, including but not limited to acting as a referee and adviser from time to time."" However it said in a statement ""such assistance will ONLY be provided in the event that Mr Leung failed to be elected as Chief Executive, and providing that such assistance will not create any conflict of interest."" It added: ""Mr Leung has not provided any service to UGL after signing the above agreement."" The department added that the contract was a ""resignation agreement"" which covered scenarios if Leung did not win the election. It repeated UGL's statement to Fairfax that at the time the contract was agreed, media coverage suggested that ""other candidates were favoured to be elected."" In the months before the March 2012 election, Beijing-backed former top civil servant Henry Tang Ying-yen was considered to be the likely choice of the Election Committee. But after what was described as a ""calamitous campaign,"" Chinese allegiances were said to have shifted in the final weeks to Leung. A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the controversy on Thursday. Leung's political opponents say answers are needed from a chief executive who has already lost the trust of the people. ""Hong Kong is dealing with this pro-democracy protests and people taking over the streets, the last thing we need is to have another big controversy surrounding the chief executive himself,"" the Democrat Party's Lau said. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Anjali Tsui, Wilfred Chan and Chieu Luu contributed to this report.","Claims Hong Kong's leader received millions of dollars from Australian company .

"(CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has issued a decree renaming the organization the ""State of Palestine,"" according to WAFA, the official Palestinian news agency. The change comes a little more than a month after the United Nations voted to upgrade the authority's status to ""non-member observer state."" The authority had been classified as a ""non-member observer entity"" until the November 29 vote. Abbas issued the decree Thursday, WAFA said. With the decree, Palestinian identification, passports and other documents will be branded with the new name, WAFA said. WAFA called the change a ""unique new move to the path of national independence.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The next time Michelle Obama goes to rally for a candidate at a campaign event, she might want to take a good look at the sign pasted on the front of her podium. Speaking at an event for Iowa Senate candidate Bruce Braley, the first lady mispronounced the Democratic hopeful's name not once, not twice, but seven times in front of a crowd of supporters. ""I'm very excited to be here to support your next Senator from Iowa, our friend Bruce Bailey,"" the first lady said commencing her speech on Friday. ""Iowa, if you want a leader that shares your values and will stand up for your families out in Washington, then you need to elect Bruce Bailey to the U.S. Senate,"" she said again a few sentences later. Obama continued to mispronounce the Braley's name five more times until she was interrupted by an audience member, who made her aware of her continued slip-up. ""Braley?"" she asked, looking quizzical. ""What did I say? I'm losing it,"" she laughed. ""I'm getting old."" ""Vote dot Bruce Braley dot com,"" she finally said, correcting herself, to some very loud applause. ""I know where I am. I know what I'm doing,"" she reassured the crowd. Republicans were quick to criticize the first lady for her mistake. ""First lady botches name of Dem Senate candidate at rally,"" Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer tweeted. ""WH Legal Counsel might want to prepare for a call from Bruce Braley, gotta avoid a ""litigious situation"" over mispronouncing name #IAsen,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Brad Dayspring tweeted. Donald Trump also weighed in. ""If a conservative Republican made the mistake that Mrs. Obama just made by calling Braley by the wrong name, it would be the biggest story!"" Key Midterm races to watch . At least the first lady wasn't the first high-profile Democrat to make this exact same blunder. At the Harkin Steak Fry just a few weeks ago in Iowa, former President Bill Clinton also botched Braley's last name. ""You know what you ought to do to honor the Harkin legacy -- and that is to elect Bruce Bailey,"" Clinton said. Later, in what could have simply been the case of a tangled tongue, the first lady also made an incorrect comment about Braley's past. ""As the son of a schoolteacher -- and I love his mom too -- As a Marine Corps Veteran, Bruce worked his way through college, waiting tables, working at a grain elevator, building bridges with a county roads department,"" Obama said. Braley is not a Marine Corps veteran, although his father, Byard Braley, was. The first lady was referencing Braley's parents in the beginning part of the sentence.","First lady Michelle Obama mispronounces Iowa Senate candidate's name seven times .

"(CNN) -- The facts show, and President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney agree, that U.S. production of oil and gas has increased over the past four years. But is this rise because of Obama, or ""in spite of his policies,"" as the former Massachusetts governor said at Wednesday night's debate? ""All of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land,"" Romney said. ""On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half."" The facts: . The Republican nominee's assertions can be broken down into two parts. The first has to do whether ""all of the increases in natural gas and oil"" under Obama are attributable to drilling on private land, rather than federal and Indian lands and offshore areas. This statement raises a few questions. Firstly, has there been more oil and gas production, relatively, on private lands versus federal lands? Secondly, does the federal government, through regulations and license approvals, have any impact on oil and gas production on private land? And last, can ""all"" the increase in production be tied to production on private lands? There is no dispute that natural gas production on private lands has increased. Adam Sieminski, head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, told a congressional subcommittee in August that it went up ""by 16.4 billion cubic feet per day"" from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2011, which ended September 30, 2011 -- a period that includes parts of the administrations of both President George W. Bush and Obama. Meanwhile, natural gas production on federal and Indian lands has steadily fallen, a trend that began around fall 2002. This is due to a consistent decrease in offshore gas drilling, though such gas production onshore, on federal lands, is actually higher now than it was at the end of the Bush administration. Overall, the percentage of U.S.-produced natural gas from federal lands -- relative to that produced from private ones -- fell significantly over the past eight years, from 35% to 21%, reported Sieminski. Oil production is more a mixed bag. On state and private lands, oil production was actually going down in the 2000s, leveled off between fiscal years 2007 and 2010, then went up by 385,000 barrels a day in fiscal year 2011, when the most recent data are available, Sieminski said. On federal and Indian lands, as well as federally approved offshore drilling sites, oil production went up from 1.6 million barrels per day to 2 million barrels per day between fiscal years 2008 and 2010. But it dropped to 1.8 million barrels per day for the last fiscal year available, a decrease that the U.S. Energy Information Administration attributes to the impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the one-year drop in production, oil production on federal and Indian lands from 2009 through 2011 totaled 2.027 million barrels. That's an average of 675,000 barrels per year during Obama's term, compared to an average annual production of 609,000 barrels annually during Bush's last term. Now, moving onto the second part of Romney's statement -- that Obama's ""administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half."" The Institute for Energy Research, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that has been critical of Obama, asserted in a September 26 report that the rate of oil and gas leasing (or licenses, as Romney stated) ""has slowed by about half."" It then directs readers to a chart on the federal Bureau of Land Management's website. This chart does show that fewer leases have been granted under the first three years of Obama's administration, compared to the last few years under Bush. Fewer drilling permits have also been issued, for these lands. During the last three fiscal years totally under Bush, there were 9,661 ""new leases"" granted for federal lands. For the three most recent fiscal years (which includes a few months of Bush's administration), there were 5,568 such new leases. This works out to a 42.4% decrease. Take the same comparable periods for drilling permits on federal lands. There were 20,479 for the last three years under Bush, then 12,821 for the most recent three including much of Obama's first term. This is a 37.4% decrease. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks . Conclusion: . There has been more oil and natural production on private lands than in federally controlled areas. So Romney is correct in pointing out an imbalance. But it is an overstatement to say that ""all of the increase"" has been on private lands -- since, by definition, new permits and licenses have been granted for federal lands (bringing in more gas and oil). Romney's claim that Obama's administration has ""cut the number of permits and licenses in half"" for federal lands is also not on the mark. True, there has been a significant drop -- one tied, in part, to the unprecedented Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Yet the actual numbers of permits and licenses haven't been ""cut ... in half."" As mentioned above (and including data from part of the Bush administration), there has been a 42% decrease in leases and 37% decrease in drilling permits -- not 50%, as Romney implied. Even the Institute for Energy Research acknowledged that ""this decrease isn't a result of President Obama's policies exclusively, but it is the result of decades and policies that have systematically reduced energy production on federal lands.""

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has signaled his support for a winter World Cup in Qatar in 2022 but with the crucial caveat that any change to the football calendar must be for a single season only. The former German international striker is also chairman of the European Clubs Association (ECA), representing over 100 top clubs, including Champions League holders Bayern. ""Everyone of us has the understanding that it is acceptable just to change one season,"" he told CNN. ""I know that there may be discussions about a second or third season but that is not acceptable to the clubs or the leagues,"" he added. Ever since Qatar was awarded the rights to host the 2022 finals there has been an ongoing controversy over the dates of the competition because of the climactic conditions in the Gulf state in June and July, when it it is scheduled to be played. Earlier this month, FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke gave a radio interview in France in which he appeared to suggest that the world governing body had already decided to switch to a November starting date to avoid average summer temperatures of between 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit) and 45 degrees (113 Fahrenheit). FIFA moved quickly to qualify his remarks, saying the decision was subject to an ""ongoing consultation process"" with key stakeholders such as the major European leagues. Rummenigge, 58, told CNN that ""it is not very intelligent playing a World Cup in the summer in Qatar when it is too hot, something like 50 degrees Celsius. ""It's not good for the players or the supporters and it would be wise to find a better date,"" he added. But Rummenigge acknowledged this would not be an easy task, with the English Premier League voicing its opposition to a winter World Cup. ""We have to find is the best date acceptable for leagues, clubs and federation because if you change to the Valcke idea of mid-November to December that would completely change the calendar for the Premier League and Bundesliga."" He revealed that a survey of ECA clubs, had come out in favor of either a November or January starting date. But the latter option would lead to a clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics and Rummenigge was keen to avoid disrupting the Games. ""We have to be careful not to damage a big event,"" he said. Rummenigge was a two-time European Footballer of the Year during his playing career, mostly spent at Bayern. He also helped Germany to the 1980 European Championships and to the runners-up spot in the 1982 and 1986 World Cups. Currently chief executive officer at Bayern, he has overseen their recent triumphs, which included last season's triple of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League. Rummenigge has worked closely with club president and chairman Uli Hoeness, who is awaiting trial in Germany for alleged tax evasion. Rummenigge has stood by his former club and international teammate, who has remained on the Bayern Munich board despite the charges against him, which could carry a jail term if he is found guilty. At the annual meeting of the Bavarian giants last November, Rummenigge's words of support for Hoeness moved the 62-year-old to tears and he promised to put himself up for re-election after his trial, which is scheduled for March. ""We hope the outcome will be good for him and he can continue his life work with Bayern Munich,"" said Rummenigge. Bayern will emerge from the Bundesliga winter break of five weeks Friday with a match against Borussia Moenchengladbach with a seven-point lead and still on course to repeat their triple of last season.","Bayern chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says 2022 World Cup should be played in winter .

"(CNN) -- Oh good, the brutal cold conditions that froze much of the country last winter are unlikely to happen again. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its seasonal outlook Thursday that some of those areas east of the Rockies might even see warmer temperatures this time. Remember how we kept talking about the Polar Vortex last winter? Chances are there won't be as much chatter about it as we move into December and January. ""The Polar Vortex is always there,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen reminded us. ""When it breaks, it spills cold air into the U.S. It's pretty unlikely that it would happen two years in a row."" Looks like NOAA agrees, though it warns folks in the South and Southeast to expect below-average temperatures -- and more precipitation. So cities like Detroit and Chicago that saw record amounts -- or near records -- of snow shouldn't have as much of the white stuff, but Atlanta and Dallas may have to keep their snow plows ready, Hennen said. While we probably won't hear as much about the Polar Vortex, we might see El Niño move his way back into the weather discussion. Hennen said forecasters have been waiting for an El Niño to form in the Pacific, but it has yet to materialize. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center puts it as a 67% likelihood of happening during the winter. But the El Niño will be a weak one and bring only some rain to drought-stricken California and other states in the West. ""We're likely to see normal amounts of rain,"" Hennen said, ""which will help with the drought, but not alleviate it."" Breakdown by region of what NOAA expects: . Northeast --- above-average temperatures, above-average precipitation along the coast. Hennen said it's important to remember that a lot of storm systems start in the South and work their way up the coast, so cities like New York and Boston might get more than their normal amounts of snow. Mid-Atlantic -- temperatures should be about normal as will the precipitation amounts in the interior parts of each state; wetter toward the ocean . Midwest -- Should be normal in temperature and precipitation in most areas . South -- colder, wetter in most areas . West -- above-average temperatures throughout, above-average precipitation in some southerly spots . Pacific Northwest --- drier and warmer than most years . Alaska -- Warmer, normal precipitation . Hawaii -- It's always nice, it seems, but expect less rain this season .","South will be colder and wetter but other areas will see warmer than normal temps .
California's rainfall totals should be about normal, not enough to solve drought .
The Polar Vortex likely won't spill as much cold air into the United States for a second year ."
"(CNN) -- It's been a bad year for the African rhino, particularly for those that call South Africa home. In 2013, over 1,000 rhinos were poached in South Africa alone. It's a dangerously high number, when you consider there are only 5,000 black rhinos left on the continent (a 97.6% reduction since 1960). The white rhino story is a happier tale. Rescued from the brink of extinction, the species now numbers 20,000 -- though conservationists worry they too are in danger, as rhino horn continues to sell for a hefty sum on the black market. ""A rhino is killed every seven hours, and when you mention rhinos to anyone, they tend to shake their head in desperation,"" says Dereck Joubert, who, along with his wife Beverly set up Rhinos Without Borders, a charity that has recently come up with a novel approach to saving one of Africa's most iconic creatures. In 2015, the charity will move 100 rhinos from South Africa -- which holds 80% of Africa's rhino population -- to Botswana, which has the lowest poaching rate in the continent. The rhinos are mainly donated from private sellers and the South African government. ""It's a bad idea to keep all your high-value assets in one place. Ecologically and genetically, it makes a lot of sense to spread them around, so if there's a catastrophic event in one place, you don't lose everything,"" he explains. Botswana: 'Shoot to kill' One of the reason's Botswana's poaching levels are so low is that they have zero tolerance when it comes to poachers. Anti-poaching is handled by the Botswana Defense Force, who have a ""shoot to kill"" policy. ""If poachers are apprehended, and don't immediately put down their weapons, the military basically treats them like an aggressive military threat,"" Joubert notes. ""The risks are very high for poachers, and the rewards are very low."" Botswana is also more remote and less populous -- two factors that he says helps keep poaching at a minimum. ""A group of foreigners walking through with AK47s are very quickly identified,"" he explains. Making the move . Rhinos Without Borders has partnered with tourism venture andBeyond, who moved rhinos from one of their private reserves to Botswana in 2011. Rhino candidates are sedated and their blood samples studied to make sure they're strong enough to make the trip. The rhinos then recover during a six-week quarantine before they're moved by plane to a secret location in Botswana. ""They won't be going in reserves near the borders either, because the president and the Botswana Defense Force don't want to attract poachers,"" explains Beverly Joubert. Because rhinos' first instinct is to seek out other herds, and Botswana has a low density of the species, synthesized rhino dung is used to help the relocated animals establish their territory. The process costs about $45,000 per rhino. Busting the horn myth . Rhinos are killed almost exclusively for their horn, which currently sells for $65,000 per kilo (2.2 pounds). The demand is driven primarily by buyers in East Asia, who (inaccurately) ascribe various medicinal cure-alls to the horn. In addition to running their charity, the Jouberts are also filmmakers and photojournalists for National Geographic. Together, they have made several films dispelling the myths concerning rhino horn's supposed medicinal properties, in the hopes of changing attitudes abroad. ""It's been claimed that rhino horn cures cancer, reduces fevers and is an aphrodisiac, and it's been proven that none of those things are true,"" says Beverly. ""Really, it's like chewing your own finger nail. It's keratin, that is all."" The ivory link . The history of the rhino horn trade is closely intertwined with that of the ivory trade. In 1989, the Contention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) succeeded in implementing an international ban on ivory. The price for the material crashed overnight and poaching of elephants mainly came to a halt. In 2002, trade opened back up when a handful of nations, including South Africa, were allowed to sell their ivory stockpiles. ""The minute that happened, we saw an influx of poachers. At the same time, the market shifted straight across to include rhinos as well,"" says Dereck. Some conservationists have proposed farming elephants and rhinos to meet the global demand -- an idea the Jouberts view as hopelessly misguided. ""If the strategy is to flood the market, the economics don't add up,"" he says. ""Maybe you could produce 6kg of horn a month from farming, but the market is over a billion strong.""","The black rhino population has plummeted 97.6% since 1960 .

"(CNN) -- As the first president-elect with a Facebook page and a YouTube channel, Barack Obama is poised to use the Internet to communicate directly with Americans in a way unknown to previous presidents. Since the election, President-elect Barack Obama has posted weekly video addresses on YouTube. Judging by Obama's savvy use of social-networking sites during his campaign and the interactive nature of his transition team's Web site, Americans can expect a president who bypasses the traditional media's filters while reaching out to citizens for input, observers say. ""The rebooting of our democracy has begun,"" said Andrew Rasiej, founder of Personal Democracy Forum and the techPresident blog. ""[Obama] has the potential to transform the relationship between the American public and their democracy."" During the presidential race, Obama's campaign won praise for its innovative use of social-networking sites, including Facebook, MySpace and MyBarackObama.com, to announce events, rally volunteers and raise money. Facebook has more than 150 million active users, and the average user has 100 friends on the site, according to the company. iReport.com: Your chance to ask President-elect Obama a question . Obama has more than 1 million MySpace ""friends"" and more than 3.7 million ""supporters"" on his official Facebook page -- some 700,000 more than when he was elected in November. His campaign also has a database of almost 13 million supporters and their e-mail addresses. Transition officials hope to transform Obama's vast Web operation and electronic list of supporters into a 21st-century tool to help accomplish his goals as president. They even have a name for this ambitious effort: Obama 2.0. ""Obama has invented an alternative media model,"" said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. ""In the old model, the president talks to the people on television [and] the people talk back in polls. In the new model, communication is online, and two-way."" Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter didn't exist when George W. Bush took office eight years ago. But since last November's election, Obama has wasted no time embracing these online communication portals. In recent weeks he has taped weekly video addresses and posted them to YouTube, where most have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Obama's staffers also have stopped posting information to social-networking sites since the election, preferring to reach out to constituents through YouTube and Change.gov, the official site of the president-elect's transition team. Visitors to Change.gov can read a frequently updated blog, post their ideas on issues facing the country, and rate others' ideas. Top-rated ideas will be gathered into a briefing book and given to Obama after he takes office. ""They want information going not just from them to the voters, but from the voters back to them,"" Democratic strategist Steve McMahon said Wednesday on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""Thirteen million people pushing a button, sending an e-mail to their elected representatives, making a phone call, taking action, is a powerful, powerful lobbying tool."" ""It's a very smart use of the Internet, to get people to offer ideas,"" said David All, a Republican Internet strategist. All hopes that Obama and his staff take a similar approach to WhiteHouse.gov, the president's official Web site. The current WhiteHouse.gov site, operated by the Bush administration, contains few interactive features. A statement on the president-elect's transition site says that Obama hopes to ""use cutting-edge technologies to create a new level of transparency, accountability, and participation for America's citizens."" It's fitting, then, that Obama's inauguration next week could be one of the most watched video events in Internet history. Rasiej expects that hordes of users will be watching online when Obama takes the oath of office, visiting WhiteHouse.gov and refreshing their browsers to capture the moment the site switches to proclaim Obama, not George W. Bush, as president. As president, Obama will likely not just rely on WhiteHouse.gov but use multiple Internet sites and technological tools to build grass-roots support for his agenda, observers say. ""[Obama] is using the tools that are available to him today,"" All told CNN. ""The next president will be using some of the same tools, and also some tools that haven't been invented yet.""","As president, Barack Obama will use the Web to communicate directly with citizens .

"Bali, Indonesia (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met Friday with his Indonesian counterpart in Bali as he prepares to conclude an eight-day trip to the Asia-Pacific region. The meeting with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono came ahead of Obama's participation in the East Asia Summit, a first for a U.S. president, according to the White House. The summit serves as a forum for the region -- which accounts for more than half of the world's gross domestic product -- to create dialogue on issues relating to politics, security and the economy. Obama is expected to meet Saturday with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra before the East Asia Summit session, after which he will depart for home. As part of their talks Friday, Yudhoyono and Obama announced a $600 million deal through the Millennium Challenge Corporation ""to support environmentally sustainable economic development through clean energy projects and sustainable landscapes projects, community-based nutrition programs, and procurement modernization,"" according to the White House. The leaders also reaffirmed their partnership and ""commitment to strengthen democracy and human rights in their own societies."" Earlier Friday, Obama took part in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic summit and hailed an airplane sales deal between Boeing and an Indonesian airline. Obama held bilateral talks with India, the Philippines and Malaysia before the ASEAN meeting. He also attended a gala dinner for East Asian leaders Friday wearing a traditional Indonesian shirt. Meanwhile, ASEAN leaders agreed that Myanmar can chair the regional bloc in 2014, amid some signs of reform. Some critics say it is still too early to award the high-profile role to Myanmar, where 600 to 1,000 political prisoners are believed to remain behind bars. Coinciding with the agreement, Obama announced that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans to visit Myanmar next month on a trip that could signal a major change in relations between the two countries. He made the announcement after talking with pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Clinton's trip is an indication that Myanmar, also known as Burma, has made some progress toward democracy and that the time could be right to forge a new relationship between the nations, the White House said. The Asian leg of Obama's trip follows two days in Australia, where he declared that the United States will increase its military presence and expand its role in shaping the Asia-Pacific region. ""Our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region,"" Obama told the Australian Parliament. ""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay."" He announced an agreement with Australia on Wednesday that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost America's presence in the region. Before departing Australia for Indonesia, the president, along with some U.S. Marines, visited a military base in Darwin. While speaking to the troops there, Obama thanked them for their service and praised the two nations' alliance, which is now 60 years old, and said he looks forward to a deepening of the alliance. The president's Australian visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the Pacific as China expands its military reach and the United States works to reduce its military footprint in Japan.","Obama meets with Indonesian president .

"(CNN) -- Science has come a long way since HIV was identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are some of the most memorable moments in AIDS history. 1981 . On June 5, the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report publishes the first mention of what later is determined to be HIV. The report mentions five cases of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in young men. The piece prompts reporting from New York, San Francisco and other cities of similar cases. Six men in New York set up a hot line, receiving 100 calls the first night. The hot line becomes the world's first HIV/AIDS service organization, the Gay Men's Health Crisis. 1982 . Health workers first begin to use the term ""acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,"" or AIDS, to describe the sudden cases of sarcoma or pneumonia infection in previously healthy people. 1984 . Scientists identify the virus that causes AIDS, first named after the T-cells affected by the strain. Its name is later changed to HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus. 1985 . The Food and Drug Administration approves the first licensed test for HIV. Actor Rock Hudson shocks the nation when he appears on TV with Doris Day as a ""gaunt, ravaged"" version of his former leading-man self. Soon after, the actor announces that he is dying of AIDS. As People magazine said at the time, his fans ""could not accept the idea of a clean-cut, virile star being felled by such an insidious disease."" Hudson dies on October 2. Hudson's good friend Elizabeth Taylor helps launch the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR). 1986 . Three brothers, Ricky, Robert and Randy Ray, are barred from a public school in Florida because of HIV infection. The Ray brothers are believed to have contracted the virus from tainted blood treatments for their hemophilia. After they win the ensuing court battle, the family's home is burned down in 1987. The events lead to a nationwide push for education about AIDS transmission. President-elect Bill Clinton tells Ricky before his death in 1992 that he will fund the fight against AIDS. 1987 . Activist Cleve Jones makes the first panel for the AIDS Memorial Quilt. By 2011, the quilt contains more than 40,000 panels. The FDA approves AZT, the first antiretroviral drug for treating AIDS. Activist Larry Kramer creates ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. ACT UP becomes the leader of many nonviolent protests through the 1990s. 1988 . The Ad Council partners with amfAR and the National AIDS Network to launch a national AIDS education campaign. It's the first ad campaign in the U.S. to use the word ""condom."" One of the campaign's taglines: ""Using it won't kill you. Not using it might."" 1990 . Congress passes the Ryan White Care Act shortly after the death of Ryan White, a heterosexual teen in Indiana who contracted HIV through hemophilia treatments. White was expelled from school in the mid-1980s because of prejudice, but his maturity and grace taught the country a lesson about those living with HIV. Life magazine publishes a photo of AIDS victim David Kirby as he takes one of his last breaths. The photo by grad student Therese Frare haunts the nation and becomes a symbol of the epidemic in America. 1991 . Singer Paul Jabara starts the Red Ribbon Foundation, which begins distributing ribbons as a symbol of tolerance for those living with HIV/AIDS. In June, the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus distributes red ribbons at the Tony Awards. Co-host Jeremy Irons becomes one of the first celebrities to wear one, creating a media stir. In November, three-time NBA MVP Magic Johnson announces that he has HIV and will retire from the Lakers. 1993 . The movie ""Philadelphia"" is released starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. In the drama, a man with AIDS is fired by a conservative law firm because of his condition, so he hires a homophobic lawyer to sue. The film makes more than $77 million at the domestic box office and is nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two. 1994 . The rock opera ""Rent"" opens off-Broadway in New York. The show is an adaption of Puccini's ""La Boheme"" but replaces the original's tragic illness with HIV. It earns rave reviews, heads to Broadway and goes on to win a Pulitzer Prize for drama. Elizabeth Glaser, wife of actor Paul Michael Glaser, loses her battle with AIDS, and her Pediatric AIDS Foundation is renamed. Glaser started the children's research foundation after she contracted HIV while giving birth. She unknowingly passed the virus on to her daughter through breast milk and her son Jake in utero. 1996 . The Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) is established by the United Nations. It combines experts from six agencies to fight the AIDS epidemic. At the 11th International AIDS Conference in Vancouver, combination antiretroviral treatment is presented for the first time. These drugs are shown to be effective against HIV. 1997 . Media outlets report that for the first time since the epidemic began, the AIDS death rate has declined in the U.S. thanks to the success of drug therapies. 1998 . The company AIDSvax starts the first human trial of an AIDS vaccine using 5,000 U.S. volunteers. Doctors in San Francisco start a trial of post-exposure prevention, a method similar to Plan B in that it aims to prevent HIV after possible exposure before the virus takes hold. 1999 . Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham report a discovery of HIV-1 in a subspecies of chimpanzee. They believe this to be the source of the virus and theorize that human hunters contracted it when exposed to infected blood. Initial findings from a joint Uganda-U.S. study identify a new drug regimen as an effective and affordable way to reduce mother-to-baby transmission of the virus. 2000 . The Clinton administration declares, for the first time, that AIDS is a threat to national security and to global stability. The Rev. Jesse Jackson publicly takes an HIV test after the CDC reports that African-American and Hispanic infection rates have overtaken those of white gay men. 2001 . UNAIDS marks the 20th anniversary of the first report of HIV. Executive Director Peter Piot says, ""At the time, I read the report with great interest, but I never imagined I was looking at the first sign of an epidemic, that in just 20 years would have infected 60 million people, killed 22 million and achieved the status of the most devastating epidemic in human history."" 2002 . The FDA approves the first rapid HIV test, which produces results in less than 20 minutes. The test uses a finger prick to draw blood. 2003 . The FDA approves the first of a new type of anti-HIV drug called Fuzeon (also known as enfuvirtide or T-20). This drug is designed to prevent the entry of HIV into human cells. The HBO TV miniseries ""Angels in America"" premieres, starring Al Pacino and Meryl Streep. Adapting a Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name, it follows two couples as they struggle to stay together during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. It wins multiple Emmy and SAG awards. 2004 . George W. Bush launches PEPFAR, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan to combat AIDS worldwide. ""This historic commitment is the largest by any nation to combat a single disease internationally,"" according to the PEPFAR website. 2005 . For the first time, the FDA approves a generic AIDS drug made by a foreign country, allowing PEPFAR to provide cheaper medications overseas. The patent on AZT also reaches an end, allowing more generic versions of the drug. 2006 . Singer Bono launches Product Red. Profits from the line of consumer goods are designated to fight the AIDS epidemic worldwide. ""I feel a bit of a fraud, a bit of a loser because we are not winning in the war against AIDS,"" Bono says. Bill Gates announces that he will step down as the head of Microsoft in order to donate his time to the Gates Foundation, the largest private source of funding in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Atripla, the first effective one-a-day pill to treat HIV, is approved in the U.S. 2009 . President Obama removes a travel ban preventing HIV-positive people from entering the U.S. This leads to the announcement that the International AIDS Conference will be held in the U.S. for the first time in more than 20 years. Washington's health department reports that D.C. has a higher rate of HIV and AIDS prevalence than West Africa, at 3%. 2010 . The trial of a microbicide gel, CAPRISA 004, shows that it reduces the risk of a woman becoming infected with HIV during sex by almost 40%. A third phase of a PrEP trial reveals that drugs used to treat HIV may also be effective in preventing infection. Subjects taking a once-daily antiretroviral pill were 44% less likely to be HIV-positive after male-to-male sex. 2011 . The National Institutes of Health publishes the results of a study that says taking antiretroviral drugs at the onset of HIV leads to a dramatic reduction in HIV transmission to an uninfected heterosexual partner. ""These results represent another significant step forward in HIV prevention and reinforce the importance of people everywhere knowing their HIV status and being linked to services for HIV prevention, care and treatment,"" CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden says. 2012 . The 19th International AIDS Conference takes place in Washington, bringing together more than 25,000 doctors, scientists, AIDS activists, politicians, philanthropists, drug company representatives, people living with HIV and heads of state from around the world. One of the main themes is the launch of ""Towards an HIV Cure."" UNAIDS announces that new HIV infections have dropped more than 50% in 25 low- and middle-income countries, and the number of people getting antiretroviral treatment has increased 63% in the past two years. More than 34 million people are still living with HIV, according to global estimates. 2013 . Researchers announce they have ""functionally cured"" a Mississippi toddler of HIV.

"(CNN) -- The oldest sitting member of Congress was airlifted Saturday following a car accident in his native Texas, though the 91-year-old apparently took the flight in stride -- ""joking with paramedics"" on his way to Plano, according to his office. Rep. Ralph Hall was being driven by his friend, 73-year-old Howard Zielke, when someone turned into them and collided with their vehicle around 2:50 p.m. (3:50 p.m. ET) in Fannin County, the Texas Department of Public Safety reported. The other car's driver didn't need to go to a hospital, while Zielke was transported to a hospital in McKinney, the state agency said. Hall, though, was flown to The Medical Center of Plano with what the public safety department described as ""serious injuries."" Joy Dover, a hospital spokeswoman, said later Saturday that Hall was in stable condition. The congressman's office provided more details. It described Zielke as one of Hall's ""close friends"" and said he was ""not hurt."" As to Hall himself, his office said he ""suffered a hip injury and minor cuts and bruises, but is expected to make a full recovery."" The same statement noted that the congressman -- who'd arrived home from Washington on Friday -- was ""joking"" with health staff on his medical flight. The idea that Hall might find humor in an otherwise bad situation, perhaps, shouldn't be too surprising. Shortly after losing a Republican primary this spring to tea party-backed candidate John Ratcliffe, thus spelling an end to his 32-year stay in Congress, Hall cracked: ""I figured it out -- damn guy got more votes than I did!"" He pointed out, too, that he couldn't get unemployment yet since he has ""a job here until December 31st."" ""At 91-years-old a contract for six months -- you can't beat it,"" he said then, referring to the rest of his term in the House.","Outgoing Congressman Ralph Hall, 91, is the oldest sitting member of Congress .

"(CNN) -- A 48-year-old Utah man was arrested after police said his attempt to abduct a little girl was foiled by the child's stepfather. Troy Mitchell Morley is suspected of two felonies -- child kidnapping and burglary, the Sandy, Utah, police department said in a written statement. ""The motive for the abduction and intentions of the suspect towards the child are not known,"" police said in the suburban Salt Lake City community. A spokesman for the family told CNN affiliate KSL on Friday afternoon that the girl was OK. ""At this moment, she seems pretty healthy and pretty happy,"" Miles Holman told the station. Police said there was no connection between Morley and the family. According to a news release from the Sandy police, Morley broke into the family's home around 4:30 a.m. Friday and found the girl sleeping in the basement. He woke the girl and told her to come with him, the statement said. The girl's parents were awakened by the sound of the front door and the stepfather saw the assailant carrying his daughter across the front lawn. In the 911 call attained by CNN affiliate KUTV, the girl's mother describes the moment when she and her husband realize something is wrong. ""We heard the front door open and I heard her talking. She's just the sweetest little thing. I heard her voice and we ran out,"" the sobbing woman says. The dad confronted the suspect and the man let go of the girl and ran. He was unarmed, the 911 caller says. ""But he was saying something that he's messed up and someone's going to hurt him,"" she tells the dispatcher. The man was later caught while hiding in another home after crawling through a doggie door, authorities said. KSL spoke to the home owner.

"(CNN) -- People smugglers accused of causing the deaths of hundreds of migrants when they deliberately rammed and sank their boat in the Mediterranean must be found and punished, the U.N. human rights chief said Friday. Up to 500 people on board are thought to have died after the boat went down last week. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein called on Egypt and other North African and European states to track down those responsible for this ""atrocious incident"" and hold them accountable. ""All the countries in the Mediterranean must make a concerted effort to clamp down on the smugglers who are exploiting one of the most vulnerable groups on the planet and endangering their lives, virtually on a daily basis, purely for financial gain,"" Zeid said. ""The callous act of deliberately ramming a boat full of hundreds of defenseless people is a crime that must not go unpunished. ""If the survivors' accounts are indeed true -- and they appear all too credible -- we are looking at what amounts to mass murder in the Mediterranean."" Zeid also called for nations to tackle the root causes that led people to undertake such dangerous journeys in a bid to reach European shores. 'They were laughing' Eleven survivors of the sinking, rescued by authorities in Italy, Malta and Greece, told interviewers from the International Organization for Migration earlier this week that the people smugglers were Palestinian or Egyptian. Those on the boat included Syrians, Palestinians -- many of them from Gaza -- Egyptians and Sudanese, as well as Palestinians, the witnesses said. Two Palestinian survivors explained that they'd paid $2,000 -- money they'd gotten after receiving grants to rebuild their homes -- at what they called a ""travel"" office in Gaza for their voyage to Italy, according to the IOM. They had packed into a boat in Egypt's port of Damietta and left on September 6, they said. They estimated at least 400 men and women, in addition to as many as 100 children, were on board. Five days later, the smugglers allegedly rammed their boat far out to sea between Malta and Greece, causing it to sink, after the migrants refused to move onto a smaller boat they judged to be unseaworthy. They'd already been forced to transfer vessel several times, the survivors said. ""After they hit our boat they waited to be sure that it had sunk completely before leaving. They were laughing,"" one survivor told the IOM. As many as 300 people were reportedly crammed into a lower deck of the boat, many of them children, while another 200 were on the sun-baked top deck, the IOM said. A week later, only 11 survivors have been found. Zeid urged the Greek, Maltese and Italian authorities to share information on the identity of the smugglers with the Egyptian authorities, who he said should also launch a thorough investigation. ""You cannot transport large quantities of foreigners in buses into a major port and cram them on board a ship without the port authorities and other witnesses being aware of what is going on,"" Zeid said. 'This summer's recipe for death' According to the IOM, the latest reported sinking would take the death toll off Europe's shores this year to nearly 3,000. In 2013, the organization's Missing Migrants Project estimated the total for the year to be 700 deaths. In a news release Friday, the group said the reported 500 deaths were ""merely the latest chapter in a horrible story unfolding on Europe's doorstep. ""Criminality, on top of desperation, has been this summer's recipe for death â€” even murder, according to eyewitness accounts."" The IOM called for an end to a culture of impunity, fed by poverty and lawlessness, that has allowed criminal gangs to prosper, particularly in Libya. And it urged European nations to reform immigration laws to allow refugees safe, legal migration to Europe. CNN's Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","U.N. human rights chief urges probe into alleged deliberate sinking of a packed migrant boat .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two days after voters angry with Washington's dysfunction swept Republicans into control of the Senate and expanded their advantage in the House, Speaker John Boehner used his first post-midterm news conference to issue a ""burn"" notice to the commander-in-chief. ""When you play with matches, you take the risk of burning yourself and he's going to burn himself if he continues to go down that path,"" the Ohio Republican told reporters on the Hill, when asked about President Barack Obama's plans to issue executive orders on immigration before year's end. Just hours after Obama recommitted himself to staying the course on immigration orders and protecting his signature health care law, Republicans spent Thursday firing back shots at the administration, signaling that Tuesday's midterms did little to quell partisan tension in Washington. Republican National Committee members as well as GOP leaders on the Hill took the election results as a sign to dig in on their issues, and while both parties made reference to compromise, Thursday's developments suggested more of the opposite was in store. Obama alone after midterm repudiation . Two of the most powerful Republicans in Washington, Boehner and the expected next Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, outlined their priorities in writing, using an oped in the Wall Street Journal to showcase their 2015 priorities. Among them: Repealing Obamacare, authorizing construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and reforming the tax code. The pair took shots at Democratic House and Senate leaders who shepherded most of Obama's significant legislative achievements through Congress, saying they ""won't repeat the mistakes made when a different majority ran Congress in the first years of Barack Obama's presidency, attempting to reshape large chunks of the nation's economy with massive bills that few Americans have read and fewer understand."" And in his press conference, Boehner said the House will likely vote again next year to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- both in full and in separate chunks, like stripping away the medical device tax and the individual mandate. Get ready: 2016 starts now . And he warned that if Obama will ""burn himself"" if he overhauls the U.S. immigration system through executive order in the coming weeks -- which president has pledged to do. Going ahead with those plans, Boehner said, will ""poison the well"" in the eyes of congressional Republicans. It's the same phrase Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell used Wednesday -- indicating that a major fight is likely to come before the new Congress is even sworn in. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in his Thursday briefing that Obama is looking forward to meeting with GOP leaders and hearing their ideas. ""The good news though is that the deck has been reshuffled,"" Earnest said. ""There's now a Republican majority in the Senate. There's a Republican majority in the House. And you could understand how this might change the political calculation that Republicans make. Maybe they now see that it would be in their own personal political interest to try to find some common ground with the president."" Opinion: Did Americans get what they want? Obama himself repeated his plans for an executive overhaul of immigration laws during hid Wednesday news conference. But he also said he'd like to sit down for Kentucky bourbon with McConnell and telling voters -- and those who stayed away from the polls Tuesday -- that he heard their message. Boehner, one of several Republicans to mention their mistrust of the President, said Thursday that he isn't buying it. ""The president said, 'I listened to what happened Tuesday night,'"" Boehner said before adding, with an incredulous grin: ""Really?"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told CNN on Wednesday night that it's ""bizarre"" to see Obama and his allies now looking for areas of compromise. He pointed to Obama's handling of immigration -- the president had initially planned to take executive action over the summer, but deferred that move until after the midterm elections. ""I don't believe a thing he says,"" Priebus said when asked by CNN's Erin Burnett about working with the president. ""All he's been doing for the last year is lying to Hispanic voters across the country."" While McConnell's ascendancy to the Senate majority leader's post is all but assured and Boehner is staying on as speaker, Democrats have some leadership questions of their own to sort through after Tuesday's devastating elections. Why Pelosi, Reid are sticking around . Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel told Newsday he won't stay on for a third election -- though he does want a seat at the House Democrats' already-crowded leadership table. The first look at the new political landscape will come later this month, when lawmakers return for leadership elections and the House is scheduled to vote on a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulatory bills. In the coming weeks Congress will also take up Obama's request for more than $6 billion in new Ebola-related funding, spending bills to fund the government and potentially legislation to authorize the use of military force against ISIS.","House Speaker John Boehner warned President Obama against executive orders on immigration .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Hours after North Korea's deadly artillery attacks Tuesday, South Korea's president said ""enormous retaliation"" is needed to stop Pyongyang's incitement, but international diplomats urgently appealed for restraint. ""The provocation this time can be regarded as an invasion of South Korean territory,"" President Lee Myung-bak said at the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff here, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. The incident -- in which two South Korean marines died -- is ""the first direct artillery attack on South Korean territory since the Korean War ended in an armistice"" in 1953, Yonhap reported. Read more CNN coverage on North Korea . In addition to the slain marines, 15 South Korean soldiers and three civilians were wounded when North Korea fired about 100 rounds of artillery at Yeonpyeong Island in the Yellow Sea, South Korean authorities said. Hundreds of island residents boarded boats and fled to safety, as the attack also set houses and forests on fire. Some U.S. forces had been helping the South Koreans in a military training exercises, but were not in the shelled area. South Korea's military responded with more than 80 rounds of artillery and deployed fighter jets, defense officials said. Firing between the two sides lasted for about an hour in the Yellow Sea, a longstanding flash point between the two Koreas. In March, a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, was sunk in the area with the loss of 46 lives in a suspected North Korean torpedo attack. The United States has about 28,500 troops deployed in South Korea. A U.S. defense official said more than 50 U.S. Navy vessels are in the area, including a carrier strike group led by the USS George Washington. U.S. President Barack Obama defended South Korea. ""South Korea is our ally. It has been since the Korean War and we strongly affirm our commitment to defend South Korea as part of that alliance,"" he told ABC News. In response to a question on whether he would consider sending U.S. warships to the region or putting troops on alert, Obama said: ""I'm not going to speculate on military actions at this point. I want to consult with President Lee."" Later Tuesday, the White House released a statement saying that Obama called Lee to express his support. ""The two presidents agreed to hold combined military exercises and enhanced training in the days ahead to continue the close security cooperation between our two countries, and to underscore the strength of our alliance and commitment to peace and security in the region,"" the statement said. South Korea's Lee said ""indiscriminate attacks on civilians are a grave matter."" He said that, since ""North Korea maintains an offensive posture,"" South Korea's military forces -- the army, air force and navy -- ""should unite and retaliate against [the North's] provocation with multiple-fold firepower."" ""Reckless attacks on South Korean civilians are not tolerable, especially when South Korea is providing North Korea with humanitarian aid,"" Lee said, according to Yonhap. After the incident, Yonhap said the Seoul government ""banned its nationals from entering the communist state, indefinitely postponed scheduled Red Cross talks and began looking at ways to push the United Nations to condemn Pyongyang."" South Korea also suspended promised flood aid to North Korea, Yonhap reported, citing an unnamed official. North Korea said the incident stemmed from South Korean maritime military exercises, code named Hoguk, and called the exercises ""war maneuvers for a war of aggression."" The ""South Korean puppet group"" engaged in ""reckless military provocation"" by firing ""dozens of shells"" inside its territorial waters ""despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK"" or Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the North's military said in a statement. ""The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK standing guard over the inviolable territorial waters of the country took such a decisive military step as reacting to the military provocation of the puppet group with a prompt powerful physical strike,"" the statement said. ""It is a traditional mode of counter-action of the army of the DPRK to counter the firing of the provocateurs with merciless strikes,"" said the statement, which warned that it ""will unhesitatingly continue taking merciless military counter-actions against it"" if the border is crossed. A senior U.S. defense official said South Korea had informed North Korea prior to the training mission, and that ""there's no reason North Korea should have been surprised by this firing of artillery."" Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea, told reporters both sides should exercise restraint. He was in Beijing to discuss nuclear matters with Chinese diplomats. ""The U.S. strongly condemns this aggression on the part of North Korea, and we stand firmly with our allies,"" he said. ""The subject did, of course, come up in my meetings with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I think we both share the view that such conflict is very undesirable. I expressed to them the desire that restraint be exercised on all sides, and I think we agree on that."" ""We call on all members of the international community to condemn the DPRK's acts and to make clear that they expect the DPRK to cease all provocations and implement its denuclearization commitments,"" Bosworth told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday. The incident comes a few days after a U.S. scientist reported that North Korea has built a new uranium enrichment facility. North Korean officials said the facility is producing low-enriched uranium, said Siegfried Hecker, co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. The enrichment facility contains 2,000 centrifuges and appears to be designed for nuclear power production, ""not to boost North Korea's military capability,"" Hecker said. But U.S. and South Korean diplomats said the revelation confirms the country's long-term deceit. Sanctions have been progressively placed on North Korea in response to a succession of nuclear and missile tests and the sinking of the South Korean warship in March. The United States said it would not dismiss restarting six-party talks aimed at denuclearizing the North. However, it said it would not return to negotiations unless North Korea showed good faith. Countries that had been negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear program issued swift reactions. The six-party talks include both Koreas, the United States, Russia, Japan and China. The United States ""strongly"" condemned North Korea's action, and a U.S. Defense Department official told CNN that the ""hope is that this is just one isolated incident, not an escalation into a different military posture"" by the North. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates called South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-young Tuesday morning. ""Secretary Gates told Minister Kim the United States strongly condemns the attack by North Korea, views it as a violation of the armistice agreement and assured him that we are committed to South Korea's defense,"" said Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell in a statement. ""The Secretary and the Minister agreed their departments should consult closely and coordinate on any response to this act of aggression by the North,"" he added. U.S. Rep. John Boehner, the House Republican leader who's in line to become the next speaker, said he joined Obama in condemning North Korea's ""hostile action."" State Department Deputy Spokesman Mark Toner said the United States would work with its partners in the six-party talks ""to take a deliberate, slow approach to responding to this latest provocation."" He wouldn't respond to criticism that the current policy is a failure, or at the very least, not working well. ""It's hard; it's another setback,"" he said. ""I think that everybody involved is stunned by North Korea's provocative actions."" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China had ""taken note of relevant reports"" and expressed its ""concern."" ""Relevant facts need to be verified, and we hope both parties make more contributions to the stability of the peninsula,"" he said. A U.S. official with knowledge of U.S. strategy on North Korea says it may be time to adjust U.S. military policy in the region. While the exercises ""are designed to deter further provocative behavior by North Korea, obviously it's not working,"" the official said. ""When we announced joint military exercises in the Yellow Sea, it only angered China. And in other waters, it doesn't seem to be effective deterrence against the North Koreans."" Scott Snyder, director of the Center for U.S.-Korea Policy, the Asia Foundation, called the act a ""very serious provocation."" ""It also signals dissatisfaction with the inter-Korean relationship and an apparent willingness to keep inter-Korean tensions high. The incident could reflect a more aggressive view of what a nuclear North Korea thinks it can do without facing a broader escalation of tensions."" Journalist Andrew Salmon and CNN's Steven Jiang, Yoko Wakatsuki and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: South Korea, U.S. agree to joint exercises .

"(CNN) -- Say it with us: Kids today have it sooooo easy. A new smartphone app will do their math homework for them, provided it's not too complicated. PhotoMath by microblink uses a phone's camera to solve equations and then teaches you the step-by-step method for solving it yourself. The app can do arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. It can handle fractions. It knows what 23 is and can calculate the root of 246. It can even do simple linear equations, provided the x you're solving for is italicized so the app doesn't confuse it with the x multiplication symbol. The only catch is that the equation you're trying to solve must be printed text, rather than handwritten. So forget trying to calculate that tip by scribbling it on a restaurant napkin. (Don't worry, there's already a million apps for that.) The app may pose a problem for schools are already dealing with smartphone overload. Math teachers will have to be extra vigilant during tests to prevent students from cheating. The PhotoMath app is available for iPhones and Windows phones and is coming to Android phones in 2015.","PhotoMath app uses phone's camera to solve equations .

"(CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a big, serious government agency with a big, serious job: protecting public health from threats ranging from hurricanes to bird flu. So when the good doctors of Atlanta warned people this week about how to prepare for a zombie apocalypse, the world took notice. ""That's right, I said z-o-m-b-i-e a-p-o-c-a-l-y-p-s-e,"" Dr. Ali S. Khan wrote on the CDC website this week, adding casually that ""Resident Evil"" is his ""personal favorite"" zombie movie. As it happens, Khan, one of the nation's top-ranking public health professionals (he's a rear admiral and an assistant surgeon general), doesn't actually believe the living dead are about to claw their way out of graves and start chewing on your brain. But, he and his communications team recently noticed, what they'd want you to do if the world really did suddenly go ""Night of the Living Dead"" is pretty much the same thing they'd want you to do in case of a hurricane or a major pandemic. From that realization to the decision actually to put up a blog post was a short step, Khan said Thursday. Inside zombie brains: How sci-fi teaches science . Khan floated the idea of what to do in a meteor strike on earth not long after becoming director of CDC's Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response eight months ago, he said, so his staff knew he was open to ""novel and creative ideas to engage the public."" Then the CDC got a question about zombies during an online chat about radiation leaks related to the meltdown at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March, and they saw traffic spike. Khan and his communications team knew they'd found a way to get the public interested in disaster preparedness, he said. ""You have a 'Resident Evil' movie coming out, 'Shaun of the Dead,' 'World War Z.' It's a good metaphor for where you have complete disruption,"" he said. So they posted the advice on Monday. Their website crashed on Wednesday. Why we love those rotting, hungry, putrid zombies . It's running sporadically as of this writing, so in case you can't get on, here's what CDC recommends: .

And keep some cleaning supplies handy, along with key personal documents like a driver's license and birth certificate. The CDC also recommends having basic first aid supplies handy for a hurricane or a pandemic -- although, Khan admits on the CDC blog, ""you're a goner if a zombie bites you.""","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues zombie preparedness advice .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney praised the Obama administration Sunday for using a drone strike to kill American-born Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, but said President Barack Obama should now reverse past criticism of former President George W. Bush's actions against suspected terrorists. Al-Awlaki -- an American whose fluency in English and technology made him one of the top terrorist recruiters in the world -- was killed Friday in Yemen, according to U.S. and Yemeni government officials. The strike also killed Samir Khan, an American of Pakistani origin, and two others who were in the same vehicle as al-Awlaki, said the U.S. official, who was briefed by the CIA. Khan specialized in computer programming for al Qaeda and authored the terror network's online magazine, Inspire. ""I think it was a very good strike. I think it was justified,"" Cheney told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union."" But ""I'm waiting for the administration to go back and correct something they said two years ago when they criticized us for 'overreacting' to the events of 9/11."" The Obama administration has ""clearly ... moved in the direction of taking robust action when they feel it is justified,"" Cheney said. Cheney's daughter, Liz Cheney, went a step further, saying Obama ""in effect said that we had walked away from (America's) ideals."" ""I think he did tremendous damage,"" Liz Cheney said. ""I think he slandered the nation and I think he owes an apology to the American people."" When asked by Crowley if Dick Cheney also wants an apology, the former vice president replied, ""Well, I would. I think that would be not for me, but I think for the Bush administration."" Republican critics of the administration claim it is hypocritical for Obama to approve the killing of Americans without due process while criticizing Bush officials for signing off on the use of so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" such as waterboarding. The use of such techniques has been banned by Obama. Former Rep. Jane Harman, D-California, told CNN that she believes many of Obama's critiques of the Bush White House -- most notably its secrecy -- are valid. ""I don't think the Obama administration should be repeating"" those mistakes, Harman said. ""I think the debate about the legal grounds (for counterterrorism strategy) should be more in the open,"" she said. In particular, ""we should have a legal framework around our interrogation and detention policies far more than we do now."" Harman, a former top member of the House Intelligence and Homeland Security committees, also cautioned about the need for strict guidelines in the use of drone strikes, which have increased under Obama's watch. Critics of drone strikes argue that they undermine the U.S. cause by killing innocent civilians, infringing on the sovereignty of other nations and generating sympathy for al Qaeda and other extremist organizations. ""We could abuse this program,"" Harman said. ""We've got to have a counter-narrative (to dissuade potential terrorists). We've got to live our values."" Retired Gen. Michael Hayden, a former CIA director under George W. Bush, largely dismissed Harman's warning, telling CNN that critics of drone strikes ""greatly exaggerate"" their collateral damage. The strikes are arguably the most critical weapon in the U.S. arsenal against al Qaeda, Hayden said. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report .","Cheney says Obama should back off past criticism of the Bush anti-terror policies .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats have a message for voters during the final, frenzied day of campaigning: All is not lost. Party leaders insist they can still hold onto the Senate -- their last bastion of power on Capitol Hill -- and are spending the remaining hours before the polls open on Tuesday trying to convince their voters not to give up. ""I don't agree with the oddsmakers,"" Vice President Joe Biden said in an exclusive interview with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. ""I predict we're gonna ... keep the Senate."" Everything would have to break for Democrats just right for Biden's optimism to carry the day. New polls in states that Democrats must win if they have any hope of keeping the Senate aren't promising. In New Hampshire, a WMUR poll released Sunday shows Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown in a deeply competitive race. The poll puts Shaheen's support at 46% with Brown at 43%. The race narrows further -- with Shaheen at 47% against Brown at 45% -- once undecided voters are asked who they are most likely to support. The numbers are troubling for Democrats because a WMUR poll just a few days earlier showed Shaheen leading Brown 50% to 42%. A Quinnipiac University poll in Iowa shows the Senate race there in a dead heat, with Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst at 47%. That could provide some comfort to Democrats after a Des Moines Register poll had Ernst up by 7 points over the weekend. Though Republicans appear on track to take the Senate majority for the first time in nearly a decade, polls can be wrong and might miss important shifts in the electorate during the final hours of the election. But veteran Republican power broker Haley Barbour told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" that it was looking good for his side. ""I think it is more likely than not Republicans will have a majority in the Senate after these elections, but it's not a certainty, never is in politics,"" Barbour said. ""People shouldn't take things for granted."" Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz however said her party's superior get-out-the-vote operation would be the difference maker. ""We are going to hold the Senate tomorrow night. We have, going into election day, a superior ground game that has run circles around the Republicans,"" she told Tapper. Emotions are running high among exhausted candidates, who are throwing everything into their last hours of campaigning. Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, vowed not to give up, despite polls showing her well behind Mitch McConnell, the man in line to become the next Senate majority leader. ""You are the messengers that Mitch McConnell can't buy,"" Grimes said in a campaign rally Sunday, her voice cracking with emotion. ""And I tell you, this strong independent Kentucky woman, I've got kick still in me."" CNN's Dana Bash reported at the weekend that Republican strategists have already told McConnell that things are looking so good that he will indeed be the next majority leader. Democrats might not be giving up but they know the wind is in their face. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to pick up the Senate in an election in which they are also likely to pad their majority in the House of Representatives. The GOP is expected to cruise to victory in Democratic seats in South Dakota, Montana and West Virginia, which would leave them just three seats short of a majority. And latest polls show the GOP leading in Democratic-held seats in Arkansas, Alaska and Colorado. Democrats, however, hold the advantage in North Carolina. To have any hope of halting the Republican tide, Democrats would have to come from behind in several seats on the GOP hit list and push races in Louisiana and Georgia into run-offs. The party is insisting that its vaunted get-out-the-vote operation will make things much closer on Tuesday than they seem now. Republicans are making the election a referendum on the increasingly unpopular President Barack Obama. The GOP would use Senate control to make him a lame duck during his last two years in power. Buy if they do win the Senate, Republicans will fall short of the 60 seat supermajority that they would need to thwart Democratic delaying tactics. And they also know they have a tough map of Senate seats to defend in 2016 â€” a presidential election year in which Democratic turnout is likely to be higher. So they may have an incentive to show they can govern or to compromise with Obama in some areas like tax reform or trade deals. The votes have not yet been counted in this election, but the next White House race effectively begins on Wednesday morning. Likely candidates on both sides are hitting the Senate battlegrounds â€” and boosting their own prospects in 2016. New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie is wrapping up his campaign marathon that has seen him hit 10 states since Friday. He is in Rhode Island, Michigan, Maine and New Hampshire on Monday. Another Republican with 2016 in his sights -- Sen. Rand Paul -- is making seven stops with McConnell in Kentucky. Mitt Romney, who two years ago lost the presidency to Obama, travels to Alaska to give GOP Senate candidate Dan Sullivan a last minute boost. And Bill Clinton will cap his own long campaign swing with an event with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist in Florida â€” a swing state that will see a lot of his wife Hillary Clinton, in her presumed presidential run.","Democrats are trying to keep hope alive for Tuesday's midterms .

"Pasadena, California (CNN) -- A tender smile frames the face of Eva Perez as she remembers the life of her 6-year old son. ""Hernan was a very happy boy,"" she says. ""He gave me flowers all the time. He's the first 'man' (to) give me flowers."" But her smile is thinly veiled -- her face splintering into tears as she permits the raw truth to surface. On Valentine's Day in 1999, Hernan suffered severe head trauma while sledding in the snow-covered mountains above the Los Angeles basin. Eva says she tried to reach her son but couldn't navigate thick snow and ice. She flagged down a passing vehicle and asked the occupants to alert authorities. Hernan was airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital, where, two days later, he was declared brain dead. A family care coordinator with One Legacy, an organ and tissue recovery agency, approached Eva and her husband, Arnold, to talk about donating Hernan's organs. They decided to donate four of Hernan's organs: his heart, liver and both kidneys. ""The right kidney went to an older white gentleman,"" says Arnold Perez, Hernan's stepfather. ""The left kidney went to an older Vietnamese gentleman. His heart went to a young American boy, and his liver was given to a young girl."" That young girl, 9-year old Megan Corfee, recently recalled the day when she and her mother, Debbie, received word that a donor organ was available. They were at a car wash when the pager from One Legacy started buzzing. ""I called the coordinator and she told me, 'We have a liver for Megan, get here as soon as you can,' "" Debbie said. ""I was like 'Wow! That was fast, after only being of the donor waiting list two weeks.'"" When Megan was just 7 years old, she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, a liver disease that she says ""made my body think I didn't have a liver."" ""I was jaundiced and I was throwing up blood,"" says Megan, who turns 22 this month. ""Basically, when they did the transplant, they said my liver was shrinking, so I was pretty sick."" Four years after her successful transplant, Megan sent a thank-you letter to the Perez family. In the letter, printed on floral paper, Megan tells the unnamed ""Donor family"" she enjoys music and watching ""Cosby Show"" reruns. ""I had my liver transplant when I was 9 years old. I am now 13 and I am doing very well,"" she wrote. ""I am very thankful that you decided to have your loved one's organs donated."" Three years after Megan sent that letter, the two families -- who lived about 30 miles away -- agreed to meet. ""Megan Corfee came to gladden our hearts,"" Arnold Perez said. ""To me, she is an angel that was given life by another angel, and in our lives, she is a source of light."" Since they first met in 2006, the Corfee and Perez families get together every year at fundraising events for Donate Life, which handles the national organ and tissue registry and helps to raise awareness about the benefits of organ donations. The Perezes treat Megan like their own child, and Eva and Megan have formed a particularly close bond, communicating nearly every day, either on the phone or via Facebook. It's rare for donor and recipient families to meet, let alone forge such a close relationship, according to Bryan Stewart of Donate Life. ""In the case of Hernan, it was devastating for the family to lose him in such an accident,"" Stewart said. ""And yet at that time, they saw the opportunity to leave a legacy of life where they could see Hernan's gift grow into other people."" Megan's mother said that sometimes, the meetings between the two families have ""been a little awkward, I think maybe (because of) the language barrier."" But, Debbie Corfee added, ""I see, especially in Megan, that it's something that gives her a boost and a spark in life. That life is worth living because of her connection with this family."" On a recent Saturday morning at the Rosemont Pavilion next to the Rose Bowl, the Corfee and Perez families met to help hundreds of other volunteers decorate the Donate Life float for the Tournament of Roses Parade scheduled for January 1. Eva grasped Megan's hand tightly and said, ""Look at the float!"" ""One More Day,"" read the banner, ""One more day I can have with Hernan and one more day that people are on the waiting list -- they want one more day to receive the transplant."" Three years ago, the Perez family was chosen to make a floragraph -- a floral portrait of Hernan on the Donate Life float featured in the parade. Eva Perez was selected to walk alongside the float, holding a tether to a hot-air balloon that featured a portrait of Hernan. ""(She) was literally connected to his portrait,"" Stewart said. ""So for her, it was like walking five miles with her son again."" This year, Arnold Perez was chosen by his fellow volunteers to represent them on the Donate Life float. He will be one of 28 float riders. The Perez family volunteers with Donate Life. Every week, Eva shares her story of loss to visitors to the Mexican Consulate in downtown Los Angeles in the hopes they will sign up to become organ and tissue donors. Eva Perez credits the organization for giving ""my son's death meaning."" ""I realize that his organs and his life live on in other people,"" she said. With their son never far from their thoughts, the Perez family will spend this Christmas at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City decorating Hernan's grave site with tinsel, wreaths and artificial snow as they do every year. ""In the six short years that Hernan was on Earth, it was clear to see that he was a marvelous boy,"" Arnold Perez said. ""The fact that he was so marvelous and generous made it easier for us to make the choice to have him be an organ and tissue donor. ""He was a happy child, and the time that I spent with him and held him were really the joy in my life.""","Eva Perez's son died after a sledding accident when he was 6 years old .

"(CNN) -- Jeffrey Fowle never met Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller. But he's been in their shoes. Just three weeks ago, Fowle -- like his fellow Americans, Bae and Miller -- was detained in North Korea. Within a half-hour of his release, he was on a plane leaving the isolated East Asian nation. ""On the ride to the airport ... I was hoping they'd be on the plane as well,"" Fowle said Saturday. ""I got there, and they said I was the only one coming home."" No more. On Saturday, the U.S. government announced that Bae and Miller will soon be joining Fowle on American soil after being released. Now in Ohio, Fowle wonders why it didn't happen sooner and why he was let go first, despite the fact Bae and Miller were detained before him. ""Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller should have been released before I was,"" Fowle told CNN. ""But I'm glad to hear that they're on their way home."" It's too early to say what their lives will be like back home. Miller has been held since April. For Bae, it has been nearly two years. Euna Lee, who was released from North Korea in 2009 after being detained for 140 days, said she wanted to return not just to her home, but to normal. ""You can imagine that that doesn't happen,"" Lee said. ""But that's what, I'm sure, they want to probably have, (to) just come back to regular, mundane days."" North Korea releases Bae, Miller . Conditions vary for detainees, but all isolated . Numerous Americans have been detained over the years in North Korea, though that's not to say that they've all had identical experiences. Of the three released in the past few weeks, it appears Bae had it worst. The married father of three from Lynwood, Washington, moved to China in 2005. A year later, he established ""Nations Tour,"" a China-based tour company that specialized in tours of North Korea. A devout Christian, Bae was in Rason, an area along the northeastern coast of North Korea, when authorities arrested him in November 2012. U.S. officials confirmed Bae's detention the next month. The following May, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for ""hostile acts"" against the Communist nation, and spent time in a labor camp, as well as a hospital. And Miller got six years of hard labor in September for ""acts hostile"" to North Korea, all because he had ripped up his tourist visa and shouted his desire to seek asylum after arriving in the country, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. Fowle received no such sentence after leaving a Bible at a club in northern North Korea, which he admitted doing. While also accused of ""perpetrating hostile acts,"" and while he -- like Bae and Miller -- told CNN he signed documents admitting his guilt, Fowle said he didn't spend time in a jail or at a labor camp. Instead, he spent time in a high-rise hotel and a hospitality center since his detention last spring. Lee said that being cut off from the world is a major punishment in itself, with or without harsh conditions. ""Being isolated in a foreign country is very difficult,"" she said. ""(Having) no communication with family members or the outside world (makes) it even more hard."" Former detainee: 'I'd tell them to keep the faith' Thankfully, that won't be a struggle any more for Bae and Miller. If past releases are any indication, they'll soon be hugging and kissing family members back in the United States, then going off to spend time with loved ones. ""What they really need is people around them (and in the public who) can continually give them positive attention, until they are fully recovered from this attention and isolation,"" Lee said. Fowle said that his transition home was eased by the fact he got his old job back home in Ohio. That would seem impossible for Bae, who's been gone longer and whose business was predicated on traveling to North Korea, as Fowle fully admits. Still, he believes that both Bae and Miller -- if they can survive months detained in North Korea -- can survive and thrive in their return home as well. Asked what he would say now to his two fellow Americans, Fowle said, ""I'd tell them to keep the faith.""","Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller are the latest Americans released from North Korea .

Fowle says he would tell the newly released Americans ""to keep the faith""
Another former N. Korean detainee, Euna Lee, says the 2 probably want ""mundane days"""
"(CNN) -- After several stints in prison and rehab for heroin addiction, Benny Se Teo was a reformed character, but society didn't want to know. After finding it nearly impossible to get a job he decided to forge his own future. Now, over 20 years since he kicked his drug-habit, the Singaporean is the successful owner of a chain of restaurants called Eighteen Chefs. While the restaurants focus on providing quality food, from the beginning Teo was determined that his business venture would also concentrate on helping those marginalized by society. ""I realized that in society there is this gap. Where once you have a criminal record you are unable to live a normal life, you are unable to integrate back to society,"" he says. ""We are able to provide training and give them their self-respect which they lost many, many years ago."" Before setting up Eighteen Chefs, Teo trained at Fifteen, Jamie Oliver's London restaurant. He then went on to run a 200-seater Chinese restaurant, with 80% of the staff having a criminal record. However, Teo found that the high number of ex-offenders was too difficult to manage. His first Eighteen Chefs establishment started off with a smaller proportion, 35% in 2012, and now 50% of his employees are troubled young people and people with criminal records. There have been a number of success stories among staff, one of Teo's employees began as a server and is now a regional manager at an international restaurant earning more than $6,000 a month. Teo does not even mind if his employees steal recipes and ideas from him to start up their own small businesses, he's just happy they aren't going back to their old ways. While his new life is free of his old habits and addictions, his restaurants retain an allusion to his former ways: the number 18 refers to a well-known Singaporean street gang. But rather than advocate his breaking bad past, he would rather young people tempted by a thug life would pick up a pan and chopping knife rather than a switchblade.","When Benny Se Teo was released from prison it was impossible to find a job .

"(CNN) -- Physician-assisted suicide is legal in four U.S. states and in one county of a fifth state. It is an option given to individuals by state law in Oregon, Vermont, and Washington. Individuals must have a terminal illness as well as a prognosis of six months or less to live. Physicians cannot be prosecuted for prescribing medications to hasten death. Similar Montana and New Mexico court rulings are based on judicial decision and do not mention a time line. Mandated by State Law: . Oregon . Vermont . Washington . Mandated by Court Ruling: . Montana . New Mexico - Bernalillo County only . Other Facts: . The specific method in each state varies, but mainly involves a prescription from a licensed physician approved by the state in which the patient is a resident. Physician-assisted suicide differs from euthanasia, which is defined as the act of assisting people with their death in order to end their suffering, but without the backing of a controlling legal authority. In Oregon, ""the physician must be a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) licensed to practice medicine by the Board of Medical Examiners for the State of Oregon. The physician must also be willing to participate in the Act."" In Vermont, ""only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy licensed to practice medicine in Washington may write this prescription...A physician, nurse, pharmacist, or other person shall not be under any duty, by law or contract, to participate in the provision of a lethal dose of medication to a patient."" In Washington, ""only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy licensed to practice medicine in Washington may write this prescription...participation is entirely voluntary. Health care providers are not required to provide prescriptions or medications to qualified patients."" Statistics: . The process of reporting applications and deaths also varies by state. Only those states where physician-assisted suicide is mandated by law have a reporting process. Oregon has had a physician-assisted suicide law on the books since 1997, and has shown a steady increase in both prescription recipients and the number of deaths. At its height, in the year 2012, 85 deaths from physician-assisted suicide were reported. According to the 2013 annual report, since 1997, prescriptions have been written for 1,173 people and there have been 752 reported deaths. Washington - According to the 2013 annual report, since 2009 prescriptions have been written for 549 people and there have been 525 reported deaths. Vermont - Since May 2013, physician reporting forms have been completed for two people, according to the Department of Health. Timeline: . June 1997 - The U.S. Supreme Court rules that state laws banning physician-assisted suicide do not violate the Constitution in the case Washington v. Glucksberg. The court left the matter of the constitutionality of a right to a physician's aid in dying to the states. October 27, 1997 - Oregon's Death with Dignity Act becomes law. Passed in a 1994 election with 51% of voters in favor, the law was delayed initially because U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan issued an injunction and then ruled it unconstitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling and the injunction was lifted when the U.S. Supreme Court referred the matter back to the state in 1997. November 1998 - American pathologist and assisted suicide advocate, Jack Kevorkian, known as ""Dr. Death,"" videotapes the death of Thomas Youk, submits it to CBS's 60 Minutes, and it is broadcast on television. The airing prompts murder charges against Kevorkian, rather than assisted suicide charges, because Kevorkian injected the drug into Youk, who had Lou Gehrig's disease. March 26, 1999 - Kevorkian is convicted of second degree murder and delivery of a controlled substance. He serves eight years of a 10 to 25 year sentence. November 4, 2008 - Washington's initiative, the Death with Dignity Act, is passed with 57.91% of voters in favor. March 5, 2009 - The Washington Death with Dignity Act goes into effect. December 31, 2009 - A Montana Supreme Court ruling in the case Baxter v. Montana asserts that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act protects a physician who prescribes aid from liability. November 2012 - In Massachusetts, a death with dignity initiative appears on the November 2012 ballot. It is defeated by a slim margin with 51% voting against it. May 20, 2013 - Vermont signs the Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act into law.

"(CNN) -- Long before our traveling friends had Facebook and Instagram to taunt us, they had postcards. So what better way to celebrate World Post Day, marked annually on October 9, than thumbing through one of the biggest archives of postcards ever amassed? Swiss entrepreneur Adolf Feller began collecting the cards at the end of the 19th century as souvenirs from trips taken to expand his electrical goods business. Friends and relatives soon pitched in to help supplement his hoard, which passed to his daughter, Elizabeth, on his death in 1931. The collection contains more than 54,000 monochrome and colorful over-painted photographs depicting scenes from 140 countries, including New Zealand, Canada and Uganda. Some of the best postcards have been gathered in a book, ""The World in Pocket-Size Format: The Adolf Feller Postcard Collection,"" by Monika Burri. It's available from Swiss company Scheidegger and Spiess. World Post Day celebrates the anniversary of the 1874 creation of the Universal Postal Union, an international organization linking mail services around the world. Postcards appeared about the same time, with picture postcards following soon after. Accidents and natural disasters . Back then, postcards weren't just for stirring envy among friends and relations. They were often used to send day-to-day messages rather than just greetings from vacation spots. As well as idyllic scenes, Feller's collection depicts cultural differences and news events, such as accidents and natural disasters. Such postcards were often gathered in albums as mementos in the same way that subsequent generations would collect family vacation snaps. Sadly, the sending of postcards is now a tradition in decline. In 1951, 4.5 billion were delivered in the United States, falling to 1.4 billion in 2010 and fewer than 1 billion today. It's interesting to speculate how Feller would've adapted to the world of online updates. As a businessman whose work involved technology, it's possible he would've been ahead of the curve, tweeting and uploading images from his travels. Then again, such was his enthusiasm for his collection, a post-postcard world might've lacked the same appeal.","October 9 is World Post Day, celebrating the 1874 creation of the first postal union .

"(CNN) -- ISIS has made huge territorial gains in the border areas between Iraq and Syria during the past month, as well as capturing strategic cities such as Mosul and Tikrit. Now its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has changed the group's name from the previous ""Islamic State of Iraq and Ash-Sham"" to ""Islamic State."" He has also appointed himself ""caliph"" and declared the re-establishment of the caliphate. The caliphate is the term used by some Muslims to mean an Islamic State intended to unify the global Muslim population (known as the ummah). It is viewed as the succession to the state founded after the Prophet Mohammed's death and, according to Islamists, is to be governed by one interpretation of Sharia. The first four caliphs were considered to be Rashidun or ""rightly-guided"" and especially pious. Subsequent empires controlled by the Umayyads, the Abbasids and the Ottomans each claimed control of the caliphate but failed to be universally recognized by Muslims. When the Ottoman Empire collapsed in 1924, AtatÃ¼rk declared Turkey a republic and abolished the caliphate system. While the Ahmadiyya, a small Islamic religious movement, has claimed a spiritual caliphate for most of the last century and the King of Morocco refers to himself as amir al muminin (leader of the faithful), a term normally reserved for the caliph, since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, no real attempt has been made to re-establish what was lost with the fall of the Ottomans. The historical significance of the caliphate, therefore, makes this a huge claim, a risky move, and a crucial point in ISIS's short history. Its ambition and its professed success may well cause the group as many problems as it does find solutions. If the so-called Islamic State (IS) fails to gain widespread support from Muslims, it will lack the legitimacy it so craves. According to the binary jihadist doctrine of al Qaeda -- seeing the world as Muslim or non-Muslim -- al-Baghdadi will either be seen as the caliph worthy of following or as an imposter worthy of fighting. If you were to follow the revolutionary Islamist doctrine of groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, and yet not consider the new caliphate legitimate, ""IS"" is an infidel state that must be removed. If ""IS"" were to follow the letter of their own ideology, it would have to punish all rebellion with death. For ""IS,"" legitimacy will be gained through exploitation of religion, political manipulation of historical narratives, and the violent quashing of dissent. Jihadist infighting is guaranteed over the coming months and Syria and Iraq's future looks even bloodier than the last 11 years. On top of these intra-Islamist disagreements, the so-called caliphate will struggle in much the same way as other pretenders to Islamic statehood have over the last 50 years. ""IS"" will have difficulty implementing a narrow jihadist interpretation of Sharia, replete with barbaric punishments for dissenters, as state law. It is building hospitals and has established a radio station, but will likely fail to deliver any meaningful level of social justice in Iraqi and Syrian society. It also faces a well-organized counter-offensive from the Iraqi army in Tikrit and any level of military loss would immediately undermine the legitimacy of the new caliph. In much the same way as governments worldwide, ""IS"" will quickly learn that opposition is a much easier position to hold than government. It is clear from this declaration that al-Baghdadi has over-estimated the level of support that he has among Muslims. He will hope that his declaration will lead to more Sunni Muslims in Iraq and Syria pledging allegiance to him. This must also be seen in conjunction with the group's media and social media strategy to engage increasing numbers of Muslims around the world and, thereby, boost their recruitment of foreign fighters. A further factor affecting support for ISIS will be the reception of this declaration in countries like Jordan and Morocco (whose rulers are considered to be the direct descendants of the Prophet Mohammed) and in Lebanon or Saudi Arabia, where sectarian chaos and destabilization could be the result, given ""IS's"" continued rhetoric about the lack of legitimacy of existing Muslim-majority countries. If more foreign fighters flock to join ""IS,"" they are likely to stay there in the short term. Opinion: How to keep ISIS terror from U.S. shores . The worry for the rest of the world is that, if ""IS"" manages to consolidate its territory and preserve its legitimacy, an offensive jihad against all other countries will then be considered viable. Most interesting though will be the reaction of al Qaeda. Although it is clear from statements by its leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in February and May that al Qaeda would remain distinct from ISIS, the claim of the caliphate's establishment will change the dynamic of this relationship, and may prompt the leaders of some of the regional affiliates to change their allegiance from Zawahiri to Baghdadi. Al Qaeda will now want to challenge ISIS's appropriation of its key objectives and tactics. The only way for al Qaeda to stay relevant now is through a violent and spectacular attack. Although ISIS may eventually be a victim of its own success, the real victims will be the thousands of innocent Muslims and non-Muslims caught in the crossfire of this millennarian struggle.

"(CNN) -- One of the most cosmopolitan cities in Africa, Johannesburg is multicultural and multifaceted. Make the most of your time there with these tips. The Apartheid Museum is an often disturbing view of South Africa's troubled past. Apartheid Museum It's a disturbing experience, but a visit to Apartheid Museum is essential if you want to understand the city's troubled past. On arrival, visitors are randomly allocated a pass labeling them as white or non-white, referencing the apartheid pass laws that obliged black South Africans to carry identity passes at all times. Harrowing multimedia displays and news footage recreate the brutality of the apartheid era, while nooses hanging from the ceiling represent the political prisoners executed under the system. Less bleak are the tributes to those who fought against the injustice of that era, paving the way for equality and democracy in today's South Africa. The museum is open between 10 am and 5 pm (GMT +2) Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is R30 ($3.20). For more information visit http://www.apartheidmuseum.org/ . Meaty treat The Carnivore is one of the city's more unusual restaurants. A few miles outside Jo' burg proper, on the Muldersdrift Estate, The Carnivore is designed to satisfy your primal meat cravings. As well as the usual chicken, lamb and beef dishes, this eatery offers an intriguing selection of big game dishes, including crocodile, giraffe and ostrich. There are veggie options available for those who aren't tempted by the thought of slow-roasted impala, but if you choose the vegetable lasagna you may never find out if crocodile really does take like chicken. See Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg » . Day tripping Jo' burg is well positioned for some interesting day trips. Pretoria is just 50km away, but has a very different to feel to Johannesburg, offering more of an insight into Afrikaans history. The Voortrekker monument and museum, just outside the city, celebrate the pioneer spirit of the Boer and their ""Great Trek"" from the Cape to the country's interior. If African wildlife is more your scene, head to The Lion Park, a small nature reserve about 25km north of Johannesburg. It's not the full safari experience, but you will get to see lions, cheetahs, antelopes, zebra and impala, among other local fauna. What are your tips for Johannesburg? Let us know below. Get around Too big to explore on foot, Jo' burg is a driver's city. Public transport is generally poor and minibus taxis and the Metro train are crime hotspots. There are plenty of car-hire outlets in the city but if you'd prefer someone else to do the driving City Tours offer minibuses to destinations including Soweto and The Lion Park. The advantage of a tour is that your guides can offer a local's insight into the city's history and culture. Crime There's no doubt that progress has been made in reducing crime over the last couple of years, but it remains a problem in many parts of the city. ATMs are a magnet for criminals. Be sure to only use ATMs in well-lit areas and be wary of people offering to help you use them. If you're driving, keep the car doors locked at all times and don't open the windows too wide. Keep your wits about you when stopped at traffic lights and when you're getting into and out of the car, and keep your valuables out of sight. Put bluntly, it is not safe to walk around most of Johannesburg after dark.","A visit to the Apartheid Museum offers an insight into the city's troubled past .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Hugh Masekela is the legendary South African musician whose songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid. He tells CNN about growing up under apartheid, why he left South Africa and what is was like to move back to Johannesburg after 30 years away. Hugh Masekela: ""The people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom."" CNN: How did the suffering of the apartheid influence your art? Hugh Masekela: I don't think what I do is influenced by suffering. I come from a talented people who are prolific in music and dance. We have wonderful singers and we have a diversity of music here that is just amazing. But in spite of being oppressed these people were very resilient and they were mostly resilient through song. I think we are the only society where music played such a major part in our resistance. We grew up in rallies and in the street. We didn't have televisions so we played in the streets and made up songs about what was happening. Watch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg ». CNN: What's your earliest memory of Johannesburg? HM: I came to Jo' burg from Springs [a town near Johannesburg]. My family moved to Alexandra township and the first time I went to town alone I must have been 10 or 11. Jo' burg used to be scrubbed every night with fire hoses and those hard brooms and the granite on the sidewalks would always sparkle. I remember that because I came from Alexander township where there were no lights, no sewage and no cafes. The most vivid memory I have -- we used to stop and look through restaurant windows at the white people eating fancy food, and we'd say ""what do you think that is?"" and ""there are so many types of food!"" CNN: How did it feel to leave South Africa? HM: When I left South Africa in 1960 I was 20 years old. I wanted to try to get an education and music education was not available for me in South Africa. I wanted to learn from the same kind of teachers that taught Miles Davis and Clifford Brown and Chad Baker and they were not in South Africa. I hoped that one day I could go and learn some of those things and then come back and teach. It was a rough time, when the apartheid government first started showing that if you don't behave, they'll shoot you -- women and children too. You saw police with guns, with machine guns, and for the first time you saw tanks. We had a group called the Jazz Epistles and we were about to take off on a national tour. We were the first African group to play on an LP, but gatherings of more than 10 people were banned so we couldn't do our tour. But four years later, when I was ready to come back to South Africa, I couldn't. The place was impenetrable. By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to. See Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg » . CNN: Tell us about coming home. HM: It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa and we were not naive about it. It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening. When I left South Africa there were 10 million people -- when I came back there were more than 40 million. I had to learn how to get to the highways because when I left where there were no highways. And I had to adjust my language because people would say ""we don't' talk like that anymore!"" I was like a sponge trying to learn to do the right things. Not many people came back from exile compared with those who left. About a million left -- 50,000 came back, and of those about 25,000 did a U-turn because it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy but it's been a great experience. CNN: How would you define the culture of Jo' burg? HM: There's no one culture -- it's a cosmopolitan city. It's so diverse, like South Africa itself has so many diverse cultures. But again, we are still living in the culture of ethnic grouping. If we could beat that and have a major festival of tolerance, it would be the shining path. CNN: Where do you like to go out in Jo' burg? HM: I go to Newtown, I go to the Market Theater a lot, and also to the Dance Forum, because we have very brilliant dance choreographers. Old Jo' burg was vibrant, there were things going on all the time -- concerts, festivals, clubs -- but in the last 10 years or so it has become a very quiet city at night. CNN: What is life like in the city? HM: It's not very easy to enjoy the city because the safety and security is not such that you can just go anywhere any time. There's a sadness about this city that everybody talks about. People in South Africa have become inward; they spend most of the time in their homes. When it gets dark, everyone wants to go home as quickly as they can. That is not only Jo' burg's problem, it is a national problem. What we're talking about doesn't make me very popular with the people who run this country, but it's nothing new -- you see it in the newspapers every day. It has to be fixed, because the people of South Africa deserve entertainment, recreation and freedom to enjoy the beauty of their country and to show guests around and say ""this is my country.""","Hugh Masekela songs were an inspiration in the fight to end apartheid .

M: Early on, when I wanted to go back to London and start my own fashion house, a very well thought-of executive in the industry said to me: ""Name one female designer that's come from Great Britain that has had any kind of global success."" I wanted to prove him wrong. Obviously there have been great women from Britain in design, but actually there are fewer than I thought. So that was a bit of a hurdle for me. From day one I've never worked with leather or fur. I don't work with PVC, and I'm very conscious in the sourcing and manufacturing of fashion. That's a hurdle, that's a challenge, but it's a worthwhile one. CNN: Do you feel a lot of pressure from the industry because you chose to go down the ""sustainable fashion"" road? M: It's been difficult, it continues to be difficult, but I'm OK with difficult, it's what keeps me on my toes. I've had people say to me: ""You'll never sell handbags, you don't work with leather and leather is luxury."" To me it's the complete opposite, leather is everywhere, it's so cheap a material, it's so mass produced. Over 50 million animals a year are killed just for fashion. For me it doesn't have a luxury element to it. CNN: So you're comfortable flipping that notion on its head, that leather is luxury? M: Lots of things have been around for a long time, that doesn't mean they have to stick around forever. When you're in design it's your job is to change, to push, to modernize. The fashion industry, is not really as accountable for some reason. We're not expected to have to answer to the fact that it's not sustainable to kill that many animals for shoes and bags. And it's not necessary! Ninety percent of the people who come to my stores have no idea I don't work with leather. Being told no . CNN: You get very steely when you talk about people telling you you can't do something. M: Doesn't everyone, who likes being told they can't do something? Anyone can do anything they want, if they really want it. I'm not going to pretend I didn't come from a privileged starting point. I'll always admit that it was easier for me to question people telling me I couldn't do something because I had a pretty nice place to fall back on. So maybe that afforded me a little more spark and fight. I'm learning as I get older, that you don't have to try to fight everything from a man's place. I guess I got here for a reason, it wasn't because I was a woman. More: Bobbi Brown's billion-dollar idea .","McCartney talks about the influence of her famous parents on her fashion career .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Eman al-Obeidy, who garnered worldwide attention for her vocal rape allegations against the regime of Moammar Gadhafi, says she has fled Libya, fearing for her safety. Al-Obeidy told CNN that she crossed into Tunisia on Thursday with the help of a defecting military officer and his family. She said she had left Tripoli in a military car, wearing a head cover that hid everything except one eye. Al-Obeidy said she entered at the Dahibah border crossing disguised ""in the local manner"" and was not challenged. She described the trip from Tripoli as ""very tiring."" Along the road to Tunisia, the car she was in was stopped several times at checkpoints, al-Obeidy said. The military officer would show his permit, and they would be allowed to continue, she said. Al-Obeidy said she crossed into Tunisia using a refugee document. European diplomats drove her from the border region to Tunis and are giving her sanctuary, there while she considers her future, according to Western diplomatic sources. She said she was afraid she was being followed and might still be in danger, adding that she hoped she could obtain protection from a Western government. ""I still do not know what I am going to do. Of course I'd like to see my family,"" she said. Al-Obeidy's mother learned about her daughter's escape after seeing news reports on TV, her father told CNN from the family's hometown of Tobruk, Libya. Atiq Al-Obeidy said that his wife then called him, and both parents were overjoyed. Atiq Al-Obeidy admitted he was ""not optimistic"" that his daughter would be able to safely leave Libya, thinking forces loyal to Gadhafi ""would do the worst to her, given his past."" ""I am extremely delighted, and I will be looking forward to more information about how she was able to escape,"" the woman's father said. Eman al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli, while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men. In an interview with CNN last month, she said she felt defeated and lived in fear that she would be punished gravely for her words. ""I usually get harassed when I have to show my Identification card to government officials somewhere, and they find out who I am and that I have put complaints forward against Gadhafi's people,"" she said. ""They humiliate me to the point where other people gather around and start saying that it is shameful to treat a Libyan woman that way."" The legal proceedings in her rape case have not gone far, she said last month. She also had not been able to go home.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- They're known as trademark ""squatters"" and they've long caused headaches for foreign companies entering the Chinese market. Savvy to China's complex trademark laws, these individuals target valuable foreign brands and register them as trademarks in China. When international companies want to launch their products on the Chinese market, they're often left with little choice but to cough up huge sums to buy back the trademark, rebrand their product or fight for the right to use the brand through lengthy legal battles. One of Australia's most popular wine brands, Penfolds, is currently at the center of a legal dispute over the use of its own name in China. Treasury Wine Estates, the owner of the wine, said this week that someone in China has claimed ownership of the Chinese name for Penfolds -- Ben Fu -- a transliteration that means ""chasing prosperity."" The company is engaged in legal action with the individual to ""ensure the integrity of the brand is protected,"" a spokesperson for Treasury told CNN in an emailed statement. Notorious squatter . That individual, according to the Australian Financial Review, which first broke the story, is a ""notorious trademark squatter"" named Li Daozhi. A Spanish-Chinese wine distributor, Li won a similar case against a French winemaker last year. Treasury is confident it is the lawful owner of the trademark, the company's spokesperson said, and the Australian winemaker did initially win a court case allowing it to use the Chinese name for its wine in China. But Li is now appealing the decision, according to the AFR. ""It will take some time for the Chinese legal system to process this matter,"" Treasury said. Treasury's case and the many others that have made headlines in recent years should be a warning to foreign companies of the risks they can be exposed to if they fail to familiarize themselves with trademark laws in one of the world's largest consumer markets, legal experts say. 'First to file' wins . Many foreign businesses have come unstuck because China's trademark laws follow a ""first to file"" principle. That means whoever has a trademark registration approved first in China, owns the rights to that trademark. This differs from countries like the United States and many Commonwealth countries that follow a common law system, where a person registering a trademark also has to show they've used, or plan to use the mark in business. But companies do have opportunities to challenge trademarks already registered in China. One option is to prove the individual deliberately claimed ownership of the brand with the intention of blackmailing a foreign brand entering the market. Another is to show that the brand was already well-known when the trademark was registered. In practice, convincing a court on these points has proved difficult for many companies, but legal experts believe recent amendments to China's trademark laws, among other factors, could improve trademark protection for foreign brands. Here are some of the most recent, prominent cases. Tesla . Earlier this month, Chinese businessman Zhan Baosheng reportedly sued U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla for illegally using its own name, and demanded that the company stop all car sales and marketing activities in China. Zhan, who has a history of filing trademarks for names used by foreign brands, is seeking 23.9 million yuan (US$3.84 million) from Tesla. He says he filed for the right to use the English name Telsa in 2006, and planned to manufacture an electric car named after the inventor Nikola Tesla. He later applied to register related trademarks, including a Chinese transliteration of the name and the U.S. auto manufacturer's logo. Tesla, which launched its Model S luxury electric car in China last year, says its claim to the name has already been upheld by other Chinese authorities and the lawsuit is without merit. A Beijing court is due to hold an appeal hearing on August 5. Pfizer . Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer fought an 11-year trademark, patent and 3-D trademark battle over the Viagra brand after it failed to register the Chinese name for the erectile dysfunction drug before it introduced the product on the Chinese market in 2000. It won the patent and 3-D trademark litigation but lost the trademark case because it couldn't provide sufficient evidence to show it had become well-known among Chinese consumers under the name Weige (meaning ""mighty brother""). For similar reasons, luxury retailer HÃ¨rmes and whisky brand Chivas Regal have lost bids to stop clothing manufacturers from selling products under their names. Singers and sports stars . Celebrities aren't immune either. A man in Guangzhou owns the right to use the name of Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber, while the names of World Cup stars like Germany's Philipp Lahm and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo are used to promote products ranging from shoes to pesticide, according to China Daily. Two years ago, U.S. basketball legend Michael Jordan filed a lawsuit against a sportswear company called Qiaodan Sports (a transliteration of Jordan's name). The multi-million dollar company even registered trademarks for the names of his two sons, Jeffrey and Markus (Jiefuli Qiaodan and Makusi Qiaodan). And it's not only foreign stars who have been affected. In 2006, Chinese NBA star Yao Ming managed to block the trademarking of his name on a line of women's sanitary products. Castel FrÃ¨res . In the largest trademark litigation case in China's wine industry to date, French winemaker, Castel FrÃ¨res had to completely rebrand its wines in China after losing a four-year legal battle to Li Daozhi, the defendant in the Penfolds case. Li's company reportedly registered ""Kasite"" to import Spanish wines, and later French wines, into China about 15 years ago. Around the same time, Castel began bottling wine in China and became known to Chinese consumers by the same Chinese name. (In a market where many consumers don't read Latin letters, Chinese characters hold much more sway when it comes to brand recognition.) Li reportedly offered to sell the trademark to Castel for 1 million euros ($1.3 million). Castel refused the offer and chose to sue Li in 2005, arguing that his company had not used the Kasite name in three years. Li subsequently sued Castel for trademark infringement and was awarded 33.73 million yuan (US$5 million) by a Zhejiang court last year. But China's supreme court overturned the verdict and has ordered a retrial, which is still pending. In the meantime, Castel has registered a new Chinese trademark, ""Kasidaile."" Will things improve? New amendments to China's trademark laws that came into effect in May this year could make things easier for foreign companies. ""The extent of which we're not sure,"" said Deanna Wong, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells, because there haven't been any major decisions handed down subsequent to the changes. Stan Abrams, Asia legal counsel at Bentley Systems in Beijing, said the laws will make things easier, but the number one reason these kind of disputes are likely to decrease is that companies are better informed about navigating the Chinese market these days. ""A lot of (these disputes) originated years and years ago. It's been a multi-year process of litigation,"" Abrams said. ""In some cases, when you're talking about companies from common law countries, they came over here and were really unfamiliar with the legal system. They didn't realize it was a file-first system."" ""A lot of them didn't do their homework and were making crazy mistakes when using their foreign names in the local market."" Overseas companies better understand what evidence they need to make a good case these days, added Wong. What can foreign companies do? For many companies it's probably already too late to assert their rights over their brands, according to Abrams. ""For a lot of them, unfortunately the answer is invest in time travel technology because if you have a problem the chances are the roots of it are years old."" Those companies should take steps to find out immediately where they stand right now, he added. It's easy to do a free, informal search of China's online trademark database. If the trademark has already been registered by someone else, companies will have to go through ""painful"" legal proceedings that could take several years. If the company loses, it faces the choice of shelling out a lot of money to buy the trademark or rebranding. Companies should make sure they have the right advice on the ground, that takes into consideration their long-term business strategy, such as any new markets the brand may enter in the future, said Wong. Even for companies that don't have global or local help there's a wealth of information that they can access on the internet these days, in ways that most businesses 15 or even 10 years ago couldn't, said Abrams. While the cost of registering a trademark is miniscule compared to the amount a company could end up paying in legal fees, Abrams points out that not all companies, especially start-ups, have the financial flexibility to ensure all their brands have comprehensive trademark coverage. For those companies, he suggested getting minimal coverage for core brands and expanding from there. ""You just have to be smart about it,"" he said.","Many register trademarks of well-known foreign brands in China to sell them for large sums .

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch has apologized for a ""grotesque, offensive"" cartoon of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu published in Britain's Sunday Times. The cartoon by Gerald Scarfe depicts Netanyahu atop an incomplete brick wall with screaming Palestinians and body parts in the mortar. Netanyahu is holding what appears to be a bloody builder's trowel and the wall's mortar is colored red. The wording beneath reads: ""Israeli Elections, Will Cementing Peace Continue?"" The cartoon was published on Holocaust Memorial Day on Sunday and prompted complaints that it was anti-Semitic and insensitive. Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, which owns The Sunday Times, used his Twitter feed to apologize, tweeting: ""Gerald Scarfe has never reflected the opinions of the Sunday Times. Nevertheless, we owe major apology for grotesque, offensive cartoon."" Scarfe, who has worked for the Sunday Times since 1967, is perhaps best-known for designing and directing the animation for the film of Pink Floyd's The Wall. Martin Ivens, the acting editor of the Sunday Times, also apologized, saying in a statement: ""The last thing I or anyone connected with the Sunday Times would countenance would be insulting the memory of the Shoah [Holocaust] or invoking the blood libel. ""The paper has long written strongly in defense of Israel and its security concerns, as have I as a columnist. We are however reminded of the sensitivities in this area by the reaction to the cartoon and I will of course bear them very carefully in mind in future."" The weekday edition of The Times reported Tuesday that Ivens would meet representatives of the Jewish community to apologize. In a statement posted on his website, Scarfe said: ""First of all I am not, and never have been, anti-Semitic. The Sunday Times has given me the freedom of speech over the last 46 years to criticize world leaders for what I see as their wrong-doings. ""This drawing was a criticism of Netanyahu, and not of the Jewish people: there was no slight whatsoever intended against them. I was, however, stupidly completely unaware that it would be printed on Holocaust Day, and I apologize for the very unfortunate timing."" In the Jewish Chronicle, editor Stephen Pollard wrote that the cartoon did ""slip over the edge into anti-Semitism, because it invokes the blood libel."" Blood libel refers to a long-standing anti-Semitic myth that Jews murder children to use their blood in religious rituals. ""The blood libel is central to the history of anti-Semitism. I don't think Scarfe is an idiot -- far from it. So I find it impossible to believe he was unaware of the resonances of his cartoon,"" Pollard said. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had lodged a complaint with Britain's press watchdog -- the Press Complaints Commission. The cartoon, it said, was ""shockingly reminiscent of the blood libel imagery more usually found in parts of the virulently anti-Semitic Arab press. Its use is all the more disgusting on Holocaust Memorial Day, given the similar tropes leveled against Jews by the Nazis."" Meanwhile, an article by Anshe Pfeffer in Israeli newspaper Haaretz branded the cartoon ""grossly offensive and unfair"" but said it was not anti-Semitic. Pfeffner wrote that the cartoon was not directed at Jews, did not use Holocaust imagery and did not contain blood libel components. He said there was no discrimination in the sense that Scarfe's depiction of Netanyahu was ""par for the course for any politician when Scarfe is at his drawing board."" However, the Times of Israel quoted the director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israel Office -- Efraim Zuroff -- as saying the ""anti-Semitic caricature of Netanyahu"" was ""absolutely disgusting.""","News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch has apologized for ""grotesque"" cartoon .

"(CNN) -- Did you set your clocks back this morning? If you forgot, you may want to go ahead and do it now. Don't feel like you're being rude; we'll wait right here for you. There. You have now given yourself the illusion -- as all of us do, every spring and autumn as we adjust our clocks and watches -- that you are in control of the concept of time. But that's a battle that we all seem to have lost a while ago. Every technological advance fools us into thinking that we have conquered time, that we have made it our servant. Yet there is this nagging feeling that it is we who have somehow become enslaved. We suspect that our time is not, in fact, our own -- that it is some alien creature that has overcome us and altered us. We are constantly, as if against our wills, in a rush to be in a bigger rush. So why, then, does each day's invisible finish line seem farther and farther away? The other morning, I was in an airport when I saw an artifact from a dying era, something as evocative, in its own way, as the crumbling edifices of ancient Rome. The artifact in the airport had been disabled, ready to be hauled off to the scrap heap. Its name was printed upon it: ""AT&T Public Phone 2000."" You may be familiar with the contraption. In the early 1990s, when 2000 still seemed distant and exotic, AT&T started installing the things in airports across the U.S. The AT&T Public Phone 2000 was far more advanced than a traditional pay telephone. It featured a glass screen, which blinked madly at passing men and women, inviting them to come hither. It featured a keyboard. It had a wide bench seat. The idea was that the business traveler with an extra few minutes before his or her flight could sit down, insert a credit card, and -- here was the magical part -- send a written message to friends and associates in other parts of the country. They were big and bulky and undoubtedly expensive to produce, and soon enough they became all but useless because people now carry tiny personal versions of those machines in their pockets. Which is why the wiring had been cut on the AT&T Public Phone 2000 that I saw the other day, and why it sat there in the terminal, unavailable for use. Our ability to reach each other in a millisecond, and to reach the world at large, has progressed so rapidly that we didn't seem to fully notice as it happened. One day we were walking down city streets making eye contact with each other, taking in the local scenery, and the next we were staring at the screens of our hypnotic phones, receiving real-time messages and breaking-news updates from people hundreds of miles away. It was a tradeoff we didn't exactly ask for. Yes, the concept of distance was all but erased -- but so, in a way, was the concept of place. We were sold the notion that we could be anywhere, with the tap of a key. What we only gradually began to recognize was that, by being everywhere, sometimes it felt like we were nowhere. Any delay began to feel unacceptable. Most of us grew up accustomed to having to wait for letters in the U.S. mail; when e-mail made that largely unnecessary, we told ourselves that the new speed of electronic correspondence was satisfying and ideal. But then came instant messages, which were. . .well, instant. This was all supposed to save us time. Yet do you feel as if time is something you have mastered? Do you believe that you have many more free hours to yourself now? Have the ever-sleeker-and-smaller machines and the ever-more-potent software cleared your schedule, made you a man or woman of leisure? Or do you sometimes worry that you are working for your handheld communication device, instead of the other way around? ""What's new?"" has ceased to be a casual pleasantry, and has become an urgent demand. Indeed, the word ""new"" itself has lost its punch; in marketing campaigns, the adjective ""new"" has increasingly been tossed aside and replaced by the adjective ""next."" ""New"" now seems somehow old. At family gatherings and get-togethers of friends, something is happening that would have seemed outlandish even a few years ago. People at the parties are posting photos and videos of the events on social networking sites even as the parties are still going on. Thus, friends and acquaintances around the country and around the world are looking at the party pictures and videos and evaluating them before the party is even over. And people who are at the parties themselves, checking in on the same social network sites, are looking at the publicly posted pictures of the party they are still attending. It's like a bizarre form of proactive nostalgia for something that hasn't finished taking place yet. Some day soon, even this will seem quaint and outmoded; some day soon, this current ability to be constantly in touch will feel creaky and broken-down, like the AT&T Public Phone 2000 that was ready to be carted out of the airport. Right around the next corner -- someone is already working on it -- the next generation of technology is almost ready, with the promise of compressing time and space in ways that will make us dizzy. And yet: Has all of this increased your ability to take a deep breath, to relax, to savor the time that is available to you? Did all of the rushing deliver you to someplace better? Now. . .how did we get started on this? Oh. Of course. Did you set your clocks back this morning? You don't want to let time get away from you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","CNN contributor reflects on time as we set our clocks back an hour .

"(CNN) -- As about 2% of babies born in the United States do, Alex Resnick failed the routine newborn hearing screening he received before he left the hospital. At first his parents didn't think much of it, since the nurse told them further testing often shows the baby is fine. But six weeks later when those additional tests showed Alex had moderate to severe hearing loss, his mother's heart sank. ""It was like somebody knocked the wind out of me,"" Haleh Resnick remembers. Resnick and her husband, Jeff, immediately had Alex fitted for hearing aids, as recommended by his doctor, and that's when she noticed something strange. Whenever her baby wore the hearing aids, he flinched at loud noises. Plus, he seemed to hear just fine when he wasn't wearing the aids -- for example, Alex would turn around when his mother shook a rattle several feet behind his back. (Alex isn't his real name; his parents want to protect his privacy) ""He's my fifth child, and I knew he could hear just fine,"" Resnick says. ""When I said this to his doctors and audiologists, they told me I was in denial and I needed to learn to accept his diagnosis."" But it turned out Resnick was right. She drove Alex from their Cherry Hill, New Jersey, home to a specialist at Children's Hospital in Boston, who diagnosed a condition called auditory neuropathy. The doctor said the hearing aids weren't helping him -- in fact, they were hurting him by over-amplifying sounds -- and she told the Resnicks to stop using them immediately. Pediatric hearing experts say too many doctors and audiologists are missing the diagnosis of auditory neuropathy, which has  been recognized only relatively recently, and damaging children's hearing by giving them hearing aids that blast babies' ears with loud noise. ""Four to six times a week I get calls from parents with stories like this,"" says Charles Berlin, a research professor in the department of communications sciences and disorders at the University of South Florida. ""There are cases where hearing aids have actually destroyed the hearing of children with auditory neuropathy."" Misdiagnoses happen too often . Routine screening of newborns for hearing loss, which is required in most states, has helped thousands of babies each year by getting them hearing aids and other treatments early, giving them a better chance of developing speech. But many pediatric hearing experts worry the flip side to newborn screening is that children with auditory neuropathy, who make up a sizable minority of the 12,000 babies born each year with hearing loss, get swept into the much larger group of children with typical hearing loss. In auditory neuropathy, the sound enters the inner ear normally, but the transmission of those signals to the brain is impaired, according to the National Institutes of Health. For most children with auditory neuropathy, hearing aids can damage the ears by making sounds too loud, in much the same way sitting in a rock concert can hurt your ears, says Deborah Hayes, an audiologist and professor of physical medicine, rehabilitation and pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. People with auditory neuropathy hear sounds, but they're distorted. While the disease affects different people in different ways,this recording shows what some people with auditory neuropathy hear. Some children grow out of auditory neuropathy. For others it causes profound hearing loss. It's not known exactly how many children have the disorder, but Berlin, the lead author of a study of 260 children with auditory neuropathy, believes it affects nearly 15% of children with hearing loss. Like Berlin, Hayes says she sees many babies whose hearing loss is misdiagnosed and who are given hearing aids that can hurt them. ""I would like to say it doesn't happen that often, but it does,"" she says. A mother's story . Ironically, the parents who closely follow the doctor's orders end up damaging their child's hearing the most. ""If a very compliant parent puts the hearing aids on their baby every day, it can cause permanent damage within a week,"" Hayes says. Resnick, however, was noncompliant, putting the hearing aids on for only an hour or so a day for three weeks, since they bothered her baby, and in her heart she felt he heard just fine without them. ""If he'd been my first-born, I would have done exactly as the doctor said, but since he was my fifth, I went with my gut,"" she said. She says when she told Alex's doctors and audiologists he could hear sounds coming from behind him or around the corner, they said he was reacting to vibrations and instructed her to have him wear the hearing aids. She says they believed her only after Dr. Margaret Kenna, a professor of otology and laryngology at Harvard Medical School, diagnosed Alex's condition as auditory neuropathy. Today, Alex is 3, hears perfectly, and is bilingual, speaking English and Farsi, his mother's native language. While he's had speech therapy, other children with auditory neuropathy also benefit from cochlear implants and other treatments. Pediatric hearing experts say most children who are told to wear hearing aids do indeed need them, but here's what to do if your child has hearing loss and you suspect he might have auditory neuropathy. 1. Get educated about auditory neuropathy . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Nemours Foundation, and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders have general information about auditory neuropathy. 2. Talk to other parents . Learn from parents who've been there. The Auditory Neuropathy Information website is run by a nurse whose son has auditory neuropathy, and includes stories from parents whose children have the disorder. Resnick wrote about her experience with Alex in her book ""Little Patient Big Doctor."" 3. Trust your gut . If, like Resnick, you feel your child can hear and doesn't need hearing aids, tell your doctor and audiologist. If you feel they're not listening to you, find someone who will. ""The parents usually know, especially someone who's perceptive like (Alex's) mom,"" says Kenna, the doctor who diagnosed Resnick's son's condition. ""She was tuned into her baby, and you have to listen to that."" 4. Find a doctor familiar with auditory neuropathy . Even though auditory neuropathy was first named and fully described in 1996, and a major conference was held to discuss the disorder in 2008, many doctors and audiologists are still unaware of how to diagnose and treat it, pediatric hearing experts say. Testing for the disorder can be tricky, so Kenna recommends finding a pediatric hearing specialist who works at a university. ""You have to know how to give the tests correctly, and interpret the tests correctly,"" she says. ""Once you realize something is not as rare as you thought, you actually begin to look for it."" CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report.","Haleh Resnick found out that her son has been misdiagnosed with hearing loss .

"(CNN) -- Award-winning pianist Roger Williams, who played before nine U.S. presidents and recorded dozens of albums over his long career, died early Saturday in Los Angeles after a struggle with pancreatic cancer, his assistant said.

Even into his final weeks, Williams continued to perform and to champion such causes as music education. He had recently released an album and was under contract for three more, she said. ""There was never a man with a more tender, gentle heart,"" Heebner said. ""He was a charming man, even at the age of 87."" Born Louis Weertz in Omaha, Nebraska, the pianist attended Drake University and the Juilliard School in New York City. He then met Dave Kapp, the founder of Kapp Records, who suggested the musician change his name to Roger Williams, according to a biography on the Hit Parade Hall of Fame website. His break came in 1955 with his recording of ""Autumn Leaves,"" going on to have hits on the Billboard charts for four decades, according to his official website. His records include ""Born Free"" and themes from the movies ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Somewhere in Time."" Williams' success helped land him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a 2011 induction into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame and many other honors. He was also a workhorse performer, including long stints headlining shows in Las Vegas in which he played his characteristic blend of originals, classics and works from greats like Duke Ellington and more contemporary composers. Former first lady Nancy Reagan noted in a statement Saturday that Williams played for nine presidential administrations, including her husband's. She said Ronald Reagan and the pianist ""met as young men, each just getting started, and had been friends for decades."" ""Roger kept in touch long after we left in Washington,"" Nancy Reagan said, noting he performed ""many times at the Reagan Library."" ""Roger was a great pianist, a great American and a great friend,"" she said. According to Heebner, Williams played and practiced eight hours a day. She said he continued to do so into his final days, adding that his cancer didn't affect his sunny demeanor or sharp mind. ""His oncologist (recently) said his sickness hadn't done anything to his intelligence, his quick wit and his charm,"" Heebner said. ""He was an amazing person.""","Roger Williams dies Saturday after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his assistant says .

"(CNN) -- Over the past five years evictions have become a symbol of Spain's economic crisis, but the latest homeowner to face the prospect of homelessness -- an 85-year-old woman -- has found an unlikely guardian angel. One of the poorest football teams in Spain's top division, Madrid club Rayo Vallecano, has promised to help Carmen Martinez Ayuso find a new apartment after she was evicted by her landlord. From the Vallecas district of the Spanish capital, Ayuso had lived in the apartment for half a century but couldn't pay the rent after her son had used her home as collateral on a loan he was then unable to repay. According to statistics published by the Bank of Spain, 1,218 evictions took place between January and June 2014 -- an increase of 17% from the same period in the previous year. Back in 2012 it's estimated that there were up to 200 evictions a day as Spain suffered the consequences of a housing bubble that burst after the housing market crashed in 2007-2008, while unemployment also soared. Ayuso's story grabbed the attention of the club with fans holding aloft a banner which read ""Rayo against evictions"" in a recent league match. ""I know that there are lots of cases like hers,"" Rayo coach Paco Jemez told reporters. ""The worst thing that can happen to a family is when they evict you from your home,"" added Jemez. ""This is a lady who lived in her home for 50 years and due to her doing an honorable act -- being the guarantor of her son, which everyone in the world would undoubtedly do."" Jemez has been in touch with Ayuso, who according to Spanish media, was unaware of the $50,000 loan her son had taken out. He promised it wasn't just him that would try and help Ayuso, but that the ""the coaching staff, the players, the club"" would also become involved. Jemez added: ""Within our ability, we will help this lady and give her a hand so that she finds a place to live with dignity and so she doesn't feel alone. ""I'm very proud we can lend her a hand. I'd like to help more people, but that's impossible. ""What is within our power, we will do. Also, we will start an initiative so that anyone who wants to help will have the ability to lend a hand. We are very sensitive to this and what happened to her could happen to anyone."" Rayo has an annual budget of around $8.6 million -- a total which is incomparable to that of its big city neighbor Real Madrid which has a cool $720 million at its disposal. Speaking to Spanish newspaper Marca, Ayuso praised the club for the ""beautiful gesture."" She added: ""A thousand times thank you, God bless them,"" she said. ""It's a beautiful gesture that they didn't need to do and Viva el Rayo! ""If I see [Paco Jemez] I'll give him 40 kisses. But the only time I've seen him was during the neighborhood fairs. ""We always supported Rayo in this family. I remember when we used to go to the swimming pools, which were right next to the stadium. But now we have different motivations to support them. ""I'm certain my husband is showing his gratitude in heaven.""","Rayo Vallecano to help find new apartment for 85-year-old .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Are human beings set up to believe in a higher power? Some scientists say yes, based on either a ""faith gene"" or certain areas of the brain that light up on an MRI when people pray or think about God. But this is a highly destructive ""yes,"" because it reduces spirituality to a mechanical function like heart rate or the secretion of growth hormone. The same evidence fuels the arguments of atheists, who claim that if God is just a chemical reaction, it's time we quit believing in a deity. At the very least, they say, we should stop glorifying God, now that he (or she) has been demoted far below the exalted status one finds in the Bible and the rest of world scriptures. Oprah.com: Why you've gotta have faith . I think atheists are getting a lot of mileage out of a facile argument. In 1896, long before brain imaging and the discovery of DNA, the famous Harvard philosopher and psychologist William James published a lecture called ""The Will to Believe."" It contains one idea that is a revelation. James found a way for science to lead to God instead of defeating God. Let me give the revelation a context. James thought people had a right, perhaps even a drive, to say that God existed, and even though they couldn't offer evidence for their religious beliefs, it sustained them with comfort, hope and so on. Oprah.com: Find religion without losing control . Atheists scoff at this rationale, claiming it's childish to fall back on fairy tales about God just because they make you feel better. Far better to grow up and see what's before your eyes: the material world operating through random chance without the slightest sign of a higher intelligence, moral authority, afterlife and all the other trappings of religion. But James was ahead of this argument. Oprah.com: The skeptic's book club . What, he asked, if believing in God actually makes new evidence appear? That was the revelation, because while believing in ghosts or Cinderella won't make either one appear (so far as we know), God is an aspect of our own consciousness. The deity is continuous with the human mind. When Jesus said, ""Seek the kingdom of Heaven within,"" he was pointing to this very continuity. I am paraphrasing James and to some extent going beyond his lecture. But what fascinates me is that he hit upon a familiar notion among seekers today: ""You will only see it if you believe it."" To a non-believer, this sounds like self-hypnosis. Being materialists, they cling to the old formulation: ""I'll believe it when I see it."" But no one ever claimed that God or higher intelligence or the creative principle in the universe was tangible, like a rock or a tree. Gravity isn't tangible, either, but once the human mind decided to look for it, gravity became evident. God is subtler than gravity but just as evident, and just as dependent on knowing what to look for. Oprah.com: Who exactly is God? To be clear, James' belief is not the fervent belief of the religious fundamentalist who uses desperate literal interpretations of scripture to mask his insecurities and limited experience of the divine. This is the pragmatic belief of a working hypothesis applied toward improving one's life. Therefore, I don't think it's time to give up on believing. Quite the opposite. Belief is a step ahead of hope. Hope can be desperate, empty or false. But when you step beyond hope into belief, you do something both real and positive. You say, ""I believe in something, so let it appear."" In other words, you open yourself to knowledge, which is what everyone wants. Belief is a halfway house. It opens your awareness to a new possibility, and then you find out whether God can actually be known. We have countless saints and sages to tell us that God can be known; and with all their combined doubt, atheists, materialists and skeptics cannot prove that God is unknowable. The whole issue depends not on religion versus science but on James's insight that the mind allows Nature to reveal itself in greater depth the deeper we are willing to look. I find great encouragement in that insight and thought it was worth sharing. We can all benefit from James' sort of pragmatism, which says God should be adopted as a working hypothesis, even when doubt exists, because as evidence emerges to support our belief, we will succeed in living better in this world.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Three of the top four vote-getters in Sunday's parliamentary elections in Greece will meet Tuesday at the presidential palace to form a coalition government, an official with the socialist party Pasok told CNN. The official spoke not for attribution because the talks were at a critical juncture. ""As wide as possible cooperation ... should happen at the latest tomorrow evening,"" said Evangelos Venizelos, head of the Pasok Party, which placed third. The center-right New Democracy Party took first place in the vote. Its candidate, Antonis Samaras, has three days to cobble together a government. ""There should be government of national salvation with as many parties as possible,"" Samaras told reporters. Democratic Party of the Left's leader, Fotis Kouvelis, held talks Monday that the New Democracy leader described as ""constructive."" The party's platform has supported the bailouts while seeking to renegotiate the terms. With almost all ballots counted, New Democracy had won nearly 30% of the vote, the Interior Ministry said. That gives the party 129 seats in the country's 300-seat parliament, forcing it to seek other coalition members from the fragmented field to form a majority. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the leftist Syriza party, which came in second, met with Samaras but said Monday he would not back a coalition. ""History and the people will judge them by their results,"" Tsipras said of the parties backing the existing bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping Greece afloat. ""Shortly we will be vindicated."" What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? He said his party's nearly 27% showing had forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout is ""nonviable,"" and said Syriza would press as a member of the opposition for the bailouts to be scrapped. An official with Syriza told CNN that no one from the party was planning to attend the meeting. Syriza, which campaigned against the terms of the bailout, got 71 seats. Pasok, which long dominated Greek politics, won 33. Four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each. The vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether Greece should remain in the euro, the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in Europe. The possibility of a ""no"" vote roiled world markets, with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $1 trillion. Asian markets reacted positively to the election results, while European and U.S. markets were mixed. Samaras said he would build a government of ""parties that believe in the nation's European orientation, that believe in the euro."" But he acknowledged that government budget cuts forced on the country by international lenders have caused suffering among Greeks. A wild election weekend for Greece, France and Egypt . The new government will have to make changes ""in order for the Greek people to escape the torturous reality of unemployment and unbelievable difficulties that every Greek family faces today,"" Samaras said after meeting with the president. He faces a new round of coalition talks, six weeks after a previous election that failed to produce a government. International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. Eurozone finance ministers praised the election results, ""which should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring Greece back on a path of sustainable growth."" Some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . ""Don't underestimate the capacity of the Greek people to rise to the occasion,"" Petros Doukas, a former New Democracy lawmaker and deputy finance minister, told CNN. ""What's very clear is the Greeks today voted, including those that voted for Syriza, in favor of the euro and the European Union,"" Doukas said. He predicted that Greece could negotiate better terms with its creditors, who understand ""that you can only squeeze so much so fast out of a country and out of its people."" Greeks have been suffering under painful austerity measures, high unemployment and a long-running recession. The country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, had urged Greeks not to walk away from the international loan deals. ""We will stick to the agreements. That is the basis on which Europe will prosper,"" she said Saturday. As economic crisis bites, Greece's children pay the price .

"Washington (CNN) -- A bill that offers a path to citizenship to some illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children failed a procedural vote in the Senate on Saturday. Known formally as the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, the DREAM Act fell five votes short of the 60 needed to be considered for final passage. The measure passed in the House earlier this month by a vote of 216-198. In a statement released shortly after the vote, President Obama called it ""an incredibly disappointing vote."" ""A minority of senators prevented the Senate from doing what most Americans understand is best for the country. There was simply no reason not to pass this important legislation,"" Obama said in a statement. ""It is disappointing that common sense did not prevail today."" The president vowed to continue to fight for the legislation, which would offer legal standing to immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the country for at least five years. Other requirements include graduating from high school or obtaining a General Education Development diploma and demonstrating ""good moral character."" Even then, only a six-year conditional status would be awarded. Before moving to the next phase, the students would need to meet additional requirements -- attending college or serving in the military for at least two years, and passing criminal background checks. Proponents, such as Obama and Democratic leaders, say the bill would give legal standing to young people brought to the United States who have bettered themselves and served their new country. Democratic senators lined up Saturday to excoriate their Republican colleagues and assure Latino supporters they won't give up on the legislation. Several made reference to busloads of Texas students who drove all night from Austin to witness the vote. ""America is a country where dreams are made, not crushed. And today dreams were crushed,"" U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-California) said. ""My message to these young people is 'never fear,' we're not going anywhere. We're going to continue to fight because this is the right thing to do."" Republicans, such as Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, called the measure an amnesty on Saturday before the vote to invoke cloture -- which would end or limit debate. ""If we pass this amnesty, we will signal to the world that we're not serious about the enforcement of our laws or our borders,"" Sessions said. ""It will say, you make plans -- you can make plans to bring in your brother, your sister, your cousin, your nephew, your friend, into the country illegally as a teenager, and there will be no principled reason in the future for the next congress then sitting to not pass another ""dream"" act. And it will only be a matter of time before that next group illegally here will make the same heartfelt pleas that we hear today."" Republicans who voted to advance the bill were Sens. Bob Bennett of Utah, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Democrats against it included Max Baucus and Jon Tester of Montana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, and Mark Pryor of Arkansas.","NEW: Obama calls failure ""incredibly disappointing""

"Mexico City (CNN) -- A judge ordered the release Thursday of a popular Mexican singer accused of raping a teenager on grounds that not enough evidence existed for trial, state media said. Prosecutors in the state of Quintana Roo alleged that Kalimba raped a 17-year-old girl in a hotel there in December. Last week, the singer, whose full name is Kalimba Marichal Ibar, was deported from the United States to Mexico after an immigration violation in El Paso, Texas, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Ramiro Cordero said. Kalimba maintained his innocence of the rape charges and said in an interview with CNN affiliate Televisa earlier this month that he had not attacked anyone. ""There are many details that are very easy to criticize, judge or imagine,"" he said, but he urged the public to use logic when considering the case, which has received extensive coverage in Mexican media. In the Televisa interview, Kalimba declined to answer a question about whether he had sexual relations with the teen's consent. ""That I must testify before the prosecution and not on television,"" he said. The teen's uncle has asked a state human rights commission to help protect the family, which he said has been demonized since reporting the rape allegations to authorities, according to Notimex, the Mexican news agency. The 28-year-old singer is a former member of the group OV7 and also was the voice of Simba in a Spanish version of Disney's ""The Lion King."" Fans gathered last week at the prison where he was being held and in Mexico City to show support.","The judge says not enough evidence existed for a trial .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Indians' preference for sons over daughters has manifested itself in a worrisome population imbalance in the world's second-most populous nation, according to a preliminary census report released this week. The 2011 census recorded an alarming drop in the percentage of girls among India's preschoolers. For every 1,000 boys aged up to 6 years old, the report counted 914 girls, a drop from 927 a decade ago. That's the lowest ratio since India gained independence in 1947, said the preliminary census. It's illegal in India to abort a child just because of its sex, but such abortions happen, often aided by illegal clinics. ""The reasons for high number of incidence of female feticide in India include a deep-rooted traditional son preference, continued practice of dowry and concern for safety of the girl child and exploitation and abuse of women and girl children,"" India's Women and Child Development Minister Krishna Tirath told Parliament last month. To try to restore balance, several Indian states have announced incentives for the birth of baby girls and have criminalized sex-selective abortions, she said. Tirath also stressed that socio-economic empowerment of women is essential to help them make informed decisions and change their mind sets. Among Indian adults, the ratio of men to women has taken a slightly positive turn for females. There are now 940 women to every 1,000 men, compared to 933 in the previous census, taken in 2001. India's population grew 17 percent in the last decade and now stands at 1.21 billion, the report said. That's more than the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Japan put together. While the growth rate was slower than in the 2001 census, forecasters predict India will surpass China as the most-populated nation in the world by 2030.","A new census in India counts 914 girls under age 6 per every 1,000 boys that age .

"OLLANTAYTAMBO, Peru (CNN) -- Stand anywhere in the Peruvian town of Ollantaytambo and look up. If your eyes don't fix on a magnificent Andes mountain peak, then you will surely be looking at one of the Incan ruins in the immediate area. Ollantaytambo offers spectacular views of a charming village, ancient ruins and magnificent mountains. No need to worry about a crick in your neck; the view at eye level is just as pretty. There are no neon signs, no hotels or restaurants with names that you will recognize, just charming local businesses set on cobblestone streets. Narrow chutes frame the streets and carry water from the mountaintops through town, toward the railroad tracks, and into the Urubamba River. The locals are easily recognized in their brightly colored hand-woven clothing -- bright blue, orange and red shirts and skirts -- as they go about their daily business, whether tending the nearby fields or guiding a mule carrying firewood. When planning a trip to the area's star attraction -- the mountaintop Incan ruins of Machu Picchu -- this gem of a town in Peru's Sacred Valley is not to be missed. The Sacred Valley is the area between Cusco -- the historic capital of the Incan Empire and the tourism gateway -- and Machu Picchu, which was recently voted one of the new seven wonders of the world. Typically, visitors who plan to stay overnight in the Sacred Valley are trying to adjust to the altitude before heading to the higher and larger city of Cusco. Acclimating to elevations of more than 11,000 feet above sea level is a good reason to head directly down to the valley after arriving at the Cusco Airport, but the tiny town called Ollantaytambo is another great reason to set aside at least a couple of your vacation days. Ollantaytambo is one of those rare places where you'd rather look at the beauty through the naked eye than through the lens of a camera. The camera just doesn't seem to capture the ""wow"" factor. During the dry season from April to October, the sky between the surrounding peaks is often a piercing azure blue. But visitors can't be expected to stand on a street corner taking in the view all day, and thankfully, there is plenty to do in this old Incan village. The main attraction, the Ollantaytambo Ruins, a former Incan fortress, attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market. From down the street, you can see the tourists climbing the many terraces that, during Incan times, were used for agriculture and decorative purposes. The highest point on the hill is where you will find the unfinished Temple of the Sun. On tours, visitors learn that these ruins were built in the shape of a llama, and guides will point out the face of the Incan sun god carved on the side of the neighboring mountain. You need to purchase a ticket to visit this site. Across town are other Incan sites, also visible from the town's cobblestone corners, where you can hike up to the ruins free of charge. There are many nice walks around the town, and the local museum has a display on the wall that lists the time they should take and the area to cover. If you want a break from the ruins, try white-water rafting, mountain climbing or horseback riding. And if you can't get enough of the natural beauty, opt for a bicycle trip down the Ambra Malaga Pass. Bicycle trip organizers will drive you up and drop you off on an asphalt road at about 14,000 feet above sea level, and you ride -- or really glide -- down on bicycles. Make sure your body has acclimated to the altitude of Ollantaytambo, which is about 9,186 feet, before you embark on this tour. The ride offers great views of the snow-capped Mount Veronica, and you'll see livestock grazing and patches of land being tended by farmers. The entire trip takes from three to four hours and costs about $40 per person. Once you have worked up an appetite, you can easily find a good meal in Ollantaytambo. A hearty local dish, lomo saltado, is served in most restaurants. This Peruvian dish is a stir fry that includes steak tidbits, white rice, french fries, onions and tomatoes in a brown gravy. If lomo saltado isn't adventurous enough for you, try alpaca or cuy (guinea pig). You can wash your meal down with a Pisco sour, the national drink in Peru, made with Pisco brandy, sugar, lemon juice and an egg white. There are enough restaurants to choose from, and in some establishments, the food is as good as the fancy places you will find in Cusco. There are several trains a day between Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu, so it's feasible to do a day trip to visit the main attraction. It's about a two-hour drive to get to Ollantaytambo from the airport or Cusco's city center, and it costs no more than $30 U.S. by taxi. Buses are available and cost a lot less. Whether you take the bus, train or taxi, consider a stop in this impressive Incan town as you check the nearby world wonder off your list.","In Ollantaytambo, Peru, you can see magnificent mountains and Incan ruins .

"(CNN) -- A top trainer in the fabled Tennessee walking horse industry has pleaded guilty to a charge of cruelty to animals and has been banned for life from the most important horse show for the breed. Jackie McConnell had been charged with 52 counts of violating the Horse Protection Act but pleaded guilty to only one in a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Chattanooga. The charges stemmed from a graphic undercover video made by a Humane Society of the United States investigator that shows McConnell and his stable hands at Whitter Stables of Collierville subjecting show horses to practices that were banned 40 years ago. The video shows horses being struck with sticks and subjected to ""soring,"" an illegal process in which chemicals are placed on their lower legs in an effort to induce the signature Tennessee walking horse high-stepping gait known as the ""big lick."" According to the indictment, ""soring is a cruel and inhumane practice used to accentuate a horse's gait in order to gain a competitive edge in horse shows."" Chemicals and other irritants on a horse's ankles and forelegs cause it to lift its front feet and shift its weight unnaturally to the hind legs in order to relieve the pain. McConnell and the other trainers applied a thick, yellowish substance called ""the balm"" on the front pasterns of a horse named Moody Star, the court documents said. The horse was seen in the video picking up his feet in pain. Later, McConnell rubbed castor oil on the back of Moody Star's pasterns to ""peel off skin."" Moody Star was later taken to a show, and documents for the horse were falsified, prosecutors said. Other horses were similarly abused. The Humane Society said its investigator documented ""stewarding"" -- training a horse not to react to pain during official show inspections of their legs for soreness -- by striking them in the head when they flinch during mock inspections. The video also shows a writhing horse being subjected to a whip at McConnell's barn. Another receives an electric shock to the head. ""The video showed the horses, in obvious pain, which appear to be having trouble standing and being whipped until they did stand,"" prosecutors said in the plea agreement Tuesday. McConnell's staff -- Jeff Dockery, John Mays and Joseph Abernathy -- were also charged. Mays and Abernathy have also pleaded guilty. Dockery has a plea hearing in June. Soring ""has been an open secret in Tennessee for years,"" said Jonathan Lovvorn, senior vice president for litigation and investigations with the Humane Society. The video was filmed in spring 2011 by an investigator who worked two months as a stable hand at McConnell's barn, according to the Humane Society. It was first featured last week on the ABC News program ""Nightline."" It raised questions of how pervasive the training techniques are despite recent prosecutions and investigations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which enforces the Horse Protection Act. ""There obviously is a huge problem,"" Lovvorn said. ""In the competition to get this unnatural gait, trainers are using banned substances to cheat."" The walking horse gait, known for its smoothness, was originally devised for Southern plantation owners to inspect their lands in comfort. Horse show judges value the exaggerated gait, and shows in Tennessee and elsewhere annually draw thousands of spectators. The Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration said its actions against McConnell were unprecedented. He was suspended for life, is banned from entering the organization's grounds and was removed from its Hall of Fame. ""This action is the strongest we can take and it clearly reflects our disgust with the actions of Mr. McConnell,"" said Doyle Meadows, CEO of the organization. ""His actions are not reflective of the Tennessee walking horse industry, and we in no way want him associated with our show."" PepsiCo said last week it was pulling its sponsorship of this summer's Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. Asked if the sponsorship decision was in response to the 2011 video, PepsiCo spokesman Vincent Bozek said, ""That's all we're saying."" The decision was made Wednesday. The president of a Tennessee horse industry organization, condemning the ""disturbing"" video, told CNN there is a stringent inspection process at shows. ""I think it's sad that a corporation like Pepsi would go out because of the action of one person and one training barn,"" said Stephen Mullins of S.H.O.W. Lovvorn told CNN the Humane Society shared the video and results of its investigation with federal prosecutors before the indictment was returned earlier this year. McConnell will be sentenced on September 10. He faces a maximum five-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine. Mays and Abernathy face up to a year in prison and a $3,000 fine. In separate cases, a seven-month investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture resulted in at least four other Tennessee men being sentenced this year for horse soring violations. One defendant sentenced to 12 months in prison and a $4,000 fine described how chemical irritants, chains, bolts and other devices were used to bring about the exaggerated gait. ""He stressed the pervasiveness of soring in the gaited horse industry and testified that horses 'have got to be sored to walk,' "" according to a news release from the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee. S.H.O.W., certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, handles inspections of Tennessee horses at events. Mullins, a retired equine veterinarian, said self-regulation by the industry has led to three lifetime and 150 one-year suspensions for soring and other violations of the Horse Protection Act. Trainers shouldn't rely on soring to train horses to hit the ""big lick,"" said Mullins, acknowledging that the industry still has problems. ""I was given one charge (task). Get rid of the sore horse. I think we are well on our way."" One painless training technique, he said, is to fit pads, about 3 inches tall, below the horse's hoof. ""It can change the way the horse lands on its foot,"" according to Mullins. ""It requires him to exaggerate and keep his foot up for a longer period of time."" S.H.OW.'s oversight, however, does not extend to training facilities and barns. ""Soring is a way to take a horse that is not very good ... to make him look good,"" Mullins said. ""Do I think it goes on around the trainers who show routinely with me? No sir, I do not believe it does.""","Jackie McConnell was charged with 52 counts of violation of the Horse Protection Act .

"(CNN) -- Oakland City Hall reopened Monday after municipal employees worked to clean up damage they said was caused over the weekend by Occupy protesters, about 400 of whom were arrested following clashes with police in the Northern California city. Marvine White was one such worker, called in over the weekend to help scrub graffiti and vacuum floors, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. ""This is not protesting. This is something else. When you protest, you protest. This is madness here,"" White said. The mass arrests, described by police as the largest in city history, appear to have injected new life into the Occupy movement as protesters in a number of American and European cities took to the streets Sunday to express their solidarity with the Occupy Oakland group. ""The Occupy movement will respond, as we have always responded: With an overwhelming show of collective resistance,"" Occupy Wall Street said in a statement posted on its website. Windows broken, flags burned in Oakland City Hall . Occupy Oakland is part of a larger movement that began last year on New York's Wall Street and quickly spread across the globe. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme remained the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. From Philadelphia to Des Moines, Iowa, there were reports of Occupy protesters taking to the streets in mostly non-violent demonstrations. Twelve people were arrested in New York during an Occupy Wall Street protest that saw the group march from Gramercy Park to Tompkins Square Park, police said. Charges and details about the arrests were not immediately made available. In Tampa, Florida, several protesters were arrested for blocking traffic, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. In Philadelphia, police reported several hundred protesters blocked traffic near City Hall and attempted to cut down a fence near an area park where Occupy protesters were recently evicted from camping out. Two protesters were arrested, according to CNN affiliate WPVI. Overseas, Occupy protests were held outside U.S. consulates in Melbourne and Toronto, while statements of solidarity were issued by Occupy groups in Olso, Norway, and in Vancouver, British Columbia, according to Twitter and website posts late Sunday. Much of the news stemming from the Occupy movement in recent weeks has focused on government efforts to relocate the protest groups, many of whom had taken up residence in city parks and plazas. In Washington, D.C., the National Park Service gave Occupy protesters a deadline to end what it called ""sleeping activity"" at two longstanding camps established by demonstrators in the nation's capital. U.S. Park Police began enforcing the ban Monday, with Occupy protesters at one site defiantly huddling under a large blue tarp that they dubbed the ""tent of dreams."" Park service to crack down on Occupy DC camps . Park police used a stun gun to apprehend one demonstrator, who tore down park service notices warning protesters of the Monday deadline. But none of the weekend activities rose to the level of violence witnessed in Oakland, where protesters on Saturday clashed with police after they were prevented from taking over a long-vacant auditorium in the heart of downtown. Protesters and police traded allegations over who was to blame for the violence that saw demonstrators throw rocks and bottles at police, who it turn fired bean bag rounds, tear gas and smoke grenades at the group. Oakland Police Officer Johnna Watson described what transpired as ""one of the largest mass arrests that we have seen in the city."" The charges ranged from failure to disperse to vandalism, Watson said. The city of about 420,000, located across the bay from San Francisco, has a long and sometimes violent history of activism dating back to the mid-1960s with the founding of the militant Black Panther Party and later for its anti-war protests. Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October, when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, an Iraq war veteran, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group. Police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. In November, violence broke out again in Oakland when police shuttered an Occupy camp at an area park. Twice, protesters have forced the shut down of the Port of Oakland. But Saturday marked a new chapter in the Oakland Occupy movement when the group attempted to take over the long-vacant Henry Kaiser Convention Center to use as a hub. The group said it was necessary, in part because ""since November, the city of Oakland and its police force have made it impossible for us to meet, to serve food and to provide a place for people to stay."" The effort turned violent when police turned the group back, alleging the protesters were damaging construction equipment and fences near the convention center. By nightfall, the protesters stormed a YMCA and later broke into City Hall, police and city officials said. Protesters have decried the allegations, saying they entered the buildings through open doors. But Mayor Jean Quan told reporters that police have video showing protesters using a crowbar, or something similar to it, to pry open an emergency door to enter City Hall. Quan took reporters through City Hall on Sunday, pointing to walls where graffiti had already been painted over and other areas of garbage, vandalism and destruction that she said had been left by protesters. The mayor said there were no firm estimates as to how much damage had been caused, noting that workers had already painted over some ""obscene"" graffiti and that clean-up efforts would continue. Meanwhile, Occupy Oakland put out a call for financial aid to help some of those arrested make bail. ""Our bail funds have been dwindling significantly as a result of the police backlash against occupy Oakland in the last month. If you are able, please donate,"" the group said.

"(CNN) -- In early 2000, shortly after Al Gore beat Bill Bradley by a too-close-for-comfort four points in the state's first-in-the-nation primaries, Ray Buckley, then a New Hampshire state legislator, swung through Washington to have breakfast with a friend in the Clinton administration. As he sat in the White House mess eating pancakes, Buckley was shocked when an aide brought him a note that said President Bill Clinton wanted to see him in the Oval Office. He didn't know Clinton was even aware he was visiting. ""He started grilling me on what towns Gore did well in and didn't do well in. He didn't have a paper in front of him, he just knew. He was asking me 'Why didn't Al do better in Amherst?' His understanding of the political landscape of New Hampshire is just amazing,"" Buckley, now the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, told CNN. Clinton is taking that enthusiasm for the Granite State, generated in no small part by the dramatic successes he and his wife have historically secured here, to the state party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Manchester on Thursday, raising money and encouraging voters in his party to get to the polls on election day. Incumbent Gov. Maggie Hassan has the most comfortable lead in the polls among Democrats running for federal office in New Hampshire. Reps. Carol Shea-Porter and Ann Kuster are in more competitive races as they try to hang onto their House seats. But it's Sen. Jeanne Shaheen who is getting the most attention. The longtime Clinton ally is running statistically even with Republican Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts, in a race that could determine the balance of power in the senate. ""Bill Clinton is probably the best person for Shaheen,"" says Neil Levesque, the executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics and Political Library at Saint Anselm College. ""He's custom made for a state like New Hampshire that really appreciates someone who can get into the issues."" Clinton's visit comes one day after Mitt Romney campaigned alongside Brown and with Democratic activists here growing more and more anxious (the state legislature's return to Republican control looks like a foregone conclusion already) it's just in time. ""The concern is if there's anxiety bordering on depression about the bad news not just in New Hampshire but nationally that might stop an activist from working as hard as they might to get out the vote,"" says Dante Scala, professor of Political Science at the University of New Hampshire. Clinton's visit appears to be buoying many Democrats already. With news of his headlining appearance, 1,200 people have purchased tickets to the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, the biggest crowd since the state party revived it as a fall fundraising event in 1991. Normally 400-450 Democrats attend. This year, some attendees will be watching Clinton from an overflow room and the normally seated dinner has been scrapped for an earlier buffet-style meal followed by Clinton's speech to a crowd in a theater-style seating arrangement. New Hampshire has always been friendly to the Clintons and they're not going to neglect the state as Hillary Clinton eyes another presidential run. In 1992, just a few days after a tabloid broke a story about Bill Clinton's affair with an Arkansas state employee named Gennifer Flowers, a surprise second place finish in the New Hampshire primary kept Clinton's presidential prospects alive. He famously declared that January evening, ""New Hampshire has made Bill Clinton the comeback kid,"" and went on to win the state in the general election as well. In 2008, when Hillary Clinton trailed Barack Obama by double digits in the lead up to the New Hampshire primary, she teared up at a Portsmouth coffee shop as she told a voter who asked how she was faring on the trail, ""I just don't want to see us fall backwards. This is very personal for me. It's not just political."" The next day, she answered Obama's crushing Iowa caucus win with a three point victory in New Hampshire, telling her supporters at her victory rally, ""Now let's give America the kind of comeback New Hampshire has just given me."" Hillary Clinton will campaign here the weekend before the election, hoping to make a last minute move for Sen. Shaheen and Gov. Hassan. By then, most voters will have made up their minds. But strategists say Clinton can make an effective play for undecided female voters, especially with incumbent Democratic women up and down the ballot. ""She could win this race for Shaheen,"" says Levesque. And if she does, the Clintons are betting New Hampshire will remember that in 2016.","Bill Clinton is speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner on Thursday, .

"(CNN) -- When immigration agents in Belize spotted a man crawling through the bushes near its border with Guatemala, they not only stopped someone trying to illegally enter their country -- they also captured an international fugitive suspected of pulling off the biggest gold heist in Florida history. Raonel Valdez-Valhuerdis was wanted for a bold heist where he allegedly held up a man who was carrying two suitcases full of more than 100 pounds of gold flakes. Why would a man have suitcases filled with gold flakes? That's just one aspect that makes this tale so bizarre. Another is that Valdez allegedly committed the crime while wearing a court-ordered ankle monitor from a previous arrest. The heist . The heist took place in October 2012 when the victim, George Villegas, was coming out of his Coral Gables apartment with the suitcases. Villegas' family owns and operates Quri Wasi, a Bolivian-based export company that purchases gold, melts it down and then sells it. He was on his way to work when Valdez and two other men accosted him, the U.S. Marshals Service said. ""We are only here for the gold,"" Valdez allegedly told the man. Villegas said he tried to wrestle the men down, but let them go. ""Nothing is worth it,"" he told WTVJ shortly after the attack. ""Not even $2.6 million."" Several weeks later, Coral Gables police nabbed Valdez. His ankle monitor led them to him. The ankle monitor . Valdez's legal troubles began five months prior to the heist. Police said he apparently put a knife to his ex-girlfriend's neck and demanded her purse. He was convicted of battery, and a judge mandated that he wear an ankle monitor. After receiving a tip that Valdez was the leader of the heist, police searched his name and learned about the device. Taking a look at the GPS data, they placed Valdez at the crime scene exactly when the robbery occurred. Police said the GPS data also showed he conducted surveillance of the apartment for several weeks before the robbery. Once positively identified in a lineup, the detectives arrested Valdez. But at a December 2012 hearing, the judge released him on a $75,000 bond. Valdez didn't appear at his next hearing -- and a warrant for his arrest was issued. He was officially on the run. The capture . Fast forward to February 2014. Belize immigration officials found him in the bushes at the border. He had a Cuban passport, but it didn't have an immigration stamp documenting his entry into Belize. A quick background check revealed a surprise: This wasn't an ordinary border crosser. They had stumbled upon an international fugitive. Back in America . On Wednesday, Valdez was back in the hands of U.S. authorities. He's charged with armed robbery with a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, grand theft of more than $100,000 and altering/tampering with an electronic monitor. The heist, the Marshals Service said, was the biggest gold robbery in Florida's history. And let's not forget the probation violation. The gold, however, is yet to be found.

"Washington (CNN) -- For the first time since 2007, a majority of Americans think things are going well in the nation, a new CNN/ORC International poll found. It's a slim majority — just 52 percent of Americans said things are going well, while 48 percent said things are going badly — but it's the most positive appraisal of the state of the nation that the poll has found since January of 2007. And it marks consistent improvement in the mood of the nation over the past few months, despite a series of national security crises and continued gridlock in Washington. In September, 50 percent of respondents said things were going well. Economic sentiments have improved over the past year as well. Though just one-third of Americans believe the nation's economy is starting to recover, that marks an 8-point increase from a year ago, when 24 percent said the same. A plurality, 41 percent, say the economy has stabilized, a 5-point improvement from November of 2013. And just 26 percent of Americans say the country's economic conditions are getting worse, a decline from the 39 percent who said so in 2013. But the mood of the nation isn't consistently positive in the new CNN/ORC poll — it suggests both a gender and geographic divide. Men are both more positive about the state of the nation and the economy than women, the poll shows. Fifty-five percent of men say things are going well in America, compared to 48 percent of women who say the same; 36 percent of men believe the economy is recovering, while only 28 percent of women say the same. And economic conditions appear to be better in the Northeast and Midwest than they are in the southern and western parts of the nation, as respondents are more likely in those regions to say the economy is improving. They're also more likely to say that things are going well than their counterparts in the South and West. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted among 1,045 adults via telephone from Nov. 21-23, and has an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.","Fifty-two percent of Americans say things are going well in the nation .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's minister of antiquities said Monday that a one-year jail sentence and removal from his job for refusal to carry out a court ruling has been overruled by an administrative court decree. A source from the Interior Ministry told CNN that Zahi Hawass was sentenced in criminal court on Sunday, but in a blog post on his website, Hawass called that ""a complete misunderstanding,"" and wrote that the appeals court issued a decree on Monday that will keep him out of jail and allow him to remain in his position. Hawass is renowned as one of the world's leading experts on Egyptian antiquities. He was appointed minister of antiquities affairs in January by then-President Hosni Mubarak, before weeks of civil unrest led to Mubarak's resignation. Previously, Hawass was secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. The Interior Ministry source told CNN on Monday that the sentence was not a post-revolutionary political act, but was imposed strictly for his failure to carry out the court order. The sentence was related to a charge that Hawass, acting as secretary general of the SCA, refused to carry out an order to stop the bidding process last year for companies to run a bookstore in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Hawass, however, claimed he could not have enforced the ruling because it came ""when it was too late to do anything."" The court order was issued in early June 2010 on behalf of the museum bookstore's tenant at the time, who felt he should keep his contract, Hawass said. However, the new company had been chosen in late May, before the trial in the lawsuit began, and representatives of the Supreme Council of Antiquities ""did not have time to present evidence that the bidding had finished."" Further, Hawass said, a court in November ruled ""that I was innocent, because as the secretary general of the SCA, I was not in charge of legal affairs at the SCA, this was under the control of the Ministry of Culture at that time."" However, the plaintiff ""brought the case to the court again"" claiming to have evidence Hawass was in charge of legal affairs for the council. Hawass said the SCA didn't have a legal representative at the court, which then imposed the sentence. ""This is how the court in Egypt works, and this is not an uncommon thing that the head of an organization gets sentenced like this,"" Hawass wrote. ""... I respect the laws of my country very highly, and the rulings of our courts. I intend to handle this matter entirely within our legal system. Nothing will cause me to lose focus from my goal of protecting the sites of Egypt."" CNN's Dina Amer in Cairo and Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.","Zahi Hawass gets year in jail, loses job for refusing to carry out a court order, CNN is told .

"(CNN) -- Since when were a bunch of kids so interested in ancient history? Whole families were pressed up against the railings at Largo Argentina, the square in Rome, craning their heads toward ... a hole in the ground. Rome is full of holes in the ground, many of them historically significant, but this one was extra special. It contained the remains of the theater and temple where Julius Caesar was assassinated. But the kids weren't there for the ancient general-turned-emperor, murdered by treacherous senators in 44 BC. They were there for the cats. Rome's kitty ruins . Rome's noble ruins are a favorite haunt of feral cats. The ""gatti di Roma"" star on postcards and wall calendars sold all over the city. The ruins at Largo Argentina host an open-air cat sanctuary that's more than just a good show for visiting and local children. The city's strays have been fed and watered at the site almost since it was first excavated in the 1920s. The 1990s brought an injection of funds into the Torre Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, money that allowed more cats to be trapped, neutered and returned to their colony. Now, thousands of sterilizations are carried out each year -- around 30,000 and counting since 2000. More: How to Travel with Your Dog . Japan's cat islands . That's right: islands. Plural. Tashirojima in Miyagi Prefecture, is Japan's best-known feline isle. It usually goes by the name Cat Island. Dogs have been barred from Tashirojima for as long as anyone can remember. The island's cats vastly outnumber its human population. Tashirojima's furry inhabitants are well cared for by local fishermen, who hope to ensure a good catch by leaving offerings at a cat shrine. The island's most prominent structure, the Manga building and campsite, is embellished with a pair of pointy ears, in tribute to the island's lucky charms. Japan's other cat island, Ainoshima, is a little more remote, a 20-minute ferry ride from Shingu port in Fukuoka. A scrum of happy cats hangs out by the port, waiting for the next fishing boat or ferry to dock. In fact, the island represents a doubly incentive for the cats -- rugged Ainoshima is also a popular birdwatching site. More: The cat that saved a Japanese train station . Houtong, Taiwan . The riverside town of Houtong, Taiwan, fell into feline celebrity by accident. Houtong once sat on top of Taiwan's largest coal mine. When the mine closed in the 1990s, the town's population dwindled. Then some new, furry residents arrived. The Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park (Houtong Road, Ruifang District, New Taipei City; +886 2 2497 4143) was established to showcase the mining heritage of the town and surrounding hills. But visitors mostly come to photograph the 120 or so playful cats, who laze around the Cat Village and soak up the fuss -- and inevitable treats.

Kalkan Kats (Turkey) A pretty resort on Turkey's Turquoise Coast, Kalkan is another tourist destination with an active cat protection squad.

Animal loving visitors regularly give up vacation time to help out and share their experiences and photos on the Friends of KAPSA Facebook group. When tourists disappear for the winter, KAPSA feeds and cares for more than a thousand cats, relying on donations to fund its operations. Eager photographers can snap cats all over Kalkan, snoozing on hammam towels, curled up in fruit bowls or enjoying the air conditioning in the resort's stores.

In some rooms, it feels like the great author has just stepped out, even though he died in 1961. And his 1850s house is still a home -- to a colony of polydactyl, or six-toed, cats. Hemingway was given a white six-toed cat named Snowball in the 1930s. Some of Snowball's descendents are among the 50 or so furry residents of the historic home today.","In Rome, kids prefer cats over ruins .

"(CNN) -- A Spanish nurse's assistant who left the hospital Wednesday after beating Ebola said she was still weak but gave thanks to God and the health workers who cared for her that she was still alive. Looking frail but happy, Teresa Romero Ramos was greeted by cheers as she spoke to journalists, flanked by her husband, Javier Limon. Romero, who described her recovery as a ""miracle"" from God, said she was ready to do whatever she could to help others infected with Ebola. And she indicated that she still doesn't know how she contracted the virus. ""I don't know what went wrong. I don't even know if anything went wrong. All I know is that I hold no resentment, but if getting this disease serves a purpose to anyone, to better study the disease, to help find a cure, or if my blood helps cure another person, then here I am."" She added that she was ""willing to try, even if it means risking my life."" Romero spent 30 days at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa. She praised the care she received while there. ""The doctors, the nurses, the nurses' assistants, cleaning personnel, security personnel ... they have all proven to me that we have the best health care in the world,"" she said. ""Dedicated professionals who, despite the nefarious politics at times, are capable of performing miracles. I am one of them."" But she also spoke of her loneliness in the early stages, as she faced possible death. ""When I saw myself dying, I had memories of my family, of my husband,"" she said. ""I felt myself isolated, I didn't have contact with the exterior apart from Javier."" Now, Romero said, she needs to be left in peace to rest and recuperate. Dog 'was the son we never had' Limon followed his wife's statement with a pointed reproach to the Madrid authorities who decided to destroy the couple's dog, Excalibur, out of concern that he might have been carrying the Ebola virus. The animal was euthanized despite protests by animal rights campaigners outside the couple's home and an online petition signed by about 400,000 people. As a childless couple, the dog ""was the son we never had,"" Limon said. ""I would like to say thank you to all the people who love animals and have helped us in the case of Excalibur. Nobody knew the importance of the animal for us, a family without children."" He questioned why the dog could not have been quarantined, as was the case for a U.S. nurse infected in Texas. Nina Pham, who also recovered, was reunited with her tail-wagging pet Saturday after the dog completed a 21-day quarantine. Doctor: No danger of contagion . Romero is now clear of the virus but still recovering her strength, Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas told a news conference earlier Wednesday, flanked by other hospital personnel. ""Everyone can be assured that there is no danger whatsoever of her being contagious,"" he said. Romero chose not to speak at the doctors' news conference for personal reasons, said the hospital's director general, Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina. Ramon said that through Romero's case, the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of patients with Ebola and how to protect the staff caring for them. Romero was the first person to be infected with Ebola outside West Africa in the current outbreak. Authorities announced October 19 that tests showed that Romero no longer had Ebola, but she remained in the hospital while further tests were carried out and she recuperated.

"(CNN) -- How much should the rest of the world worry about the crisis unfolding in Europe? For anyone who cares about the state of their personal finances and the size of their reserves for retirement, the answer is: A lot. For investors, it's a time of risk and opportunity. Investors exhaled with some relief Sunday after voters in Greece gave a narrow victory to New Democracy, a party that vows to work with European leaders to keep the struggling country in the eurozone. But the crisis is nowhere near solved. Greece has to find a way to stability while Spain and Italy, much more important economies, show worrisome signs. When scenarios of ""Europocalyspe"" and ""Eurogeddon"" are evoked, you know things are getting bad. Because in today's interdependent and hyper-connected world, no continent can feel secure while another is sliding economically. What happens in Europe has the potential to determine the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November. It could trip up America's feeble recovery, create more unemployment and take a toll on the global stock market. Conversely, if Europe manages to avoid a financial storm, it could remove a huge cloud of uncertainty hanging over the global economy and brighten the outlook -- and the portfolios -- of investors everywhere. Pro-Euro Greek right tries, again, to form government . If you doubt that European problems could affect U.S. shores, take a quick glance at history for a chilling lesson. Prominent economists have drawn an eerie parallel between today's events and those of the early 1930s when, as the world limped in the aftermath of the 1929 Wall Street crash, a banking crisis in Europe took the world economy into another downward spiral and led to an explosion of extremist politics that, ultimately, set the pathway to World War II. If you don't care about the politics, consider just the stock market in the last 100 years. The Dow Jones Index, which stood at 381 in early September 1929, lost half of its value in the two months after the Great Crash of October. But the worst was yet to come. By 1932, the index had plummeted a breathtaking 90% from the September highs, dropping to just 41. The years after the 1929 crash brought a stomach-churning roller-coaster ride. The Dow climbed more than 400% from 41 to 194 and then back down to 92, before stabilizing and resuming a relatively steady climb during World War II. Imagine seeing your savings, your retirement funds, cut to one-tenth their size. It took a quarter of a century for the market to return to pre-crash levels. Those who bought stocks when the index stood at 41 saw their investment eventually soar to spectacular heights -- especially those who picked the right stocks at the right time. (The tycoon, J. Paul Getty, among others, started building his fortune by snapping up bargain stocks.) So what do those events in the 1930s, which unfolded when bankers, politicians and investors knew so much less about the economy, have to do with our world, the age of the Internet, the era of unlimited access to information and advanced economic theories? If European leaders and the voters who elect them glean the right lessons from history and manage to steer their continent away from the edge of the cliff, then we won't see a repeat of that disaster of a global crash. But no one knows whether Europeans will get their economic problems straightened out. This means that anyone who owns stocks or other investments should take a deep breath and decide just how much risk he or she is willing to accept. Most Americans own stocks through mutual funds. Millions have their money in employee-provided retirement accounts and rely on the stock market for their future without realizing it. Many top-rated investors are minimizing their stake in the market. The legendary Jim Rogers says he's pessimistic and not buying stocks. He's buying gold and other commodities. The investment giant BlackRock is telling clients to stock up on cash and safe-haven bonds and treasury bonds even though this is not the best strategy in the long run since it provides negative returns when you factor in inflation. For the more adventurous and optimistic, there's the lure of potentially huge returns, if Europe dodges disaster, or, in the aftermath of a crash. European leaders are getting strong advice from all directions. While the Greeks suffer, the Spaniards face severe unemployment, and fringe political parties spring up and grow stronger, economists from both sides of the Atlantic are urging German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reverse course from her push for strict austerity, which is choking economies already in depression. My sense is that Merkel will do whatever it takes to not let the eurozone come apart and will ease up on austerity while the storm passes. But nobody has a crystal ball; not for the market, not for the politicians. For investors, the most important point to keep in mind is that these are not days like others. It is a time of crisis, of great risk and, as happens when there is great risk, also of potentially great rewards. Those who wish to take the risk should do it with eyes wide open, not by accident, neglect or inertia. The epicenter of the crisis may be in Europe, but the shockwaves will know no boundaries. Everyone should pay attention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Anyone who cares about personal finance needs to pay attention to Europe's crisis .
Ghitis: Europe's problems could have huge impact on the U.S., just look at the 1930s .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese authorities Tuesday ""provisionally"" declared the country's nuclear accident a level-7 event on the international scale for nuclear disasters -- the highest level -- putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency announced the new level Tuesday morning. It had previously been at 5. Regulators have determined the amount of radioactive iodine released by the damaged reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was at least 15 times the volume needed to reach the top of the International Nuclear Event Scale, the agency said. That figure is still about 10 percent of the amount released at Chernobyl, they said. The amount of radioactive Cesium-137, which has a half-life of 30 years, is about one-seventh the amount released at Chernobyl, according to the agency. Japan's nuclear concerns explained . Hidehiko Nishiyama, the safety agency's chief spokesman, explained the final level won't be set until the disaster is over and a more detailed investigation has been conducted. Tetsunari Iida, a former nuclear engineer-turned-industry critic, told CNN the declaration has no immediate practical impact on the crisis. It is a sign, however, that Japanese regulators have rethought their earlier assessments of the disaster, said Iida, who now runs an alternative energy think-tank in Tokyo. According to the scale, a level 5 equates to the likelihood of a release of radioactive material, several deaths from radiation and severe damage to a reactor core. The 1979 incident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island was a 5. The partial meltdown of a reactor core there was deemed the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The Chernobyl accident in the former Soviet Union rated a 7 on the scale, which equates to a ""major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures."" Japan's government called for evacuations Monday from several towns beyond the danger zone already declared around Fukushima Daiichi, warning that residents could receive high doses of radiation over the coming months. Japan to evacuate more towns . Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the municipalities are likely to see long-term radiation levels that exceed international safety standards, and he warned that the month-old crisis at Fukushima Daiichi is not yet over. ""Things are relatively more stable, and things are stabilizing,"" he said. ""However, we need to be ready for the possibility that things may turn for the worse."" And about an hour after he spoke, a fresh earthquake rattled the country, forcing workers to evacuate the plant and knocking out power to the three damaged reactors for about 40 minutes, the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, reported. The magnitude 6.6 tremor came a month to the day after the magnitude 9 quake and tsunami that knocked out the plant's cooling systems, and followed a magnitude 7.1 aftershock Thursday night. Neither the 6.6 quake nor any of the smaller ones that rippled across the region in its wake inflicted any more damage to the plant, Tokyo Electric officials told reporters. At least six killed in latest Japan quake . Tuesday morning, a fire broke out in a battery storage building in a water discharge area of reactors 1-4 at Fukushima Daiichi, Tokyo Electric said. The fire was out a few hours later and the company said it caused no radiation emissions and no effect on cooling systems. Japan's government said it did not know how many people would be displaced by the new evacuation orders. Evacuation orders have so far covered about 85,000 people inside the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) zone, while another 62,000 within 30 kilometers have been told to stay inside, Fukushima prefecture officials told CNN. The decision announced Monday does not create a wider radius around the plant, said Masanori Shinano, an official with Japan's Nuclear Safety Commission. Instead, ""if there are areas in the northwestern parts where there is a risk of exceeding 20 millisieverts as a cumulative dose over a one-year period, the area will be designated an evacuation area even if it is beyond the 30-kilometer area,"" Shinano told reporters Monday night. That dose is a tiny fraction of what would cause immediate radiation sickness, but it's more than seven times the amount a typical resident of a western industrialized country receives from background sources in a year. Long-term exposures to those levels of radiation could increase the risk of cancer -- and the presence of cesium isotopes that have half-lives of up to 30 years means that radioactivity could linger for some time. The ""nuclear renaissance"" that wasn't . ""This policy does not require immediate evacuation right away, but we take the long-term perspective, considering the long-term effect of radiation on your health,"" Edano told reporters. Japanese authorities attributed growing concentrations of cesium-134, with a two-year half-life, and cesium-137, which loses half its radioactivity over 30 years, to the decay of larger concentrations of iodine-131, which has a half-life of eight days. Edano said residents of five towns and cities to the north and west of the plant -- Katsurao, Kawamata, Namie, Iitate and parts of Minami Soma -- should evacuate within a month if they have not already done so. Parts of Namie and Minami Soma are already within the 20-kilometer evacuation radius drawn in the first days of the accident, while Iitate, Kawamata and Katsurao are beyond the 30-kilometer range. Residents of five other areas -- in Hirono, Kawauchi, Naraha and parts of Tamura to the south, and the rest of Minami Soma -- were told they should be prepared to clear out soon. Hirono and Kawauchi lie in the outer belt of the current zone, while Naraha and Tamura are beyond the current 30-kilometer radius. One-month anniversary of disaster . The anti-nuclear group Greenpeace, which had warned about higher radiation levels in towns outside the evacuation zone two weeks ago, called Edano's declaration a good step, but said evacuations should take place sooner than the one-month goal Japan has set. Jan van de Putte, a Greenpeace radiation safety expert who took readings in Iitate and Namie, said the levels of radioactivity are likely to remain dangerous ""for years to come."" ""The bad news is what we're seeing today is going to decay very, very gradually,"" van de Putte told CNN. After a month of improvisation and frustration, Tokyo Electric says it has no idea when it will be able to restore normal cooling for the reactors and spent fuel pools at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo. Tokyo Electric President Masataka Shimizu visited the off-site headquarters for authorities attempting to manage the disaster Monday and met with local officials from Fukushima Prefecture, emerging to issue another apology for the situation. ""I would like to apologize from the bottom of my heart to the people of Fukushima and residents of the host towns of the Fukushima power plant for forcing them to go through enormous difficulties due to the accident that occurred in the wake of the quake and tsunami,"" he said in a prepared statement released through the company. Shimizu -- who was hospitalized for ""fatigue and stress"" in late March -- also expressed regret that he didn't apologize to Fukushima Prefecture residents before Monday. The province's governor skipped the meeting, however. Engineers are working to drain highly radioactive water from the basements of the turbine plants behind reactors No. 1 through 3 even as they pour hundreds of metric tons of water a day into the reactors to keep them cool. The water must be pumped out in order to get to the machinery that runs the coolant systems, and Tokyo Electric has dumped more than 10,000 tons of less-contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean in the past week to make room for the stuff -- a move that drew sharp criticism of the Japanese government, which approved the discharge as an emergency measure. Other contamination is leaking into the Pacific behind the plant, most likely carried along by groundwater, Japanese regulators have said. At the plant Monday, workers began installing sections of silt fence around the water intakes at the back of the plant to screen out radioactive particles. But the injection of nitrogen into the containment vessel around reactor No. 1 to counter a buildup of explosive hydrogen was stopped for the recent earthquake, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, the chief spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. In addition, Nishiyama said engineers have found gas escaping from the reactor containment vessel. But he said the nitrogen injections will resume, and the leaks were not affecting the stability of the reactor. Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the reactor core. Spectacular hydrogen explosions blew the roofs and walls off the buildings surrounding the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in the days after the tsunami, and another suspected hydrogen blast may have caused a leak in the No. 2 reactor. Tokyo Electric has said there is little danger of another explosion, but has begun pumping nitrogen into unit No. 1 as a precaution and plans to do the same for units 2 and 3.

"(CNN) -- Let's say you're on a job hunt and you've talked with people at two different companies. At one, the leaders are bombastic, always proclaiming themselves right and never admitting wrong. They have swagger but little capacity for reflection. They seem more brittle than nimble. At the other, the leaders are sure of themselves in a different way: They don't mind acknowledging their weaknesses. In fact, they have a culture of achieving success by keeping goals in mind and directly facing failures. Which team would you rather join? The question isn't about workplaces only. It's about our country -- and whether we Americans are confident enough today to handle unpleasant truths. In the Jefferson County, Colorado, school district, a new right-leaning school board recently tried to push through a history curriculum that would celebrate America more and downplay the role of protests and social unrest. This move, perhaps predictably, has led to protests and social unrest by students and teachers. Meanwhile, at the U.N. General Assembly last week, President Barack Obama's speech about ISIS and human rights made passing reference to Ferguson, Missouri, and our own problems here at home. Some critics jumped on Obama for preaching ""moral equivalence"" between Ferguson and ISIS and for being an ""apologizer in chief."" At play in both situations is a dispute about what it actually means to love this country. To the Jefferson school board, patriotism means talking up America, not talking it down. It means teaching children to behave -- and telling them that America was built by people who behaved. This isn't patriotism. It's the wishful thinking of people steeped in the status quo. Similarly, to the critics of the President's U.N. speech, patriotism means pointing out aggressively where others have sinned, erred, fallen short -- but treating any acknowledgment of our own sins, errors, shortcomings as aiding and abetting evil. This isn't patriotism. It's the bluster of the deeply insecure. True patriotism comes not from being scared to talk about where America has failed (and still fails) to live up to its stated creed and ideals. It comes from naming those truths plainly and closing the gap between our ideals and our institutions. We have to combine reverence for our exceptional creed with a demanding skepticism toward claims that we have already fulfilled it. So consider, for instance, the Jefferson County guidelines and their message to teach the virtues of ""free enterprise."" Well, yes. Capitalism has generated more wealth in the United States than had ever been generated in human history. At the same time, more of that wealth than we typically acknowledge was built on slave labor and, after the Civil War, on the industrial indentured servitude of ""freedmen."" This is a both/and, not an either/or. And citizens of a complex country like the United States should be able to deal with such complexity. Consider too: It is true both that the summer of 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act into law and that it marked the killing of an unarmed black youth in Missouri that sparked national outrage and local upheaval. There is of course a legitimate case -- made mostly by conservatives -- that a country unwilling to instill in young people a spirit of patriotism is a country headed for trouble. After all, America has little to bind together a vast continent and a diverse people besides a civic creed on parchment and commercialism everywhere else. That's why Donald Kagan, the historian of ancient Greece, argues that it's a vital purpose of public education to make patriotic citizens. It's not enough, as some of my friends on the left think, just to point out where America has faltered or to dissent against policies they don't like. True patriotism requires more commitment. But to impart such patriotism to children we should behave like adults and not children. Which means admitting that even though we Americans have done good things, and still do, we have also done bad things, and still do. The good may outweigh the bad but doesn't excuse it. And when the bad is happening today -- in the treatment of African-Americans in Ferguson, say -- the best way to be American is to confront it and make it better. Even if that means being impolite and disobedient to authority. More than 140 years ago, a U.S. senator from Missouri stood to address the tin-pot patriots of his time. His name was Carl Schurz. He was a German immigrant and had been a general of the Union Army in the Civil War. To the jingoists' chant of ""My country, right or wrong,"" Schurz replied, ""Our country -- when right, to be kept right; when wrong, to be set right."" Put that in every school board's curricular guidelines. Put it on the desk of every pundit who finds it easier to demonize than to solve problems. And put it on the conscience of the complacent and the cynical alike. That's patriotism for grown-ups.","Eric Liu: Some Colorado school board members and Obama critics get patriotism wrong .
There's nothing unpatriotic about pointing out the ways America falls short, he says .
Liu: To impart patriotism to our children, we should act like adults ."
"(CNN) -- Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz will introduce President Obama at the party's Women's Leadership Forum on Friday, a well-placed Democratic source says.

In part, that's a function of the job. Under Obama, the position of DNC chairman is tough, because that person takes something of a backseat, the source said, to the political operatives who work at the White House.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's the biggest film industry in the Middle East and known as the Hollywood of the Arab world. Veteran players like actor, Omar Sharif and director, Youssef Chahine are known to film fans the world over. Censors allowed Youssef Chahine's latest film ""Heya Fawda"" which is about police brutality . ""Egypt is the only country in the area, in the Middle East, which has cinema industry in all the meaning of the word"" explained Ezzat Abou Auf, the President of Cairo Film Festival. But until recently strict state control which favors censorship -- and a monopoly on the industry by a handful of corporate giants peddling formulaic romantic comedies -- led to many years of decline for the Egyptian film industry. Omar Sharif -- famous globally for roles in the David Lean epics, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Dr Zhivago"" -- agrees that censorship is harming the Egyptian film industry. ""We have the studios, we have all the amenities they need but we have censorship. We have to check the script they're shooting, we have to agree with it, that there is nothing anti-Arab, Anti-Muslim. We're losing a lot of income because of censorship here,"" he said. Today, a new wave of movie-makers are breaking traditional taboos, challenging the censors and taking Egyptian film into new markets around the globe. The latest of these films, ""The Yacoubean Building"" was seen as a landmark in Egyptian cinematic history. It had the biggest ever budget and an all-star cast led by the revered actor Adel Imam and featuring popular actress,Youssra. It also included subjects to challenge the censors and religious conservatives, including homosexuality and terrorism. The film's director, Marwan Hamed, says he had to work with the censors to ensure the script would be approved before filming: ""It's very important that you tackle a taboo subject but at the same time you don't want the audience to leave the cinema and go, especially when you have a conservative audience,"" he told CNN. ""The head of the censors, Mr. Ali Abou Shadi, was originally a very important film critic and he's very liberal. I sat with him a lot and I told him what I was gonna do. It's not about being the bravest it's about being entertaining but at the same time giving the people the chance to watch the film,"" he continued. Abou Shadi, head of the Egyptian Censorship authority says they are becoming more tolerant of controversial issues. ""In my own experience as a censor, I can assess that there is more freedom than in the past,"" he said, ""Some recent films like ""The Yacoubian Building"" and certain films of Youssef Chahine were examples of films that would never have passed the censor in earlier times."" ""Heya Fawda"" (""Chaos"") the latest release of Egypt's greatest living director, Youssef Chahine -- almost 60 years after his directorial debut -- has ruffle feathers. The film tackles police brutality and corruption, both among several sensitive issues, which have challenged the Egyptian censors. Censorship can be used as a tool to protect political regimes and public behaviours and beliefs, in Abou Shadi's view. ""Egypt, like many other Arab countries suffers from a very conservative or Islamic current. This creates a lot of confusion and means that creative talented people often find themselves in opposition to the fundamentalist parties,"" he said. But he is very positive about the future: ""I like to think that in this last period with a new political climate and more freedom, censorship has become more tolerant to innovation."" One production company that is dramatically shaking up the whole film industry in Egypt is ""GoodNews4Film"". It is the go-getting media giant behind ""The Yacoubean Building"" and its ambitions are stretching in many directions. Its latest production ""The Night of the Baby Doll"" -- has a budget of 40 million Egyptian pounds. That's about $7 million -- a relatively modest budget in Hollywood terms but a figure which would typically finance three Egyptian movies. ""We think and produce cinema in the same way as the Americans do"", says Adel Adeeb, director of ""Baby Doll Night"" and managing director of Good News4Film. Bigger budgets means improved film quality and and in the future, the company hopes to produce films in English as well as Arabic. Adeeb acknowledges that in order to work internationally subject matter has to change to be, perhaps, less tuned in to local audiences in favour of wider ones -- but he is convinced cinema has the power to communicate over national borders. ""We're trying to work internationally because we need to communicate. This is the glamour or the magic of cinema. We know the jeans or the hamburger, everything from the American movies, so I think people will know us,"" he said. The company aims to broaden minds beyond images of gun-battles and belly dancing synonymous with the region. ""Night of the Baby Doll"" is a comedy which highlights misunderstandings between the Arab and western worlds post-9/11 -- it will be followed by an Arab take on the legend of Sinbad. A new generation of film makers is emerging from Cairo's Higher Institute for Film Studies -- and more women are now following the path towards a future in film. What's very promising is that women are getting involved in directing and producing excellent work, according to Ezzat Abou Auf.

"(CNN) -- Zambian President Michael Sata, who was nicknamed ""King Cobra"" for his fiery comebacks and larger-than-life personality, has died. He was 77. Sata had traveled to London for unspecified medical treatment last week, and died at a hospital there Tuesday evening. Officials did not disclose a cause of death. ""It's shocking, it's devastating, because I knew he was sick. But I did not know it was going to end this way,"" said George Zulu, permanent secretary at the Zambian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""(We) lost a man who devoted his whole life to his country."" Succession of office . Vice President Guy Scott has been appointed acting president, said Roland Msiska, the Cabinet secretary. He will serve for 90 days until elections are held. Scott, who is of Scottish descent, will be the first white president in sub-Saharan Africa since apartheid. He is ineligible to be elected president because his parents were not born in Zambia, Msiska said. Absence of leadership . Sata took office in September 2011 after the incumbent president tearfully conceded in a televised speech, a rarity in a continent known for volatile elections and leaders fighting their defeat tooth-and-nail. Analysts hailed his election as an example of an African nation with a vibrant democracy. But not too long after he took office, speculation swirled over his lack of visibility -- which especially stood out for a man who loves the spotlight. Aides said his absence was a result of private international visits, and maintained those trips had nothing to do with medical treatment. The nation's bloggers have frequently criticized what they describe as ""absence of leadership,"" leading Sata to make a surprise appearance in parliament last month and declare that he was not dead. Political origins . Sata was born in the Zambian town of Mpika in 1936, and worked as a police officer during the colonial administration. He later trained as a pilot in Russia before returning home and helping develop housing projects in the nation. During Zambia's struggle for independence from Britain, he jumped into politics, and later founded the Patriotic Front -- then an opposition party. His campaign events electrified crowds drawn to his extroverted nature and fight for the average man. Sata, who narrowly lost to his predecessor Rupiah Banda in 2008, was a major critic of Chinese investment in the nation's copper industry. He especially targeted foreign companies that mistreated Zambian workers, making him popular among the nation's miners who accused the Chinese of deplorable work conditions. While in office, Sata warned foreign companies that while their investment is crucial to his nation, they must abide by the labor laws. The veteran politician has served in other positions, including city council, member of parliament and Cabinet minister for local government. Before his election, the copper-rich nation in southern Africa had been ruled by the same party for two decades. South African President Frederik de Klerk was the continent's last white President. His party lost to Nelson Mandela's African National Congress in South Africa's first multiracial, fully democratic elections in 1994.

"Washington (CNN) -- Following criticism for including ISIS footage of an American captive in an Arizona campaign ad, GOP House candidate Wendy Rogers' campaign has edited the segment out of the ad -- but is standing by its contention that the incumbent Democrat is soft on terrorism. Rogers, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, launched the attack ad against freshman Rep. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona's 9th District. In a statement defending the message in the ad, Rogers campaign spokesman James Harris said that the ad was edited to keep the focus on Sinema's voting record on national security. ""She must explain why she voted for terrorists to be tried on American soil, where they could pose an even greater danger to our homeland, and how she justified voting to give constitutional rights to those intent on destroying our nation,"" Rogers said in a statement. Obama's commitment to fighting ISIS threat questioned . The ad first went up on YouTube on Monday, drawing immediate criticism from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The new version was published Tuesday night. The original footage showed American journalist James Foley on his knees as an ISIS militant, dressed in all black, swings a knife close to Foley's side. The edited version cut the scene altogether, showing instead several ISIS militants walking in a group with guns in hand. ISIS Fast Facts . While Sinema's campaign did not immediately return CNN's request for comment, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's western regional press spokesman, Tyrone Gayle, told ABC News via email: ""For Wendy Rogers to use such a reprehensible tactic to make baseless claims just to smear Representative Sinema proves how desperate her campaign has become."" Rogers apparently is the first candidate to use ISIS video footage in a campaign ad. New Mexico Republican candidate Allen Weh showed a still frame of Foley's executioner with knife in hand in an ad against Sen. Tom Udall back in August. Foley himself was cropped out of the frame.

According to a CBS News/New York Times poll in September, a majority of Americans said they thought a terrorist attack is likely, with 17 percent saying that terrorism is one of the most important issues to them weeks going into the midterms.

"(CNN) -- Educators and policymakers have long dreamed of providing universal, low cost, first-class higher education. Their wish may come true soon thanks to an unlikely source: Silicon Valley. The mecca of the technology universe is in the process of revolutionizing higher education in a way that educators, colleges and universities cannot, or will not. One of the men responsible for what may be an Athens-like renaissance is Sebastian Thrun, Google's vice president and pioneer in artificial intelligence and robotics. Known in science circles for his engineering feats -- like Stanley, the self-driving car -- Thrun is using his technological prowess to make quality higher education available to the world. I recently interviewed him on my radio show, ""Morning In America."" Last year, while teaching a graduate level artificial intelligence class at Stanford University, Thrun lamented that his course could only reach 200 students in the suburbs of Palo Alto. So, he decided to offer his own free online class, with the same homework, quizzes and tests that he gives to Stanford students. He announced the proposal with a single e-mail. Before he knew it, he had a flood of takers. ""Usually I reach about 200 students and now I reach 160,000,"" said Thrun incredulously. ""In my entire life of education I didn't have as much an impact on people as I had in these two months."" By utilizing online videos and educational resources, Thrun's class was being accessed by students from all corners of the world. In fact, the students themselves translated the class for free from English into 44 languages. Until now, an overwhelming number of these students -- many in developing countries and lacking standard education credentials -- never would have had a chance at a Stanford-level education. Yet, their appetite for quality education was strong. Do we need a revolution in higher education? In fact, of all the students taking Thrun's class globally and at Stanford, the top 410 students were online. The 411th top performer was a Stanford student. ""We just found over 400 people in the world who outperformed the top Stanford student,"" Thrun said. Realizing the potential at his fingertips, Thrun launched Udacity, an independent online education company that provides high quality education at low cost to virtually everyone. Udacity offers 11 STEM courses like ""Introduction to Physics,"" ""Intro to Computer Science,"" and ""Web Application Engineering"" -- all free. There are no admissions offices and anyone can sign up. After the class, students can choose to certify their skills online or in one of Udacity's 4,500 testing centers for a fee. Those certificates can then be sent to employers. In one course you can learn to make your own Google-style search engine in just seven weeks. The reaction has been overwhelming. ""People really want good education. There is a huge need,"" Thrun said. ""Hundreds of thousands of people just sign up because they really care. They really want to advance themselves and their lives and they don't want to pay $50,000 or $100,000 to get there."" The classes are structured much like university classes. But instead of traditional types of lectures, all-star professors give video presentations that directly engage and challenge students. Thrun is using technology not only to transform educational access and curriculums, but also teaching. For the past thousand years, professors have been lecturing at students. ""[It's] like trying to lose weight by watching a professor exercise,"" quips Thrun. Now he is leading a new charge -- interactive, student focused technology education. The results are inspiring. On my radio show alone early one morning, several listeners called in to say they already took classes through Udacity. One man had his sights set on graduate school but was too busy with family and work to ever finish along a traditional path. Now, through Udacity, he can take the STEM classes he wants when he wants. Another man, age 53, decided to change careers and go back to a local college to study computer science. When he heard of Udacity, he dropped out of school and signed up for an online course. He said he learned more in several weeks with Udacity than he did in an entire semester at the local college, and he paid nothing for it. As you can imagine, Thrun's enterprise has rattled the foundations of the education establishment. His critics say that a Udacity certificate is worth nothing and how can one know the true identity of a student on the free-for-all jungle that is the Internet? I raised these questions to Thrun. He said Udacity has already partnered with more than 20 companies who verify and accept the certificates of course completion. Some are already hiring graduates of Udacity courses. Thrun is also working with other companies to design and tailor classes to specific needs in the work force. Soon, Udacity will be launching in-person testing centers to verify a student's knowledge and skills. Udacity is simultaneously meeting the educational needs of the public and the vocational requirements of the labor force directly and efficiently, more so than we can say of many universities and colleges. I asked Thrun whether his enterprise and others like it will be the end of higher education as we know it -- exclusive enclaves for a limited number of students at high tuitions? ""I think it's the beginning of higher education,"" Thrun replied. ""It's the beginning of higher education for everybody."" Read more about education on Schools of Thought . Much of traditional American higher education prides itself on a false promotion of diversity, opportunity and excellence. But to my knowledge, with one class alone, Thrun has provided a level of diversity, opportunity and academic rigor not seen before. People from any country, any background and any income level can receive an elite education at virtually no cost. We have been talking about equal educational opportunity for years.

"(CNN) -- Coast Guard rescuers airlifted a hunter from a remote Alaskan island after he was mauled by a group of bears. The bears attacked the 65-year-old man and his hunting party, who were carrying a deer that they had shot on Sally Island, the Coast Guard said in a statement. It said five bears took part in the attack Tuesday, describing their numbers as unusual. The alarm was raised by a master of a fishing vessel who had dropped the hunters off on the island and was waiting nearby for them to come back. He told the Coast Guard that the injured man needed immediate medical assistance. None of the other hunters were hurt. ""The fact that there were five bears was an abnormality and this serves as a reminder that anything can happen and we need to be aware of our surroundings,"" said Lt. Joseph Schlosser, operational unit watchstander for the Coast Guard 17th District. The injured hunter was flown to Kodiak Municipal Airport and then handed over to emergency medical services, the Coast Guard said. In May, a woman jogging at an Air Force base in Alaska survived an attack by a brown bear sow defending its two cubs.

"(CNN) -- British jets sent to join the fight against ISIS have conducted reconnaissance missions but have not yet targeted any militant positions, the country's Ministry of Defence said Saturday. The intelligence gathered by the aircraft will help determine targets for future missions, according to the ministry. They're ready to strike when necessary, the ministry said. The Royal Air Force Tornadoes were sent from the Akrotiri air base in Cyprus to Iraq, according to the defense ministry. Photographs released by the ministry appeared to show two aircraft. A tanker aircraft supported the British fighters, the Ministry of Defence said, adding that U.K. transport aircraft continued to deliver supplies to Kurdish forces fighting ISIS. Parliament authorized airstrikes by British forces on Friday against ISIS in Iraq, but not Syria. How much will it cost Britain to bomb ISIS? 'Not the stuff of fantasy' The 524-43 vote to join the air campaign came after Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the country had a ""duty to take part"" in international efforts to combat the extremist group. The terror group is an organization of ""staggering"" brutality, he said, which has already killed one British hostage and threatens the lives of two more. ""This is not a threat on the far side of the world; left unchecked, we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean and bordering a NATO member, with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Nestled in an epic landscape where two oceans meet in a flurry of foam and waves, Cape Town is one of the most photogenic places on Earth. The city attracts millions of visitors each year who come to admire its vibrant sights and breath-taking scenery, snapping pictures along the way to serve as lasting mementos. Usually, they have to buy expensive hotel Internet or wait until they get home to show them to friends and family, but now, thanks to a local start-up, they can share them almost instantly. ""Escape to the Cape,"" brainchild of a 37-year-old former banker Shaheed Ebrahim, offers tours of the city in 3G Wi-Fi equipped vehicles which allows his clients to upload photos to Facebook and Instagram as soon as they take them. Ebrahim got the idea for his venture after struggling to entertain his young children on car journeys: ""My wife and I would give the kids iPads preloaded with games in order to keep them occupied, but we quickly realized that for many functions you had to be connected to the Internet,"" he says. The Cape Town native, who won the Emerging Tourism Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2012, has always been passionate about his home city, and would regularly take family and friends visiting from overseas on sightseeing trips.

When the bank he was working for wanted him to relocate, he decided to leave the corporate world and use his payout to turn his hobby into a profession. However, in South Africa's tourism industry, which was worth nearly $9 billion in 2012 and represented around 4.6% of the country's direct employment, competition among tour operators is stiff. Ebrahim soon realized he needed to offer something that would make him stand out from the crowd: ""We live in the technology age where people expect to exchange information instantly,"" he says. ""They want upload their pictures on Facebook and Instagram in real-time, and I often host bloggers who wish to publish articles and pictures immediately."" When it comes to photo opportunities, Escape to the Cape tours offer plenty, visiting sites like Table Mountain and Cape Town's colorful Bo Kaap district with its yellow, blue and pink houses. If that doesn't fill up your camera's memory card, there's also a chance to see penguin and sea lion colonies, and Cape Point, a World Heritage Site whose 200 meter high sheer cliffs cut deep into the mixing waters of Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The company now employs five permanent staff, but Ebrahim admits that things were far from rosy in the beginning: ""It took two years for the firm to become profitable, which was nerve wracking, but we persevered,"" he says. Escape to the Cape is planning to introduce a new service where family and friends at home can take part in tours virtually, via online streaming in tour cars. He is also thinking of expanding his operations to other regions: ""We have a transferable concept and there is no reason why it couldn't work in other countries too,"" he explains.

"(CNN) -- As the world reels from its deadliest Ebola outbreak, health experts are fast-tracking tests for various vaccines, and hope to have millions of experimental doses by next year. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which continues to spread in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The virus has killed nearly 5,000 people -- mostly in those three nations -- and infected twice that number. Scientists racing to stop the epidemic are trying various experimental drugs on patients, including ZMapp and TKM-Ebola. In addition to drug development, there's a scramble to develop vaccines, with scores of companies working on experimental doses, the World Health Organization said this week. Health care workers in affected nations will get the first opportunity to try the experimental vaccines. GlaxoSmithKline and the Public Health Agency of Canada are already conducting the first phase of clinical trials for two experimental vaccines, according to the WHO. The latter hopes to have 12 million experimental doses by the first quarter of next year. The GSK vaccine is being tried on healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom and Mali; the Canadian one is undergoing testing on healthy volunteers in the United States. ""If the vaccines are determined to be safe, tens of thousands of doses could be used in West African trials beginning in January of next year,"" the WHO said. Other vaccines in the works include those by Protein Sciences and Inovio, and another one by Russian scientists. According to the latest WHO figures released Saturday, there have been at least 10,141 cases of Ebola -- with 4,922 reported deaths -- as of Thursday. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea account for nearly all the cases. All but one district in Liberia and all districts in Sierra Leone have reported at least one case of Ebola since the start of the outbreak in March, the WHO said. About 450 health workers have caught the virus worldwide. Of those, 244 have died. Ebola is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The push for vaccines came as new cases of Ebola were confirmed in New York and Mali, the latter the first case in that nation. Complete coverage on Ebola .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force's mysterious unmanned space plane, the X-37B, is about to come back to Earth after nearly two years in orbit on a mission the military won't tell us much about. The X-37B is expected to land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the Air Force said. The base did not give an exact time for the landing, but a notice to aviators and mariners on the Federal Aviation Administration's website Tuesday said airspace around the Southern California base would be closed from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT Wednesday. ""Team Vandenberg stands ready to implement safe landing operations for the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, the third time for this unique mission,"" Col. Keith Baits, commander of the 30th Space Wing, said in a statement. The X-37B, which looks like a small space shuttle, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida on December 11, 2012. At the time, the Air Force said its mission would last about nine months. The X-37B ""is designed to demonstrate reusable spacecraft technologies for America's future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth,"" an Air Force statement said. ""Technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, and autonomous orbital flight, re-entry and landing."" But as the spacecraft has been in orbit for more than 22 months, speculation on other uses abounds, including testing of a secret space weapon or spying activities. The previous mission of the X-37B, which landed at Vandenberg on June 16, 2012, lasted 469 days, according to the Air Force. That mission was flown by the second of the Air Force's two X-37B orbiters. The current mission is the second for the first of the orbiters, which was refurbished after it spent 224 days in orbit following an April 2010 launch. When the current mission launched, the Air Force said it might not be the last. ""Officials anticipate multiple missions will be required to satisfy the test program objectives, but the exact number of missions has not been determined,"" a statement said. The X-37B spacecraft is 29 feet, 3 inches long and 9 feet, 6 inches high with a wingspan of 14 feet and 11 inches. It weighs about 5.5 tons.

"(CNN) -- The death of famed Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee on Tuesday marks the symbolic end of an important era in American journalism, one that, unfortunately, was very different than our own. Bradlee turned The Washington Post from a sleepy, second-rate publication into a powerhouse of investigative journalism. During the early 1970s, he was at the editorial helm when his reporters broke the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation and were part of the group of journalists who published the Pentagon Papers. Bradlee was a true believer in the power of journalism to expose the abuses and misuse of political power. He was devoted to a vision of the news media in American politics that took seriously the responsibility for the press to go wherever was necessary to keep politicians in check. Bradlee wrote that, ""I started looking for the truth after hearing the official version of a truth."" While Bradlee liked to sell a newspaper as much as anyone, the way he would do so would be through publishing the most hard-hitting stories possible. That era of journalism has faded. Bradlee's death came on the same day that Pew released a report showing how more and more Americans are just listening to like-minded sources of news. Journalists react to 'icon' Ben Bradlee's death . Journalism in this era is less about speaking truth to power than speaking to those who agree on a particular version of the truth. As Pew reported, ""When it comes to getting news about politics and government, liberals and conservatives inhabit different worlds. There is little overlap in the news sources they turn to and trust."" The business challenges facing much of the media have created immense pressure on news organizations, reporters and producers to cater to audiences that will enhance the bottom line rather than to produce work that will truly challenge the holders of political and economic power. This certainly does not describe all the news media, as there are many great journalists and some terrific news outlets, but it has become an unfortunate trend. The zeal for investigation that Bradlee once nurtured has, for many, been eclipsed by the imperative to provide an ideological echo chamber. Bradlee was far from perfect. As his biographers will recount, he made many mistakes in his career. In his zeal for the big story, he could be sloppy. He allowed the publication of a story about an 8-year-old heroin addict that won the Pulitzer Prize, but which turned out to be a hoax. But Bradlee made a huge contribution to newspaper journalism when it was at its prime. He and his generation of editors and reporters helped to show how the media could be an indispensable watchdog in our political system. Bradlee's death should serve as a reminder of the kind of news to which we all need to aspire.","Famed former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee dies at 93 .

"(CNN) -- Dilma Rousseff's re-election as president of Brazil on Sunday may have surprised many. After all, it was only a little over a year ago that social protests swept parts of the country as demonstrators complained that her government had failed to provide quality transportation, education and health care services. Economic growth, meanwhile, also slowed, from an annual GDP growth rate of 7.5% in 2010 to 2.5% in 2013. As a result, Rousseff's approval rating tumbled from a high of 65% in March 2013 to 30% later that year (although it had climbed back up over 44% in recent months). Yet she still pulled off a narrow victory in Sunday's runoff vote. Why? In part, her re-election suggests that most voters -- especially the poor -- were more concerned with her Workers' Party's impressive track record at reducing poverty. But Rousseff's re-election also underscored the poor's fears of selecting a fiscally conservative presidential candidate, Aécio Neves, who represented the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, which had done little to improve their lot during the 1990s. This matters in a country in which nearly half the population earns less than the minimum wage, and where the poverty rate runs unusually high for a middle-income country. Still, although poverty rates in Brazil remain high, there has been progress: Income inequality has fallen, while the percentage of Brazilians living on less than $2 a day dropped from 6.9% in 2004 to 3.3% in 2012. This progress has come as the poor's access to food has also burgeoned, dramatically reducing hunger across the country. Many attribute all this to Rousseff's successful anti-poverty programs, such as the Bolsa Familia (Family Grant) program. Created in 2003, Bolsa Familia is a cash transfer program that provides monthly stipends of 70 reais to approximately 13.8 million families. To receive this money, families must enroll their children in school and prove they are receiving medical vaccinations. But the Bolsa Familia program also provided a notable political advantage. The program was created by Rousseff's political party, the PT, the brainchild of her presidential predecessor and mentor, Luiz Ignacio ""Lula"" da Silva, and quickly generated credibility and support among the poor. Because of Rousseff's other anti-poverty programs, such as Zero Fome (Zero Hunger), which expanded food benefits to the poor, and the Brasil Sem Miséria (Brazil without Destitution) program, the PT gained a reputation for meeting the poor's needs. In contrast, Rousseff's opponent, Neves, represented a party whose previous president, Fernando H. Cardoso (1994-2002), was focused mainly on stabilizing the economy through tighter fiscal policy and privatization. Of course, the Cardoso administration was credited with improving education through federal programs increasing salaries for teachers, as well as impressive public health programs, such as the national AIDS program. But poverty alleviation and social welfare did not appear to be a priority for his government, and more voters appear to have felt that Brazil is in a better position today than it was 10 years ago. The question now is what Rousseff will do to consolidate her position. Looking ahead, she seems committed to using future oil revenues obtained through Petrobras, the largest oil company in Brazil, to provide additional funding for education and health. For example, about half the fund's reserves will go toward primary and secondary education, such as better school infrastructure, technology, teacher salaries and college scholarships. In addition, the fund will be used to increase health care spending, with an eye on improving the quantity and quality of public hospitals and personnel. All this suggests that Rousseff appears to have learned that to be re-elected in Brazil, investing in the poor and helping them escape poverty can be more politically advantageous than simply trying to build the country into an economic giant.","Dilma Rousseff was re-elected president of Brazil on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Amos Wekesa has seen a lot of changes in his country. Today, the self-made mogul oversees Great Lakes Safaris, one of the largest tour operators in Uganda. He has made millions introducing his clients to the splendor of his country, whether taking them on elephant treks in Queen Elizabeth National Park, or giving them an opportunity to get close to the local chimps at Murchison Falls. ""Personally I've traveled the whole world, and I think one of the things I am advantaged with is having seen my own country as a tour guide, and seen how the tourists were shocked about the beauty of this area,"" he says. In the last few years, Wekesa has seen tourism numbers swell, but that wasn't always the case. Though 2013 saw 1.2 million travelers (a 50% increase over the last five years), tourism was at a standstill for many decades in the aftermath of Idi Amin's bloodthirsty reign. In the shadow of ""Big Daddy"" Two year before Wekesa's birth, Amin had forcefully taken control of the country. Amin declared himself President for Life, Conqueror of the British Empire and Last King of Scotland. He also liked to be called ""Big Daddy"", though his countrymen would eventually bestow a different moniker in the wake of his reign of terror: The Butcher of Uganda. ""At the time I was born, it was a difficult time for every Ugandan. There were a lot of challenges economically for Ugandans. And people tried to find ways to survive,"" Wekesa recalls of his challenging childhood. ""My family was close to the border and all they could do was smuggle stuff from Kenya. I think as a child, I was involved in smuggling by the age of seven."" The 50 cent salary . There was nothing swift about Wekesa's rise. After school, he worked sweeping floors, earning $10 a month. ""I was living, to be honest, on half a dollar a week,"" he recalls. His luck would eventually change when scored got a job as a tour guide. ""I remember very well my first trip. We had three tourists and we went around for 15 days. We were doing camping, we had to put up tents, had to cook breakfast for the guys, and stir the campfire until the last person finished smoking, maybe 3 am. It was a draining job,"" he recalls. When he decided to set up his own firm in 2001, he found he got little support. ""People would say, 'you were born in a poor family, we told you, you can't do business,'"" he says. ""I mean 99% of the people that surrounded were telling me 'You can't succeed. You don't have a background of business.' But I knew in my heart that you know what, I think God has given me this opportunity and tried me out, and I'm going to make sure I succeed in this thing."" Today, Wekesa has made millions and become one of the go-to Ugandan tour guides with a company providing 180 jobs to the local economy. ""The company has grown to be one of the top three safari companies in the country. But I think one of things I like about this is having been the first Ugandan to build accommodation inside a national park. (It inspired) so many Ugandans to start building. Now we are seeing a lot of Ugandans saying, 'you know what 'If Amos can do it, I can do it.'""

"(CNN) -- New Zealand's center-right National Party, led by Prime Minister John Key, won Saturday's general election with 48% of the vote, according to a complete preliminary count. It was followed by the Labour Party, which took 25% of the vote, the Green Party with 10%, and the New Zealand First Party with 9%, the Electoral Commission said. The National Party won 61 of 121 seats in the New Zealand parliament, but in his acceptance speech Key said he would seek alliances with smaller parties. ""I feel humbled and energized by the prospect of a third term. Over the next few days I will talk to other political parties with the view of putting together a broader majority,"" he said. Pre-election polls had put Key in the lead to win a third term. In polling for ""preferred prime minister,"" Key had 43% support, compared with 12% for Labour's David Cunliffe -- this despite allegations on the campaign trail that the prime minister lied to the nation by covertly approving a widespread spying program while publicly denying it. Key rejected the claims. One of the most vocal critics of Key has been German tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, who has been a New Zealand resident since 2010. While he could not run for office, the Megaupload founder has gradually emerged as a player on the fringe of New Zealand politics, as he fights a legal battle in New Zealand courts to avoid extradition to the U.S. on criminal copyright charges. Earlier this year, Dotcom founded a political party, the Internet Party, which teamed up with the Maori nationalist Mana Party to contest the 2014 election. They campaigned for a more inclusive society, greater digital rights and an end to government electronic surveillance. The coalition failed to win any seats in the election, prompting Dotcom to tell the New Zealand Herald that ""the brand Kim Dotcom was poisoned ... and I did not see that before the last couple of weeks."" Earlier this month, Dotcom hosted a trio of Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and Julian Assange in an event he called ""Moment of Truth"" in which they alleged Key misled the public. The event, however, appeared to have little effect in denting the National Party's path to victory. Under Key, a former foreign exchange trader, the party is credited with keeping the economy on an even keel. Key has developed a reputation as a safe pair of hands with a friendly personal style -- although his political brand may have sustained some lasting damage during a bruising election campaign, which saw one of his top ministers resign over alleged involvement in a political smear against a senior bureaucrat. The National Party won the last election in 2011 with 49.78% of the vote. Turnout has fallen ""dramatically"" in New Zealand over the last two decades, from 85% in 1981 to 69% at the last election in 2011, according to the country's electoral commission. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime Minister John Key says he aims to build ""a broader majority""

"(CNN) -- When the ground began to shake in Tokyo on March 11, 2011, Katsuhiro Asama was in the office of his creative management agency. Some 200 miles north, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake had struck off the coast of the Tohoku region, triggering dozens of aftershocks and a tsunami that sent 30-feet high walls of water crashing across fields, flattening entire towns and propelling debris miles inland. More than 15,000 people died and over 20 times that number were displaced by the disaster. It was the largest ever earthquake to hit Japan and the fourth biggest on record worldwide. Asama spent much of that day checking on his loved ones and colleagues -- professional photographers, makeup artists and models, many of whom had family or friends in Tohoku. ""I strongly felt I had to do something and anything I could possibly do,"" the father of two said. In the days that followed, his employees returned to their hometowns and confronted the aftermath. Asama's own grandparents lived in Rikuzentakata, a coastal city in Iwate Prefecture that was completely wiped out by the waves. ""Of course, we did something for our families, but at the same time, we started to think about what we could do for others,"" he said. Two months later, on May 14, Asama and some of his colleagues began what would become known as the Egao Project -- or ""Smile"" Project in English -- traveling to the worst-hit areas of Japan to pamper the tsunami survivors who had been left to live in temporary evacuation shelters. The group, which organizes activities like hair and makeup sessions and face painting for children, has helped to bring smiles to the faces of those who have endured extraordinary hardships. The volunteers capture these small moments of joy in photographs, hoping the survivors' remarkable resilience will serve as an inspiration to others. Over the last three years, the group has visited around 180 shelters across Tohoku. They have a core group of several dozen volunteers who visit the region twice a month, but as many as 2,000 people have contributed to their mission. Community building . Egao Project donates the photographs to the survivors, many of whom lost their possessions in the disaster, but the activities have also helped build a sense of community among those living in the shelters, according to Asama. For him, one of the most memorable images was taken on the group's first visit to the region, on May 14, 2011. It's an image of two middle-aged women with beaming faces, embracing -- their two enormous grins forming creases around their eyes. ""They seem to be very close friends,"" Asama said. It was only later that his team learned the pair had never met before that day. One woman lost her house in the tsunami and the other, whose home was spared, had visited the shelter to assist. It was only through the Egao Project's activities that they crossed paths and became good friends. The project seeks to draw attention to the plight of the people of Tohoku, more than 200,000 of whom still live in temporary accommodation three and a half years after the earthquake struck. ""In summer or winter it's really quite harsh -- even inside of the housing it gets really cold,"" said Kozue Miyagi, a volunteer responsible for event planning and promotion. ""They don't even know how much longer they have to live (like this), because the housing situation in Tohoku is not progressing as easily as initially planned, so they're living in quite a challenging, harsh environment."" Asama says that many of those living in the shelters are ""tired, stressed, physically and mentally exhausted."" ""But from our experience, we know that our activities can lighten up their day a little and make them smile, even for a few seconds."" ""If we know we can do something positive, we just have to do it and (not give up),"" he said. Scars remain . The group's work is far from over. Six months ago, when a team of Egao Project volunteers visited one of the shelters, a girl approached them and said: ""How can I smile when I lost my dad and grandpa? I really don't like photographs."" ""It was quite a shock,"" said Asama. ""After three years of project activities and more than 5,000 smile photographs, we thought that people (were starting) to recover slowly but surely. But the fact was, there are scars on many people's hearts still."" Asama and his team are determined to keep the project going ""until everyone can get their smile back,"" even if that takes decades. ""We will not do it for them, but we will do it together with them,"" he said.","Japanese NGO seeks to bring small moments of joy to survivors of 2011 tsunami .

"(CNN) -- When a teenage gunman opened fire at students in a high school cafeteria in Washington state, a relative said, he was not shooting at random targets. Jaylen Fryberg, who witnesses said gunned down students at Marysville-Pilchuck High School, is the cousin of two of the wounded. ""All three of them are cousins, and they live right close to each other,"" Don Hatch told CNN affiliate KOMO. His 14-year-old grandson, Nate Hatch, is among four wounded in the rampage Friday that left Fryberg and a female student dead. The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable, Hatch said. They even went to a school dance together last week, where Fryberg was named the freshman class homecoming prince. ""Only God knows what escalated this. Only God knows,"" Hatch said, according to KOMO. ""Nobody pushed a button with bullying. It's just something that happened, and we don't know why."" Hatch said he forgives Fryberg and plans on visiting his family. ""I'll say, 'I feel for you and I'll pray for you,'"" he said. Authorities have not publicly identified the shooter or the student he killed. The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Marysville police spokesman Robb Lamoureux said. Wounded in intensive care . The wounded -- two girls and two boys -- are in intensive care in hospitals in Seattle and Everett. The boys, identified as cousins 15-year-old Andrew Fryberg and Nate Hatch, are at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Susan Gregg, the hospital's spokeswoman, said. Fryberg is in critical condition and Hatch is listed in serious condition, she said. The girls were identified as Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, according to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett's chief medical officer Dr. Joanne Roberts. They were in critical condition with head injuries. At a news conference Saturday, Roberts read a brief statement from Soriano's family: ""Our family is in shock. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers during this tragedy. Our hearts go out to the other victims and their families."" Roberts said dead tissue was being removed from the girls' head wounds and surgery was conducted to allow their brains to swell and contract. ""The next three days are going to be crucial,"" she said. Of the victims' families, Roberts said: ""They are having all of the reactions that you or I would have if we were in their circumstances. Much of the day yesterday was spent trying to make identification. That was terribly stressful for them. We've seen tears. We've seen anger. They are just grieving."" Lunchroom in shock . Investigators in Marysville, about 34 miles north of Seattle, have not provided details on the shooting, but students offered up accounts that painted a terrifying, chaotic picture. Fellow student Jordan Luton was finishing his lunch in the cafeteria when he heard a loud bang. He saw Fryberg go up to a table of students, ""came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them,"" Luton told CNN. ""They were his friends, so it wasn't just random."" Freshman Rachel Heichel was sitting at a table about 60 feet from Fryberg. When the shots started, she turned around and saw the shooter standing there. ""When I saw him, I was like, 'Oh my God, that's Jaylen.' I would have never expected it would have been him, out of all people,"" she said. School in scramble . Someone called 911, and by 10:40 a.m., police swarmed the building, guns readied. They went room to room, placing tape over doors to mark the ones they'd secured. ""I've got 30 students at the gym ready to go to the northwest,"" police could be heard saying over radio. ""We're going there to evacuate more students."" Then they came upon the gunman's . body. The Snohomish County sheriff's office said Saturday that investigators interviewed more than 100 students and confirmed that ""a cafeteria worker attempted to stop the shooter."" The Beretta .40-caliber handgun believed used in the shooting has been traced to Fryberg's father, a law enforcement source told CNN. It was bought at Cabela's in Tulalip, Washington, a federal source said. Grief, disbelief . It was hard for Luton to make sense of the shooting. ""I have no idea what his motive was because yesterday at football practice, he was all fine, talking ... having a good time,"" he said. ""And then today, just horrible. I don't know what went through his head or what caused him to do it."" Alex Pietsch, a sophomore, told CNN on Saturday that the shooting keeps replaying in his mind. By all accounts, Fryberg was a popular student. Just a week ago, he had been named the high school's freshman homecoming prince, according to a YouTube video of the ceremony and accounts provided by students to CNN. ""It's weird to think about, because you see him and he is such a happy person,"" Pietsch said. ""You never really see him be so angry and so upset. ... People were telling me who it was when I was getting in my mom's car and I was like, 'What? This is not happening. ... This is crazy.' It was just surprising to me that him out of all people would be the one."" Multiple social media accounts in Fryberg's name depict him frequently hunting and using rifles. Those accounts say he was a Native American and a member of the Tulalip Tribe. But a Twitter account in his name gave a very different picture, that of a teenager with a broken heart. Luton could not confirm reports that Fryberg had been bullied. But two weeks ago, according to Luton, Fryberg got into a fight after somebody said ""something racist"" to him. Who was Jaylen Fryberg? CNN's Carma Hassan, Ray Sanchez, Susan Candiotti, Jake Tapper, Shimon Prokupecz, Evan Perez, AnneClaire Stapleton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Only God knows what escalated this,"" a relative of the shooter says .

"(CNN) -- Forget kissing babies, to win office in Brazil you may have to leap a building in a single bound. Latin America's largest economy will head to the ballot on October 5. Voting is compulsory for Brazilians, so with dozens of local and federal congressional seats in the offing, candidates rely on the exciting and the occasionally bizarre to attract attention. That's especially true on the small screen. One candidate dressed as Wonder Woman to woo voters. Another created his own superhero: a laser-beam shooting anti-communist. He takes to the skies flying from communist project to communist project, obliterating them with a laser-focused glance. Others have taken the more obvious comedy route. A congressman known by his stage name, Tiririca, has a video where he appears in a wig alongside dancers that wouldn't be out of place at a Miley Cyrus show. In another video he makes a bathroom joke involving a politicians ""main role"" and a roll of toilet paper. But perhaps he is just sticking with what works. He is forecast to keep his job, no matter how unsavory its role. But some Brazilians don't share this sense of humor. One voter blames the proliferation of the humorous ads on ""low education levels"" and voters who think ""elections are just a joke."" Another pointed to a serious problem, saying that voters think ""everyone is corrupt so they vote for some guy because he's funny."" And it's not just superheroes and a clown filling up the legally mandated free air time.

"(CNN) -- Oregon authorities have arrested a man accused of killing his girlfriend in Washington state and posting gruesome pictures of her body online. David Michael Kalac, 33, was taken into custody near Portland late Wednesday by the Wilsonville Police Department. He was wanted on suspicion of second-degree murder. ""Outside of a terrorist attack this is as serious as you can get,"" said Deputy Scott Wilson of the Kitsap County Sheriff's Department. Authorities first received a call Tuesday afternoon. When they arrived at the apartment in Port Orchard, Washington, they found the body of Amber Lynn Coplin, 30. Around the same time, authorities started receiving tips about suspicious photographs posted online on social media sites Imgur and 4chan. ""The initial poster, believed to be Kalac, was also posting comments with the pictures. He said that the crime scene would be discovered and what he was going to do. We took this very seriously. We have no reason to believe that anyone posted them but him,"" the deputy said. According to CNN affiliate KOMO, the statement read, in part: ""Check the news for Port Orchard Washington in a few hours. Her son will be home from school soon. He'll find her, then call the cops. I just wanted to share the pics before they find me. I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough. When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicide by cop. I understand the doubts. Just check the (expletive) news. I have to lose my phone now."" KOMO reported the same writer later added: ""Turns out its way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks on the movies. She fought so Damn hard."" Kalac has a history of domestic violence and making threats to law enforcement, Wilson said. The victim's missing vehicle was found abandoned in Portland earlier in the day.

"Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- His home in Monrovia is just as he left it when he boarded the plane to the United States. A tiny tin-roofed room in a run-down building that's now the focal point of so much of the paranoia ricocheting across the world. But while the United States struggles to contain the fear stirred up by Thomas Eric Duncan's diagnosis in Dallas, here there's a different concern. Here, they are struggling to come to terms with the mounting death toll of all those who -- like Duncan -- came in contact with the pregnant woman who gave him Ebola. Already nine others are dead or dying. All the neighbors have been put quarantined. And local officials are trying to get in touch with everyone who may have interacted with the pregnant woman, Marthalene Williams. That number? ""Right now, according to statistics that we got, close to 100,"" says Pewo Wolobah from the local Ebola task force. Desperation and despair . Here in Monrovia, like in several African hotspots, the challenge of containing the virus is staggering. The disease has killed more than 3,400, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Liberia has been hit the worst -- with 2,069 dead. Hence, the desperation and despair in the homes along 72nd SKD Boulevard. Ebola spreads exponentially. If any of those people had direct contact with Williams' saliva or other bodily fluids, they are in danger of contracting the highly infectious disease -- and potentially passing it on. Unsuspecting contact . Marthalene Williams was in her seventh month of pregnancy when she collapsed. Duncan rushed to help. Williams' 12-year-old sister Tete was with him at the time, as were several other people. ""We've been through this over and over,"" Wolobah says. ""We tell the people no matter how much you love the person. It is the health authority that is responsible to pick up the sick."" But none of them knew Williams had Ebola, Tete says. Both of Williams' parents have tested positive for Ebola. Another woman who also ran to Williams' side was rushed to a hospital days later. Soon afterward, a neighbor was tasked with he difficult task of telling her 9-year-old daughter that mom is never coming home. And Duncan lies in a hospital bed in Dallas, critically ill. All of them contracted Ebola trying to do good. Helping Williams was the right thing to do -- the right thing with devastating consequences.

"Washington (CNN) -- CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on ""Inside Politics"" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Talk of Bill Clinton's role in the campaign stretch, where his wife hopes to make a difference, a 2016 GOP buildup and some 2014 observations from the trail made for a lively trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table on Sunday. 1. GOP grass roots sees a growing immigration crisis . We thought after the 2012 presidential election that Republicans would see their crisis with Latino voters and find some way to strike an immigration reform compromise with President Obama. It didn't happen, largely because of pressure from grass-roots conservatives who oppose any path to citizenship for the undocumented and consider even granting legal status tantamount to amnesty. Well, if you believed perhaps there would be room, and motivation, for a deal after the 2014 midterms -- think again. One striking common theme from a 1,200 -mile drive this past week across Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Iowa is the visceral reaction of conservatives when immigration comes up -- and often they are the ones to raise it early in any chat about what is driving their politics. Perhaps it's not surprising to hear this anger at a Colorado tea party meeting, where one speaker warned that Islamist suicide bombers are deliberately infecting themselves with Ebola and coming across the U.S.-Mexican border planning to ""cough and spit"" on Americans ""before blowing themselves up."" But talk of a wide-open border being exploited by terrorists also animated four Kansas women during a chat at a senior center in Bob Dole's hometown of Russell, and came up in conversations with voters in conservative rural Iowa. The bottom line: There appears to be little political space for House Speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who could well be majority leader in January, to negotiate any deal that would be acceptable to Obama. And, when the President takes executive actions, as he promises to do after the election unless there is some legislative breakthrough, it is clear the conservative grass roots will demand confrontation -- leaving the issue front and center as we head into the 2016 presidential cycle. 2. Hillary Clinton's delicate Wall Street balancing act . Hillary Clinton is closing the 2014 campaign with appearances designed to both help Democratic candidates this cycle and also help her test themes for her likely White House run in 2016. Last week it was Kentucky. This week it's Massachusetts and Rhode Island, to help two Democratic women in close gubernatorial contests. The Rhode Island stop, in particular, has an interesting twist, as detailed by Politico's Maggie Haberman: . ""That's the one to watch, because Gina Raimondo has been criticized as being too close to Wall Street herself. This has been a commentary applied to Hillary Clinton,"" said Haberman. ""Watch and see what Hillary Clinton's words are as she is helping her up there."" 3. Bill Clinton to court African-American voters in Louisiana . And while Hillary Clinton is in New England, ""Big Dog"" Bill Clinton will be in the Big Easy trying to help Democrats rescue a Senate seat that appears to be slipping away. Maeve Reston of the Los Angeles Times added the nickname for the former president and she noted his hope of generating increased turnout among African-Americans. ""Where he can really help her is with black voters in Louisiana,"" said Reston. ""She's going to get virtually all of them, both sides would say, but it's a matter of getting them to the polls, and Bill Clinton might be able to work his magic down there to help her do that."" Turning out the African-American vote is a top priority for Democrats there and in several other states now, and there could be a sequel if the Louisiana race ends up in a runoff. 4. Up all night on November 4? Maybe a good time to invest in coffee futures? Or book an advance airfare to New Orleans or -- Atlanta? Jonathan Martin of The New York Times rightly points out the likelihood of a late election night because so many Senate races are so close, including an Alaska contest that, in addition to the time zone issue, also includes many remote areas where the count could spill into Wednesday. Even then, he points out the possibility that control of the Senate might not be clear until months after November 4. ""I talked to a lot of folks from both parties over the weekend -- increasingly certain that Georgia is in fact going to a runoff,"" said Martin. ""And by the way, that's a January runoff."" 5. Ben Carson, the ""Tea-vangelical"" vote, Ebola and 2016 . Speaking of 2016, keep an eye on Dr. Ben Carson. The conservative favorite is adding staff to his talk of a possible presidential run, Nia Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reports. And supporters looking to encourage a Carson run are raising some serious money. ""He's got a virtual campaign-in-waiting, a campaign chairman, his super PAC raised $3 million in this last third quarter -- Ready for Hillary was only able to raise $2 million,"" said Henderson. ""Look for him to challenge Rand Paul and Ted Cruz for that key 'Tea-vangelical' vote. And this Ebola scare certainly gives him something of an opening to flex his medical knowledge during these next couple of days.""","Bill Clinton courts black voters in Louisiana this week .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Five American service members were killed in southern Afghanistan when a coalition jet, called in to help ward off a Taliban attack, mistakenly bombed them, an Afghan official said Tuesday. The five were killed Monday night along with an Afghan soldier in Zabul province, said Ghulam Sakhi Roghliwanai, the province's police chief. According to NATO, the troops were conducting a security operation. Such operations have been stepped up ahead of Afghanistan's presidential runoff election, which will take place Saturday. The service members' unit came in contact with enemy forces. That's when the casualties occurred, a U.S. military official told CNN. ""There is the possibility that fratricide may have been involved,"" he said. The incident is under investigation. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby acknowledged the deaths appear to be the result of friendly fire. ""I'm not going to get into too much detail about qualifying who they were or the specifics of the mission,"" Kirby said. ""We do have reason to suspect that friendly fire was the cause here, specifically friendly fire from the air, but the issue is under investigation."" A NATO statement provided a few details. Roghliwanai said the troops had completed their joint military sweep at about 9 p.m. Monday (12:30 p.m. ET) when they came under rocket fire from Taliban militants. The service members called in air support. ""But the airstrike mistakenly bombed their own friends too,"" he said. ""The Department of Defense is looking into what happened,"" U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. ""Our hearts are heavy over this loss, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the fallen."" Friendly fire incidents . Since the Afghan war began in October 2001, 2,323 Americans have died there. Once the United States confirms these latest deaths, the number will rise to 2,328. There have also been numerous fatalities resulting from friendly fire. Among the more publicized ones was the 2004 death of Pat Tillman. Tillman, who became a national hero after he gave up a lucrative contract with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals to join the Army's elite Rangers force, was awarded the Silver Star, the military's third-highest combat decoration, after the Army said he was killed leading a counterattack. Only later did the Army admit he had been shot accidentally by his comrades. Here are some of the others: . • In April 2002, four Canadian service members were killed and eight others seriously wounded when a U.S. Air National Guard pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on a group of Canadian troops conducting a nighttime training exercise in southern Afghanistan. • In August 2007, three British soldiers were killed when a U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle mistakenly struck their position with a 500-pound bomb during a firefight with Taliban fighters in northern Helmand province. • In July 2008, nine British soldiers were wounded when a UK Apache attack helicopter mistakenly fired on them during a firefight with Taliban fighters in central Afghanistan. • In November 2011, NATO helicopters attacked a military checkpoint in northwest Pakistan, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. The attack wounded 13 others in the volatile region bordering Afghanistan. The incident greatly strained relations between the nations. Other developments . The Taliban abducted a busload of students and lecturers from Kandahar University as they traveled to the capital, Kabul, on Tuesday, said Mohammad Ali Ahmadi, the deputy governor of Ghazni province. The exact number of passengers on the bus was not immediately known. Negotiations were under way to find the passengers and free them, Ahmadi said.

"(CNN) -- Youths have rioted on the streets of Athens and other Greek cities for the past three days. Stores and cars have been torched, barricades erected and rioters have fought running battles with police. Athens riot police come under attack near the capital's main police station Sunday. The unrest came after police shot dead teenager Alexandros Grigoropoulos, 15, who they allege was about to throw a fuel-filled device at them, as a gang of youths pelted a patrol vehicle. What has been the political reaction to the unrest? The Greek government, led by Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis' center-right New Democracy party since 2004, has appealed for calm. Interior minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos and his deputy tendered their resignations, but this offer was rejected by Karamanlis. The government has been quick to condemn the death of Grigoropoulos in a bid to defuse the crisis. Two police officers have been arrested.  Watch youths riot in Greece » . ""An investigation is under way and those found responsible with be punished,"" said Pavlopoulos Sunday. ""Measures will also be taken to avoid such incidents again in the future."" Much of the violence have been blamed on self-styled anarchists -- although opposition parties have been quick to blame the Greek government for the crisis. The Communist party has announced that a rally will take place in Athens Monday.  See images of anarchy on Greek streets » . Is there a wider political context to the unrest?  Greece has endured a tumultuous 18 months. Karamanlis called a snap election in mid-2007 to back his proposals for reforming Greece's social and economic system, including the privatization of ailing public institutions such as Olympic Airlines. He has argued that such reforms are necessary if Greece is to compete with the rest of Europe and the wider world. Karamanlis assured workers -- one in five of whom lives below the poverty line according to government statistics -- that massive layoffs would not result from the reforms. What happened? Just weeks before the September election, forest fires ravaged much of Greece, leaving at least 70 people dead. Many blamed Greece's slow bureaucracy for not responding quickly enough to the disaster. For his part Karamanlis suggested that the blazes might have been set by political extremists ahead of the vote -- a claim that his left-wing rivals claimed was made to destabilize the nation. Karamanlis was re-elected for a second term -- but only by a slim majority. How have the reform plans fared? Not well. Union leaders -- who represent around half the Greek workforce to a union -- have argued that planned pensions reforms, which would end most forms of early retirement, fail to protect workers. ""It is unjust and unfair to all categories of workers, mainly working mothers and young people entering the labor force,"" Yiannis Panagopoulos, head of GSEE, one of the two main labor unions, said in March. The government has argued that such reforms are especially necessary, given how the nation's low birthrate will likely impose a burden on future generations. There have been several strikes during the past year that at various times have hit all transport networks, including international airports, schools, courts, banks, public offices, hospitals, utilities and media organizations. At times garbage has been left uncollected and homes and offices have suffered power blackouts. A demonstration in Athens during the latest general strike during October descended into skirmishes as protesters confronted police, who responded with tear gas. The worldwide financial crisis has hit Greece hard as well. The government has been forced to cut ambitious growth targets, despite a projected GDP growth of about 3 percent -- above fellow Eurozone nations. Flagging revenues have also forced the government to impose new taxes on capital gains and the self-employed, and also to bring forward plans for privatization. Is there a history of unrest in Greece? Greece gave the world the word and ideal ""democracy"" and has itself enjoyed a period of political stability since the mid 1970s. A member of NATO and the European Union, it became a parliamentary democracy in 1952 following civil unrest after the end of World War II. But a coup in 1967 saw the army take control, ban elections and institute a repressive right-wing junta that eventually abolished the monarchy in 1973. Civil unrest saw the overthrow of the regime and the introduction of a republic in 1975. Since then Greece has gradually sought to redefine and modernize its image, especially during the past decade, staging the Olympics in 2004 and attempting to forge stronger ties with Turkey, its traditional rival. But Greece has not been without civil strike beyond street demonstrations. For more than two decades the November 17 terror group carried out at least 25 murders against Greeks and other nationals, including the assassinations of U.S. CIA Athens chief Richard Welch in 1975 and British diplomat Brigadier Stephen Saunders in 2000. The remaining members of the group were eventually caught in 2002. What next for Greece?  Even if the street violence subsides, the political pressure on Karamanlis is unlikely to subside -- more so given how he has staked his name on economic reform. His administration survived a turbulent 2007 -- and 2008 has given Greece more of the same.","Greece has endured unrest with youths battling police on the streets .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea maintained its unbeaten start to the English Premier League season but were made to sweat against a dogged Sunderland side Saturday. Jose Mourinho's men have been far and away the best team in England over recent months but were frustrated by their opponents who thoroughly deserved their point from this hard-fought 0-0 draw. The blank represents the first time Chelsea have failed to score this season -- but it wasn't for the want of trying. Brazilian midfielder Willian struck a post midway through a first-half that saw Chelsea repeatedly press forward and Sunderland frantically try to keep them at bay. Gus Poyet's men were well drilled and composed, a far cry from the side that conceded eight to Southampton just a few weeks ago. But it wasn't all hustle and bustle from the Black Cats who also chances of their own. Santiago Vergini came closest when he grazed the crossbar after swiveling to connect with a Lee Cattermole cross. Sunderland rope-a-dope . A Gary Cahill header and a stinging drive from Nemanja Matic was the extent of opportunities until midway through the second half. Sunderland were quick to hit back with a thumping drive of their own through Conor Wickham that Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois did well to block. It appeared Sunderland had been applying the rope-a-dope strategy until this point, becoming stronger as the game wore on. And as the closing stages approached it looked more likely that they would be the ones to break the deadlock. Adam Johnson screwed wide when it looked easier to score after a shot from Jose Altidore fell at his feet 13-yards out. The former Manchester City midfielder then fired inches wide from the edge of the box after bursting beyond the Chelsea midfield. That would be as close as either side would come to winning it. The tie means Chelsea are now seven points clear at the top of the EPL table, although that lead could be cut to four points if Southampton triumph at home to Manchester City Sunday. EPL Roundup . In the day's early kick-off, a solitary goal from Danny Wellbeck was enough to give Arsenal victory away to West Brom and ease the pressure on manager Arsene Wenger who has come in for criticism from sections of the Arsenal support in recent weeks. There have been no such job security worries for Louis Van Gaal despite a similarly sticky start to the EPL season. The Dutchman's Manchester United side have dug deep to pull together an impressive string of results in recent weeks. And their fine form continued Saturday with a comfortable 3-0 victory at home to Hull City thanks to goals from Chris Smalling, Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie. Elsewhere, Liverpool secured a late victory at home to Stoke City after Glen Johnson turned in a Rickie Lambert header that had rebounded off the visitors crossbar. Aaron Cresswell's goal was enough to give West Ham victory over in-form Newcastle United while Queens Park Rangers beat Leicester City 3-2. Swansea City were held at home 1-1 by Crystal Palace while EPL new boys Burnley drew 1-1 with Aston Villa.","Chelsea held away to Sunderland in English Premier League .

"Washington (CNN) -- The former head of U.S. counterterror operations said Tuesday the ""imminent threat"" posed by an al Qaeda offshoot in Syria hasn't lessened after a U.S. air campaign there. Speaking to CNN's Jim Sciutto, Matt Olsen said by his analysis the threat from the Khorasan group ""is still in the same place as it was before"" President Barack Obama ordered airstrikes against the terror operation last month. ""This group was in a position to train without any sort of interference, they were able to recruit operatives,"" said Olsen, who stepped down as director of the National Counterterrorism Center in September. ""We saw that they were looking to test explosives. So they were in the advanced stages of plotting. They had both intent and that capability that put them nearing an execution phase of an attack."" President Obama announced strikes against Khorasan in September at the same time he began the mission to ""degrade and destroy"" the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq. At the time, senior officials described the threat posed by Khorasan as ""imminent."" In the days after the strikes, the Pentagon said they believed the mission had ""degraded, damaged, destroyed some of their capabilities,"" but didn't specify whether the threat was taken out altogether. No subsequent strikes against Khorasan have been announced by the U.S. military. Olsen said on Tuesday the types of individual who have joined Khorasan -- ""hardened, seasoned veterans"" -- made it unlikely the threat had diminished. ""I think it's unlikely that threat's altogether been eliminated,"" Olsen said, adding that some senior leaders with the group had been killed. What's the difference between ISIS, al-Nusra and the Khorasan Group? Before the strikes began in Syria, U.S. government officials had barely acknowledged the presence of Khorasan, which formed from former al Qaeda members. Sources have said the group has the same aim as ISIS: recruiting and training foreign fighters who could return home to stage attacks. While Olsen said foreign fighters present a broad risk to Americans' security, the potential for so-called ""lone wolf"" attacks by unaffiliated terrorists also worries officials. The propaganda circulated by ISIS online could allow Americans to be motivated by the group without ever leaving the country, he said. ""The other issue is somebody in the United States, who never leaves the United States, simply sits in their basement reading some of this hateful propaganda that ISIS puts out,"" he said. ""The concern is that somebody just reads that and they have something in their own mind that makes them think that's what they want to do. They would seek to carry out what we would think would be a relatively small scale attack, but a lethal attack nonetheless.""

"(CNN) -- Science has brought us incredible gifts: life-saving vaccines and clean water, air travel and instant communication. Modern life is built upon the knowledge that the scientific community has gathered and that society -- markets, governments, workers -- put to use. We have our ancestors to thank. But will our descendants thank us? Have we put to good use the knowledge we are gaining today to help those who will come after us? That question is now before one of the highest courts of the United States. As a scientist who has spent the past half-century documenting how mankind is fundamentally altering our climate, I fear that unless the courts understand the threat and require the government to produce a plan of action, the answer of history could be damning. In a new study, I and my co-authors make indisputably clear what the world's scientists have increasingly warned: Our climate is changing, and the impacts are growing. The changes harm humans and threaten other life on the planet. Our study, published in the prestigious peer-reviewed science journal PLOS-ONE, was written in support of a lawsuit against the federal government. The plaintiffs are young people, those to whom we are handing an increasingly warmer and destabilized planet. They argue that they have a constitutional right to a safe climate, that they have a right to receive from us a planet that supports all life, just as our forebears gave us. It is correctly a legal argument, but it relates to a fundamental moral question. We know without a doubt that gases we are adding to the air have caused a planetary energy imbalance and global warming, already 0.8 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. This warming is driving an increase in extreme weather, from heat waves and droughts to wildfires and stronger storms (though mistakenly expecting science to instantly document links to specific events misses the forest for the trees). More than simply listing calamitous threats, we wanted to jump-start the discussion of how the world can take significant action. Now. First, the good news. We still have time to choose. Will we seek out and exploit ever deeper and dirtier fossil fuels or phase in cleaner carbon-free energy? If we start aggressively reducing carbon emissions, we can stabilize our climate and avoid cataclysmic change. Our fate truly is in our hands. Our analysis shows that we must rapidly reduce carbon emissions and improve land management policies to restore billions of tons of carbon to soils and forests. We recognize that won't be easy. Carbon emissions will decline only if the price of fossil fuels begins to include their costs to society: their effects on human health and climate. Economic analysis shows that a rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies would swiftly drive market innovations and investments in clean energy. (Indeed, many companies are preparing for such a fee.) Watch out for climate surprises, scientists warn . Courts cannot tell the government how to reduce emissions. But they can require that the government provide a plan: How will emissions be reduced to assure that the rights of young people are protected? There is also painfully challenging news. The widely accepted goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius would lead to continually receding shorelines and growing climate extremes. We must, instead, keep maximum warming close to 1 degree Celsius. Thus, most of the allowed carbon emissions budget has been used up. We must phase out coal emissions. And it would be foolhardy to develop unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands. In short, our analysis finds that we must act more quickly and more aggressively than politicians and international negotiators have even considered. My co-authors are experts on biology, ecology, law, economics, public health, climate modeling, oceanography and paleoclimatology. We need broad expertise because climate change is not just a science problem. It is the great challenge of our times. Climate change warriors: It's time to go nuclear . Climate change is altering people's lives, right now, from the United States to Africa to the Arctic. It is as clear and present a danger as we've ever seen. And the threat will only get worse if left unchecked. If we allow the planet's energy imbalance to increase and the ocean to continue to warm, we will pass a point of no return. Our children and grandchildren would inherit disintegrating ice sheets, rising seas that inundate all coastal cities, increasingly violent climate extremes and extermination of countless species. We would leave future generations a far more desolate planet than the one that we were blessed to inherit. Science and the knowledge it brings is a gift only if we use it. Failing to act on our knowledge to protect future generations would be the gravest injustice of all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Hansen.","James Hansen: We know what to do to prevent climate catastrophe .
Ending emissions from coal and stopping development of tar sands are key, he says .

"(CNN) -- The attorney for Jameis Winston says that despite serious legal concerns, his client will cooperate in Florida State University's Title IX investigation concerning an allegation that the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback sexually assaulted a woman in 2012. In a letter that was dated Tuesday and obtained by CNN on Wednesday, attorney David Cornwell, who also serves as an adviser to the Winston family, says that Winston will participate in a requested interview with the university. ""Mr. Winston will cooperate with the Investigation,"" Cornwell writes in the conclusion of his letter to FSU General Counsel Carolyn Egan. ""He looks forward to clearing his name. But, Mr. Winston will not walk into a honey trap."" Cornwell alleges in the letter that an attorney for the woman who accused Winston of rape demanded $7 million to settle claims against Winston, Florida State and Tallahassee police before the case became public. Cornwell writes that Patricia Carroll, attorney for the alleged victim, met with him and ""demanded $7,000,000 to settle (the alleged victim's) claim. ""Ms. Carroll stated, 'If we settle, you will never hear from my client or me again -- in the press or anywhere,'"" Cornwell writes in his letter to FSU's Egan. John Clune, another attorney who represents the accuser, said in an email to CNN that Cornwell had approached Carroll first about paying off the accuser. ""Settlement discussions were immediately unproductive as Cornwell was crude and insulting going so far as to say 'your client likes to f!#% football players,'"" Clune said in the email to CNN. Cornwell declined to comment on Clune's statement. Carroll declined to comment, deferring to Clune's statement. Title IX is a federal law that requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault. This investigation is mandatory under the law even if criminal charges were not filed, which they were not in the 2012 case after police said the alleged victim did not want to proceed. Winston could be charged by his university for a code-of-conduct violation for sexual misconduct, depending upon the results of the school's investigation. On September 5, Clune told CNN that Florida State had opened the Title IX investigation into the 2012 sexual assault case involving Winston. Clune said his client -- the alleged victim -- was interviewed by FSU officials in August, calling it a ""very thorough interview"" and he said that his client, then a Florida State student, ""felt like she was heard by the university."" Florida State -- one of several universities under federal review for their handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints -- previously has not commented on the investigation, citing state and federal student privacy laws. According to police documents, the accuser said Winston raped her in December 2012 after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in Tallahassee. She said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar. The accuser also said she did not remember much of what happened next but that she remembered being in a ground-floor apartment, where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections. The accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night. A month later, in January 2013, she accused Winston of the alleged rape. Tallahassee interim Police Chief Tom Coe said last year that the woman ""broke off contact"" with investigators in February 2013 and didn't want to go forward with the case. The woman's family said a detective warned her attorney that Tallahassee is a ""big football town"" and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case. Tim Jansen, another attorney for Winston, has said his client had consensual sex with the woman. After he won the Heisman Trophy, Winston and the Seminoles went on to win the BCS National Championship against Auburn in January. Winston spent this spring playing for the Florida State baseball team. Winston made headlines again in April when he was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a Publix supermarket in Tallahassee. Police said that Winston said he forgot to pay. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. This past week, Florida State suspended Winston for its game against Clemson, which the Seminoles -- still ranked No. 1 in national polls -- escaped with a 23-17 win in overtime. The suspension came after witnesses said that Winston made a sexually explicit remark near the school's student union. Florida State initially announced Winston would be suspended for the first half of the game. However, Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the punishment late Friday after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols.","Title IX is a federal law that requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault .

"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (CNN) -- Saying she felt compelled to support ""the man I believe has a new vision for America,"" Oprah Winfrey spoke passionately about Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama at two rallies in Iowa Saturday. Oprah Winfrey joins Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, Saturday. ""I've never taken this kind of risk before nor felt compelled to stand up and speak out before because there wasn't anyone to to stand up and speak up for,"" Winfrey told thousands of people in Cedar Rapids Saturday evening. ""We need a president who can bring us all together,"" she said. ""I know [Barack Obama] is the one."" Earlier in Des Moines, she focused on world affairs.  Watch Winfrey endorse Obama » . ""These are dangerous times, you can feel it. We need a leader who shows us how to hope again in America as a force for peace,"" Winfrey told the enthusiastic crowd. ""I believe Barack Obama will bring statesmanship to the White House,"" she said. ""He's a man who knows who we are and knows who we can be."" Winfrey said she has voted for as many Republicans as she has Democrats over the years, so her endorsement wasn't about partisanship. ""This is very, very personal. I'm here because of my personal conviction about Barack Obama and what I know he can do for America,"" she said to applause. Winfrey also told the crowd that she's looking for more than a candidate with ""experience in the hallways of government."" ""I challenge you to see through those people who try to convince you that experience with politics as usual is more valuable than wisdom won from years of serving people outside the walls of Washington, D.C.,"" she said. Obama thanked Winfrey for drawing a big crowd and coming out to the event. ""There are some people here who are here to see Oprah. I'm sort of a by-product of that and I appreciate that, but what I know is that for her to take the risk of stepping out of her comfort zone is extraordinary,"" the senator from Illinois said. Before Winfrey's speech in Des Moines, her best friend and fellow talk show host Gayle King, tried to quietly slip into the rally. She walked up to the set of bleachers behind the stage and asked some women if she could scoot in. Within seconds cameras were clicking and fans were yelling. King spent the speech in the first row of bleachers chatting up supporters, listening and and mingling with fans. Winfrey's campaign appearance comes less than one month before the Iowa caucuses. After Iowa, the three-state ""Oprah-bama"" tour moves on to South Carolina and New Hampshire on Sunday. The nod by the empress of daytime television comes at a time when independent politicos and campaign aides believe the Democratic senator from Illinois is picking up steam. The latest Des Moines Register poll puts Obama ahead of Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-New York, in Iowa and shows him gaining ground among women. Women are proving to be a crucial voting block in 2008 for all the Democratic hopefuls, but most especially Clinton. At a recent Obama rally in Iowa City, many women expressed the difficulty they had in deciding whether to vote for him or for Clinton because she could be a first for their gender.

""I think it's going to help him with the women my age because she's very popular, very respected among my age group,"" said Linda Peterson, a middle aged mother and probable Obama voter from North Liberty, Iowa. According to The New York Times, women make up 75 percent of the audience for the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" and more than half are over 50. More than 40 percent make less than $40,000 and a quarter have no more than a high school education. ""One of the secretaries was just so excited about the fact that Oprah was coming,"" said Jodi Plumert, a University of Iowa professor and ardent Obama supporter.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's midterm schedule -- which until now has been marked just by a handful of closed fundraisers and events -- is about to fill up with commitments to Democrats across the country. Democratic sources familiar with the Clinton campaign plan say the former Secretary of State will help raise money and excitement for a number of vulnerable Democrats in the month before voters go to the polls in November. The states Clinton will campaign are also markedly important states in presidential races -- namely Iowa, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania -- a fact that further raises the specter of Clinton running for president in 2016. Clinton will headline her first public campaign rally next Thursday, when she travels to Philadelphia to stump for Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania Democratic gubernatorial nominee. The event is focused specifically on women supporting Wolf, a voting bloc that Democratic operatives hope Clinton can help turnout in November. ""Secretary Clinton is the right person at the right time for Democrats who are focused on turning out the vote and persuading undecided voters, particularly women, in the remaining days of the election,"" said Guy Cecil, the director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Clinton will also headline events and fundraisers for Democratic senate candidates in Kentucky, Iowa, New Hampshire, Georgia, North Carolina and Colorado, according to a Democratic source. For months Clinton aides have said the former secretary of state will be active in the midterms and these newest additions, which were first reported by Politico, appear to be proof of that. ""Hillary knows firsthand the importance of keeping our majority in the Senate and I couldn't be happier that she is helping us turn out the Democratic vote,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. Clinton is not helping all vulnerable Democrats in 2014, however. Missing from her list of events are tough Democratic races in Louisiana and Alaska. Former President Bill Clinton is headed to Arkansas this weekend to campaign for Sen. Mark Pryor and other state Democrats. Hillary Clinton, according to Erik Dorey, Pryor's campaign spokesman, will not attend those events but will host a fundraiser for the senator in New York next week.

Jeanne Shaheen, Clinton will also headline an event for Gov. Maggie Hassan and the all female ticket in the critical presidential primary state. Clinton's trip to New Hampshire will be Nov. 2, a Democratic source in the state tells CNN. A Grimes campaign official said Clinton will be in Kentucky for a series of events in mid-October. Clinton is also set to campaign for Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn next week and will headline an event for Martha Coakley, Massachusetts' gubernatorial hopeful, before election day.

"(CNN) -- Amid rising tensions and fresh violence, Ukrainian authorities on Friday accused Russia of sending dozens of its military vehicles into its territory -- though the Kremlin have knocked down such reports as unfounded and ""provocative."" At a briefing Friday, Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that 32 tanks, 16 D-30 howitzers and 30 KamAZ heavy trucks crossed past a border checkpoint and headed toward the volatile Luhansk region on Thursday. Another Ukrainian official, Dmytro Tymchuk, alleged the ""armored column"" consisted of ""a battalion tactical group of the Russian Armed Forces,"" also according to Ukrinform state news agency. A NATO military officer said Friday that the alliance -- which doesn't include Ukraine but does include several of its neighbors -- is looking into these reports and knows of an increase in Russian troops and equipment on its eastern border. ""If this crossing into Ukraine is confirmed, it would be further evidence of Russia's aggression and direct involvement in destabilizing Ukraine,"" the officer said. Earlier this week, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said that he was ""deeply concerned by reports of Russian troops moving closer to the border of Ukraine,"" calling such movement ""provocative"" and ""further proof that the Kremlin only seeks to hamper the peace process in Ukraine."" On Friday, a Russian defense ministry official quoted by the country's state-run TASS news agency criticized what he called ""all such provocative reports aimed at further fueling of tension(s)."" The official claimed that a single source had made up the Russian troop movement sightings, reports that have also showed up as ""rumors in social networks."" Wherever the truth lies, southeastern Ukraine itself remains very unsettled -- with separatists claiming control over some of the region, despite the efforts of Ukraine's central government in Kiev. Those leaders in Kiev have accused Moscow of fomenting the rebellion, in part by aiding the separatists' militarily and even sending its own troops into Ukraine to take part in the fight. Kremlin officials have consistently denied such claims and accused Kiev authorities of stirring up further unrest. The violence in the region has ebbed and flowed over the past few months, though it's never gone away. In fact, Lysenko told reporters Friday that five Ukrainian soldiers had been killed and 16 more wounded in Donbas over a recent 24-hour stretch. And Tymchuk said that rebels have been shelling security forces beyond that as well, including 15 recent attacks around Debaltseve, 12 around Donetsk, 10 around Pervomaisky and seven around Luhansk.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There's not much to cheer inside the once venerable Secret Service lately, but veterans are thrilled that at this moment of crisis that ""Father Joe"" agreed to take the helm. Before Wednesday, people outside of the Secret Service weren't familiar with Joe Clancy when President Obama appointed him to be the interim head of the agency. But, within the Secret Service, he is still well known and highly regarded. Fellow agents call Joe Clancy ""Father Joe"" because he looks the part of a priest but also because of how he goes about his business. Clancy has a good relationship with both Obamas. And in addition to being in charge of protecting the President as the director of the Presidential Protective Division (PPD), he worked closely with the first couple on the protection arrangements for the daughters. The Obamas have been generally happy with that according to several colleagues that served with him at the time. One likely knock on Clancy that has been mentioned since his temporary appointment is that he was in charge of PPD at the time of the infamous Salahi gate crashing incident in 2009. Even though PPD agents have little to do with guest clearance at events, when the crisis exploded, Clancy offered to resign. The director at the time, Mark Sullivan, said no. Not telling Obama of elevator breath was 'final straw' for Pierson . There was some talk of Clancy coming back when Sullivan left and before Julia Pierson was appointed, for either the number one or number two job, but he preferred to stay in the private sector at the time. Clancy left his job as executive director of Comcast Cable Security for this role. What remains unanswered about Clancy is whether he wants the job permanently or whether pressure will be too great for an outsider to be chosen. Secret Service insiders think that it would be a mistake to bring in an outsider. They argue for a new management type as a number two but think you need a ""take the bullet"" person as director. They didn't know if that argument will carry the day in this environment. But now that Pierson is gone, agency veterans are thrilled Clancy agreed to come back. They were worried the outsider thing would be immediate. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson resigns .","Some members of the Secret Service call the new interim director ""Father Joe.""

"(CNN) -- Most Internet users and tech experts think cash and credit cards will become things of the past in the next decade as people turn to their mobile phones to make payments, results from a newly released survey suggest. Nearly two out of three respondents to the survey (65%) told the Pew Internet & American Life Project that they think most people will have fully adopted the ""mobile wallet"" as their day-to-day means of paying by 2020. Whether it's paying for coffee with a mobile app, using more versatile apps such as Google Wallet or doing business using tools such as Square that turn phones into mobile cash registers, the adoption of mobile payments is clearly under way. In a December report from comScore, 38% of smartphone owners had used their phones to make a purchase of some kind. That finding jibes with an earlier Pew study in which one-third of smartphone owners had used their phone to do some sort of banking (such as checking their balances or paying bills) and that nearly half (46%) had paid for an app with their phone. In the survey released Tuesday, 65% of respondents agreed with the following statement: . ""By 2020, most people will have embraced and fully adopted the use of smart-device swiping for purchases they make, nearly eliminating the need for cash or credit cards. People will come to trust and rely on personal hardware and software for handling monetary transactions over the Internet and in stores. Cash and credit cards will have mostly disappeared from many of the transactions that occur in advanced countries."" Survey respondent and Harvard University professor Susan Crawford wrote, ""There is nothing more imaginary than a monetary system. The idea that we solemnly hand around printed slips of paper in exchange for food and water shows just how trusting and fond of patterned behavior we human beings are."" Crawford, an ex-special assistant for technology policy for President Barack Obama, asked, ""So why not take the next step? Of course, we'll move to even more abstract representations of value."" One-third agreed with an essentially opposite statement, saying there won't be a major conversion to ""all-digital, all-the-time"" payments. Many cited security concerns as the reason. ""The use of a simple string of digits that must be shared with any vendor with whom you transact is really a ludicrously insecure system that can and must change,"" said Peter J. McCann, a FutureWei Technologies senior engineer. Proponents of mobile payments said technology is evolving but that such payments are no less secure than what most people do now. ""It's basically the same technology as credit cards,"" Mung-Ki Woo, the head of mobile for MasterCard Worldwide, told CNN last year. ""It's not better or worse."" Pew's report said those who think mobile payments will dominate in the coming years frequently said the boom in smartphone ownership, convenience and security are key factors that make ""these systems an obvious choice to replace established modes of payment in day-to-day commerce."" The survey, conducted with Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center, was not random but instead asked for the opinions of 1,021 ""Internet experts and other Internet users."" Since it sought the opinions of a specific audience, there is no margin of error.","Web experts, users say mobile payments will replace cards, cash .

"(CNN) -- The current Ebola outbreak is ""running much faster"" than the international response to it, the co-discoverer of the virus said Thursday. ""This is the first Ebola epidemic where entire nations are involved, where big cities are affected,"" Peter Piot, a microbiologist and a former undersecretary general of the United Nations, told Global Public Square host Fareed Zakaria. ""And I continue to be worried that the response to the epidemic is really running behind the virus."" According to the World Health Organization's latest update, there have been almost 9,000 confirmed and suspected cases, with almost 4,500 deaths. However, the WHO warned there could be as many as 10,000 new cases per week in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone by the end of this year. Piot, a member of the team that discovered the virus in 1976 in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, made headlines earlier this month when he told The Guardian newspaper he feared an ""unimaginable catastrophe"" if the virus became lodged in a mega-city such as Lagos. ""The three countries that are affected are being totally destabilized, not only in terms of people who are killed by Ebola -- their families, the orphans that now are coming up because the parents died -- but the economy has come to a standstill,"" Piot said Thursday, speaking from Oxford. ""People are massively dying from other diseases that are normally treatable, like malaria, or women die while giving birth because hospitals are abandoned or are full with Ebola patients. So that's a very, very destabilizing factor,"" he said, adding that the impact of its spread is ""beyond Ebola."" Watch the full interview on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" this Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN . Piot said that it is impossible to predict the number of cases. Asked about the WHO projections, he said: ""10,000 per week, or 1,000, we don't really know."" ""At the moment, there are about 1,000,"" he said. ""It's still expanding, that's for sure. And it probably will continue to grow until all the measures have been put in place in a more efficient way."" Piot's comments came on the same day as Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer for Texas Health Services, apologized over mistakes he says were made in the care of Thomas Duncan, a Liberian national who became the first person in the United States to die from the virus. Duncan was sent home despite saying he had a fever and that he had visited West Africa. ""Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes,"" Varga testified to Congress. ""We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry."" Writing for CNN earlier this month, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Tom Frieden said one way for the United States to prevent the disease spreading in the United States is to tackle it at the source, in West Africa. ""After all is said and done here, that is the only way to truly and completely protect the health security of America -- and the world,"" Frieden wrote. This view was echoed by Piot, who added that there were some encouraging signs from two of the countries in the region that have been worst affected. ""As long as there is a major epidemic in West Africa, the rest of the world is also at risk. That is an additional reason for providing assistance to stop the epidemic. And because there will be people who will show up -- be it in Europe, in the U.S. or in China,"" he said. Watch the full interview on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" this Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN . ""The good news is that both Nigeria and Senegal have been able to contain a number of important cases,"" Piot said. ""In Senegal, there was never even any secondary case. In Nigeria, there were a number of people who were infected and died, but it has not given rise to an outbreak in Lagos, after all, a city of more than 20 million people."" ""That shows that if you act decisively and early enough ... it can be controlled."" Asked by Zakaria what steps he would like to see taken to try to halt the spread of the virus, Piot suggested that it is particularly important to focus on protecting health workers. ""Something that we've learned through Doctors Without Borders is how to treat patients, to care for them and isolate them so that they don't infect others. But also to reduce, more or less, mortality,"" he said. ""We need to protect health care workers. We've seen it in the U.S. We've seen it in Europe. But above all, in Africa, where over 200 nurses and doctors and lab workers have died from Ebola. And that can be done by protective care."" But he added that the biggest challenge in slowing the spread of Ebola is changing the kinds of behaviors that allow it to spread. ""Stopping the transmission in the community around funerals -- that is still going on. And so we have to change people's behaviors and beliefs and also what to do with all the patients who are still at home, who can infect people while they're being transported to hospital units."" ""So that's going to be a massive undertaking of behavior change. And it will have to come from within, where their beliefs are influenced and where safe behaviors have to be introduced. And that can come from traditional chiefs, from the opinion leaders in each community."" Asked whether he believed the United States was overreacting to the potential spread of Ebola, Piot said he hoped the extensive media coverage of the virus would ensure that people are more aware of how to protect themselves. But he said he also believed it was possible to get the current outbreak under control. ""I'm not worried about an epidemic in the larger population,"" he said. ""There will be cases. I think we should not be naive about that. But I think it can be contained.""","WHO warns 10,000 Ebola cases per week possible in West Africa by end of year .

"(CNN) -- How does a 14-year-old high school student, shot in the face and told he can never play football again, feel about his attacker? Forgiving. In a tweet he sent from his hospital, Nate Hatch says he forgives his cousin -- the shooter who opened fire at Marysville-Pilchuck High School in Washington on Friday. Two students, Zoe Galasso and Gia Soriano, were killed. Two others, in addition to Nate, are still hospitalized. The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, took his own life. ""I love you and I forgive you jaylen rest in peace,"" Nate tweeted. Witnesses say Jaylen, a popular freshman, opened fire in the crowded cafeteria after inviting the five victims to the same lunch table. ""It's our understanding he (invited them) via texting,"" Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said Monday. Shortly before the shootings, Fryberg sent a selfie to his ex-girlfriend showing himself holding a gun, a law enforcement official told CNN. It is unclear if it was the same .40 caliber pistol used in the attack. Rampage ended when 'hero' teacher confronted gunman . Critical condition . Of the three students who remain hospitalized, Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15, are in critical condition. Nate is in satisfactory condition.

Nate was walking with the aid of nurse when the grandfather went to see him Monday morning. But doctors told Nate he can never play football again due to his facial injuries, Hatch said. ""He just wants to let people know that he's OK. He's getting better,"" Hatch said. Nate himself tweeted, ""Worst pain ive ever felt in my life."" Hatch said Jaylen's family is struggling and like everyone else wants to know why this happened.

"(CNN) -- Hunger isn't glamorous, but Michael Kors and Halle Berry are using the power of fashion and Hollywood to help the U.N. World Food Programme provide meals for children around the world. Thursday is World Food Day, but the celebrities are rallying support all month long to raise funds for WFP's School Meals program with the #WatchHungerStop campaign. The issue of hunger has been an important one for designer Michael Kors for decades. He started his charity work in New York in the late 1980s with God's Love We Deliver, a nonprofit organization that provides nutritious meals to seriously ill people. And as the Kors fashion empire grew so did the designer's mission. ""I think the amazing thing about the hunger initiative with the World Food Programme is that everyone has the possibility to pitch in,"" Kors says. ""You don't have to be wealthy. You don't have to be a certain age. You don't have to live in a certain geographical area. Everyone can really contribute."" Kors started the #WatchHungerStop campaign with the World Food Programme in early 2013 and brought on Berry a few months later. ""She's a great mother, a terrific human being and a great actress. She is very glamorous also,"" Kors says. ""She does the whole thing and makes it look effortless. We want to spread the word that anyone can make a difference."" As of July, #WatchHungerStop has provided 5 million meals to children, and Kors says the campaign wants to continue to ""make some more noise"" about hunger. Movie star visits Nicaragua . Over the summer, Berry visited a WFP site in Nicaragua, the second-poorest nation in the Americas. Children seemed to be the driving force behind Berry's journey to Central America. There, she saw firsthand how the WFP's School Meals program works in an area suffering from a failed coffee crop. ""It was incredibly moving,'' Berry says in an e-mail forwarded to the WFP. ""It's hard to describe the mix of emotions you feel -- sadness, certainly, to sit and talk with children who don't get the nutrition they need to grow. But also respect and admiration for their families and communities, who do so much for them."" Berry appears to be inspired by her visit. ""There's a great sense of hope, because this is something that's working. And then there's joy, real joy, because these kids are full of joy,"" says the actress, who has two children. ""Halle was very humble, very quiet and really came to learn. She was visibly touched by seeing the poverty firsthand,"" says the WFP's Bettina Luescher, who traveled with the star to Nicaragua. Making a difference with $5 and a watch . Kors and Berry have helped tremendously with the #WatchHungerStop campaign, according to the World Food Programme. ""They are so creative and have such fantastic ideas. Not only do they fund-raise ... but they have brought massive awareness in the fight against world hunger,"" Luescher says. That creativity starts in a Michael Kors store with the 100 Series watch. For every watch sold, 100 meals are donated to the World Food Programme. In addition to the watch, $5 is a common theme for the campaign. According to the World Food Programme, $5 feeds a child for a month. People can donate $5 at a Michael Kors store register or text MKHUNGER to 50555 to donate $5. Wear it and share it . On Thursday, you can visit a Michael Kors store and get a free Watch Hunger Stop T-shirt. Take a selfie in the T-shirt and post it using the hashtag #WatchHungerStop between Thursday and October 31, and 100 meals will be donated to the World Food Programme. The money raised by Kors and Berry goes toward providing school meals. When families in developing nations fall on hard times, children, especially girls, drop out of school to work and help out. School meals help encourage poor families to send children to school and keep them there. In 2013, WFP said it provided school meals to 19.8 million children in 63 countries. Most of the money raised by the WFP goes for emergency work in places such as Syria, Iraq as well as in more than 70 other countries. The WFP also helps provide food to people in West African countries hard hit by the Ebola crisis. ""We want to see zero hunger in the world ... so we still have a ways to go,"" says Michael Kors. ""I think you can be optimistic; you can have fun; you can be compassionate, and you can be chic all at the same time.""

"(CNN) -- Cambodia will accept refugees seeking asylum in Australia in return for A$40 million ($35 million) in aid, under a controversial, open-ended deal that has been criticized as ""a new low"" in Australia's treatment of asylum seekers. Australia's Immigration Minister Scott Morrison was in Phnom Penh Friday to sign the agreement, as protesters there demonstrated outside the Australian Embassy. ""Cambodia is poor... can't help the refugees from Australia,"" read one placard. Before his departure, Morrison told Australian public broadcaster ABC that the deal would initially apply to refugees being held on Australia's offshore detention center on Nauru, more than 200 of whom had been granted refugee status. Instead of finding refuge in their target destination, asylum seekers who agreed to the terms would instead be settled in Cambodia, one of southeast Asia's poorest nations. It would be ""an ongoing arrangement"" with no caps on total numbers involved, said Morrison. ""This is a voluntary arrangement. No-one is forcing anyone to go anywhere,"" he said during the interview. ""It enables us to fulfill on the policy which says no one will be resettled in Australia."" Australia's government was elected a year ago partly on a pledge to halt the flow of asylum seekers arriving by boat. Morrison said Australia would provide A$40 million ($35 million) in development aid projects over four years as part of the deal, in addition to the $79 million ($69 million) already allocated to Cambodia. Australia would also provide expertise on developing Cambodia's capacity to settle refugees, he said. 'Shameful' deal . The plan to outsource refugees to an impoverished country -- which, as a consequence of its recent history of civil war, genocide and occupation, is better known for generating its own waves of refugees into the world -- has drawn widespread criticism. Australian senator Sarah Hanson-Young, immigration spokesperson for the Greens, lambasted the government for signing ""an open-ended deal with one of the most corrupt nations on Earth."" ""It's shameful that the Abbott government is forcing refugees to choose between cruelty on Nauru and cruelty in Cambodia,"" she told CNN. ""There is nothing optional about this deal. It's like the bully in the schoolyard asking if you want a punch in the face or a kick in the guts."" The Australian government itself has recently criticized Cambodia's human rights record, saying at the United Nations earlier this year that it needed to stop its military from killing street protesters, quashing political opposition and detaining people without trial. Cambodia rates 160th out of 177 countries on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index. Of particular concern, said Hanson-Young, was the potential fate of unaccompanied girls among the refugees. ""Human rights organizations have said the incidence of rape and sexual exploitation is on the rise in Cambodia, especially for girls and young women,"" she said. ""The moment these girls step off the plane, they will be put at risk."" 'Shirking responsibilities' Refugee advocate David Manne, executive director of Australia's Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, said the agreement risked ""violating rights and endangering lives."" ""The deal involves Australia once again shirking rather than shouldering its responsibilities to refugees in our region and globally,"" he said, describing Cambodia as ""a completely unsuitable place to resettle refugees."" ""It's a country that can barely meet the needs of its own population, let alone the basic needs of refugees. The reality is that refugees will be forced to live a life of danger and despair on the margins."" In a statement, Amnesty International described the agreement as ""a new low in Australia's deplorable and inhumane treatment of asylum seekers."" ""This agreement is putting the short-term political interests of the Australian government ahead of the protection of some of the world's most vulnerable people,"" said Rupert Abbott, the organization's deputy Asia-Pacific director. ""It makes Cambodia complicit in Australia's human rights breaches and seriously flawed offshore processing system."" That processing system, established by the previous government, sees new arrivals processed in overcrowded immigration detention centers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, in a policy that has been criticized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). More than 1,200 asylum seekers are currently detained in Nauru, with 250 status determinations carried out to date. More than 200 were found to be genuine refugees. UNHCR said in a statement it was ""deeply concerned"" at the precedent set by the deal. ""This is a worrying departure from international norms. We are seeing record forced displacement globally, with 87 per cent of refugees now being hosted in developing countries,"" said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres. ""It's crucial that countries do not shift their refugee responsibilities elsewhere.""","Australia has struck a deal with Cambodia to settle refugees in the southeast Asian nation .
In return, Australia will contribute millions of dollars in additional aid .

"(CNN) -- Apparently it was a coincidence, but the deadly shooting in Ottawa came on the same day that the 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai was scheduled to speak with high school students and receive honorary Canadian citizenship. Instead of listening to Malala, instead of seeing Prime Minister Stephen Harper honor the idealistic teenager who defied radicals to advocate peace, reconciliation, and education, Canadians watched in horror as their normally placid capital became the scene of mayhem in what Harper later described as a terrorist attack. It was the second attack this week, the second in which a Canadian soldier was killed. In both cases the alleged perpetrators were men whose passports authorities had confiscated fearing they had become radicalized and would travel to the Middle East to join Islamist extremists. The Ottawa attack kept Malala from delivering her message in person. And yet, there is something profoundly powerful in this intersection -- in this scheduling conflict of competing ideologies. The killings in Canada and the canceled events delineate a sharp contrast between the alternative worldviews faced by young people today -- particularly by young Muslims. They also highlight the need to develop a clear path of active involvement for those who want to join in making a reality of Malala's vision, just as those who support extremists receive clear direction on how to join their cause. On one side there is the future outlined with such remarkable clarity by Malala, one in which we provide educational opportunities for all, strive for peace, and respect our differences. She has the heavy burden of having become the torch-bearer for advocates of moderation, coexistence and equality. Then there is the other end of the spectrum, inhabited by the hyper-extremist group known as ISIS, which also manages to communicate its vision for the future, broadcasting its ideology, its military exploits and its excesses across social media platforms. Malala had arrived in Toronto this week, as scheduled but, sadly, she left town without speaking, after her events were canceled as a result of the crisis in Ottawa. She tweeted, ""I extend my thoughts and prayers to the Canadian people during this difficult time."" It was not the first time that her plans were abruptly changed by a shooter. Her life took a most unexpected turn in 2012 after an extremist tried to kill her. Now, with the rise of ISIS and a jihadist appeal that has brought young Muslims from around the world to fight in Syria and Iraq, Malala's symbolic place in the battle of ideas extends beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan. Now it is vital that her message be heard everywhere. But she cannot do it alone. There is a great need to build on her ideas with practical action. Those who accept the ISIS creed know what to do. They travel to the Middle East to join their jihad, or they follow ISIS's deadly guidance at home. For those who embrace Malala's enlightened view there is no clear path ahead. How does a young person join the cause of freedom and equality? One of the admirable aspects of young adulthood is an awakening to the larger world; a wish to become involved in something larger than ourselves, a drive to make the world a better place. Consider Malala's words at the U.N. last year: ""We call upon all communities to be tolerant -- to reject prejudice based on cast, creed, sect, religion or gender. To ensure freedom and equality for women so that they can flourish. We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave -- to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential."" Compare it to the ISIS appeal, which a few days ago proclaimed the rightness of its revival of slavery and slave markets for selling Yazidi women, or its more recent call to followers, ""If you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchman, or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car, or throw him down from a high place, or choke him, or poison him."" The jihadi appeal is quickly rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, but the tiny percentage who accept it can cause terrible damage. And their help contributes to ISIS victories in the Middle East that are destroying the lives of men and women, including those who might have grown into future Malalas. Malala's canceled events in Canada will likely be rescheduled. When she returns, she will have a message that will resonate even louder after what occurred in Ottawa. Until then, let her supporters come up with a plan so that those who would follow her can help build the world she envisions, with organizations and active movements in which people can enlist to promote equality, coexistence, and acceptance of other points of view.","Frida Ghitis: Malala was due to make appearances on day of Ottawa shooting .

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Hu Rongfen had no choice. On November 14, 1971, in the whirlwind of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, the slender and soft-spoken middle school graduate was dispatched from Shanghai to a far-flung village in East China's Anhui Province to work in the country. This wasn't a punishment for any wrongdoing -- on the contrary, the quiet girl was a top student in class. The migration was an order from the central government to every urban household -- at least one of their teenage children needed to leave the city to work on the farm indefinitely. The ruthless political command lasted from 1966 until the mid-1970s and intended that the privileged urban ""intellectual"" youth learn from farmers and workers. As a result, China's ""lost generation"" emerged -- deprived of the chance of education and the right to live with their families. ""We were told that city dwellers never move their limbs and could not distinguish different crops,"" says Hu, now 58. ""So we were banished to labor and learn skills and grit from peasants."" Hu spent four years (1971-1974) planting rice, spreading cow dung and chopping wood in Jin Xian, a mountainous county. Known in Chinese as ""up to the mountains and down to the farms,"" the urban-to-rural youth migration was part of China's decade-long Cultural Revolution, a social political movement initiated to implement Communism and Maoism in China by eliminating any capitalist, feudalistic and cultural elements. Hu still remembers the luggage she brought: basic life necessities, the ""Little Red Book"" explaining Chairman Mao's theories -- a mandatory read for everybody -- and dozens of notebooks with hand-copied chapters from ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Anna Karenina,"" which she sneaked in secretly -- these books had been banned for their perceived Capitalist connotations. ""I used to read those notebooks in secret under my blanket at midnight."" According to Chinese media, as many as 17 million ""intellectual youths"" in the country packed their bags and moved to some of the remotest parts of China. There, they transformed from care-free students to farmers. ""I still can't bear to recall my youth spent on the farm,"" she says. One of Hu's most vivid memories was working in rice fields in early spring in freezing water, on which lumps of ice still floated. There, she would bend down to seed for more than ten hours. She would slap her legs madly to rid herself of the leeches clinging to her limbs. Blood would ooze from her wounds and mingle with the dirt and water. Another time, she recalled walking 40 kilometers along mud paths against bone-chilling winds to the nearest bus station on Chinese New Year's Eve to catch a ride to the train station to go back to Shanghai to see her parents. Hu was eventually elected by her commune to study mechanics at a college in Hefei -- the capital of Anhui -- in 1974. Most people stayed as long as eight years in their commune and only started returning to cities from 1978 onwards. Many did not get a chance to return to their studies. Hu eventually found a job in Hefei after graduation and lived there until 1986 before moving back to her hometown for good. She worked as an office secretary at a scientific laboratory in Shanghai until her retirement in 2008. But the memories from her youth still make Hu blanch. ""If the Cultural Revolution came back and I were to be dispatched again, I'd rather commit suicide,"" she says, noting that the farming days tortured her physically and mentally. ""I stayed awake night after night at the commune, worrying if I'd ever return to any city. ""After my retirement, I seize every opportunity to travel and exercise my body (to stay healthy),"" she adds. ""I live a happy life now. I want to live every day like (I were still in my) youth because I was never able to enjoy my teens and 20s -- the best time of one's life."" However, she confesses she did gain something -- an iron will to live through the toughest conditions and four lifelong friends. Hu and her four dormmates on the farm have stayed in regular contact for the past four decades. Having experienced similar ordeals in youth, they encourage and support each other to enjoy the present and the future. They write memoirs, travel stories and nostalgic poems to share with each other or post to the web. ""It's a way for us to act out our feelings towards the past,"" she says. ""Together my 'comrade sisters' and I lived through some unimaginably tough times -- learning to live without parents and like peasants,"" says Hu. ""And now we want to live our youth again all together."" As Leo Tolstoy wrote in ""Anna Karenina"": ""All the variety, all the charm, all the beauty of life are made up of light and shade.""","Millions of young people sent from city to country during China's Cultural Revolution .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Wednesday that the African-American teen killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, ""could have avoided that if he'd have behaved like something other than a thug."" Speaking on Newsmax TV, Huckabee said the evidence provided in the case surrounding officer Darren Wilson's shooting of Michael Brown suggests as much. ""It's a tragedy that the young man got shot, but this is a young man that just roughed up a store owner, just robbed a store, and now he's going after a cop's gun,"" he said. ""It's a horrible thing that he was killed, but he could have avoided that if he'd have behaved like something other than a thug."" Huckabee, a potential presidential contender, also slammed President Barack Obama for inviting ""some of these thugs and rioters and mob members ... to sit down and have a conversation"" at the White House, a reference to meetings the President held with young activists and community leaders, among others, this week. ""When people are breaking the law, they don't get an invitation to the White House. They ought to be getting an invitation to the big house,"" he said. And he criticized the Congressional Black Caucus for protesting on the House floor Monday night by making the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture, which has become the rallying symbol of those protesting the events in Ferguson, and Wilson's acquittal by a grand jury. ""It's just incredibly dangerous that you have members of Congress on the floor of Congress holding up their hands in the 'hands up, don't shoot' position as if to say that somehow that is going to get you shot,"" Huckabee said. ""I'm going to tell you something: What gets you shot is when you grab a police officer's gun and you lunge at him and you try to hit him in the face,"" Huckabee added. Brown's shooting exacerbated racial tensions in Ferguson and across the nation, sparking protests that grew violent last week after Wilson was acquitted. Commenting on that unrest, Huckabee argued the ""goings on that have happened in Missouri ... violates everything that [Martin Luther King, Jr.] gave his life for, which was nonviolent protest."" ""This is just an anathema to everything that the civil rights movement was truly all about and what it accomplished,"" he added. Complete coverage on Ferguson .","Former Arkansas Gov.

"Lynchburg, Virginia (CNN) -- Cassandra Morton never became a household name like some of the other women. Not like Morgan Harrington. Or Hannah Graham. Even for the people in the historically black Tinbridge Hill neighborhood of Lynchburg, where sense of community and oral history thrive, memories of Morton are hazy. ""Wasn't she the girl whose body they found up on the mountain?"" people ask. Morton went missing on October 10, 2009. Several weeks later, a hiker discovered the 23-year-old's decomposed body on Candlers Mountain, near Camp Hydaway, a retreat owned by Jerry Falwell's Liberty University. Lynchburg police and the Campbell County Sheriff's Office hunted for Morton's killer in vain. A year after her death, authorities admitted their leads had gone cold. As the years wore on, Morton's family learned to live without knowing who committed this heinous act. Or why she was robbed of life. Their hope of learning the truth diminished with time. Until recently. One night last month, University of Virginia student Hannah Graham disappeared after going out with friends. The arrest of a suspect in that case has prompted authorities to take another look at Morton's death and several other unsolved cases of women who were murdered, raped or went missing. Police have charged Jesse L. Matthew Jr. with abduction with the intent to defile in Graham's disappearance. They said forensic evidence also links Matthew to at least two other cases: the death of Morgan Harrington, whose body was discovered in Albemarle County in 2010, and a 2005 rape of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax City. Matthew was also accused of a 2002 rape at Liberty University in Lynchburg, though charges were not pressed. The Campbell County Sheriff 's Office is investigating any possible connection between Matthew and Morton. Sheriff Steve Hutcherson declined further comment on an ongoing investigation. The result of all this has been that suddenly, almost five years after her death, Morton's face is all over the media again. It has meant torture, all over again, for her mother, Catherine Morton. She again felt the kind of shock that jolted her when police showed up at her doorstep several days after Thanksgiving 2009. They showed her a photograph of the body. She recognized her daughter's moccasins and beige jacket. They told her they had matched Cassandra's dental records to the body that was discovered. Catherine fell to the floor. ""She hasn't been right ever since,"" says her husband and Cassandra's stepfather, Rawleigh Myers. Police seize cab of man linked to 2009 death . Overshadowed by a 'damsel in distress'? Cassandra Morton's cremated remains rest in an urn her mother keeps by her bed. It's a constant reminder of the daughter she lost; a reminder that her killer remains unpunished. Every morning, Catherine Morton prays for her daughter's soul. She takes comfort in knowing that 250 people showed up at her daughter's funeral at the Tree of Life Ministries a few blocks up the road from her rented duplex on Campbell Avenue. She swallows eight or nine pills a day to treat her depression and hypertension. There's not much she can do about the anger that rises within. Why did her daughter's death not make national headlines like Graham or Harrington? Why did no one from the state come to help her in her hour of grief and pain? Morton's death was never big news. And it was always overshadowed by news about Harrington, who went missing six days after Morton vanished. In fact, when Morton's body was discovered, some headlines wondered if it might be that of Harrington, whose parents had been vocal from the first day about their daughter's strange disappearance from a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville. They appeared on television and created a website to seek justice for their daughter. ""There's been so much publicity about Morgan, about Hannah,"" Myers says. He is blind in his left eye and suffers from high blood pressure. He used to work for the school system, then performed odd jobs here and there. But these days, he and Catherine Morton barely survive by collecting disability. ""The Harringtons can afford a reward to find their daughter's killer,"" he says, sitting on a small front porch cluttered with things. ""We're poor and black. Nobody cares."" His stepdaughter, Myers says, didn't fit the profile of missing women who make headlines. Like Elizabeth Smart, Laci Peterson and Natalee Holloway. Or Harrington and Graham. ""It's hard to deny that race has something to do with the fact that attractive young white women get vastly more coverage when they disappear,"" says A. Barton Hinkle, an editorial writer at the Richmond Times-Dispatch, who wrote about the so-called Missing White Woman Syndrome in a recent column. The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson first described the media fascination in a 2005 column in which he described ""Damsels in Distress."" ""A damsel must be white. This requirement is nonnegotiable. It helps if her frame is of dimensions that breathless cable television reporters can credibly describe as 'petite,' and it also helps if she's the kind of woman who wouldn't really mind being called 'petite,' a woman with a good deal of princess in her personality. She must be attractive -- also nonnegotiable. Her economic status should be middle class or higher, but an exception can be made in the case of wartime. ""Put all this together, and you get 24-7 coverage,"" Robinson wrote. ""The disappearance of a man, or of a woman of color, can generate a brief flurry, but never the full damsel treatment."" Similar comments were made in Cleveland, after the bodies of 11 black women were found in a ""house of horrors"" in 2009. ""In all their coverage, sympathetic as it may be, the [Cleveland] Plain Dealer never raises the bigger issue. What made these women such easy targets was being black, being women and being from the highly segregated and desperately poor east side of Cleveland,"" Angie Schmitt, founding editor of Rust Wire, wrote a year after the bodies were discovered. ""Nobody was going to tear up the city looking for a few black women from the east side with sketchy pasts."" Justice for everyone? Morton grew up in and around Lynchburg one of three siblings. Her parents separated, and when Catherine Morton married Myers about 12 years ago, he embraced her as his own. Myers never had much contact with his own daughter from a previous relationship; Cassandra filled that void. He loved to hear her call him ""Daddy."" Myers adjusts the baseball cap hugging his head. ""Relax,"" it says. ""God is in control."" But he is far from relaxed talking about Cassandra. Catherine Morton decided she had had enough of journalists after Graham's case made the news. She had agreed to speak with me but changed her mind. She makes it clear she's upset her daughter's name has been dredged up again. She tells her husband to ""keep it short."" But Meyers wants to talk. He wants to keep Cassandra's memory alive. At a vigil last year organized by ""Help Save The Next Girl,"" a group started by Harrington's parents, Myers spoke publicly about Cassandra. ""She was loved,"" he told the crowd, among them the families of nine Virginia women whose cases remain unresolved. Myers says his stepdaughter wasn't perfect. She had fallen in and out of trouble, moved from one home to another. She was arrested in 2005 for theft. The photo that was used in newspapers and television when she went missing was, ironically, a police mug shot. She dabbled with drugs and men, Meyers says. She got pregnant and gave birth to two daughters. She was supposed to check into a rehabilitation facility two days after she went missing. She did not fit the picture of the all-American girl next door. But that, says her family, doesn't mean she should go without justice. Authorities have not said anything about the evidence they have on Matthew. Cassandra Morton's family has no idea whether she, Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington are linked in some chilling way. They know only this: For the first time in years, they harbor hope again of learning the truth, however brutal that might be.","Almost five years after her body was found, Cassandra Morton's name is in the news again .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forget about pushing voters to the polls in the final 72 hours. Republican war rooms are now just as focused on turning voters into votes weeks before Election Day. In their multi-front battle to win back the Senate and hold on to governor mansions, Republican operatives don't want their supporters to wait until Nov. 4, and they're investing real money, technology and manpower to try to match Democrats, on a playing field the left has dominated in recent contests. Many credit an early voting advantage by Democrats for playing a key role in the 2012 presidential elections. The practice has upended the traditional electoral calendar and Republicans have revamped their approach, at a time when 33 states and the District of Columbia now offer some form of early voting. In key battleground states like Georgia, where early voting begins Monday, Republican operations are pouring more resources than ever into get-out-the-vote efforts ahead of Election Day. In Iowa, where residents have been voting for the last two weeks, Republicans are already starting to close the gap with Democrats after investing more than $1 million to mobilize early voters. That's a stark contrast to past election cycles when Republicans ""focused barely any resources on it,"" Iowa Republican Party spokesman Jeff Patch said. ""This midterm election cycle in particular has been the most early vote centered than any other election in previous history,"" Patch said. ""I think we're going to make a huge dent."" In just the last week, Republicans have requested absentee ballots at a faster rate than Democrats -- more than doubling their count compared to just a 40% increase for Democrats in the last 10 days, according to numbers provided by the Iowa Secretary of State's office. Registered Republicans have also mailed in their early ballots at a faster pace than Democrats. And while both parties have gotten their voters to submit more ballots than in 2010 so far, early Republican votes have more than doubled from 2010 while Democrats have only posted a 36% bump. But Democrats still lead overall by more than 11,000 early votes and while Republicans expect to continue closing the gap, they don't believe they'll undo their rivals in the early vote count -- at least not this cycle. ""They're playing catch up,"" Iowa Democratic Party communications director Christina Freundlich said. ""They're trying to teach their base about [early voting]. So we're already a couple steps ahead of them on that. We know that our base is going to be voting early."" Like her Republican counterparts in Iowa and other states, Freundlich declined to share early voting targets and program specifics. But Democrats are doing well, increasing their early voting turnout from the 2010 midterm as Democratic ballot requests already account for more than half of all requests. And in Georgia, Republicans have spent months in the ramp up to early voting season building what Georgia GOP spokesman Ryan Mahoney called ""the largest grassroots operation the party has had in modern history."" ""This is by far the most infrastructure that we've had in place,"" Mahoney said. ""In years past, this would be the point where everyone would start opening up headquarters and making calls."" Instead, Republicans in the state have already cranked out about 700,000 calls and have about 1,000 ""grassroots leaders"" working a strengthened fieldwork operation thanks to smartphone ""walk apps"" that have replaced bulky walk books that had to be manually logged into the database. Compounded with a ""robust mail program,"" automated phone calls, emails and a social media push, Republicans in the state are hoping to mobilize more supporters to vote early for Gov. Nathan Deal and Republican Senate candidate David Perdue, who are both locked in competitive races. Those efforts have helped Republicans identify those supporters in a state with no partisan voter registration -- and now the race is on to turn them out, and early. Those supporters will now hear from fieldworkers next week -- many for at least the second time -- reminding them that early voting has started. ""We just have a lot on the line. We have highly competitive gubernatorial race and U.S. Senate race going along for almost six months. Republicans wanted to be a part of this [early voting push.] We wanted to make sure that we set a precedent,"" Mahoney said. ""We want to let voters, the national media and also Democrats know that this is a red state and we're not going to give an inch."" Democrats aren't rolling over to let Republicans catch up, though, and the DNC's Vice Chair of Voter Registration and Participation Donna Brazile said the Democratic turnout operation has been operating in every state that has early voting. ""These elections are all about turning people out,"" Brazile said. ""Democrats definitely cannot afford to have the kind of drop off we saw in 2010. We're redoubling our efforts."" RNC officials are also laser-focused on ramping up their early vote turnout operation, Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said. ""We know that we need to increase our voter base to win in November and that means turning out voters who don't typically vote in mid-term elections,"" Kukowski said in an email. ""We've always done absentee and early vote GOTV but we've put a new emphasis on it and broadened our efforts."" This year Republicans launched a voter mobilization website that helps people figure out where they can vote early and encourages them to take up the ""vote challenge"" on Facebook to encourage their friends to vote -- Ã  la ice bucket challenge. And the increased and more targeted data in RNC databases is going right into fieldworkers' hands, integrating email and social media campaigns that encourage Republicans to vote early with boots on the ground for the first time, Kukowski said. In the perennial battleground state of Iowa, Republican officials have even brought in outside helping, hiring strategist David Kochel to boost the party's early turnout operation. ""We're confident that we're going to have the kind of results that will make it very difficult for Democrats to get the kind of lead that they need to win statewide elections this year,"" Kochel said. Kochel said his efforts are part voter mobilization, part stimulating cultural change among Republican voters who tend to prefer the traditional, polling booth method of voting on the first Tuesday of November. Even Kochel said he still prefers to vote on Election Day, and does. And Kochel said Republicans are looking to capitalize on a high-energy midterm election that is expected to generate higher turnout than the 2010 midterm -- pushing voters to mail in their vote ahead of Nov. 4 will help Republicans better manage Election Day efforts. ""You never know what's going to happen late in the campaign,"" Kochel said. ""There are twists and turns that happen in the campaign. You'd rather chase your voters early and get them in the door."" And state party officials say Republican candidates Joni Ernst and Gov. Terry Branstad have also been more visible in driving voters to flood the early vote. The focus on early voting in Iowa came this summer when the governor's campaign pushed the state party to make early voter mobilization a priority. ""[Branstad] made it really clear that this is how they thought that Republicans needed to run their campaigns and their party to get back to winning not just the U.S. Senate race but state senate races as well,"" Patch said. But even Patch concedes that Republicans have been playing catch-up, not just on the early voting front, but also in overall fieldwork this summer. ""Ultimately, I don't think anyone in the Republican Party is going to say we had a better ground game than the Democrats did in June or July,"" Patch said. ""[But] we've rapidly raised the resources to be competitive.""","Republican operations are pouring more resources than ever into early voting.
Democrats say they've had the early voting advantage and that the GOP won't bridge the gap.
Iowa Republicans have invested $1 million specifically for mobilizing early voters.

"(CNN) -- Spain's world champions will begin the defense of their European title against fellow football superpowers Italy next June, after both were drawn in Group C on Friday. That match in Gdansk will be the feature clash of the third day of the Euro 2012 finals, while the Republic of Ireland will take on Croatia in the other opening Group C fixture in Poznan. ""It is a difficult draw. The 16 strongest teams are in this tournament so whatever team we came up against would have presented problems,"" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque told UEFA's website. Relive the draw as it happened . ""Given the circumstances, it is good that we will play our three games in Poland and we will not face Germany.

Italy coach Cesare Prandelli will come up against his mentor Giovanni Trapattoni in Poznan on June 18 in the four-time world champions' final group game against the Irish. ""We wanted to avoid a game against Trapattoni's Ireland for various reasons.

"(CNN) -- The number of Syrian refugees could double -- if not triple -- by the end of the year if the crisis continues without change, a U.N. official said Sunday. Since the civil war began two years ago, more than 1 million have fled the country. Read more: The plight of Syria's refugees . The number of refugees recorded has gone from 3,000 on average each day in December to 8,000 daily in February, Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said Sunday in Ankara, Turkey. State of Syria: Exodus reaches 1 million; seesaw battles rage on . ""Now if this escalation goes on -- and nothing happens to solve the problem -- we might have in the end of the year a much larger number of refugees, two or three times ... the present level."" In December, the U.N.'s Regional Response Plan for Syrian Refugees estimated that 1.1 million displaced Syrians would move to surrounding countries by the end of June. The group now predicts that figure will be exceeded this month. Most flee to surrounding countries, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt, but they are increasingly going to North Africa and Europe, according to the U.N. The influx of Syrian refugees strains the nearby countries, Guterres said. Jordan's energy, health and education services are struggling to accommodate them, and Turkey has put $600 million into its 17 refugee camps, according to the UNCHR. Not all displaced Syrians register as refugees because of fear of repercussions when they return to their home country, or because they don't want to accept aid because of pride. Read more: Refugee figures fail to give true picture of Syria crisis . Members of Jordan's army told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh that they were doing what they could to help the Syrians, but they were overwhelmed. Rebel fighters who had led their families to a camp in Jordan talked to Walsh. They said they were going back to fight in Daraa, Syria.

"(CNN) -- The biggest case of the Supreme Court's term involves a three-headed, hot-button appeal combining abortion rights, religious liberty, and Obamacare. It's also the last one, and a ruling is due on Monday. The legal and social pique may not reach the heights of two years ago when the justices narrowly preserved the Affordable Care Act and its key funding provision in a blockbuster ruling. But the stakes are still large, and the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law championed by President Barack Obama and in play as a campaign issue this midterm season. The issue before the justices is whether Obamacare can mandate contraception coverage specifically for certain businesses that object for religious reasons. ""This case isn't that practically important, except for the employees and businesses involved. There just aren't a huge number of those,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a Washington appellate attorney. ""But everyone can agree the social questions presented-- about when people can follow their religious convictions, and when people are entitled to contraception care-- are truly important,"" he said. Hundreds of advocates and demonstrators representing both sides are expected to rally in front of the courthouse on Capitol Hill. Contraception mandate . The section of law in dispute requires for-profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. A number of companies equate some of the covered drugs, such as the so-called ""morning-after"" pill, as causing abortion. The specific question presented was whether these companies can refuse, on the sincere claim it would violate their owners' long-established moral beliefs. The First Amendment says that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" ""How does a corporation exercise religion?"" asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor at March's oral arguments, summarizing perhaps the key constitutional question at hand. ""This is a religious question and it's a moral question,"" added Justice Samuel Alito, suggesting the businesses have such a right. ""You want us to provide a definitive secular answer."" Conestoga, Hobby Lobby . The justices have a good deal of discretion to frame the competing issues and could reach a limited ""compromise"" through narrow statutory interpretation. They could conclude individual owners can make the religious freedom claim, bypassing the corporate rights argument, but still give female workers the flexibility to get covered drugs. The court weighed two related appeals from Conestoga Wood Specialties, a Pennsylvania cabinet maker, and Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based retail giant that will have more than 700 arts-and-crafts stores nationwide by year's end. Both corporations emphasized their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. That includes their leaders' publicly stated opposition to abortion. The case presented a complex mix of legal, regulatory, and constitutional concerns over such thorny issues as faith, abortion, corporate power, executive agency discretion, and congressional intent. Health law impact . The political stakes are large, especially for the future effectiveness of the health law, which marks its fourth anniversary this year. The botched rollout last fall of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, has become another political flashpoint along with other issues that many Republicans say proves the law is unworkable. They have made Obamacare a key campaign issue in their fight to overtake the Senate, and retain control of the House. Supporters of the law fear a high court setback on the contraception mandate will lead to other healthcare challenges on religion grounds, such as do-not-resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage. More broadly, many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment, safety, and civil rights. The abortion link . The Hahn family, owners of Conestoga, and the Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, said some of the mandated contraception prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the plaintiffs equate with abortion. That includes Plan B contraception, which some have called the ""morning after"" pill, and intrauterine devices or IUDs used by an estimated 2 million American women. A key issue for the bench has been be interpreting a 1993 federal law requiring the government to seek the ""least burdensome"" and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions. Chief Justice John Roberts could be the ""swing"" vote as he was two years ago when siding with the court's more liberal members to allow the law's ""individual mandate"" to go into effect. That provision requires most Americans to get health insurance or pay a financial penalty. It is seen as the key funding mechanism to ensure near-universal health coverage. Searching for compromise? But how will the divided court rule this time? Unanimous opinions in recent days on separate issues involving presidential recess appointments, cellphone searches by police, and abortion clinic protests suggest Roberts may be on a private campaign to push his colleagues to rule narrowly to reach consensus. Such an approach usually involves both left- and right-leaning justices reluctantly giving a little. ""At oral argument it seemed likely a majority of the justices were looking for a compromise,"" said Goldstein, ""in which the closely held for-profit businesses wouldn't themselves have to pay for contraception care, but the employees would get it, maybe through the exchanges, maybe financed by the federal government."" Compromise may be nice, but as other contentious cases earlier this term demonstrated, it is not always easy to achieve. Separate decisions this spring involving political campaign donations and voter-approved affirmative action limits produced especially sharp 5-4 divisions. Under the Affordable Care Act, financial penalties of up to $100 per day, per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage. Hobby Lobby, which has about 13,000 workers, estimates the penalty could cost it $475 million a year. The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated between the Obama administration and various outside groups. Under the changes, churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate. Other nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and charities must either offer coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement. Lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts. Second generation . Monday's decision could signal how the court will approach other lawsuits against the health care law. ""We're now getting the second generation of challenges to Obamacare-- about the actual adoption of the statute, and its core provisions,"" said Goldstein. ""We're probably going to see cases over the next five to ten years, as more and more details about the law get put into effect.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Over half the world's population now live in cities according to the United Nations. Unprecedented levels of urban migration in recent decades coupled with the challenges presented by climate change are threatening to create a perfect storm for city planners, design engineers and architects. The history of cities has too often been one of waste and inefficiency. But if cities are to have a viable future they will have to be transformed into lean, clean, people-friendly machines. But for many city dwellers, the future is already here. The citizens of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik and Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada already enjoy energy supplied almost exclusively from renewables. Vancouver is somewhat blessed geographically -- with mountains, rivers, oceans and valleys -- but citizens there have always tried to help what nature has provided. Jane McRae, is program director at the International Center for Sustainable Cities (ICSC) which is based in the city. ""I think sustainability has always been important here because it's a beautiful place and people value the environment. Green ideas are well accepted here and it creates a climate for innovation and pushing the envelope a bit,"" McRae told CNN. For the past 17 years, McRae and her colleagues at the ICSC have been spreading the message of urban sustainability at home and overseas sharing ideas and innovations with cities, regions and associations in Asia, Africa and Europe. The same sustainability rules apply to cities wherever they are, according to McRae. They need to be looked at as ""one complex system,"" she says, which ""recognizes the inter-relations and interactions of the four elements of sustainability -- economic, environmental, social and cultural -- and treat the whole system as a whole. ""Sustainability is complex and requires moving from short term problem-solving to long term thinking."" Cities also need to adopt a far more integrated approach to management of key services like water, waste and transport and encourage participation at all levels of the community in decision-making. ""It is the cornerstone of sustainable development,"" McRae says. These levels of engagement have been evident in cities like Freiberg, in south west Germany. Completed in 2006, the Vauben project transformed an old army barracks into a sustainable, energy-efficient community of 5000 people. Some cities have been grappling with green issues for much longer. Curitiba -- 330 kilometers south-west of Sao Paulo -- in Brazil introduced a sustainable transport system (Bus Rapid Transit) over 30 years ago. Others projects like the Masdar eco city project (completion date 2016) in the United Arab Emirates perhaps point to a new breed of sustainable settlement. McRae has been impressed with what U.S. cities Portland and Chicago have accomplished and praises Europeans being a leaders in tackling greenhouse gas emissions and energy conservation. But she cautions against complacency. ""We will not be sustainable if only a few cities become sustainable,"" she said. ""Until cities are producing less waste and not taking resources from the earth that we can't regenerate sufficiently so that future generations are going to have access to the same kinds of resources that we do. That's the ultimate definition of sustainability,"" McRae added. The U.N. predict that by 2050 over two-thirds of the total world population -- projected to be 9.5 billion -- will live in cities. Only time -- and an enormous effort on the part of everyone -- will tell if cities can survive the twin assault of humans and climate change. Is your city blazing a green trail? Do you think other cities are deserving of more praise for their sustainability measures. We would like to hear from you. Use the sound off box below to leave your comments.","Mass migration has created more city dwellers than ever before .

"(CNN) -- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro said Tuesday he resigned as the head of the Communist Party five years ago and has never tried to resume the post -- one that he was thought to still hold. It was the first time that the 84-year-old leader of Cuba's revolution stated so directly that he no longer heads up the party he founded. ""Without hesitation, I resigned all of my state and political positions, including that of the First Secretary of the Party, when I fell ill and I never tried to exercise them again after the proclamation of July 31, 2006,"" he wrote in an essay published in Cuban state media. He said he did not try to resume his positions ""even when I partially recovered my health a year later, although everyone, affectionately, continued to refer to me by those titles."" Cubans and foreign observers had believed that the head of the Communist Party was the one title that Castro still held after he was forced to cede power to his younger brother, Raul Castro, due to a health emergency caused by intestinal problems. Cuba plans to hold its first Communist Party Congress in almost 14 years next month. Raul Castro has stressed that the focus of the meeting will be sweeping economic changes to the Soviet-style economy. But there was intense speculation that the elder Castro would step down as the head of the party during the event, and his brother would move into the role. Castro also shot back at U.S. President Barack Obama, who criticized Cuba in a speech in Santiago, Chile, on Monday and demanded greater freedoms for the Cuban people. ""When the president looked anxiously at the public after mentioning treacherous Cuba, waiting for an explosion of applause, he was met by a glacial silence,"" Castro wrote in the essay.","Many thought Fidel Castro still held the top spot in Cuba's Communist Party .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Constitutional Court Tuesday fired the country's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, for violating the constitution by hosting a TV cooking show while in office. Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej talks with a market vendor on Monday in Udon Thani province. Tuesday's ruling against Sundaravej, who has faced weeks of violent street protests, also forces the resignation of his cabinet. Ministers are barred from working for private companies, and Samak's opponents filed the case hoping that a conviction will compel him to step down. In theory, analysts say, Samak can return as prime minister in days -- if the ruling coalition nominates him again and a parliament vote is taken. Samak appeared in court Monday, and argued that he had not violated any rules. His work for the television company, he said, was as a freelancer and not an employee. Further, he said, the show was not on the air any more and that he received just $2,300 for his appearances. The 73-year-old Samak continued to appear sporadically on the show ""Tasting while Grumbling"" after he became prime minister in February.

I said, 'No, I checked the constitution already. There's no obstruction with that,'"" he said. Professor Suchit Bunbongkarn, an expert on the constitution, said the document clearly bans prime ministers from being employed by a private entity. ""It depends on the constitutional court to decide whether receiving money to appear in the programs on the television could be considered an employee of any employer or not,"" he said. The court case is another attempt by Samak's opponents who have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at him. Samak was already facing charges of corruption, appealing a three-year prison sentence for defaming a deputy governor and dealing with an election commission decision last week that his party committed electoral fraud in the December elections and should be dissolved. In addition, thousands of protesters have camped outside the Government House, the government's headquarters -- blocking Samak from entering since August 26. The protesters are demanding that Samak step down. They accuse him of being a proxy for his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra. Samak has strongly denied the allegation and has refused to resign. On Tuesday, he declared a state of emergency in the capital city of Bangkok after overnight clashes between his supporters and anti-government demonstrators that wounded 40 and left one person dead. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) -- which is heading the protests -- contends Samak is trying to amend the constitution so Thaksin does not have to face charges. Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, returned to England last month just as he was to appear in court in a corruption case.

"(CNN) -- There were triumph and tears, joy and sorrow at the World Cup final between Argentina and Germany. But regardless of whichever team you were supporting, there were some moments Sunday that were just bizarre. Here are our top 5: . 1. Good girl gone bad: Rihanna was so excited about Germany's win, she decided to give the crowd a celebratory flash. But let's not get too excited, fellas: This was not the topless kind. The pop singer has been an avid fan of the World Cup, and her tweeted commentary throughout the tournament rivaled ESPN's. Highlights include a picture of her scantily clad with the message: ""For my German boys."" The team must have appreciated the gesture: They later brought the trophy to her. 2. Football diplomacy: World leaders take a little time off for sports, too. Cameras caught Russian President Vladimir Putin in deep conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Maracana Stadium in Brazil. Merkel was supporting the home team, which went on to beat Argentina 1-0 to win the World Cup. Putin was on a mission, too: Russia hosts the next World Cup in 2018. 3. And the winner of the Selfie World Cup is ... : Lukas Podolski. The German team forward took some epic selfies after the game. And he didn't even play Sunday! If the first one wasn't awesome enough, there's a second. And a third. Way to go, dude! 4. Because your kiss is on my list: God bless LeBron James -- and his cell phone. King James captured footage of a streaker who rushed the field, belly out and all, and tried to kiss Germany's Benedikt Howedes. Let's just say it was a case of unrequited love. ""We're going streaking! Everyone's doing it. Man that was hilarious,"" James posted under the video on Instagram. The man, it turns out, is Russian prankster and viral video sensation Vitaly Zdorovetskiy -- and he kind of hinted at his second-half shenanigan on Twitter hours before the game. The message scrawled across his torso? ""Natural Born Prankster."" 5. Silver lining in Argentina's loss: Imagine if this guy -- and his rat tail -- had scored a winning goal.

"(CNN) -- FIFA has employed a pair of high-profile crimefighters to help tackle corruption in the game, after a wake of scandals that have engulfed soccer's world governing body. President Sepp Blatter announced that former United States attorney Michael J Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert had joined the organization to probe allegations of wrongdoing. Their first task will be to investigate a Swiss court document after an investigation into alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing partner International Sports and Leisure (ISL) to former FIFA president Joao Havelange and former executive committee member Ricardo Teixeira. The report found that Havelange had received at least 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.53 million) and Teixeira was paid at least CHF 12.4 million ($12.64 million) from marketing partner ISL. Blatter: I knew about 'illegal' payments . Last week Blatter admitted that he did know about the alleged bribes handed to former FIFA executives, but insisted he didn't think they were illegal at the time. As well as the new appointments, Blatter also announced a new FIFA Code of Ethics which includes provision to remove time limitations for the prosecution of bribery and corruption cases. He said the new two-chamber court would help to prosecute cases more quickly and could look retrospectively at old cases, including the process surrounding the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. ""I don't see any limitation if anything has happened,"" he told a press conference at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, when asked about the ISL case. ""We have a new set of rules and regulations, we have new regulations for the Ethics Committee, we have no statute of limitations there. ""What you are mentioning right now, this is a case that has been taken to the Supreme Court in Switzerland, where a decision was taken, so FIFA will now look into only moral and ethical issues."" Garcia was appointed head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency in the Department of Homeland Security by former president George W. Bush. He has prosecuted a number of high-profile cases including the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in New York. Eckert is a specialist when it comes to big bribery charges, and presided over an investigation into German telecommunications giant Siemens that uncovered billion-dollar payments. Blatter spoke of his delight at the dual appointment on his official Twitter page, writing: ""Major milestone for our governance process: Ethics Code approved, independent chairmen for investigatory & adjudicatory chambers. ""I remain 100% committed to reforms and FIFA fully backs Michael Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert, the two new independent chairmen. ""On my request, ISL file will be given to the new Ethics Committee. ISL is settled legally -- now it will be settled also morally."" Meanwhile, Mohamed bin Hammam, a former challenger to Blatter for the FIFA presidency, has been suspended for 30 days over new corruption allegations. The Qatari was banned from soccer for life after a FIFA probe found him guilty of offering bribes in return for votes during his challenge to Blatter, which he withdrew hours before his ban. He was temporarily replaced as head of the Asian Football Confederation, after serving for nine years as president. Bin Hammam has repeatedly protested his innocence and has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport with a verdict due this week. But the AFC announced on their website that he had been suspended after an inspection of the organization's accounts. The audit concerned ""the negotiation and execution of certain contracts and with the financial transactions made in and out of AFC bank accounts and his personal account during the tenure of Mr Bin Hammam's presidency,"" it said.","FIFA unveil two new appointments to their Ethics Committee at press call in Zurich .

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old male has been arrested in connection with a shooting last week at a nightclub where 15 people were wounded, Miami police said. By Florida law, the suspect initially will be charged as a juvenile. He will face one charge of attempted first-degree murder and 14 counts of aggravated assault with a firearm, police said. Prosecutors will weigh whether to charge him later as an adult. Miami Police Chief Manuel Orosa said the suspect ""decided to take retribution against the individual who apparently fought with his friend"" at a high school. That victim remains in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital. Orosa said he had been shot in the abdomen and was still having stomach issues. None of the other victims, who range in age from 11 to 25, is still hospitalized. The shooting occurred on the morning of September 28 at a Miami restaurant/nightclub called The Spot. The manager was arrested last week and accused of selling liquor without a license, and The Spot was licensed as a restaurant and not as a nightclub, CNN affiliate WSVN reported. Orosa said the investigation is ongoing because two types of bullet casings were found at the scene and investigators are still trying to locate the getaway car and driver. Several people identified the suspect as the shooter, the chief said. The suspect has been previously arrested on a marijuana possession charge and for obstructing a police officer, Orosa added. CNN affiliate WPLG reported last week that a large party was being held when shooting broke out. Witnesses told police they heard about 100 gunshots, WPLG reported. Capt. Ignatius Carroll of Miami Fire Rescue said the scene was chaotic when emergency medical personnel arrived. Wounded people were found inside the club and on the sidewalk, he said. ""We understand there was a gathering taking place at some sort of little nightclub,"" he said. ""We had a large crowd."" With so many wounded people, emergency responders had to treat some victims on the sidewalk.

"(CNN) -- World and European champions on the football pitch, but blighted by ""endemic"" racism in the stands. For the second week in a row, Spain is facing up to allegations of racist abusive chanting from supporters inside its football stadiums. Last week it was Dani Alves who took a bite out of a banana hurled towards him by a fan during Barcelona's match at Villarreal, while Sunday Levante's Papakouli Diop opted to dance in front of his abusers during a match against Atletico Madrid, who will compete in this season's UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid later in May. ""I was going to take a corner and some of the Atletico fans started making monkey chants,"" the Senegalese told reporters after Levante sealed a 2-0 win over the La Liga leaders. ""I don't have anything against Atletico's fans,"" he added. ""It was just a part of them who did that to me and I wanted to explain that so people can know what happened. ""This monkey chants towards black players have to stop. And that's all."" A leading anti-racism campaigner is hoping Spain will respond to the publicity generated by the Alves incident, which struck a chord on social media, with a number of high-profile footballers, including his Brazilian teammate Neymar, posting pictures of themselves eating bananas along with the hashtag #weareallmonkeys. ""I expect quite a few incidents to come to light after the Alves banana issue,"" chief executive of anti-discrimination body Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) Piara Powar told CNN. ""The problem really is endemic in Spain. ""We are pulling together some stakeholders in a roundtable at the end of the month in an attempt to get some action co-ordinated. ""It may be that after Alves there is finally some appetite to take the issue on."" Atletico declined to comment on the abuse directed at Diop but Spain's La Liga reacted Monday following the incident. ""The Professional League of Spanish Football (LFP) and, in particular, its Department of Integrity, is strongly against any discriminatory, violent, racist, xenophobic or intolerant act, especially in the environment of football and sports,"" read the statement. ""At this respect the LFP warns that it has been proposing before the Sports Anti-violence Commission sanctions for big or minor offenses according to the 2007 law against violence, xenophobia, racism and intolerance within sports regarding the last events that took place in some stadiums during the last days. ""In any case, the LFP will fight against this kind of behavior and announces that will impose compulsory training courses to the clubs associated to the LFP in order to prevent these events to happen again. The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) made no comment to CNN, but it will investigate the incident on Wednesday, with the Ministry of Interior's Anti-violence National Commission examining the case on Thursday. European football's governing body UEFA explained that, while it is committed to eradicating racism from football, it is the duty of national associations to handle cases that arise in domestic competitions. ""UEFA operates a zero tolerance policy towards racism and is against any kind of discrimination both on and off the pitch,"" read a statement from UEFA. ""UEFA supports its member associations to combat racism in European football. ""We offer subsidies to the national associations to encourage them to set up anti-racism programs within their organizations, and we also ask them to take all necessary measures, including imposing disciplinary sanctions to eradicate these problems."" A series of high-profile incidents of racism led to world football's rulemakers FIFA introducing a number of sanctions. The punishments for a first offense is a warning, fine or the club in question being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed ""serious,"" could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament.

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the recent Alamo Drafthouse ""Don't Talk"" PSA that has been blazing a viral trail on YouTube over the past 48 hours, I was asked to expand on our other operational policies at the theater. Most of them go back to 1996, when my wife and I were first getting into the business. Despite the fact that we had zero experience in exhibition, we decided to quit our ""real"" jobs and open a movie theater. We had no desire to make movies, but we sure as heck loved to go to the cinema and watch them in the right environment. What drew us to open a theater in the first place is that we were finding a trip to the multiplex to be, more often than not, a disappointing experience. Poor projection, bad sound and, worst of all, disrespectful patrons in the cinema were slowly eroding our fun, so we conceived of the idea of opening a cinema ourselves on our own terms. We could program the movies that we loved, create unique experiences around those movies and make sure people behaved appropriately. In the first couple of months of operation, we came up with some very simple guidelines that all of our theaters still adhere to today. They were all born from our own reactions to experiences we hated and endured when we went to the movies. The insistence on these simple policies is one of the main reasons people are loyal to our cinemas today. We also serve beer, and that helps. 1) We do not play ads before the film. If I spend $9 or more to see a movie, I equate that to paying for premium cable. Paying for the movie means you get to skip the ads. If the cinema model were similar to Hulu, then sure, the ads are a means of paying for the screening of the film. The barrage of ads used to be annoying enough when they were just slides projected on the screen. Now, with full audio and video, they are insufferable and should not be tolerated. At the Alamo, instead of ads, we create customized video ""preshow"" content that is fun and entertaining and themed to the movie you are about to see. If there is ever an ad, it will be along the lines of a Japanese Charles Bronson Mandom cologne ad from the 1970s, not a PSA with fake-rock jams enticing you to join the Army. Our hope is that even if the movie you paid for is terrible, the preshow is awesome, you had an ice-cold beer and left happy. 2) We do not allow children under 6. If the movie is a non-crossover kids movie, we sometimes flex this age down to 3 and up, and we also have select ""Baby Day"" screenings each week for infants and small children. If you want to take your 4-year-old to see ""The Hangover 2"" at 10 p.m., however, you'll have to go somewhere else. 3) We do not allow unaccompanied minors. There are of lots of great, well-behaved 12-year-old individual kids, but assemble them in pods of four or more and drop them unaccompanied in a darkened theater, and they will pave a swath of destruction akin to feral hogs. We don't allow it ever. Minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian, and if they act up, they will be thrown out. 4) If you persist in talking or texting, we will throw you out. After the past few days, I think I've probably articulated our policy on this topic fully. If you talk or blatantly text, we will warn you to stop. If you persist, you will be asked to leave. These policies (with the exception of the no-ads policy) have the same underlying rationale. When you are in a cinema, you are one of many, many people in the auditorium. When the lights go dark and the movie begins, every single movie fan in the room wants to be absorbed into and get lost in the flickering images on the screen. A light from a cellphone, a screaming baby or a disruptive teen cracking jokes all pull you out of the magic of the movies. Providing an awesome experience for true movie fans is the reason we opened the first Alamo Drafthouse back in the mid-'90s, and it is the exact same philosophy we adhere to today.","At the Alamo, instead of ads, we create customized video ""preshow"" content .

"(Health.com) -- When Megan Kenny was five years old, she began to exhibit a strange and troubling symptom: Every time she stood up for more than two minutes, she collapsed. The episodes were particularly bad after Megan had been sitting or lying down for prolonged stretches, such as when she woke up in the morning or walked between classes at school. ""Church was always a disaster,"" recalls Mary Kenny, Megan's mother. After sitting or kneeling for a time, Megan would stand up with the congregation and invariably fall down. As Megan got older, other worrisome signs emerged. Her eyelids began to droop. She continued to wet the bed and suffered from constant bladder infections. And, about once a week, she experienced extreme hypoglycemic episodes -- a sudden drop in blood sugar levels -- that left her shaking and unable to function for the rest of the day. The Kennys visited a parade of doctors and specialists who considered, and ultimately ruled out, a grab bag of diagnoses: epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, liver failure, kidney failure. One time, after testing Megan for epilepsy, a neurologist observed that she appeared to have a severe form of orthostatic hypotension, a not-unusual condition in which a person's blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing or sitting up, causing the sensation known as a head rush. Health.com: Surgery saves girl's face from rare disorder . The doctor was only half right. Megan did have orthostatic hypotension, but the underlying cause was a far more exotic condition that wouldn't be diagnosed until she was an adult. In the meantime, she had to cope with having blood pressure that could dive from a relatively normal 110/70 when she was lying down to 50/30 upon standing. ""I've seen dead people with higher blood pressure,"" one nurse told her. A family affair . It was clear from the first minute of her life that Megan wasn't in good health. She was a small baby, barely five pounds, in a family that had a history of strapping, nine-pound newborns, and she immediately required oxygen for respiratory distress. ""She was literally blue,"" Mary remembers. Later, as an infant, Megan's sucking reflux was so poor that her mother wasn't able to nurse her. Orthopedists said her motor coordination was below average and referred her for physical therapy. When Megan was eight years old, her brother, Brendan, was born. As he grew up, he too would develop symptoms similar to hers, suggesting the mysterious condition had a genetic component. Megan's parents continued visiting doctors, seeking explanations for what ailed the two siblings. While some people get the occasional head rush or dizzy spell, Megan and Brendan experienced the sensation almost constantly. ""Mostly it was a feeling as if you're going to black out, like walking through life with permanent black spots,"" Megan says. Megan learned how to compensate for the strange spells. At school, if she had to climb a flight of stairs to get to a class, she'd sit on the landing to regain her composure or lean over and pretend to tie her shoes. She even played softball throughout high school, although she needed a teammate to run the bases for her. Health.com: Doctors induce 5-month coma to save woman's life . Megan and her brother lived like this for years. Finally, after Megan had graduated from college and was living on her own in San Francisco, a psychiatrist at the University of Connecticut began to unravel the mystery. After hearing a description of the Kenny children, the psychiatrist said some of their symptoms resembled those of a rare disorder he was researching: dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency (DBHD). As the name suggests, people with DBHD lack dopamine beta hydroxylase, an enzyme needed to convert the neurotransmitter dopamine into norepinephrine and epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), hormones that are critical to maintaining normal blood pressure. The psychiatrist suggested the Kennys fly Brendan, who was still in high school and living at the family home in Connecticut, to see a specialist at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tenn. ""It was like winning the lottery,"" Megan says. An 'extraordinarily rare' condition . David Robertson, M.D., a neurologist at Vanderbilt's Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, is the country's leading DBHD expert. In 1986, he was the first person to identify the disorder, in a 33-year-old woman who hadn't opened her eyes for the first five days of her life -- a common feature of DBHD. After performing blood work and numerous other tests on the woman, Robertson and his colleagues recognized that her abnormally low norepinephrine levels were caused by a genetic defect in dopamine beta hydroxylase. It was thought that no one could survive for long without norepinephrine, but that woman lived to be 62. If people with DBHD are in a situation where they're unable to sit or fall down safely, the resulting loss of blood flow to the brain can be fatal, but most people with the condition learn how to compensate and can live a relatively long life, Robertson says. Health.com: 10 states where rare and exotic diseases lurk . Robertson confirmed the suspicions of the UConn psychiatrist and diagnosed 15-year-old Brendan with DBHD. The diagnosis put Brendan in very exclusive company. ""DBHD is extraordinarily rare,"" says Robertson, who is also the principal investigator of the Autonomic Rare Disease Consortium at the National Institutes of Health. It is so rare, in fact, that the 10 patients Robertson personally has seen represent the lion's share of the documented cases worldwide. Another eight patients have been identified in Europe and Australia, though Robertson says there could be thousands more still undiagnosed. A night and day treatment . In the late 1980s, Robertson began to formulate a drug to treat the norepinephrine deficiency associated with DBHD, but he soon learned that such a drug was already being marketed in Japan. Droxidopa, also known as L-DOPS, was being used in that country for Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder characterized by dopamine deficiency. Roberston's first patient responded immediately to droxidopa. ""The drug allowed us to replace the norepinephrine not only in the blood, but even in the nerve cells of the body,"" Robertson says. Health.com: Prescription drugs that lead double lives . Brendan, too, responded to droxidopa within days. Two years later, he ran a victory lap of sorts across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, while his sister watched. Megan had visited Vanderbilt soon after Brendan. Not surprisingly, Robertson diagnosed her with DBHD, but due to a protocol change in the clinical trial he was leading, Megan had to wait three years before she could take droxidopa herself. When she finally did the results were just as dramatic. ""I felt different immediately,"" Megan says. ""This feeling of strength -- being able to walk up a hill in San Francisco at the same pace as my friends, or actually [being] able to do it without sitting down -- was incredible."" Megan herself took a sprint across the Golden Gate Bridge as part of her training for the New Orleans Marathon. She finished that race in a little over six hours in the winter of 2005. In 2010, she completed an Olympic-length triathlon: a 1,500-meter swim, 40-kilometer bike ride, and 10K run. ""For me it was like checking this off the list,"" Megan says. ""I was so grateful for my new physicality."" Megan takes 300 milligrams of droxidopa three times a day, and even now, a decade after her diagnosis, feels lightheaded if she misses a dose. She no longer runs marathons but climbs San Francisco's steep hills with ease. ""It's such a small thing in the grand scheme of things, being able to walk a block up the hill,"" she says. ""People take it for granted. I was like, 'This is incredible.'"" Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .","Megan Kenny and her brother would collapse after standing for two minutes .

"(CNN) -- Can beauty be defined by age, gender, color, body shape or size? Who gets to decide? Multibillion-dollar beauty and fashion industries both shape and depend on the cult-like worship of what physical attributes the public sees as beautiful. And most women feel the effects of those decisions. The photo exhibition ""Beauty Culture"" at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, with 175 pictures by iconic photographers, is aimed at starting people thinking and talking about female beauty. It also peeks into the underbelly of the beauty industry, including its relation to celebrity, plastic surgery, the faux-perfection of airbrushing of advertising and even child beauty pageants. There are a lot of hot-button issues as to how the media and the beauty and fashion worlds depict whole groups of people, why they show them in a particular way or barely notice them at all. However, there's been a major shift when it comes to diversity in beauty advertising and magazine beauty editorial spreads. Supermodel Veronica Webb, L'Oreal's corporate diversity director Jean-Claude Le Grand, fashion insider Bethann Hardison, Marie Claire's beauty editor Erin Flaherty and others share their thoughts on the evolving and increasingly inclusive take on gorgeousness. America's changing definition of beautiful . Several studies suggest that many equate beauty with symmetry, but even within that equation, ""Each time has its own standard (of beauty),"" said photographer Melvin Sokolsky during his lecture at the Annenberg. View more than 30 former Miss USA Pageant queens . A photographer, an editor or a casting director may be subject to his or her personal predilections of what beauty is and foist them upon the public, leading entire societal likes and dislikes to shift, too. And that standard in America is changing rapidly. Today, the number of marriages between people of different ethnicities is surging. Back in 1993, Time magazine's cover story ""The New Face of America,"" featuring a computer generated face consisting of a mix of several ethnicities, is indeed more in line with what most of us now consider beautiful, according to Allure's 20th Anniversary Beauty Survey. ""Sixty-four percent of all our respondents think women of mixed race represent the epitome of beauty,"" the survey says. And of those respondents who said they wished to change their skin color, ""70% reported that they wanted it to be darker."" Full lips and curvy bodies are also coveted. That's a far cry from 1991 when most Allure respondents chose blonde haired, blue-eyed Christie Brinkley as the ideal beauty. The all-American look today is much more of a hybrid. One model's story . Model, writer and television personality Veronica Webb (former co-host of ""Tim Gunn's Guide to Style"" on Bravo) experienced this transition from the front lines of the beauty industry. Although Beverly Johnson was the first African-American on the cover of Vogue in 1974, Webb was the first African-American to win a major cosmetics campaign when she signed on with Revlon in 1992. ""For me personally it was like almost the impossible dream of the fashion industry,"" says Webb of her Revlon campaign. ""The biggest reward, the most money you could make, the highest level of commercial validation. And you know a barrier -- a real barrier, a glass ceiling that existed forever -- got broken. ""And the ideal of beauty, and who represents beauty, and what beautiful is changed so quickly and so radically right after that, that by the time I had my children they can't even recognize the world of fashion and beauty that I came up in."" Webb says that in any business when you qualify and can perform on every level, ""but you're rejected out of hand because of your skin color ... not even your skin color, but the perception of your 'race,' there's nothing more frustrating than that,"" says Webb. But today there's a whole spectrum of women who've helmed beauty campaigns from blonde to brunette, from fair skinned to deep, including celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, Freida Pinto, Eva Mendes, Taylor Swift, Kerry Washington, Aishwarya Rai, Drew Barrymore, Gwen Stefani and models such as Liu Wen, Liya Kebede, Christy Turlington and Adriana Lima. A global perspective = good business . Time has shown the beauty industry that embracing a world of beauty isn't just good karma, it's also good for the bottom line. ""For us, the more you are diverse, the more you are successful,"" says Le Grand. L'Oreal Group is the world's largest beauty company and includes 23 international brands, including L'Oreal Paris, Lancôme, Maybelline and Garnier. If you are to be a leader, Le Grand says that you have to understand ""there is a link between beauty and diversity."" And that includes understanding the vision of beauty in places such as China, India, Africa and Europe as well the United States. ""If it's only one vision of beauty and not a diverse one, you are out. ... We have to reflect everyone from the model to the employee."" Flaherty, Marie Claire's beauty editor who also once worked at Jane, says that she's been lucky to work at magazines that are all about a global perspective, diversity and unusual beauty. Diversity, of course, can be expresses a myriad of ways, be it featuring women with freckles, who are curvier or who are 45 and older. An element in the beauty world that changed things, ""was the Dove campaign,"" says Flaherty. ""Using many different types of models and reflecting what women really look like."" The campaign's stated goal is to ""free ourselves and the next generation from beauty stereotypes"" and contribute to building self-esteem for young women and others through marketing campaigns featuring women of different shapes, sizes, ages and hues as well as partnering with groups such as the National Eating Disorders Information Center and the Girl Scouts. Bethann Hardison has been a model, modeling agent and recently Vogue Italia editor-at-large. ""I'm an advocate of the fashion model,"" says Hardison, who laments models losing jobs to actors and singers. But she does see big changes in advertising in that it better reflects American demographics. Hardison points out that the beauty industry has a large consumer base, speaks to a broader group of people, and so is more democratic and shifts faster than the fashion world. But as the global economy shifts, so too will fashion with the help of newspaper editors who call out inequities and magazine editors, casting directors, advertising agencies and designers committed to inclusiveness, as well as the public. ""The word beauty is such a controversial word,"" says Hardison. ""I think that the more that there's exposure (of different kinds of looks), and as long as you expose them consistently, you give people a chance to see what could also be beautiful besides what came before.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court is scheduled to tackle some key cases in its 2014-15 term, which starts Monday. More than three dozen appeals are currently on the docket. Perhaps three dozen more are expected to be added in coming months. The caseload for the term is usually settled by February, with the term effectively ending in late June. Other important appeals that may yet be added cover such issues as same-sex marriage, affirmative action, abortion rights and further litigation over President Obama's health care reform law. Cases already on the Supreme Court docket: . FREE SPEECH: Elonis v. United States . AT ISSUE: The limits of policing ""speech crimes"" in the Internet age, especially laws aimed at protecting those harassed or bullied online. What is the level of proof needed to convict someone of making criminal threats? THE CASE: Anthony Elonis was convicted in federal court for threatening language in Facebook posts aimed at his estranged wife, judges and law enforcement. Some were expressed as rap lyrics, which Elonis said were ""therapeutic"" for dealing with emotional pain. But prosecutors said he crossed a dangerous free speech line. THE ARGUMENTS: Elonis' lawyers argue that the government did not prove that his statements showed a ""subjective intent to threaten,"" based on Supreme Court precedent. But the Justice Department replied that his online comments were serious in nature, not a case of ""careless talk, exaggeration, something said in a joking manner or an outburst of transitory anger."" THE IMPACT: A ruling here could have broader implications for free speech amid the explosion of popular and often anonymous social media. Are sites like Twitter in the same category as more conventional news links, and are general threats made online different from those made in person? RELIGIOUS FREEDOM: Holt v. Hobbs . AT ISSUE: An inmate wants to grow a Â½-inch beard in accordance with his beliefs, citing rights under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. THE CASE: Gregory Holt, also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad, is a Muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the court. Arkansas prison policy allows only a ""neatly trimmed mustache."" THE ARGUMENTS: Corrections officials say beards can hide contraband and make it hard to identify prisoners, so such security concerns deserve deference from courts. But Holt's lawyers -- backed by the Obama administration -- say that a less restrictive policy should be adopted. THE IMPACT: Holt has the support of both civil liberties and religious freedom groups, who have often been traditional foes. Last term, the justices ruled that some for-profit companies whose owners expressed strong Christian beliefs had a First Amendment right to oppose Obamacare health mandates providing contraception coverage for their workers. EXECUTIVE POWER: Zivotofsky v. Kerry . AT ISSUE: The constitutionality of a federal statute that explicitly directs the secretary of state how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a Consular Report of Birth Abroad and on a passport. Does the law impermissibly infringe on the President's power to recognize a foreign nation? THE CASE: Thirteen-year-old Menachem Zivotofsky is a U.S. citizen, and his parents want his birthplace listed as ""Jerusalem, Israel,"" but U.S. diplomatic officials said they could use only ""Jerusalem."" The status of the holy city remains in dispute, and U.S. policy is reflected in the fact that it does not currently recognize any country as having sovereignty over the region. THE ARGUMENTS: The justices three years ago allowed the lawsuit by the family to proceed. It is not the first time Congress and the White House have clashed over the holy city, which both Israelis and Palestinians consider their capital: The U.S. Embassy remains in Tel Aviv, over U.S. lawmakers' objections. THE IMPACT: This dispute may be fact-specific, but the federal government is thinking of the bigger political and diplomatic picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record in a pending case, but President Barack Obama has acknowledged that the stalled peace process has created divisions in that region and in the United States. WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION: Young v. United Parcel Service . AT ISSUE: The duty of employers to provide workplace accommodations under the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act. THE CASE: Expectant mother Peggy Young's request for a ""light duty"" assignment from her regular work as a truck driver was denied, even though the company allegedly had done so for other workers temporarily unable to perform their functions. Young, who worked in suburban Washington, then had to take unpaid leave, with a subsequent loss of medical benefits. THE ARGUMENTS: The company and Young focus on two different readings of the act and whether UPS' ""pregnancy-blind"" policy on the ability to work protects it from liability. THE IMPACT: The ruling could add significantly to the evolving canon of judicial oversight over job discrimination claims. Cases that may be added to the Supreme Court docket in coming months: . SAME-SEX MARRIAGE: Various pending appeals from state officials in Utah, Oklahoma, Virginia, Indiana and Wisconsin . AT ISSUE: Whether state bans on the ability of gays and lesbians to legally wed violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantees. THE CASE: Thirty-one states do not allow same-sex marriage. Legal, political and social momentum favoring the right has accelerated in the past year after the Supreme Court in a peripheral case struck down part of a congressional law that recognized marriage for federal purposes as between only one man and one woman. THE ARGUMENTS: Gay rights groups say the bans are discriminatory and single out homosexuals for disparate treatment. But many states say that the voters -- not the courts -- should decide such matters and that traditional marriage encourages opposite-sex couples to raise children in a stable family unit. THE IMPACT: A final ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court would be a landmark on many social levels. The justices could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or they could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures to sort it all out, for now. ABORTION RIGHTS: Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas Surgical Health Services v. Abbott . AT ISSUE: A challenge to a Texas law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of a clinic where they are providing abortion services. THE CASE: Other states have adopted similar laws, and lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. THE ARGUMENTS: Abortion-rights supporters say the provision is unconstitutionally restrictive and has forced more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas to close. State officials, including Gov. Rick Perry, have said the law ensures that clinics are no operating under ""dangerous conditions."" THE IMPACT: Another part of the Texas law is also being reviewed by a federal appeals court: the requirement that abortions be provided in only walk-in hospital-type surgical centers, which could force closure of many smaller women's health clinics. 11 other states have similar restrictions. If the case is accepted for review, the justices will again tackle one of the most contentious social issues. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: Fisher v. University of Texas . AT ISSUE: A renewed challenge to the school's race-conscious admissions policies. THE CASE: Abigail Noel Fisher individually sued the flagship state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she a high senior in Sugar Land, Texas. Fisher claims that she was turned away because she is white. The school defends its policy of considering race as one of many factors -- such as test scores, community service, leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus. THE ARGUMENTS: The high court first heard this case two years ago, issuing a ruling with no clear winner. The justices affirmed the limited use of race in the admissions process but made it somewhat harder for institutions to apply such policies to achieve diversity. The case went back to a federal appeals court for further scrutiny, which decided in the school's favor in July. THE IMPACT: The Fisher dispute will now probably be reviewed once again by the Supreme Court in coming months, with the potential for a definitive 21st-century ruling. The issue of race and education offers vexing questions of competition, fairness and demographics -- and what role government should play when promoting political and social diversity.","The court will hear cases involving rappers, UPS drivers and Muslim prisoners with beards .

"(CNN) -- Women in China have a lot more opportunities in business because it is ""not gender-based, it's merit-based,"" says one of China's top female businesswoman. Jennifer Li, CFO of Baidu, the world's largest Chinese-language search engine, sometimes referred to as ""China's Google,"" adds that China is a very female-friendly business environment. ""The society is very open and many companies create a level playing field when it comes to employment,"" adds Li, who controls the corporate functions of a company worth nearly $32 billion. According to data from Beijing-based research firm Analysys International, Baidu has secured a staggering 78% share of the world's largest internet market -- China's 500 million internet users. Baidu, founded by search engine expert and entrepreneur Robin Li (no relation) in 2000, employs slightly more women than men, according to Jennifer Li. ""They're very open, very communicative, very assertive and sometimes can be very aggressive, too,"" she says of Baidu's female employees. ""These women are all women with great ambition. You can tell their focus is not about, 'How do I fulfill a woman's role as a mother or as a young woman trying to get married?' They're more thinking about their lifetime career objectives."" Beijing-raised Li began her career in finance at General Motors, following an MBA at the University of British Columbia. She worked there for 14 years before joining Baidu in 2008. Here Li talks to CNN about her management style, on balancing creativity with control and how to succeed as a woman in business. On women and work ... First, don't think that being a woman is a big deal. If you are sensitive about 'I am a young Asian woman,' that noise is coming into the professional setting. Focus on the issue. Focus on what we need to do here, not who we are. Measure yourself only by the standard that you deliver specific work objectives. Interactive: Boardroom quotas for women explained . On success ... It's not like you have good luck that drops on you. If you consistently have high standards for yourself, and are constantly learning and improving, you'll become somebody that maybe years ago you aspired to be. On gender ... Gender is not a factor. To become a successful career person, it's about passion for excellence, not easily giving up on things, and it is about really connecting yourself to have very full perspectives, so you are unique and bring value somehow. Meet Fortune 500's female powerbrokers . On being nice ... People know that I have a high standard, and maybe they think 'She's a very tough boss,' but in reality I'm very warm. I chatter with people about stuff and I would remember if you told me your wife had an operation. I remember all that naturally, not by design. On Baidu ... Nobody tells you what you need to do. People wander around; they show up at work whenever and they leave whenever. That has been the way Baidu has operated all along. It's a very self-initiated environment ... you define your own work, you define your own value. Whether you're good or not, the result will speak for itself. On control vs. creativity ... The key is to put order and process in the critical areas -- not everything -- so you give people a feeling that they are very free but at the same time, you give management the kind of comfort that this company is in control. On standards ... I have a true dedication for excellence. It's that attitude that makes me very different from others. I really think it makes a difference. When I was a young analyst, you needed to leave a market update voicemail for the company executives. All my colleagues would stutter or forget about things, but I would record my message until it was perfect and then send it. 10 most powerful women in tech . On the evolution of management ... The higher up you go, the more time you spend managing people rather than managing projects. On her two children ... I hope they grow up to be noble people, have virtues and great values. I feel I haven't spent enough time with them and therefore I don't have very much control of that situation. But I can only create the best environment for them to be who they are and hopefully they are great people as they grow up. On childhood dreams ... I wanted to be an astronaut because I felt it was an intellectual and physical challenge. But today I love what I do. I'm very fit and I'm happy with where I am.","China's work environment gives women more opportunities for success, says top businesswoman .

"(CNN) -- The Leipziger Strasse in central Berlin looks like almost any another main traffic artery in the world these days. It's four lanes in each direction, and high rise buildings with nondescript shops on the ground floors line the sidewalks. But this used to be one of the main streets of Communist East Berlin, where the East German regime showcased its arsenal during military parades. It was also the place I spent five years of my childhood from the late 1970s. My father, Fritz Pleitgen, was the bureau chief for ARD West German television in East Berlin, and with that title he became one of the people the intelligence service -- the Staatssicherheit or ""Stasi"" -- hated and spied on the most. Their code name for him was ""The Tiger."" ""It was a war of the airwaves much more than it was a war with weapons, because there was always this competition between East Germany and West Germany,"" my dad recently told me when we visited our old house at Leipziger Strasse 66. ""They broke into our flat, but also into our office,"" he said, describing the Stasi's methods. ""They took pictures. And sometimes they wanted to show me that they were in. That I got the impression that I am being observed."" They tried to gather any sort of information they could on my dad. The Stasi also used directional microphones and, of course, many informants who tried to make contact with our family and those working for the ARD office in the Schadow Strasse in East Berlin. The files that the Stasi gathered were later made available to the public. When my dad went through his, he was amazed. ""It was a total observation,"" he said. ""They wanted to know everything to try and determine what kind of guy I was, because they thought all Western reporters were spies."" He later discovered that all of our neighbors around the house we lived in were secretly reporting to the Stasi. There were some situations where it was pretty obvious that people were acting as informants, or ""Unofficial Employees"" as the Stasi called them. But it was impossible for Western journalists to know the full extent to which they were being shadowed. The daily work was a cat and mouse game. The East German regime went to great lengths to try and prevent people in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany's official name) from watching Western TV. And they also did everything they could to stop East Germans from talking to West German reporters. ""They wanted to stop our contacts with the East German population,"" my dad said. ""That was their nightmare -- that there could be an alliance of West German correspondents with the people of East Germany."" One such encounter was recorded in 1979 when my dad and his crew drove out to the Berlin-GrÃ¼nau district to try to interview the author and activist Stefan Heym -- a man who was not afraid to speak out and criticize the regime. When the team arrived, Stasi agents were already waiting, and they tried to stop them from talking to Heym. The crew did what almost every TV crew does when confronted with government goons who want to stop them from doing their work: They started a long conversation while the cameraman secretly kept filming, and the Stasi people grew increasingly uncomfortable as the situation went on. In the end my dad was allowed inside to speak to Heym, but the camera had to stay out. He would go on to interview the activist on many occasions, and they remained friends until Heym died. As time went on, the East German government's restrictions grew tighter and tighter. ""They wanted a permission letter for everything,"" my dad told me. ""I could not even go up to you and just ask you what the weather is like."" One way to undermine the repression was to mislead the Stasi. In some cases the ARD crews would say they wanted to do feature reports about the beauty of the landscapes and towns of East Germany, when in reality they wanted to show the mood of the people there. Sometimes they would purposely talk about going to a certain area, knowing the spies were listening, and then go somewhere completely different. Being a West German family living in East Berlin, we were allowed to pass through the Berlin Wall to West Berlin anytime. The children actually went through the Wall every morning to get to school and kindergarten. My parents have never forgiven us for purposely losing our identification cards whenever we didn't feel like going to school. That meant we were stuck in the East, and that my dad would have to fly to West Germany to get new IDs for us. The constant harassing and spying also made life extremely difficult for my mother, who was doing an amazing job trying to raise me, my brothers Christoph and Benjamin and my sister Vanessa. My dad had promised her a glamorous life as the wife of a foreign correspondent with stints in Paris or New York. Instead she found herself first in Moscow from 1970 till 1977, and then in East Berlin. ""She always had problems with the border guards,"" my dad said. ""And she was not ready to talk to them with a smile because she hated their questions."" One of the dumbest things the guards always wanted was to see was my mom's left ear. It was in their protocol that people passing the checkpoints had to show their left ear to be positively identified. ""First of all, she always refused to get out of the car,"" my dad said. ""And at some point she told them, 'Listen, you have seen my left ear so many times, you must know what it looks like by now. I am not going to show you again.'"" It didn't help that my siblings and I did a lot to bring our parents into embarrassing situations. My father remembered how he once got a call because his children had stolen a border guard's hat and thrown it around the inside of a bus. On another occasion we threw balloons filled with water from the 13th floor of our building and hit an East German ""Volkspolizist,"" as the regular police were called. ""One of the questions that was asked in the police report was whether the balloons were filled with warm or cold water,"" my dad recalled with a smile on his face as we stood outside the apartment building. I was 13 when the Berlin Wall came down. It meant nothing to me at the time. But today when I walk the streets of Germany's capital it is truly amazing to see how far the city and the country have come -- first rebuilding it after the shame of the Nazis and World War II, and then re-unifying it after the long division of the Cold War. I take great pride in the fact that my dad played such a prominent role opposing German division, and that he and my mother never gave up and always stood tall and strong. No matter how repressive, intrusive and abusive the East German regime was, it never broke the will of The Tiger.","As a child, CNN's Fred Pleitgen lived in East Berlin under the watchful eye of the Stasi .

"(CNN) -- For the past week-and-a-half, people have been marveling over the discovery of evidence supporting ""inflation,"" the theory describing the birth pangs of the Big Bang 13.7 billions years ago. What do these findings mean and how did they come about? Lots of articles reported the news, but I am going to try to explain it in depth. Stick with me, because this is one of the most exciting astrophysical discoveries in decades. Humans have wondered about the origin of the universe for millennia, and last week's news brought us a little closer to an answer. What this development means, basically, is that for the first time, we may be seeing what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second of the universe. Assuming this discovery is verified by other similar experiments, it means the very birth of the universe can be studied. These will tell us about the physics of matter and energy well beyond the reach of earthly particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider. In a press conference on March 17, leaders of the Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization (BICEP2) experiment announced their discovery of evidence of gravitational waves -- predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity -- that were generated by the near-instantaneous expansion of the universe by some 50 factors of 10, or a factor of 100 million, trillion, trillion. Those waves were predicted by the theory of inflation, developed 30 years ago by Alan Guth, Andrei Linde and others. Inflation is the instantaneous initial expansion, far faster than the speed of light, that ""describes the propulsion mechanism that drove the universe into the period of tremendous expansion that we call the Big Bang,"" as Alan Guth put it. Incidentally, the term ""Big Bang"" was coined as an insult by a physicist who didn't like the theory. The Big Bang idea itself is simple. Edwin Hubble -- after whom the Hubble Space Telescope is named -- showed more than 80 years ago that our universe is expanding. Objects in space are not hurtling outward: Space itself is becoming bigger over time. That means the distance between two galaxies grows even if neither galaxy is moving through space at all. By extrapolating the Hubble expansion backward, we have long known that the universe was once smaller by many, many factors of 10. All the mass and energy of the entire universe squeezed into such a tiny volume would have been much hotter and denser. Then, as the universe expanded over time, the energy density went down, so the temperature cooled. This Big Bang idea implied that cool relic radiation should be visible today. Indeed, this Big Bang glow of radiation was discovered in the early 1960s by two Bell Labs engineers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who were trying to build the world's best radio antenna. Their instrument recorded a mysterious irreducible low-level noise from every direction. Apparently worried that the surface of the antenna horn had been corrupted by, um, debris from pigeons roosting inside, the engineers repeatedly disassembled and cleaned the antenna, to no avail. Physicists later connected this measurement to the Big Bang prediction of a cosmic microwave background, for which Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978. As a colleague at Bell Labs joked, referring to their obsession with pigeon droppings, ""They went looking for dung and came up with gold. For most of us [scientists], it works the other way."" The Big Bang idea was well established by the 1980s. But it did not explain important pieces of the story. First, the universe looks pretty homogeneous and isotropic -- that is, galaxies in any one direction look very similar to galaxies in the opposite direction, no matter how distant. The number of galaxies, their masses, their shapes and their stellar content are remarkably similar, to the furthest reaches we can observe. This is surprising because the Big Bang-Hubble expansion implied that very distant regions should never have been in causal contact. How then could they be so similar? Here is a simple analogy: Imagine a thermos of ice water and a thermos of hot tea. As long as these two liquids are separate, they will have different temperatures. But if the two liquids are combined, the mixed liquid will quickly reach an intermediate temperature. Similarly, two well-separated regions of the universe can be alike only if they were at one time in contact. The theory of inflation explains this quite naturally: If at the beginning the universe inflated at an extraordinarily rapid rate -- much faster than the Hubble-measured expansion today -- then all parts of the universe visible today were once in contact. That means they had the same initial physical conditions (such as temperature and density), so that similar stars and galaxies eventually formed out of the cosmic soup. Inflation also explains why the universe has a very ""flat"" geometry -- something revealed in the 1990s by analysis of the spatial distribution of tiny fluctuations (hot and cold spots) in the cosmic microwave background radiation. In principle, other geometries of space were possible. For example, a two-dimensional surface can be flat like a table; convex like the surface of a sphere (also called closed); or concave like the surface of a saddle (also called open). For the universe to be flat requires a very precise balance. It has infinitely more ways to be open or closed, with strong curvature, weak curvature, or anything in between. But to be flat -- well, that's like balancing on a knife edge. Inflation naturally explains this odd fact. Specifically, the idea is that, at the very beginning, the universe must have inflated enough to stretch the fabric of space until no trace of curvature remained. Imagine inflating a beach ball to the size of the Earth: you can easily see the curvature of the beach ball in your hands but once it's hyper-inflated, any piece of its surface seems very flat, just as the Earth feels flat locally. The enormous inflation in size would effectively erase the initial conditions in the universe. Whatever the initial temperature, for example, inflation would cool the universe to absolute zero. Even if the initial universe were very lumpy, after inflation we can see only a very smooth, local part of the original volume -- and it would seem perfectly flat. After about one hundred millionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second, according to theorists, whatever repulsive gravity caused inflation then transformed into a hot, dense soup of particles and energy. At this point, the Big Bang expansion that Hubble discovered took over. How inflation began and how it ended are not yet understood, but this simple idea of inflation neatly explains otherwise odd characteristics -- isotropy and flatness -- of our universe. Still, until now, there had been no direct evidence of inflation. What BICEP2 saw was the imprint of inflation on the cosmic microwave background radiation. Specifically, inflation should have generated a lot of gravitational waves -- that is, it would cause propagating ripples of space itself. Such waves have a characteristic pattern, squeezing space rhythmically in one direction then the perpendicular direction, like two hands pressing a rubber ball top to bottom then side to side. This distortion of space causes a special pattern of polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. So what is polarization? Light is a wave that oscillates back and forth -- polarized light oscillates preferentially in one plane. Because most light is a mix of random directions of polarization, its net polarization is zero. But any scattered light, like sunlight reflected off water, is polarized -- which is why polarized sunglasses cut down substantially on glare. BICEP2 scientists searched for that special pattern of polarization in the cosmic microwave background that would show the evidence of inflation, working for several years analyzing and reanalyzing their data. As they ran through every possible check of the analysis, team members finally began to believe they had detected the first direct signs of inflation. Now other experiment teams are redoubling efforts to find the same signal -- or to find contradictions. The reported BICEP2 signal is unexpectedly strong, so it should be within reach of at least some of these experiments. Physicists around the world know: the BICEP2 discovery is only the beginning of the story. If this result is verified by independent experiments, new, more accurate experiments will be designed to better measure the polarization imprint. This in turn will tell us about how matter and energy behave in conditions much hotter and denser than on Earth or any other place in the cosmos. As Carl Sagan once said, ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" Let the observations begin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Meg Urry describes the sequence of discoveries that lead to evidence of ""inflation""

"(CNN) -- A week ago Sunday, Arctic sea ice cover reached its lowest extent ever recorded. For good reason, there has been significant media focus on how a warming sea gobbles up the ice that is polar bear habitat and reduces the area's capacity to reflect the sun's rays. This is roughly equivalent to unplugging one pole's worth of the Earth's central air conditioning system. But far less attention has been placed on what a naked Arctic Ocean means for its closest neighboring ecosystem: the Arctic tundra. Beyond the images of icebergs and stranded polar bears, I doubt many people picture the Arctic's vast carpet of lush green plants, chirping songbirds or highs in the mid-70s -- all of which are typical of summertime on the tundra. With climate changing at an alarming rate and sea ice extent slipping away, the tundra stands to change a lot, and this, too, will affect the rest of the planet. It is time to start familiarizing ourselves with the tundra, and here's why. The tundra biome is huge, covering 15% more of the Earth's surface than all 50 U.S. states combined. Currently, it stores a significant proportion of the Earth's carbon in its permanently frozen soils, keeping it locked away and unable to contribute to the atmosphere's giant pool of greenhouse gases. Opinion: Why we should look to the Arctic . However, in much the same way that other bodies of water keep coastal cities such as San Francisco from having extremely cold winters and scorching hot summers, sea ice conditions in the Arctic Ocean influence weather patterns over the nearby tundra. Less sea ice is associated with warmer and drier summer conditions on the tundra. Consistently balmier summers will cause soils to warm and thaw to greater depths, unleashing long-stored carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are potent greenhouse gases. The previous record low in Arctic Ocean ice cover occurred in 2007, and the hot, dry summer that accompanied it on the Alaskan tundra was highlighted by the largest, longest lasting and most severe tundra fire to burn in northern Alaska in recorded history. The fire covered an area roughly 10% larger than Manhattan and burned for 2Â½ months. Although lightning frequently strikes the tundra, the landscape is typically fairly moist and so rarely ignites, and even when it does, the flames don't spread very far, burn very deeply or remain alight for very long. But the tundra was very dry in 2007 and fire-fueling winds kicked up the blaze. During this single event, the immediate combustion of plants and soils and the thawing of frozen soils injected an enormous amount of carbon into the atmosphere â€” an amount equivalent to what the entire tundra biome typically absorbs from the atmosphere through plant growth every year. The effect of diminishing sea ice isn't limited to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Warmer conditions on the tundra trigger a cascade of change, including converting its lush but short green carpet into a taller shag, since warmer soils and deeper thaw enable taller, woody plants to grow and thrive on the tundra. What my colleagues and I are discovering from our own work in Alaskan tundra is that this shift in vegetation cover has implications -- some good, some bad -- for the animals that depend on it for food and shelter. Opinion: Extreme weather and a changing climate . Each spring many species of migratory songbirds travel to the Arctic tundra from all over the world to breed. Some nest in patches of tall vegetation and may stand to benefit from the expanding taller shag, but those that nest in short vegetation may not be able to adapt. What may likely benefit all species is that the taller vegetation harbors significantly more bugs to eat. We don't yet know which species will benefit, and which will suffer in response to the changes, but because each species plays a specific ecological role on the tundra, the downfall of one species or proliferation of another could have a domino effect that disrupts the tundra's delicate food web. And in case you thought that what happens on the tundra stays on the tundra, consider that many of the sparrows, robins and warblers that visit our backyards in winter, or pass through come fall and spring, spend their summers breeding on the tundra; so, whatever happens to them there will affect which ones and how many of them show up at your bird feeder in the future, potentially setting off a local domino effect. Since the Arctic as a whole is responding to climate change earlier and more acutely than the rest of the planet, we should think of it as an early warning system -- a proverbial canary in a coalmine. Perhaps if we pay closer attention to how the tundra is changing, we can learn some practical lessons on what types of changes to expect here at lower latitudes, which would enable us to mitigate the consequences, or at least plan for how to cope with them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Natalie Boelman.","Natalie Boelman: Arctic sea at lowest extent recorded, affecting Earth's ability to cool .

"(CNN) -- Step into any of the countless nightclubs in Lagos and you're bound to find yourself immersed in a sonic journey of pulsating beats, groovy samples and hip-hop kicks. In a megacity where everybody loves to dance, the tone is set by the infectious sounds of Afrobeats -- a growing music movement that's struck a chord with youth in West Africa and outside the continent. Although its name sounds similar to Afrobeat -- the eclectic mix of traditional and contemporary sounds pioneered by firebrand multi-instrumentalist Fela Kuti -- Afrobeats is a new genre on the Anglophone West African music scene. Back in late 1960s, Kuti, one of Africa's biggest music stars, used his electrifying grooves and sharp-tongued lyrics as a political vehicle to oppose Nigeria's military governments. Read: Blind music pioneer fires up Nigeria's modern sound . Afrobeats, however, tends to steer clear from politics. Its mission, says well-known Nigerian music promoter Cecil Hammond, is to make people forget their everyday troubles and have a good time. ""Africa can be very stressful,"" he explains. ""So you need things to make you loosen up and make you happy -- and music makes Nigerians happy."" Hammond says that Nigerian music today has changed a lot since the days of Kuti, who died in August 1997. ""Nigerian artists don't really want to get into politics,"" says Hammond. ""They tend to stay far away from it because at the end of the day, you have different political parties, you don't want anyone to say you belong to this party or that party. ""The more neutral you are, the better -- so just focusing your music, give us good music, let everybody dance and that's it."" Kanya King: MOBO founder's top 5 pop picks . Musically, however, the influence of Kuti is clearly evident on the new generation of Afrobeats artists. DJ Abrantee, a UK-based Afrobeats champion, says the new sounds derive from Afrobeat, having evolved over the years with various Afrobeats musicians experimenting to suit their individual styles. ""[With] the inclusion of non-traditional instruments, electronic sounds, grooves, synths, hip-hop kicks, it has become more than just the one typical style of beat used in the 1970s,"" he explains. ""It is now an amalgamation of beats."" But who are some of the hottest names making strides in the Afrobeats scene? Here, Abrantee picks five stars whose are breaking through commercially on the world stage. WizKid . ""WizKid is without a shadow of doubt on the verge of a worldwide explosion,"" declares Abrantee, who describes the Nigerian Afrobeats singer as a ""young talented guy who not only sings but pens some of the most musically catchy hooks in that genre."" WizKid was recently signed by UK star Tinie Tempah's management company. D'Banj . The Nigerian rapper is at the forefront of the Afrobeats scene, having enjoyed big international success with ""Oliver Twist,"" a global hit that made it to the Top 10 in UK charts. Abrantee says ""his music is infectious, fun, dynamic and appeals to the masses."" In recent years, D'Banj has won several prestigious awards, including the Best African Act at the 2012 MOBO Awards. May7ven . Nigerian May7ven is a UK-based Afrobeats artist and singer-songwriter who is well known for her dancing. ""Her bold and catchy anthems in a predominately male-dominated industry have been leading the way and carrying the international flag for the ladies in Afrobeats,"" says Abrantee. Atumpan . The Ghanaian artist, also known as ""the talking drum,"" has had success with ""The Thing,"" a massive hit on dance floors in Africa and beyond. ""The dexterity and distinctness of his soulful voice complements his records and puts him in a firm position to have a long lasting career,"" says Abrantee. R2Bees . R2Bees is a super group featuring Ghanaian artists Paedae and Mugeez, produced by Killbeats, who is responsible for some of the biggest hits coming out of the West African country. Abrantee says they are the ""Afrobeats group to watch"" in 2013, pointing to the anticipated release of their new single featuring UK star Tinchy Stryder.","Afrobeats is a West African style of music making waves internationally .

"(CNN) -- For 585 days, Swiss adventurer Raphael Domjan braved storms, pirates and cloudy skies in an attempt to circumnavigate the globe on a boat propelled by nothing but sun beams. The boat, christened ""Turanor"" after a word meaning ""power of the sun"" in JRR Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, is Domjan's brainchild. As heavy as a whale and 30 meters long, it's adorned with enough photovoltaic panels to cover two tennis courts. After eight years of fundraising, 64,000 hours of construction, and 19 months at sea, the ""Turanor"" made history on May 6, when it cruised into Port Hercules, Monaco, completing the first ever round-the-world journey by a solar-powered vessel. From the coast of Miami to the shores of Mumbai, Domjan and his four-man crew visited 28 countries on a voyage designed to showcase the practical applications of solar energy. ""The aim of this journey was to show the world that this technology is not science fiction, it is very real and it can help us change how we do things now rather than in the future,"" said Domjan. ""Everywhere we went people would flock around the boat. They had never seen such a strange design before,"" he added. But for the 40-year-old skipper, whose youth was spent wading through pages of adventure books, the voyage was also a fruition of boyhood aspirations. ""I remember sitting on my grandfather's knee listening to him reading 'Around the world in 80 days' by Jules Verne. It made me want to go out and explore just like Phileas Fogg,"" recalled Domjan. Read related: When superyacht chic meets hybrid technology . As a young man growing up in Switzerland, Domjan developed his penchant for the unknown by exploring nearby caves. He then trained to become a mountain guide and a rescue specialist in hazardous environments. This preparation would prove invaluable during the more perilous parts of his journey. On numerous occasions the boat had to endure winds of up to 100 kilometers an hour as it was rocked by storms off the Australian and Vietnamese coasts. ""We faced some really rough weather, but the boat always operated well during those times, even better than we expected,"" he said. In fact, Domjan says that the most serious threat came not from Mother Nature, but from fellow man. While crossing the Gulf of Aden -- a waterway in the Arabian Sea notorious for kidnapping and hijacking -- Domjan faced little choice but to recruit six French soldiers for protection. ""Normally ships speed up to 15 or 20 knots when crossing this area but we couldn't go faster than five knots,"" said Domjan. Indeed, one of ""Turanor's"" comparative limitations is its snail-like pace. It has a maximum speed less than that of a large oil-tanker, just 7.5 knots (14 kilometers an hour). Fortunately for Domjan and his crew, no pirates attempted to confront the muscle-bound French commandos or the unusual looking boat. It would have certainly made a rare and impressive bounty. The $16 million vessel not only boasts 536 square-meters of shiny photovoltaic panels, but also the world's largest rechargeable lithium battery -- capable of storing enough power to allow the ""Turanor"" to travel for five full days without sunlight. ""Most people think that if the sun doesn't shine the boat wouldn't work, but it is impossible to sail for one year and only have good weather. The beauty is that you never get nothing from the sun, she is always giving us energy. Not once did we run out of power,"" boasted Domjan. The ship's captain has reason to be proud. Having completed the 50,000 kilometer journey, the ""Turanor"" returns with five Guinness World Records to its name: Longest solar journey; first solar circumnavigation; fastest solar crossing of the South China Sea; fastest solar crossing of the Atlantic and - no surprises here -- a record for the world's largest solar-powered boat. Read more from Mainsail: The boat that Hendrix's guitar built . Domjan concedes that that the ""Turanor"" and its crew have little competition in these categories, but hopes this won't be the case for long. ""I really hope our journey will make people realize the sheer power of solar energy and that it can be used efficiently for long-haul travel,"" he said. Now back in Europe, Domjan is taking some time off to recharge his own batteries, before getting back to work, thinking of new ways to spread the solar power message to the world.","The ""MS Turanor"" is the first solar powered boat to sail around the world .

"(CNN) -- The ""tweet heard round the world"" was followed by the sound of a slamming door Saturday. Media company IAC has ""parted ways"" with company PR executive Justine Sacco over her tweet: ""Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!"" ""The offensive comment does not reflect the views and values of IAC. We take this issue very seriously, and we have parted ways with the employee in question,"" an IAC spokesman said in a statement. ""There is no excuse for the hateful statements that have been made and we condemn them unequivocally,"" he said. ""We hope, however, that time and action, and the forgiving human spirit, will not result in the wholesale condemnation of an individual who we have otherwise known to be a decent person at core."" Sacco did not immediately respond to messages left by CNN. The tweet Sacco sent before she left Friday for Cape Town, South Africa, went viral and created a social media firestorm. The incident -- Boing Boing called it ""the tweet heard round the world"" -- was a glaring reminder that every word uttered on the Internet can be heard by seemingly everyone on the Internet, sometimes with serious consequences. Sacco was the head of corporate communications for IAC, the media company chaired by Barry Diller that operates websites such as The Daily Beast, About.com, CollegeHumor and Match.com. Her whole job revolved around communicating with reporters -- which made her Twitter comment about Africa all the more shocking. Sacco was in London and about to begin a long vacation in South Africa when she wrote the message. Her Twitter account was relatively obscure when she posted it -- fewer than 500 people were following it. But the message went viral on Friday, unbeknownst to Sacco, who apparently did not have Internet access on her flight. Websites such as Valleywag and Buzzfeed highlighted Sacco's account, and soon it had thousands of followers -- and thousands of harsh replies directed at it. Some were downright hateful. Others said they felt sorry for Sacco, regardless of how offensive her Twitter message was, because she hadn't had a chance to defend herself during the 12-hour flight. As Twitter observers parsed through her public posts, many were disturbed by her previous messages. (""I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night,"" she once wrote.) Her account was a laundry list of banal complaints about poor customer service and other apparent indignities. ""It seems she has left a trail of casual racism across social media on her various travels,"" Chris Taylor, a writer for Mashable, opined. Still, Taylor wrote, ""it was hard to ignore a disturbing feeling in the mob's response"" to the Twitter messages ""and something creepy in the trial by social media that was going on in her absence."" On Friday afternoon, with hours to go before she landed, another corporate communications representative for IAC issued a statement that tried to address the online controversy. ""This is an outrageous, offensive comment that does not reflect the views and values of IAC,"" the company said. ""Unfortunately, the employee in question is unreachable on an international flight, but this is a very serious matter and we are taking appropriate action."" The statement led many to believe that Sacco would be reprimanded or even terminated when she landed in South Africa. Parody accounts started to appear on Twitter and Facebook that portrayed Sacco as a mean, bitter person. On Friday evening a Twitter hashtag, #HasJustineLandedYet, became a running commentary about Sacco; some people observed that she'd have to put her crisis communications expertise to the test to save her own career. Meanwhile, other Twitter users started scoping out Sacco's past messages and flagged other questionable comments she'd made before, like this one: ""I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?"" All of those messages disappeared, though, early on Saturday, when someone -- presumably Sacco -- deleted her Twitter account. IAC had no immediate comment about how or why her account was removed. Some good does seem to have come out of the incident, at least. Advocates for AIDS relief set up websites to encourage donations; one of the sites read, ""The AIDS epidemic is bigger than a tweet from a person in PR. If we want real change, we need to think beyond Justine. Let's turn that anger into something tangible.""","PR executive no longer works for IAC .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Georgia Institute of Technology student Nicholas Selby is a force to be reckoned with. The sophomore is a Mechanical Engineering major, co-leads Team Solar Jackets -- Georgia Tech's team that built and raced a solar-powered car in the Formula Sun Grand Prix -- and is a president's scholar, representing the top 2% of enrolled students at the university. It's safe to say he must have a lot of energy -- and it appears to have been unleashed during his welcome speech Sunday to this year's freshman class. It started out like many other convocations. Faculty, staff and notable guests, including Selby -- dressed in a traditional black robe with his mortarboard perfectly perched upon his head -- addressed the new recruits: ""We chose Georgia Tech because we want to do the impossible."" But then, something unexpected started to unfold. Music from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" began as Selby quoted Sir Isaac Newton: ""If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" As the trumpets from the iconic movie theme song swelled, so did Selby's passion, with the cadence a drill sergeant would envy. ""Crush the shoulders of the giants upon whom we stand. We here are all such innovative people. So I am telling you: If you want to change the world, you're at Georgia Tech! You can do that! If you want to build the Iron Man suit, you're at Georgia Tech! You can do that! And if you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a bad ass, we're at Georgia Tech, we can do that! I am doing that!"" Selby breathlessly finished the speech with his arms raised in victory, to applause from the roughly 4,000 people in attendance -- some of whom seemed a little shell-shocked from his intensity. After a brief pause, Selby deadpanned with a smirk: ""Congratulations on your acceptance and brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer."" That last phrase was a reference to refrain of the school's famous fight song. Freshmen, wearing their traditional yellow caps slightly askew, appeared stunned; and they weren't the only ones. Video of the speech is going viral with over 340,000 hits since being posted Monday. Comments on the video range from poking fun at Selby's appearance -- ""Welcome to Hogwarts,"" a reference to Selby's Harry Potter-like appearance -- to enthusiasm. One person commented, ""I am 30 yrs old, I already went to college. I am married, I have a kid, and a full time job in New York... and after watching that, I just applied to Georgia Tech."" Another person felt the speech was so epic that becoming Selby's best friend feels possible ""Because I go to Georgia Tech!""","Sophomore's enthusiastic welcome speech stuns freshmen .

"(CNN) -- Ferrets could be making a comeback in the Big Apple. The furry, four-legged animal -- long absent from the city -- could weasel its way back into the hearts of New Yorkers based on a petition submitted to the Department of Health asking it to repeal the city's 15-year ban on ferrets as pets. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said Wednesday that it is considering an amendment to the Health Code. Ariel Jasper, a Brooklyn College master's student, said she drafted the petition in January because she has always loved ferrets and wants to correct the current Health Code, which she claims contains many inaccuracies about ferrets. ""I looked into the Health Code and I saw that they were labeled as wild, dangerous animals, and that confused me because ferrets have been domesticated for over 2,000 years,"" Jasper told CNN. ""They were actually domesticated before the cat,"" Jasper said. Owning a ferret is legal in 48 states, including in the remainder of New York state, she added. Jasper said that as part of her petition, she recommended mandatory rabies vaccinations for the animals, spaying and neutering, leash laws, as well as micro-chipping requirements so that they can be tracked if anyone gets rid of them. The city's ban on ferrets dates back to June 1999 under then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani. The Health Department said in its announcement that it would be irresponsible from a public safety perspective to allow a ferret to be kept as a pet in New York City, citing their unpredictable behavior and reports that they are prone to attacking humans. That same year, Giuliani had a famous dust-up with a ferret lover during his ""Live From City Hall"" radio show. ""There's something deranged about you,"" Giuliani said to caller and ferret advocate David Guthartz. ""The excessive concern that you have for ferrets is something you should examine with a therapist."" The Humane Society calls ferrets ""cute and inquisitive"" and lists them as belonging to a family of animals that includes weasels and minks -- not rodents. And the ASPCA has them on a list of species suitable as companion animals along with dogs, cats and birds. Mayor Michael Bloomberg upheld his predecessor's ferret ban, but current Mayor Bill de Blasio has not spoken about the issue. But he has already been labeled an animal lover by some after his efforts to remove Central Park carriage horses from their ""congested, urban setting."" CNN's attempts to reach de Blasio Wednesday went unanswered. ""I think there are more important things for the mayor to focus on,"" resident Shard Pierre told CNN. ""There's income distribution problems, rent problems, crime, bigger issues on the agenda than to worry about whether or not people are allowed to own ferrets."" ""I'm an animal lover so if the owner of these ferrets will give them a great life and great experience in this city then I'm all for it,"" resident Francisco Aliwalas said. ""But there greater things in the city that need to be addressed than little furry elongated creatures scurrying along hardwood floors of apartments."" The Health Department, led by de Blasio appointee Dr. Mary T. Bassett, said that a public hearing and comment period will be held in the fall, followed by a Board of Health vote. CNN's Haimy Assefa, Chris Welch, Adam Reiss and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","A ferret fan petitioned New York's Heath Department to reconsider ban on animal .

"(CNN) -- Just over 9 percent of the world's urban population lives in a megacity today. By 2025, the number of megacities with a population greater than 10 million will grow from 21 to 29 and account for 10.3 percent of the world's urban population, according to the United Nations. Here we highlight some of the world's megacities, such as the most populous: Tokyo in Japan, which, with 35.2 million inhabitants, has a larger population than Algeria, Canada or Uganda; and the rapidly expanding Shanghai, China's economic powerhouse, which is the world's biggest metropolitan area, covering 2,914 square kilometers. Megacities can bring not just wealth and employment but also cultural benefits, says the United Nations. And some megacities are more efficient than their less populous counterparts. While New York houses 2.7 percent of the U.S. population, New Yorkers only account for one percent of the country's CO2 emissions. However, the high density of people can generate problems, including health issues such as the rapid transmission of 'flu viruses and psychological problems caused by poverty and stress. But whatever we think of them, megacities are not only here to stay: They're growing. New Delhi, for example, is projected to have 29.49 million inhabitants by 2025, according to Demographia -- up from 20.99 million in 2010.","By 2025 10.3 percent of the world's urban population will live in megacities says the UN .

It's our drinking money later when we watch the World Cup games."" The social experiment is the brainchild of California real estate investor Jason Buzi, 43, who is hiding envelopes of cash in public places across the country and posting clues to their whereabouts on his Twitter page. What started as an anonymous act of giving in the San Francisco Bay area has turned into a nationwide search. Buzi revealed his identity on Monday in an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""I've done well and some of my friends that are involved with it have done very well as well, and we wanted to give back."" Buzi said. ""This was like a fun way to give back to the community."" The ""Hidden Cash"" craze has hit Brooklyn, Las Vegas and Houston, Buzi told CNN. Chicago is next on Sunday. The Twitter page features selfies of people who found the money -- typically smiling and holding the cash -- with testimonials of what they intend to do with it. ""We just want to encourage people to pay it forward,"" Buzi told CNN. Kurt Dee, who discovered an envelope with $50 and a a coin in Central Park, agreed. ""My family and I were really going to plan to get Father's Day dinner today because my dad's working tomorrow,"" he said. ""So I'm telling them I'm going to pay for dinner tonight, which is awesome."" Another winner, Stephanie Culff, held a $50 bill. ""Since its Father's Day, I'm gonna give this to my dad and he can use it as he wishes. Happy Father's Day,"" she said. People enjoy the excitement of the hunt. ""When you first see the white envelope on the ground and you know that it's out there, it's like your heart just completely stops and you're just like, 'Oh my god, I just won,'"" Dee said.

"(CNN) -- Five babies in El Paso, Texas, have tested positive for tuberculosis after being exposed to the infectious disease at a local hospital, the city's health department says. Providence Memorial Hospital has identified more than 850 infants and 43 health care workers who were potentially exposed after a nurse came to work with an active case of TB some time between September 2013 and August 2014. He or she worked with infants in the nursery and in the post-partum unit at the hospital. It's important to note, health officials said, that the babies who tested positive do not have active cases of TB. Four of them received the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine for TB that may be generating false positives. Still, all will be given treatment. ""I first of all want to apologize to the families that are affected by this, and let you know as CEO of Providence Memorial Hospital, I and my colleagues take absolutely ownership of our role in this,"" Eric Evans said at a news conference last week. ""I represent today over 3,000 dedicated co-workers who get up every day dedicated to helping others in their most vulnerable moments. They're a group of people that I'm very proud of, and they're all struggling with this happening in our facility. We're going to make this right."" 45 infants added to TB exposure list . The infected health care worker is no longer working and is receiving treatment, the owner of the hospital, Sierra Providence Health Network, said in a statement. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that generally causes coughing, chest pain and difficulty breathing, according to the Mayo Clinic. An estimated 2 billion people worldwide have what's called latent TB, where the bacteria remain dormant and don't cause symptoms. ""Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB,"" the El Paso Department of Public Health said in a statement. ""That is why it is so important to identify people who may have been exposed, screen them, and provide treatment."" The bacteria that cause TB spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, but it's not a highly contagious disease; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected, according to the Mayo Clinic. Only active TB can be spread. Patients with TB must take antibiotics for six to nine months. Some strains of TB are resistant to antibiotics, which makes them more dangerous. Without treatment, TB can be fatal, the Mayo Clinic says.","Five babies in El Paso, Texas, have tested positive for tuberculosis .

After filming the surprisingly successful ""21 Jump Street"" and reteaming for the June 13 follow-up, ""22 Jump Street,"" the two actors have put in countless hours filming and doing press for their projects, the kind of time that could strain any professional relationship. But as Tatum told CNN at the ""22 Jump Street"" premiere on Tuesday, these two got ""lucky."" ""It doesn't always work out like this,"" Tatum, 34, said. ""Sometimes you take a movie because you like someone's work, and then you get to work with them and you don't actually enjoy working with them. And we just got really lucky."" In the ""Jump Street"" movies, the pair play former high school foes who become friends after being partnered as police officers. The concept is a spin on the '80s TV series of the same name, and, like in the TV show, Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's Jenko are at first sent to work undercover in a high school. The resulting comedy, ""21 Jump Street,"" was released in March 2012 to critical praise and box office success, proving that Tatum could do more than just sub as a heartthrob. ""21 Jump Street"" was such a hit that it wasn't long before a sequel was announced, and by most accounts, ""22 Jump Street"" is just as funny as the first. What works so well in the film, which sees the pair's undercover cops head to work on a college campus, is what cements the duo's bond off-screen: a raunchy, daring sense of humor. For example, the ""X-rated"" bet that they made before the opening of ""21 Jump Street"" -- wherein Hill promised to ""kiss the tip"" of a certain part of Tatum's anatomy through his underwear if they reached $35 million that first weekend -- is exactly the kind of off-the-wall camaraderie that comes across on screen. ""For this kind of movie,"" Hill observed at the premiere, ""the friendship translates into what the movie's about, which is kind of rad.""

"(CNN) -- One of the three guns Adam Lanza used to kill 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a military-style semiautomatic rifle known as an AR-15. That surprised and shocked a lot of people unfamiliar with America's gun culture. They questioned why such weapons are available and why anyone would need them. ""Personally I don't know how any ordinary citizen can justify owning an automatic or semiautomatic gun,"" writes CNN commenter Mark Smerkanich. ""Can't we leave those guns to the trained military?"" Self-described gun owner Julie Jones-Hawkins comments, ""I ... fully support a ban on rapid-fire weapons. Any weapon that can take out an entire kindergarten class is a problem."" Here are five reasons many gun owners say they want military style rifles: . 'Some people play golf, others bowl. I shoot' ""Every month or so I take my guns out to the range and shoot. It's thrilling, exciting and a great way to vent,"" says Christopher L. Kirkman, a Florida-based military-style gun owner. Kirman was one of more than 100 gun enthusiasts who shared opinions on CNN iReport about owning firearms that would have been banned under the now-expired 1994 federal weapons ban. ""Sure, I could try to say that the reason I own these guns is self-defense, but the truth of the matter is that, although they will technically serve this purpose, they are not why I own them,"" he says. Michigan gun owner Ethan Daniels describes his enthusiasm for his rifle more succinctly, saying, ""I like to shoot, and that is one heck of a fun carbine to plink with."" iReport: Tell us why you own your military-style weapon . Background can factor into a gun owner's choice of weapon. ""The AR-15 is what I am used to from my extensive training as an airborne infantryman,"" writes Nathan Lee. ""Because of my training, it's what I feel the most comfortable with."" Another reason for these guns is hunting. The AR-15 is a ""good hunting platform. I've hunted coyote with it,"" says CNN iReporter MVR155, who owns two of the weapons. He asked to remain anonymous. Owners of military-style rifles also use them to hunt deer and other game. But some states have banned the AR-15 and its .223 caliber for deer hunting. Related: Newtown shooter's guns: What we know . 'It's cool' It may not be the best or most important reason, but military-style weapons often appeal to the enthusiast side of the American gun owner. Just like many car lovers who dream of owning a Lamborghini, many gun owners get excited about the idea of owning an AR-15. ""There are people who buy certain types of firearms because they have a certain image -- the AR-15 is one of them,"" says Austin Nikel, a former AR-15 owner in Boulder, Colorado. ""One thing about this country is how Hollywood has glorified the image behind those certain types of weapons. A lot of guys grow up with GI Joe, and that image is extremely attractive. It grabs you and affects you. ""A lot of people buy the AR-15 because, well, it's cool."" Apparently it wasn't cool enough for Nikel to hold on to. He ended up selling his AR-15 to his father. iReport: Why some own military-style weapons . 'A part of history' ""Since coming of age -- and in the decades since -- I have collected many different firearms, some of them historical pieces, some for sport, some of them even the so-called 'assault weapons' that are now a controversy,"" says iReporter Hrothgar01. ""Guns like these are as much a part of the history of this country as the muskets carried by pioneers, the rifles toted by doughboys in the trenches, and the other arms that have served and protected throughout the years. To hold one in your hands, appreciate its history and design, and to be able to take that piece of history to the range and work -- it is a feeling that many people in this debate do not understand or appreciate."" Related story: By the numbers: Guns in America . 'Protecting my family' ""I believe the foremost person responsible for protecting my family and myself is me,"" writes iReporter ShortyDoowap, who owns a pair of AR-15s. ""These rifles provide me with the tools to perform that duty. I don't own these guns to target shoot, though I do that with them. I don't hunt with them, though I could in a pinch."" Parks says he ""would not hesitate to use one to simply defend my home and family from a single intruder if it became necessary."" Related: Parents defend right to keep guns in the home . In some home-protection situations, fans say military-style rifles are generally more accurate than handguns. Rifles are generally easier to learn how to shoot, say military-style rifle owners. Like most firearms, military-style weapons such as the AR-15 are semiautomatic -- increasing protection because the shooter can fire off many shots without having to manually chamber a new bullet. With a bolt-action rifle or pump-action shotgun, firing multiple shots takes more time. ""When you weigh it all out, these types of guns are stigmatized,"" says iReporter MVR155. Military-style weapons look more dangerous than other guns, he says, but really, there are many weapons available which are just as lethal, but which are not designed in a military style. iReport: One gun owner's solution . 'Fascination with the Second Amendment' ""I am a proud owner of an AK-47,"" writes iReporter INGunOwner. ""It's a terrific gun. Lots of fun to shoot. I own an AK because of my fascination with the Second Amendment, which I view as a backstop protector of freedom. Many people would argue that we have no use for it today because the government is trustworthy. ""However since it acts as a deterrent, we can never measure exactly how much it has been effective. Perhaps the notion that people feel safe with our government after over 200 years is a testament to the Second Amendment value in balancing power with the citizens.""

"(CNN) -- Some say it's funny, some call it creepy. Either way, a new Old Spice commercial dubbed ""Momsong"" has the Internet buzzing. The commercial, part of a series called ""Smellcome To Manhood,"" promotes a new line of Old Spice body sprays. The sprays, according to the ad, quickly turns teenage boys into men -- something that a group of moms in the commercial apparently aren't ready to come to terms with. One mom is seen hiding behind the door in her son's bedroom as she sadly sings about her boy quickly becoming a man after using Old Spice. The song is picked up by other moms as they spy on their sons hanging out with girls. The ad rocketed to viral status on Sunday when it was shown at commercial breaks during the NFL playoff games. Within a day, the term ""Old Spice"" was tweeted over 50,000 times, according to social analytics company, Topsy, and the video has had more than 1 million views since it was posted a few days ago. Reaction on Twitter was fast and furious. This isn't the first viral commercial for the brand. A series of commercials featuring pitchman Terry Crews won the internet's heart a few years ago with his pectoral flexes and ear shattering screams. ""Momsong"" may be just the beginning for Old Spice's new campaign. The company's YouTube page features two other new ""Smellcome to Manhood"" commercials in the vein of ""Momsong."" We will just have to wait to see what they have in store for the upcoming Super Bowl, an event known to feature bizarre commercials.","The commercial is part of series to promote Old Spice body sprays .

"(CNN) -- A couple with fish bowls instead of heads. A magician who can make cards fly in a perfect spiral. These images have to be real, our brains tell us. That's the amazing thing about photography, says Ronen Goldman: If the light falls on the object just the right way, if the shadows line up naturally, our brains allow us to believe the unbelievable. It's the guiding concept that drives 32-year-old Goldman, a conceptual photographer in Tel Aviv, Israel, who has been recreating his dream fragments in a six-year series called The ""Surrealistic Pillow"" Project. The project has appeared in the Affordable Art Fair in several cities. Goldman considers himself more of a photographer than a manipulator. He shoots all the elements of his photos on location at the same time under the same lighting to achieve the best optic effects. He then uses Adobe's Photoshop editing program to layer the images together and mask objects as needed to create the illusions. Analyzing the dream and figuring out how to execute the vision in the real world takes much longer than the photo editing, though that part of the process can also take many days, he says. ""Surrealism in my view is not simply Photoshop or photographic technique,"" he says. ""The most important in my mind is the intention, or the concept you want to convey. It's not about levitation or multiplication of objects -- those are just tools I happen to use to convey deeper concepts I find to be interesting."" Sharing his work and deconstructing it for other photographers is a key part of his art. Goldman, who studied script writing at Tel Aviv University, learned about photography while on reserve duty for the Israeli army. Art photography: When 'reality isn't good enough' ""Most of what I know today I learned from Internet resources, starting from shutter speeds and apertures, basic functions of the camera, to composition and Photoshop techniques. I bought my first camera and lens with the help from a guy I have never met,"" he said. ""I basically look at hundreds of photos every day from around the world and try to learn what I like."" Goldman uses his blog to take the audience behind the scenes of his photos, deconstructing the image or explaining where the props came from. He made a music video from the shoot where a woman is lying on a bed surrounded by iguanas, one of his favorite images from the series. That one, which represents a fear of relationships, was shot in his bedroom in Tel Aviv. There was actually only one iguana, and the girl really is in bed with the lizard. ""I did all the lighting preparation beforehand and we just went along and placed the iguana on different spots on the bed. It started moving and that was kind of scary for her, but it was fine, and he got very relaxed afterward,"" Goldman said. ""Then I layered those photos, like 30 different layers, and made that image."" This week Goldman posted a batch of his photos on Reddit, the social news site where members create and run their own forums on topics of their choice and user clicks determine the popularity of posts. He agreed to post them on CNN iReport. The surreal photos were a hit on Reddit -- his link made it onto the site's front page -- and Goldman stayed up all night answering questions about where his ideas come from, how he remembers them, and his techniques for composing certain images. What the brain draws from: Art and neuroscience . Some photos, like his depiction of a woman lying upside down on a staircase, and a man rappelling down the wall, require little editing -- just creative angles and a discretely positioned step-stool, he explained. ""I don't love telling everything, just for the reason of the effect on people -- like when a magician does something, you really don't want to know -- but if it helps an actual photographer to go out and do cool stuff, I'm for it,"" he says. ""It's not like it's a big secret about what I'm doing."" Want to try? Ronen Goldman has an assignment for you: . Take a photo of yourself using one element you can recall from a dream, using any type of camera or phone. The photo needs to tell the story of the dream, or part of it. In the caption, write what you remember from the dream. ""If you don't like the result, do it again until you do,"" Goldman says. ""Be prepared for the possibility of it being misunderstood or deemed a failure. It might just turn out to be the best thing you have ever done, and interest a whole bunch of people."" Upload your photo to CNN iReport and it could be featured on CNN.com.","Photographer Ronen Goldman recreates his dreams through photos .

"(CNN) -- It sounds like the plot of a Hollywood movie: An eccentric millionaire creates a sperm bank with donations from only extraordinary men -- Nobel laureates, an Olympic athlete and geniuses with off-the-chart IQs. The mission? To create a generation of smarter, healthier, more productive members of society . But this was no movie plot. This actually happened. Robert K. Graham -- a businessman who made his fortune after inventing shatterproof eyeglasses -- founded the Repository for Germinal Choice in 1980. It operated until 1999, two years after his death. Graham was very clear about his motives: He wanted to improve the human gene pool. ""The better the human gene pool, the better the individuals who will come out of it,"" Graham said. ""And the poorer the human gene pool, the more useless and detrimental individuals will come out of it."" Not surprisingly, the so-called ""Nobel Prize sperm bank"" attracted controversy and accusations that Graham was a racist, resurrecting the ideas that gave rise to Nazi Germany -- something he denied. On Sunday, some of the men and women who were born as a result of Graham's project reveal how their lives have evolved on this week's episode of ""This is Life with Lisa Ling."" Here are some interesting facts about the Repository for Germinal Choice: . It didn't cost that much . Women who applied for Graham's genius sperm only had to come up a $50 application fee and $10 a month for storage and shipping costs, according to a 1984 New York Times article on the sperm bank. The moms didn't have to be geniuses . They had to be married (although there was an exception made for at least one single mother), but the mothers did not have to take an IQ test or go through any genetic screening. Donors were recruited on college campuses . Julianna McKillop, who worked for the repository from 1980 to 1985, recalls traveling up and down the West Coast visiting elite college campuses looking for sperm donors. ""I'd take the tanks of liquid nitrogen in Dr. Graham's Cadillac and drive up to CalTech and talk to the students (and professors),"" she told Lisa Ling. If someone was willing, she provided him a cup and some private time. She'd store the donation in the back of the Cadillac with the liquid nitrogen. ""Can you imagine doing that? It wasn't easy to get a donor, they'd kind of go like, 'Why are you in my office?' And I said, 'Well you have some genetic material and there's some people out there that can use that, they would like to have a child.'"" All the donors were white . While most of the donors remain anonymous, Graham did acknowledge that they were all white, according to David Plotz, author of ""The Genius Factory: The Curious History of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank."" But Graham strongly denied that he was a racist or a Nazi. ""We aren't thinking of a superrace,"" Graham said at a 1980 news conference, according to Plotz's book. ""We are thinking in terms of a few more creative, intelligent people who otherwise might not be born."" The sperm bank produced some 215 children -- and many lead quite ordinary lives today . Most of the progeny of the ""genius sperm bank"" who have spoken publicly say they did quite well in school. Today, as adults, many seem to be pretty ordinary: Tom runs a roofing business, Leandra is an opera singer, Courtney is a dancer, Logan has a form of autism. And several claim to feel pressure to do something extraordinary with their lives. As Tom puts it, ""I have to do something with the gifts that I've been given."" But Adrienne -- mother of Leandra, Courtney, and Logan -- says having ""genius sperm"" is no guarantee for happiness and success. ""There's only so much you can control when it comes to genetics,"" she says. ""It all has to do with what you give to your family."" Graham paved the way for how many sperm banks operate today . Despite all the criticism, Graham paved the way for couples to have more of a choice in determining their sperm donors -- something that is commonplace today, as more and more men and women seek fertility treatment. At the Fairfax Cryobank, less than 1% of the men who apply to be donors actually become active donors, according to lab director Michelle Ottey. ""It's a rigorous screening process, which is a good thing because we want really high-quality guys in the program,"" she explained. ""Statistically it's easier to get into an Ivy League school than it is to get into the Fairfax donor program.""","The Repository for Germinal Choice was an elite sperm bank that closed in 1999 .

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old girl died after a haunted hayride flipped over in Maine, police said Sunday. The teen was airlifted to a hospital after the accident Saturday night, Central Maine Medical Center spokesman Chuck Gill said. More than 20 other people were injured, CNN affiliate WMTW reported. The accident happened during what's called The Gauntlet, a spooky hayride through forest that includes ""things that jump and scream in the night."" The activity is part of Pumpkin Land, a venue featuring a variety of Halloween-themed activities in Mechanic Falls, about 30 miles north of Portland. The 17-year-old who died was on the ride with other students from Messalonskee High School in Oakland, Maine, according to WMTW. Investigators say they think a mechanical problem prevented a Jeep that was towing a tractor-trailer from stopping, WMTW reported, citing the state fire marshal's office. The Jeep went off the road, careened down a hill and slammed into a tree in a heavily wooded area around 8:30 p.m. Saturday, the CNN affiliate said. Authorities have impounded the Jeep and are investigating what caused the crash.

"(CNN) -- A non-contagious, fungal form of meningitis has sickened 26 people in five states, killing four, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday. Five additional cases were reported in Tennessee, health officials said Tuesday. The total number of cases in that state is 18. Three cases have been reported in Virginia, two each in Florida and Maryland and one in North Carolina, the CDC said. Two people have died in Tennessee, one in Virginia and one in Maryland. All of those infected had received steroid injections to the spine. Tennessee: Meningitis outbreak investigated . The Tennessee victims range in age from 49 to 89, state Health Commissioner Dr. John Dreyzehner said Wednesday. Department spokesman Woody McMillin said Tuesday 11 patients were hospitalized. ""The prime suspect for this outbreak is methylprednisolone acetate,"" Dreyzehner said Wednesday. Methylprednisolone acetate is an injectible steroid product used to treat pain and inflammation. Food and Drug Administration officials identified the manufacturer as New England Compounding Center (NECC), which conducted a voluntary recall of three lots of methylprednisolone acetate 80mg/mlinjection produced at NECC. The lot numbers are #05212012@68, #06292012@26 and #08102012@51. The FDA continues to work with state health departments and the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy to investigate the scope and cause of the outbreak of the fungal meningitis, according to FDA spokesperson Erica Jefferson. ""We expect to see more cases,"" Dreyzehner said, noting the infection can take up to 28 days to develop. Three pain treatment centers in Tennessee received the steroids that were part of the three recalled lots, officials said. They are the Specialty Surgery Center in Crossville, Tennessee; the PCA Pain Care Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and the St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in Nashville. Biopsies from two patients are consistent with the aspergillus fungus found in another patient, according to Dreyzehner, but he was careful to note that the findings need to be confirmed by the CDC. The investigation is ongoing and evolving, he said. ""Though we are closer to identifying the cause, we have not concluded there is one factor at this time."" The investigation is also looking at anesthetic or the antiseptic as possible causes of infection, he said. The dates of the investigation have also been widened, and now include patients treated between July 1 and September 20. ""We are casting a wider net as a precaution,"" Dreyzehner said. The Nashville facility contacted 737 patients who had lumbar epidural steroid injections between July 30 and September 20, health officials said previously. What is meningitis? The facility was temporarily closed on September 20 and will remain closed until investigating authorities ""are confident the current concerns have been resolved,"" the health department said. Between 100 and 200 patients at the Crossville facility may have been exposed or put at risk because of lumbar injections during the same time period, according to McMillin. No cases have been identified from the Oak Ridge facility, Dreyzehner said. Meningitis is a general term for swelling of the protective membranes that cover the brain and spine. The swelling is typically caused by an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungus, although meningitis also be caused by injury, cancer or medications. For this type of meningitis, symptoms include worsening to severe headache, nausea, dizziness and fever, Dreyzehner said. Other symptoms can include slurred speech, unsteady gait, urinary retention, weakness and sensory deficit. 6 places germs breed .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to the scary stalkability we've all given ourselves on the 'net, ""Whatever happened to him/her?"" has all but toppled out of our dialogue. If a shadow of the past flits across your mind, and you have an idle moment, say, in the dentist's office amid the smell of plastic and the squeal of drills, you pull out your smartphone, perform a search (heck, with the Google app you just hold it up to your mouth and mumble a few relevant words of caveman speak), and ... voila! Mystery solved. The trickiness, though, crops up when you decide to actually contact one of these people. I'm not talking about the former seventh-grade lab partner you idly friended thanks to a ""People You May Know"" tip-off. No, I speak of the former relations you truly want to reintroduce to your life -- or at least to catch up with in earnest. We're talking about the people whom, years ago, you'd jump through all sorts of hoops to reach -- calling up a mutual friend, asking said friend to sift through their well-thumbed Rolodex for your long lost friend's number, copying it down and then (gasp!) calling, unexpectedly, to get back in touch. About 70% of people have used the web for re-knotting old ties, according to a survey from Pew Research Center. You only get one chance to make a second impression. Behold, a few tips for blissful e-reunions with the following bygone buds. An Old BFF . You and Candy Sue used to be so close ... braiding each other's hair at sleepovers, giggling over prank calls to classmates and teachers, sharing a packed hotel room on that bizarre high school band trip to Orlando when Candy Sue's boyfriend got in major trouble for the incident involving cough syrup and late-night shenanigans. But, anyway! If you aren't already Facebook-ed-ly connected with an old pal, sending a request with a sweet note about how you'd love to catch up is a good bet. That way, when he or she accepts, you can get a life snapshot in a two-minute perusal of his or her profile, and have a million pleasant questions at the ready for your eventual long-awaited phone call or coffee date. If you're already FB official but haven't spoken in years, pluck her address off the site and send a legit e-mail. The extra step makes your query feel more genuine and less ""I came across your face and am on a boring date, busying myself with my iPhone while this bozo waits in line for the bathroom."" A Business Buddy . Reaching into your past for professional reasons? It wouldn't be awkward if you'd kept it up with the (yes, admittedly exhausting) rigamarole of real-life networking -- exchanging occasional e-mails, breaking bread together now and then, sending a pleasant nondenominational holiday card in December, etc. As it is, though, we all lose touch with the occasional stellar colleague, and rebuilding the bridge needn't feel like a slimy attempt to use the old contact (to mix metaphors galore). Check out your old work friend's LinkedIn profile; if it says he'd like to be contacted for ""getting back in touch,"" then congratulations, he's asking for it. A simple LinkedIn connection is fine if you want a passive, place-holding relationship, but if you really want to move things back into the real world, a polite, professional e-mail will do. If you don't hear back right away, wait at least three or four weeks and patiently follow up. This year, corporate e-mail users will send and receive an average of 192 e-mails per day, according to research firm Radicati, so don't take it personally if yours take a few (spaced out) tries to find solid ground. Eventually, your understated guilt trip will pay off in spades -- or at least in a comped business lunch. An Ex . Let's talk intentions real quick: If you're contacting your former flame because you're (a) bored and hoping he/she might stupidly hook up with you again or (b) with a new partner and hoping some casual chatting will lead to an opportunity to gloat ... gross.  Get over yourself. If you really do feel like it'd be pleasant to hear from that cool girl/guy you dated before you moved and split amiably, well, OK then. (This bears repeating, though: We've heard from our fair share of readers who are freaked out by an ex's insistence on staying in their lives, so tread lightly). E-mail is your best option by far. (I guess a phone call could also work, but this is a column about social networking.) Yes, you might even have to go so far as asking a mutual friend for an e-mail address. Don't pour your heart out in an initial missive; just say hello, non-creepily explain why they've been on your mind, and see if they respond. See, e-mail is noninvasive and its reach is finite; a Facebook friend request begs for a long-term commitment, whereby you'll be popping up in each other's news feeds for years to come, until one of you severs the ties that bind a second time. And isn't a fear of commitment what splintered your young love in the first place? Worse still is following an ex on Twitter, particularly if he or she has unprotected tweets. After the way-out-of-left-field ""YOUR EX is following you on Twitter"" e-mail, he's left picturing you reading his bi-hourly updates, catching constant glimpses into his life. And blocking you isn't really an option, since the rest of the WWW is free to read his tweets at will. That's the funny thing about the web: We love imagining that our friends and interested strangers are eating up our every word; we also like to pretend that privacy will magically settle in a veil over the random unsavory characters of our past and present. Neither thing is true, but the only way to figure out which camp your target will put you in is to stick out your hand and hope it gets a friendly shake back.","About 70% of people have used the web for reknotting old ties .

"(CNN) -- For 17 years, Ted Kaczynski meticulously prepared his instruments of death from a cabin on a remote piece of property in western Montana. The former math professor eschewed modern comforts, like electricity or water, in the small wooden building where he made the mail bombs that would make him infamous. He also drew up an angry 35,000-word anti-technology manifesto. The ""Unabomber"" killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of attacks from 1978 to 1995. The cabin is long gone, housed in the Newseum in Washington, D.C. Kaczynski, 68, is long gone, too. He is serving a life sentence at a federal supermax prison in Colorado. All that's left in Lincoln, Montana, are the notoriety for about 1,500 townspeople and the 1.4 acres Kaczynski once owned a few miles south of town. Now the property is for sale, recently reduced from $154,500 to $69,500. ""It's very secluded. Hardly any one goes up there,"" says John Pistelak, who runs a realty company in town and is handling the sale. ""I've had all kinds of calls."" The land is much quieter than it was in the weeks after the arrest as agents scoured it for clues into the Unabomber's diabolic plans and anger. A few bottles and the remains of a root cellar are still evident, according to Pistelak. A real estate brochure reads, ""Own a Piece of U.S. History: Home of the Unabomber."" It also touts the plot's proximity to wilderness areas and ""great fishing and hunting."" Read the real estate brochure . Pistelak acknowledges the land normally would go for no more than $50,000. But this wooded patch of land, which is being sold by a friend of his, is different, Pistelak says. ""With the history, it's got to be worth something,"" he said. Wendy Gehring, who knew Kaczynski and was a neighbor, said she doesn't buy the man's reputation as a naturalist. ""I have nothing good to say about him,"" she told CNN Saturday, saying he looked down on her because she is a woman. ""The town doesn't really give a rat's ass about Ted Kaczynski."" Gehring and her husband, Clifford, operate a lumber business and saw mill. Kaczynski complained about the noise and said it disturbed his peace, Gehring said. For a while, the Unabomber lived a hermit's life, later emerging to ride his bicycle to town. ""We thought he was D.B. Cooper,"" said Gehring, referring to the famous hijacker who disappeared after parachuting from a flight, likely over Washington state, in 1971. Clifford Gehring identified Kaczynski when agents made the April 1996 arrest on the property. It has not been inhabited since the arrest. A prospective buyer could run power on the property from a few lots down, Pistelak told CNN Saturday. Kaczynski quit a tenure-track position at the University of California-Berkeley in 1969 and, soon after, he and a brother built the shack. Federal agents gave the case the code name ""Unabom"" because universities and airlines were the early targets. Along with the deaths and injuries he inflicted, Kaczynski threatened to blow up airplanes, and placed a bomb on one flight in 1979, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing when a fire broke out in the cargo hold. Agents closed in after his brother noted similarities between his old letters and journals and the bomber's manifesto. Some areas on the property are surrounded by chain-link fences, vestiges of the federal investigation. Interestingly, Pistelak says, there are no gates in the fences. In 1999, Kaczynski told Time magazine he ""would rather get the death penalty than spend the rest of my life in prison."" In an interview at the federal prison in Florence, Colorado, he also said he is sane. ""I don't get delusions and so on and so forth. I mean, I had very serious problems with social adjustment in adolescence, and a lot of people would call this a sickness. But it would have to be distinguished between an organic illness, like schizophrenia or something like that."" Kaczynski said he pleaded guilty in 1998 only to stop his lawyers from arguing that he was a paranoid schizophrenic, as court-appointed psychiatrists had diagnosed. Kaczynski wrote a book, ""Truth Versus Lies."" In it, he said his brother's decision to turn him in was a way of settling a sibling rivalry. His brother was jealous ""over the fact that our parents valued me more highly."" In the Unabomber Manifesto, Kaczynski claimed a moral high ground for his bombing campaign, justifying the attacks in the name of preserving humanity and nature from the relentless onslaught of technology and exploitation. But in his journals, the government said, Kaczynski scoffed at environmental ideals. The journals, found by FBI investigators in his Montana mountain cabin, revealed a cynical, apparently sexually confused killer who delighted in his deadly explosions and cared little for the outside world. ""I believe in nothing,"" Kaczynski wrote. ""I don't even believe in the cult of nature-worshipers or wilderness-worshipers. (I am perfectly ready to litter in parts of the woods that are of no use to me -- I often throw cans in logged-over areas.)"" Of his killings, Kaczynski wrote: ""My motive for doing what I am going to do is simply personal revenge."" The Unabomber got no sympathy from victims and their families. Susan Mosser, who lost her husband in a Unabomber attack, urged the federal judge to ""make the sentence bullet-proof, or bomb-proof, lock him so far down that when he does die, he'll be closer to hell. That's where the devil belongs.""","Property formerly owned by Ted Kaczynski is for sale in Montana .

"(CNN) -- Legs covered in skin-toned stockings, her skirt crisp to the knee, Patty Davis slips on the black heels she has shined for the day. ""Got to look good in the Lord's house,"" she says as she spritzes her neck with White Diamonds perfume and exits her black Lincoln Town Car. Davis, 46, of Union City, Georgia, has attended African Methodist Episcopal churches since before she could crawl. She sits proudly in the pew every Sunday for service and is among the first to arrive for bible study each Wednesday. She moves swiftly, with confidence, a weathered Bible clutched in her right hand, the day's passages dog-eared and highlighted. She's the type of woman who can recite scriptures with ease, her love of faith evident in her speech. ""Every day is a blessed day for me,"" she says. ""Jesus is the No. 1 man in my life and any man who wants me must seek me through Him."" The unmarried Georgia native is a committed follower of the Christian faith, striving to live and breathe the gospel in her daily life. Yet, according to relationship advice columnist Deborrah Cooper, it is this devout style of belief and attachment to the black church that is keeping black women like Davis -- single and lonely. Clinging to the gospel . Cooper, a writer for the San Francisco Examiner, recently made claims on her blog SurvivingDating.com that predominantly black protestant churches, such as African Methodists, Pentecostal, and certain denominations of Evangelical and Baptist churches are the main reason black women are single. Cooper, who is black and says she is not strictly religious, argues that rigid beliefs constructed by the black church are blinding black women in their search for love. In raising the issue, Cooper ignited a public conversation about a topic that is increasingly getting attention in the black community and beyond. Oprah Winfrey, among others, recently hosted a show about single black women and relationships after a Yale University study found that 42 percent of African-American women in the United States were unmarried. Big Miller Grove Missionary Baptist Church, a predominately African-American Baptist church in Atlanta, is holding a seminar on the question of faith's role in marital status on August 20. ""Black women are interpreting the scriptures too literally. They want a man to which they are 'equally yoked' -- a man that goes to church five times a week and every Sunday just like they do,"" Cooper said in a recent interview. ""If they meet a black man that is not in church, they are automatically eliminated as a potential suitor. This is just limiting their dating pool."" The traditional structure and dynamics of black churches, mostly led by black men, convey submissive attitudes to women, Cooper says, encouraging them to be patient -- instead of getting up and going after what they want. Nearly ninety percent of African-Americans express ""certain belief in God"" and 55 percent say they ""interpret scripture literally,"" according to the 2009 Pew Research Center study ""A Religious Portrait of African-Americans."" Dr. Boyce Watkins, a professor at Syracuse University and advocate for African-American issues, responded to Cooper's article online. Though he applauded Cooper's courage to voice her opinion , he agreed -- and disagreed -- with her. ""I don't think the church keeps black women single,"" Watkins says. ""But I do agree that some black churches teach women that they must only date a man that goes to church regularly."" Watkins, who is African-American and whose father is a Southern Baptist minister, described his interactions with southern women who are devout churchgoers. ""I am a male and I know that I will treat a woman well, but I have been rejected many times because I don't thump a bible with me everywhere that I go."" All in the numbers . One of biggest reasons black women are single, Cooper says, is because of a lack of black men in the church. According to the PEW study, ""African-American men are significantly more likely than women to be unaffiliated with any religion (16 percent vs. 9 percent). Nearly one-in-five men say they have no formal religious affiliation."" Watkins believes the social structure of the church keeps black men from attending. ""Those appealing, high-testosterone guys have a hard time getting into the 'Follow the leader, give me your money, and listen to what I have to say' attitude."" ""Many of us have a difficult time submitting to the pastor who is just another man."" The male pastor, Cooper says, is the ""alpha male"" for many black women. Over-reverence for the pastor - or any religious figure for that matter - creates barriers for the black man, she says, because he feels like he must compete for the No. 1 spot in a black woman's heart. ""It doesn't make you more attractive if your life is filled with these 'other' men,"" Cooper says. ""If they feel like they have to compete, you are not going to be interesting because you're not feeding his ego in the way it needs to be fed."" Mark K. Forston, son of a black preacher in Forest Park, Georgia, says some black women ""put their pastor on this pedestal and have a large amount of faith in him because he is a living source of salvation."" Sometimes women even focus their romantic feelings on the pastor, says Forston. ""Regardless if he's married or not, sometimes human desires will transcend beyond certain parameters and that's dangerous territory. Pastors are humans just like anybody else."" The Rev. Renita J. Weems, a bible scholar who holds a degree in theology from Princeton, strongly disagrees with Cooper about why many black women remain single and says she is reinforcing one message: ""It's the black woman's fault."" ""To claim that women are sitting in their chair getting heated about watching their preacher strut across the pulpit is illogical,"" Weems says. ""The black church is not a Sunday morning sex drama."" Weems, who is African-American and has written several books on women's spirituality, has her own criticisms of the black church. The literal interpretation of certain scriptures can lead to subjugating women, Weems says. However, positive scripture messages, about love and justice, do exist and can be used to empower women rather than keep them ""single and lonely."" Weems says Cooper fails to examine deeper threads. ""What the black church does and what religion does is helps you create core values for your life and allows you to see what you appreciate in others. ""The reason why black women who go to black churches are not married is because they are looking for certain values in a man,"" Weems says. ""It is not the church that keeps them single, but the simple fact that good values are lacking in some of our men."" Choose or lose the church . Cooper says her goal is to empower black women. If their strategy for meeting men is failing, Cooper offers two suggestions: Find another church or leave-and go where the boys go: tailgates, bars and clubs. ""Black women need to open their eyes. You want to know the reason why the black man isn't in church? Because he left church to go to the Sunday football game,"" Cooper says. ""Going to these sites is discouraged in the black church because these places are seen as places where 'sin dwells.' But if women are compassionate, as the bible preaches they should be, then they need to be more open about the men they choose to date and where they might meet them."" ""I'm not against religion, or against the church, I'm against women limiting their choices and putting themselves in a box because they do what their church tells them to do,"" Cooper says. Weems disagrees. ""Telling black women that they should spend their two hours on Sunday elsewhere and drive them away to go to the bar to find a date is not helpful to our communities."" ""Black women are the backbones of their community and without them a lot of charitable work would not get done, social justice on the ground would be diminished and outreach to poor people would be severed."" Patty Davis, the long time churchgoer in Georgia, says all the arguments over what the church preaches miss the point. What truly matters, she says, are women's motives. ""The real question is: What are you coming to church for?"" she says. ""To feed your spirit? Or your carnal desires?"" The church's effect on the romantic lives of black women cannot be gleaned from a mathematical equation or a select bible passage, Davis says. ""It is a woman's own actions and decisions that will determine the outcome of her love life, not the church's,"" Davis says. ""Because the last time I checked, the church ain't no dating service.""","Dating advice columnist Deborah Cooper: Black church keeps black women single .

"(CNN) -- Bored of diving among the usual coral reefs and tropical fish? Looking for something a little out of the ordinary? Ever thought about diving in a crack between two continents in some of the clearest water on Earth? Or what about swimming up to an active volcano? Perhaps underwater art is more your thing? If so, take a look at some of the most unusual, mysterious and awe-inspiring underwater landscapes from around the world. Continental rift in Iceland . The only place in the world where you can swim between two continents, the Silfra fissure in Iceland's Thingvellier National Park is where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. Not only can you dive in a crack in the earth caused by the two continental plates slowly moving away from each other (at an average of 2 cm a year), the waters are so clear that many divers are said to lose all sense of depth and even experience vertigo. The water's extreme clarity is thanks to year-round cold temperatures of around two to four degrees Celsius and the water's purity. The water originates from a glacier high on Iceland's Hofsjokull Mountain and is filtered through layers of porous lava rock before reaching the national park. Not only is it cold and clear, the water is so pure it is safe enough to drink. The three sections of the dive include Silfra Hall, the Cathedral and Silfra lagoon. Mysterious ruins in Japan . A long-lost civilization, the work of aliens or simply a natural wonder? The mysterious underwater ruins of Yonaguni continue to lure the most intrepid of divers. Located in the Yaeyama Islands off the westernmost point of Japan, the tiny island of Yonaguni is remote and difficult to reach. But it remains popular thanks to the archaeological riddle submerged off its southern coast. Exactly how the underwater pyramid structure, known as the Yonaguni monument, was formed is still under debate. Some claim the ruins to be evidence of a long lost city, while others are convinced it is a geological phenomenon. There are even a few who believe the site to be the work of architecturally-ambitious aliens. Whatever its origin, it's an impressive site. Estimated to be between 5,000 and 8,000 years old, the stepped structures -- with smooth platform steps and right angles -- appear as though they were carved out of the rock. This is not a diving site for beginners, with the ruins located in open waters with high waves and strong currents. Volcanic action in Indonesia . Want to see a volcano up close without the threat of lava flows and toxic air? If so, the submerged volcano of Banua Wuhu is the place to head. Located beside the island of Mahangetan, part of the volcanic island chain of Sangihe in Indonesia, Banua Wuha rises more than 400 meters from the sea floor and is less than five meters below the water's surface. There is no risk from lava -- instead, the underwater volcano releases ribbons of silver bubbles -- sulfur gas -- escaping deep from inside the earth's crust. ""The bubbles can burn your fingers if you're not careful,"" said Roman Szalay, managing director of Ocean Rover Cruises, which charters one of the few boats that makes the journey to the volcano. ""If you bring (the gas) up in a bottle to the surface it smells horrible, but if the bubbles come up to the surface it smells like nothing,"" he added. The further you descend, the volcano's barren sulfur-covered rocks give way to coral reefs and an extraordinary display of marine life, including huge barrel sponges, black tipped reef sharks and schools of neon fusiliers. ""If the sky is cloudy and the sun is not bright, the atmosphere is quite mystic"" said Szalay, ""Sometime you can also hear the roaring of the volcano."" Underwater art in Mexico . Want a bit of culture on your next dive? Then try the tropical blue waters of Cancun, Mexico where you will find the Museum of Underwater Modern Art. Consisting of more than 403 permanent life-sized sculptures, the art-filled sea-bed is one of the largest artificial reef attractions in the world. The work of British sculptor and scuba diver Jason deCaires Taylor, each sculpture is individually cast and made using a special cement mix to encourage coral growth. ""It's incredibly interesting working underwater,"" said deCaires Taylor. ""The colors are different, the light patterns are very different, the atmosphere and mood is otherworldly. ""The piece takes on a very different tone underwater -- it has a lost feel to it and brings up all these questions that you wouldn't have on land,"" he continued. Underwater cemetery in the U.S. A little over five kilometers off the coast of Miami, Florida, is an altogether different, and slightly creepy, diving experience -- an artificial reef that doubles as a cemetery. The Neptune Memorial Reef, with its tagline ""creating life after life,"" is a man-made reef, built to encourage the growth of marine life while creating ""the ultimate 'Green Burial' opportunity."" People who choose the reef as their final resting place are first cremated. Their remains are then mixed with non-porous cement, sand and water, and molded into a stone shape of their choosing, such as a shell or starfish. The stone is then added to the reef by scuba divers. The first phase of the memorial has been built in the style of a ""classical re-creation of the Lost City."" Relatives of the deceased, curious scuba-divers and marine biologists are among those who dive among the coral-encrusted arches and statues of lions that line the sea floor. When completed, the memorial will cover have the capacity to hold the cremated remains of around 100,000 people.","In Iceland you can dive in the crack between two continents .

"(CNN) -- Immigrants in Illinois without a valid visa or green card could soon carry one form of state-issued documentation -- a driver's license -- thanks to a law signed Monday by the governor. The bill could affect about 250,000 drivers who traverse Illinois' roads without a license or other documentation that authorizes their presence in the United States. Once it takes effect in 10 months, those who have been in Illinois for over a year who aren't eligible for a Social Security number can get a driver's license if they pass a driving safety test and have valid automobile insurance. Although he referenced the divisive immigration debate in Washington, Gov. Pat Quinn said the measure signed Monday was mostly motivated by a desire to optimize safety along Illinois roads. Another aim is to reduce an estimated $64 million in annual damage claims related to accidents involving undocumented immigrants, thereby lowering insurance premiums paid by others Illinois drivers. ""Illinois is moving forward,"" the governor said. ""This common sense law will help everybody, regardless of their background, learn the rules of the road, pass a driving test and get insurance. As a result, our roads will be safer, we will create more access to job opportunities, and our economic growth will be strengthened."" The statement issued by Quinn's office touts the positive effect the new law will have on undocumented immigrants -- and, it argues, on the state's economy as a whole. Specifically, it cites studies that show immigrants ""who drive legally are more likely to work, spend and contribute to the economy."" And those with driver's licenses will have more job opportunities available to them, which the governor's office says should generally boost businesses in the state. Access to driver's licenses is also important to immigrant rights groups, who see it as a sign of inclusiveness and perhaps a harbinger of broader immigration reform that will keep more families together. ""Today is a proud day for our immigrant community,"" said Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights CEO Lawrence Benito. ""The signing of today's law sends a clear signal: Our country is ready to unite in a bipartisan manner to pass a humane immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship."" State Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno, a Republican, said her state's politicians should be proud of the effort, which she said was necessitated by ""the inaction of the federal government."" Another Republican, state House Minority Leader Tom Cross, praised a law he said will allow more Illinois residents to legally ""go to work, take their kids to school or the doctor,"" in addition to making ""the roads safer for all residents."" Opinion: Stars align on immigration . ""Today in Illinois, we take a monumental step in recognizing the needs of many hard-working immigrants living here and contributing so much to our great state,"" Cross said. But not all Republicans nationwide support such an initiative. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said last week that she'll push -- for the third time -- to repeal what she called a ""dangerous law"" that lets undocumented immigrants in her state get driver's licenses. Critics claim that the 2003 law has made New Mexico a magnet for fraud, with state Secretary of Taxation and Revenue Demesia Padilla contending in 2011 that ""illegal immigrants from all over the country come to New Mexico to obtain a license without having the intention of staying here."" The only other state to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses is Washington. Utah issues driving privilege cards to undocumented immigrants who live in the state for more than six months. Monday's announcement in Chicago comes the same day a bipartisan group of eight U.S. senators floated their framework for national immigration reform. President Barack Obama -- whom some Latinos had criticized for not making immigration a top priority in his first term, though they overwhelmingly backed him in the 2012 election -- will address the issue Tuesday night. Possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape . Among other elements, the senators' proposal includes a ""tough but fair"" path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States and a guest worker program for jobs that Americans are either unable or unwilling to fill. This plan drew swift condemnation from some conservative groups and politicians, reflecting the battle lines on the issue that have been drawn in earlier debates and suggesting that it won't be easy to get any such legislation through Congress. NumbersUSA, a group seeking to reduce U.S. immigration, called the senators' plan an attempt to ""out-amnesty Obama"" and said it will urge its 1.3 million members to push to fight it. And Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the proposed measures may cost taxpayers millions of dollars as well as thousands of jobs. ""By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration,"" Smith said.","Illinois governor signs law that may affect 250,000 who don't have visa or green card .
Immigrants who pass a driver's test and have insurance can get a driver's license .
Bipartisan backers say the law bolsters safety, economy and ""hard-working immigrants""

"(CNN) -- Imagine going to the internet to search your name only to find a mug shot from years ago posted on multiple websites. There are publications and websites whose sole purpose is to feature police booking photos. Some make a profit selling advertising around the photos, while other websites are offering, for a price, to remove or hide these images permanently. Donald Andrew McMahon learned about the mug shot business the hard way. In 2003, McMahon woke up one morning covered in blood, with stab wounds and evicted from his home. McMahon was fired from his job and slept in a gas station bathroom that night. McMahon knew his life was in need of a change. At the time, the then-bartender was dealing with the deaths of his best friend and sister within months of each other, along with a family history of drug abuse. McMahon started using cocaine at age 12 and lived in a drug-induced haze until he was 23. During those tumultuous years, McMahon was arrested several times, including two instances for driving under the influence of alcohol. These days, McMahon is a happily married, churchgoing father who works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. His wife, Andrea McMahon, is a part-time student at the University of Georgia earning a master's in social work. When they're not working, life for the McMahons revolves around their 2-year-old daughter, Gemma. It is a much different existence than McMahon once had. ""I'll be outside watching them and a bag of bricks hits me,"" McMahon said at his Norcross, Georgia, home while watching ""Dora"" with the family. ""This is me now compared to eight years ago when I was living in a bar."" On paper, McMahon is the quintessential American family man, but his past haunts him in publications and on websites that are using it for profit. Mug Shots Inc. As part of his recovery, McMahon went to the Internet to check his online image after he read that employers use Google to search the names of potential employees. Having served the time for his crimes, McMahon was shocked to find his mug shot still posted on a website along with others. He contacted the site to have the image removed. He paid a another site to have the mug shot removed only to see his photo show up in four other places. ""It's like killing one flea and then saying, 'OK the flea problem is done,'"" McMahon said. His frustration built when he contacted the website Reputation.com, which said for $7,500 it could not get rid of his image, but could ""bury"" it in Internet purgatory. McMahon is not alone in finding his murky past displayed for the public. Caught Up is a Tennessee-based weekly that dubs itself a ""crime-fighting publication."" It features police booking photos. Found primarily in smaller communities throughout Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Indiana, and Kentucky, the publication showcases people's names and alleged crimes listed below their mug shots. Caught Up and other similar papers collect mug shots, which are public record, from sheriffs and local police departments, who hand over the information with the names listed in alphabetical order, detailing the criminal charges. These photos are also featured and archived on the publication's website caughtuplive.com. Caught Up will feature anyone. One issue included OutKast's Big Boi on the cover after he was arrested on a cruise in late 2011. ""Sometimes I say I'm the most popular woman of the small counties because police departments are so grateful,"" said Lori Broderick, the media liaison for Caught Up. Broderick is involved in the publication of every paper, which puts out more than 25,000 copies weekly. Broderick, who is also a paralegal, joined the Caught Up team in December 2010. She feels the mission of the paper is to give people the ability to keep an eye on their communities. She recalls one woman who wanted some extra help with her lawn over the summer. The woman saw a picture of a man listed as a sex offender in Caught Up. It was the same man she was planning to hire to work at the home she shares with two teenage daughters. Broderick said the woman told her it was the best $1 she had ever spent. The flip side is how the publication affects the people showcased. Broderick recalled a man who was a sex offender and had finished serving his sentence. The man was trying to rejoin the community but felt he couldn't with his mug shot in the paper and online. Broderick said she and her team discussed the issue, but ultimately felt their need to inform was more important than helping the man overcome his past. ""When you're talking about the safety of the community and the safety of children and seeing as how these are already public records, we just made the determination that it was in the best interest of the public to have this information available,"" Broderick said. ""The lack of knowledge was not a chance that we were ready to take."" Mug shots: Informative vs. slander? Caught Up consists mostly of mug shots with a few related written pieces and various games that it calls ""informative fun."" There also is some local advertising. Caught Up Vice President Geoffrey Bar-Lev said in today's economy the profit margin for this business is relatively low. However, the demand for the publication in smaller communities has remained the same. The business makes money even if the lives of the people who make up its content have changed, which leaves someone like McMahon out of luck. Several clients have asked Kavan Singh-Grover, an Atlanta-based criminal defense attorney, about removing their mug shots from the sites and about what legal action can be taken. ""They are using a person's image for commercial gain without their permission,"" said Singh-Grover. ""To me, its extortion, maybe not legally, but the common use of that term."" Singh-Grover said legally, there is nothing that can be done. The only thing that could stop the publications and websites is legislation that forbids them. That legislation does not exist. Caught Up's Broderick said she understands the concerns and said other publications might have a lower standard, but their purpose is to encourage safety in communities, not promote public humiliation. ""People think we are in the business to mock,"" Broderick said. ""They believe that we have photos of a person who has been arrested to allow the community to thumb their nose at and that's not our purpose. If people find some of the mug shots amusing, that's more or less a side effect."" McMahon isn't laughing. ""But that's the main way they make profit, right,"" he said. ""We can read a paper without looking at a picture and know that seven people were arrested for DUI -- we don't need the picture. It just -- to me -- seems like the way that they're making money is because the pictures are pathetic or sometimes funny."" RemoveSlander.com is a website that erases mug shots from the Web once a person has been legally cleared. The site said it uses ""trade tools"" to eliminate the mug shot. Spokesperson Philip Lee said he does not feel RemoveSlander.com should be ""affiliated with the mug shot website."" RemoveSlander.com via ImageMax Mugshot Removal said it is the first reputation management firm to offer the service. For $399, RemoveSlander.com allows a customer to specify one website from which to have a mug shot deleted. For $699.00, the mug shot is removed from three sites. Remove.Slander.com has 14 business days to remove the mug shot from the website and Google or the customer gets their money back. If a customer has multiple arrests with more than one booking photo, that costs more. In his suburban Atlanta home, McMahon seems at peace with his new life and everything that comes with it. However, he's eager to talk about his past if it means more people are aware of publications like Caught Up and sites like RemoveSlander.com. ""I'm human, I made a couple of mistakes -- it's not a secret I made more than one,"" McMahon said. ""Everyone has a past. It's just unfortunate that mine is exploited for profit.""","Mug shot publications and websites feature police booking photos, which are public record .

"(Health.com) -- Will placing a tea bag on a cold sore make it disappear? Can you ease hot flashes with herbs? And does putting yogurt on your nether parts have a prayer of curing a yeast infection? It used to be that you'd hear about these kinds of home remedies from your mom. These days, they're touted on websites, blogs, and online forums. In fact, 61 percent of American adults turn to the Internet to find help in treating what's ailing them, a 2009 study reveals. But do these natural moves actually work ... and, just as important, could they do more harm than good? Health asked medical experts to weigh in on the Internet's most popular home cures. The online claim: Yogurt can stop a yeast infection . Is it true? No . Yeast infections -- and their symptoms, from intense vaginal itchiness to cottage cheese-like discharge -- are caused by an overgrowth of the fungus candida. Because studies show that yogurt can promote the growth of healthier strains of bacteria in the stomach and intestines, people have long assumed it might also keep candida in check. And that rumor keeps circulating, thanks to the Internet. Unfortunately, ""no study shows conclusively that eating yogurt cures or even lessens the severity of yeast infections,"" says Michele G. Curtis, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. Neither will douching with yogurt, or (yikes!) dipping a tampon in the stuff, freezing it, and inserting it -- a remedy suggested on some websites. In fact, douching can cause yeast infections, Curtis says, especially if you're using yogurt; its sugars could actually help yeast grow. If you're sure you have a yeast infection, based on a past experience, Curtis recommends using an over-the-counter medication, such as Monistat. But, she points out, ""everything that itches is not yeast!"" So see your gyno when in doubt: That itching might actually be bacterial vaginosis, for instance, which requires treatment with antibiotics. Health.com: Is vaginal grooming safe? The online claim: Black cohosh eases hot flashes . Is it true? Yes . Commonly known as bugwort or rattle root, this herb is derived from a plant called Actaea racemosa. While it may sound like something from Harry Potter's wizarding world, this remedy is not all hocus-pocus: Some studies suggest that black cohosh may indeed reduce hot flashes, according to guidelines re-released last year by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. ""It appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect,"" says Philip Hagen, M.D., co-editor of the ""Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies."" In fact, the herb is often prescribed in Europe; it's a key ingredient in Remifemin, a popular drug there, which is also available in the United States. While U.S. studies haven't conclusively proven that black cohosh works, Curtis says it can't hurt to try the herb -- just consult with your doctor about the dosage first, and stick with it for 12 weeks, she says. (Make sure you're getting black cohosh, not blue cohosh, which could potentially be harmful, she adds.) Health.com: Can supplements ease menopause symptoms? The online claim: Pop calcium pills to quell PMS cramps . Is it true? Yes . Since there's scientific evidence that PMS sufferers have lower levels of calcium in their blood, it's not a stretch to think that loading up on it would ease the cramps, headaches, and bloating that come at that time of the month. Indeed, research has shown that taking 600 milligrams of calcium twice a day can reduce PMS symptoms. And getting the nutrient in your food (such as calcium-packed dairy) may keep them at bay altogether: In a recent study conducted at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, women who consumed four servings a day of skim or low-fat milk reduced their risk of developing PMS by 46%. Note: Some women's cramps are so severe that only prescription medication can curb them, Curtis says. So if calcium doesn't make a difference with yours, see your doctor. Health.com: 10 ways to get rid of PMS . The online claim: Tea tree oil can zap your zits . Is it true? Maybe . One brand of tea tree oil sold online is dubbed ""Pure Liquid Gold,"" and it just may be, at least in the case of acne. A study published in the British Journal of Dermatology found that applying the extract to pimples reduced inflammation. ""Tea tree oil is antifungal and antibacterial,"" says Debra Jaliman, M.D., a New York City-based dermatologist. ""It's so effective that many of my patients prefer it to benzoyl peroxide.""

""The berries contain proanthocyanidins, which keep E. coli from attaching to the bladder wall and causing an infection,"" Hagen says. If you're prone to UTIs, drink one to two glasses of cranberry juice daily to help prevent them. Doing so also works when you have symptoms -- like a constant need to pee, or a burning sensation when you do -- to speed recovery. (There's also evidence that peeing immediately after sex can help prevent UTIs by flushing out bacteria.) Stick to juice that's at least 20% pure cranberry -- or try supplements, taking up to six 400-milligram pills twice a day an hour before or two hours after a meal. If your symptoms don't end within 24 to 48 hours, see your physician -- especially if you have a fever or chills.

"(CNN) -- It's the midst of peak cruising season, and millions of travelers are eagerly embarking on exotic vacations without thinking they could ever fall victim to a crime at sea. Cunard Cruise Lines' Queen Mary 2 sails into Sydney. Cunard says it has kits to aid rape investigations aboard. But sexual and physical assaults were the leading crimes committed onboard cruise ships in recent years, the FBI says. In March, a 42-year-old female passenger aboard the Coral Princess says a Portuguese crew member sexually assaulted her during a cruise, according to an FBI affidavit. The woman met the 38-year-old crew member for drinks in a dining room on the cruise ship operated by Princess Cruises, which did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The friendly encounter turned terrifying, the woman told the FBI, after her assailant blocked the doors to the room, trapping her inside, and forced her to perform oral sex. ""Travelers have this idea they are in a special cocoon where nothing bad can happen,"" says Charles Lipcon, a leading maritime lawyer in Miami, Florida, who is representing the alleged victim from the Coral Princess and has handled more than a hundred cruise assault cases in the last decade. ""That's just not true."" Addressing cruise ship violence has become an important issue for lawmakers as the $22 billion cruise industry proliferates. About 12 million North Americans will set sail on a cruise this year, according to the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade organization representing the industry. Cruise crimes have made headlines in recent years, like the Connecticut newlywed who vanished from his Royal Caribbean honeymoon cruise in 2005. Last Tuesday, the U.S. Coast Guard began searching for a passenger who went missing on a Carnival cruise ship. Though cruise companies don't display crime statistics to the public, they are required to report serious incidents involving Americans to the FBI and U.S. Coast Guard. Salvador Hernandez, deputy assistant director at the FBI in 2007, told lawmakers that the FBI opened 184 cases on crimes that occurred aboard cruise ships between 2002 and early 2007. The cruise industry points out that those numbers are small when compared with the number of passengers served by the industry --  about 64 million in that same five-year period. Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts and Rep. Doris Matsui of California have introduced the 2009 Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, which requires the cruise industry to publicly report crimes and improve safety on board. It mandates peepholes and security latches in cabins. This week, several victims of cruise crimes will meet with senators to discuss the issue. The cruise industry says that it is ""working closely"" with lawmakers on the bill and that passenger safety is a top priority. Royal Caribbean International, the second-largest cruise vacation company, has closed-circuit television cameras in hundreds of public locations on its ships, according to the company's Web site. Cunard Lines, which operates luxury cruises, wouldn't share security details with CNN but said its ships carry kits that investigators need to gather evidence of rape. The number of attacks on ships is probably higher than reported, sexual assault experts say, because rape victims are afraid to come forward on an isolated ship with perpetrators in close quarters. They also say cruise travelers are at a higher risk for attack because of readily available alcohol and a partying mentality on the vessels, which haul an average of 2,000 passengers each from across the globe. Of the attacks investigated by the FBI, a majority involved the use of alcohol. Cruise lines disagree, saying people are safer on the ships than they are in their own communities. The companies provide 24-hour security and screen passengers' belongings. ""The cruise ship is a closed community,"" said Michael Crye, executive vice president of the Cruise Lines International Association. Security officers ""have absolute access to everyone onboard,"" he said, because each person has been documented before boarding the ship. Authorities say passengers should report crimes immediately to a cruise line security officer or staff member on board. There are no U.S.-mandated ""cruise police,"" nor are FBI agents assigned to cruise ships. ""It's unclear what you should do when you're on a ship,"" says Evelyn Fortier, vice president of policy at the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. ""1-800 numbers don't always work when you're at sea."" Some attorneys say the security and medical authorities aboard the ships may be biased in their investigations. ""The cruise workers are paid by the cruise lines. Do you honestly think the cruise ship doctor will be favorable toward the victim?"" says Michael Ehline, a maritime attorney in Los Angeles, California. Vessels need independent, third-party security officers and cruise doctors, critics say. They point out that even the airline industry has federal air marshals on planes with international itineraries. Attorneys for the victims also point out that FBI statistics on cruise crime show that in nearly half of the incidents, a crew member is the suspect, which may deter victims from coming forward because they don't know which employees to trust. The Cruise Lines International Association says on its Web site that the industry's work force is prescreened by the U.S. State Department, which is responsible for issuing work visas to foreigners working on ships that stop in U.S. ports. Many passengers are unaware that being on a cruise ship is equivalent to being in a foreign country. Vessels are typically foreign-flagged from countries like Liberia and Panama. Cruise lines aren't obligated to follow the crime investigation and reporting guidelines that law enforcement would follow on U.S. soil, attorneys say. Filing lawsuits can also be difficult when the crime occurs in foreign waters because the trials can sometimes take place in courts abroad. ""They [cruise lines] will commit to nothing,"" says Ken Carver, president of International Cruise Victims, a nonprofit group. ""They will sell you the tickets,"" he says, ""and then fail to take responsibility."" Carver's daughter disappeared on a Celebrity cruise ship in 2004. He filed a lawsuit in 2005 accusing the cruise company of hiding information about her disappearance. The suit was settled a year later. Some attorneys question the training of private cruise ship security officers. Laurie Dishman, 38, testified before Congress that she was raped aboard a Royal Caribbean ship three years ago. She said cruise staff instructed her to gather evidence, so she and a friend went to the cabin where the assault occurred and piled her clothes and bed sheets into plastic bags they were given. ""We didn't know what we were doing,"" says Dishman. She said she was later told by authorities there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute a criminal case. ""It makes me frustrated looking back that the cruise lines didn't handle evidence properly."" Dishman's suit against Royal Caribbean was settled in early 2008. She says she can't disclose the amount. Cruise industry officials say their security officers are trained in how to preserve evidence. Carnival Cruise Lines, the largest cruise company in the world, says its security personnel must have previous security, military or law enforcement experience. Even if evidence is gathered properly by cruise security, the time that elapses between the crime and FBI involvement may threaten the integrity of an investigation. In the Coral Princess case in March, three days passed before the ship docked in California and FBI agents could step aboard. That incident, however, was handled in exemplary fashion, say attorneys and even some cruise line critics. The evidence was sufficient enough for the U.S. District Attorney's Office in the Central District of California to charge the alleged offender, Jorge Manuel Teixeira, with aggravated sexual abuse. Teixeira is pleading not guilty to the federal offense, which carries a possible life sentence. Teixeira says the encounter was consensual, according to his attorney. Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. District Attorney's Office prosecuting Teixeira, said charging offenders with cruise-related crimes can also be complicated by challenges such as tracking key witnesses abroad. The biggest threat, though, is the time lag, when valuable evidence can disappear or be tampered with, he said. ""When we can bring the case, we'll bring the case,"" he said. ""Teixeira is a good example.""","In a five-year period, the FBI opened 184 criminal cases aboard cruise ships .

"(CNN) -- How does your sex life measure up? That's the central premise of ""The Normal Bar,"" a new book by Chrisanna Northrup and sociologists Pepper Schwartz and James Witte. Based on the responses of an Internet survey of some 70,000 people, ""The Normal Bar"" endeavors to ease people's concerns about their sexual relationships by providing readers with an idea of what's ""normal"" for most couples -- from how often they have sex, to how sexually adventurous they are, to how they romance each other outside the bedroom. ""It isn't about a 98.6 kind of normal -- just the normal of exceptionally happy couples (gay and straight) and what we can learn from them,"" Schwartz says. One juicy nugget -- 86% of all men and women are intrigued by having kinky sex. ""This just goes to show that both men and women want to be kept on their toes,"" says Patty Brisben, sex educator and entrepreneur. ""I can't think of any couple who would be 'satisfied' with predictable sex for the same reason people don't watch the same movie every weekend: There's no mystery, no excitement."" Admittedly it's hard to resist checking out how we match up to other people between the sheets. ""Couples that come into my practice with complaints about their sex life are often comparing themselves to a rather unrealistic and fictitious standard,"" Dr. Sue Varma says. ""They have grown up watching Hollywood flicks believing that bedroom passion should be spontaneous."" Adds social psychologist Justin Lehmiller, ""Almost all couples, both heterosexual and same-sex, worry about how their relationship stacks up. This naturally leads us to compare our relationships to those of other couples."" It may be natural, but is that comparison healthy? It depends, say experts. ""It's tempting to think that statistics about how often other people have sex can tell you how often you should be having sex,"" explains Emily Nagoski, a sex health educator. ""But other people's sex lives have nothing to do with yours. Experiencing sex differently doesn't mean you're doing it wrong, it just means you're doing it differently."" On the other hand, the quest to keep up with the Jones' sex life can have its perks, too. Although comparison ""can be destructive if you think of the 'norms' as being ideals to strive for, it can also be empowering if it makes you feel that your experience has been validated and that you are less alone,"" says Margie Nichols, a sex therapist and pioneer in her work with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. ""Because kink and open relationships are more common among lesbian, gay and bisexual people, these couples face more options and choices, something that can add a layer of complexity to a couple's sex life as well as more freedom."" Comparison may even inspire you to amp up your sex life a bit. For instance, ""The Normal Bar"" authors found that 48% of men want their female partners to be more romantic -- and that the No. 1 thing they want more of is communication, not sex. ""Responses like these might encourage some women to raise the bar on how they talk and act in the bedroom,"" sex educator Jamye Waxman says. The survey results call into question stereotypes that men compartmentalize sex and emotions, says Jean Malpas, a psychotherapist in New York. ""Men are often described as rigidly separating sex and feelings,"" he says. ""However, many straight, gay or bisexual men I encounter in my clinical practice appreciate meaningful sexual intimacy. They often long for a sexuality anchored in the complicity and playfulness of their romantic relationship."" One of the goals of ""The Normal Bar"" is to get couples talking about their sex lives and trying new things. It's an experience that Nagoski sees reflected in her own work as a college sex educator. ""By the end of the semester, my students know they're normal, but not because their quantity, quality or frequency of sex falls within some statistical range, compared to other people,"" she says. ""They feel normal because they understand how varied people are, how many different ways there are to be 'normal,' and that the real measure for 'normal' is mutual consent and satisfaction.""","""The Normal Bar"" aims to get couples talking about their sex lives .

"(TIME.com) -- At every election, California's ballot is filled with initiatives, but none received more attention this year than Proposition 37. After the polls closed, Prop 37 -- also known as the ""Right To Know"" initiative to require labeling of foods that have been genetically modified -- failed to pass. If approved, California would have been the first state to require such labeling for foods sold in the state, and would have prohibited products containing genetically modified ingredients to be labeled or marketed as ""natural."" Although the issue was ostensibly about food, the debate over Prop 37 quickly became political in recent months, with grassroots-based food purists supporting the measure and a well-funded agriculture and industry opposition campaigning against its passage. As the San Francisco Chronicle reports, Prop. 37 opponents, largely from industry and agriculture, raised over $45 million while the Vote Yes campaign, which was largely backed by consumer groups and the organic industry, raised about $6.7 million. TIME.com: Prop. 37: Why California's ballot initiative on GM food is about politics more than science . ""We've said from the beginning of this campaign that the more voters learned about Prop 37, the less they'd like it. We didn't think they'd like the lawsuits, more bureaucracy, higher costs and loopholes and exemptions. It looks like they don't,"" the No on Prop. 37 spokeswoman Kathy Fairbanks told the Associated Press. Prop 37 supporters argued that citizens have the right to know what's in their food and make educated decisions on what to feed their families, especially since long-term health effects are hazy. They wanted to see labeling, according to the ballot initiative, either on the front or back of packages ""if the food is made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways."" Opponents from the biotech industry and Big Ag companies like Monsanto called the labeling deceptive and argued it would stigmatize foods that scientific evidence shows is not harmful. They also estimated that the cost of the labeling requirement would trickle down to California households, forcing families to pay $400 more in grocery bills each year. As TIME's EcoCentric noted, however, that figure, which became a highly debated part of the campaign, assumes manufacturers would be replacing currently unlabeled genetically modified (GM) products rather than slapping new labels on them. TIME.com: Making sense of food labels . In the end, however, public health experts hope that it was the science that helped voters to make their decision. So far, there is little evidence suggesting that GM foods pose any harms to people that would warrant a label informing them of the modification. Major medical groups like the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association, in addition to the American Association for the Advancement of Science note that people have been eating genetically modified foods (about 85% of corn sold in the U.S. are man-made hybrids) for nearly 20 years with no serious adverse effects. So what is the push for labeling really about? In California in particular, it may be about a new-found appreciation for issues that many of us take for granted, including sustainable farming and animal rights. Opinion: Kids take up fight for 'real food' In the New York Times Sunday Magazine, writer Michael Pollan says the movement has ""revitalized local farming and urban communities and at the same time raised the bar on the food industry, which now must pay attention (or at least lip service) to things like sustainable farming and the humane treatment of animals."" He also admits the movement still has hurdles before it can establish itself as a campaign that will appeal to enough people to pass as a ballot initiative. But despite the defeat, the Prop 37 supporters see the campaign as a victory of sorts. ""Prop 37 is a really important and historic opportunity for an emerging food movement. It will fundamentally change the conversation about food and agriculture here in the U.S.,"" says Dave Murphy, founder of Food Democracy Now. ""It will also change how food companies have to respond to the millions and millions of Americans across the country who want to know what they're eating."" TIME.com: Vital farms: Raising the ultra-organic egg . Murphy says the campaign has highlighted Americans' increasing distrust of the food industry and the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the food they eat. Given that 50 countries already label GM foods in Europe, Australia, Japan, Russia and China, he hopes American skepticism will continue to hold food manufacturers accountable. ""We have a massive social movement for change to achieve labeling of genetically engineered foods in the United States. We understand that [this] loss...that's politics. The largest, most powerful corporations have spent millions of dollars to deceive the California voters,"" he says. More states will consider labeling laws in coming years, and Washington state and Oregon will likely have ballot propositions in the next two years. ""We will go to Washington and demand labeling from the next administration. We are not going away. We are just getting started,"" says Murphy. This story was initially published on TIME.com.

"(CNN) -- The French Riviera, that picture-perfect stretch of beach-hugging Mediterranean coastline, looks just like a fabled playground of the rich-and-famous would if an artist drew it. And many of the most renowned, from Claude Monet to Henri Matisse, certainly did. August is when many French residents escape their cities, towns and villages and head out ""on holiday,"" but weather-wise, it's a great time to visit the Riviera (or the Côte d'Azur, as the Riviera is called en français). But so is the fall, the spring -- even the so-called ""off-season"" after New Year's for those who prefer their crowds thin, traffic light and prices less steep. Travel Snapshots: Share your photos from the South of France . Talk about an embarrassment of riches. From the Italianate pastel charms of Menton and Nice to the sexy, sybaritic lure of Cannes and St-Tropez, the sun-splashed South of France has it all. Here are 10 ways to savor it, no matter when you go. 1. Go strolling in style. Just like a supermodel blessed with natural beauty and great bones, the Riviera loves to show itself off. So take advantage with anytime strolls through these gorgeous seaside and hillside cities and towns. Nice's famed Promenade des Anglais -- a miles-long stretch alongside pebbly beaches and dominated by the Belle Epoque-era landmark hotel Le Negresco -- is one rewarding route; the jaw-dropping allure of the walk between Côte d'Azur villages Villefranche-sur-Mer and next-door Beaulieu-sur-Mer is another. Eight hotels worth a tour . 2. Party like a rock star. The Côte d'Azur is a perennial playground for A-list celebrities such as Rihanna (who in late July hit the streets of St-Tropez in a bandeau bikini top and crochet skirt), Academy Award-winning actor Adrien Brody, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. But you too can roll like the jet set. Do it in Cannes (May's annual film festival, anyone?) at Le Baoli nightclub where Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz have dropped in. Or at St-Tropez's eternally hot and long-queued club Les Caves du Roy, where stars such as P. Diddy, George Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham get the royal treatment -- and guests staying onsite at the five-star Hotel Byblos get to skip the lines. 3. Get lucky. Unlike the giant casinos in Las Vegas, where gamblers amble in wearing shorts and flip-flops, the grand ones in Monaco are more refined. Even though men are ""required"" only to wear long pants and closed-toe shoes at the Casino de Monte-Carlo, they can channel their inner James Bond and don jackets at night in the Salons Privés, where roulette, blackjack and other games are played. Cannes' massive Casino Croisette is one of several, including Nice's glitzy Casino Ruhl, owned by the 100-year-old Lucien Barrière group, which helped launch the modern-day resort concept by combining casinos, luxury hotels and sports facilities on the same site. Both Ruhl and the casino inside the Art Deco-inspired Palais de la Méditerranée have fabulous addresses, facing the sea and the Promenade des Anglais. 4. Soak up the scents. The South of France is home to some amazing smells, thanks to the way-high hillside towns of Grasse and Eze, which send fragrances to the world and explain perfume production to the masses. Grasse, about 26 miles west of Nice, is home to legends Fragonard, whose 18th century factory is still open to the public; Molinard, which also operates a friendly and well-stocked store in central Nice; and Galimard, another 18th century gem that offers free guided tours of its factory and museum 365 days a year (and does the same in picturesque Eze Village). Travel Snapshots: Paris . 5. Take an artistic approach. Great painters were obviously onto something when they settled along the Côte d'Azur, inspired by its dazzling blue waters and skies and villages high in the sky. Those who called this stretch home and created world-class works that fill modern-day museums along the French Riviera include Pablo Picasso, whose former château-turned-museum in Antibes houses hundreds of his paintings, ceramics and more. In Nice, there's Musée Matisse, perched on a hill in the tony Cimiez neighborhood and housing a collection the artist and his heirs left to the city. Musée National Marc Chagall features the 19th century artist's biblical-themed works. In Saint-Paul-de-Vence, you'll find Fondation Maeght, a modern art museum that pays homage to Chagall, Joan Miró and Alberto Giacometti. 6. Take in the scene. There's never a dull moment on the Côte d'Azur with year-round festivals keeping tourists and locals well entertained. Of course, there's the Nice Jazz Festival with international A-list headliners each July (and with many performances staged in an ancient Roman amphitheater in Cimiez). The top-flight and Jazz à Juan festival follows just days later in lively and watersports-friendly Juan-les-Pins. Cannes lights up the sky each summer with the annual International Fireworks Festival, which started last month and continues August 7, 15 and 24. Also catch the Monte-Carlo International Fireworks Festival each July and August, with its competition happening August 8 and 25. If you feel a need for speed, the Grand Prix of Monaco races through this tiny principality's streets for several days each May. Heavenly Hawaii: Do's and don'ts . 7. Dine like the locals. Cuisine in the South of France takes advantage of the Provençal region's rich natural bounty. You'll find colorful ratatouille, a side dish made from tomatoes, eggplant, onions, peppers and zucchini; bouillabaisse, the famed seafood soup from the port city of Marseille served with a creamy garlic sauce; and socca, a chickpea-and-olive oil pancake sold by vendors in Nice and beyond. And because Nice belonged to Italy until 1860, Italian cuisine feels about as local as salad Niçoise. You'll dine fabulously across the Côte d'Azur, but tiny Oliviera in Vieux (Old) Nice does more than serve delicious dishes. Multilingual owner Nadim Beyrouti uses his seasonal cuisine as a showcase for the small-producer Provençal olive oils he sells. You'll want to take home bottles of this liquid gold to use back home -- and give as gifts. 8. Savor sundown. The French Riviera may be all about sun-splashed days, but the good times keep rolling at night. The mild climate lets folks dine and sip aperitifs outdoors most of the year, with terrace tables at cafes and restaurants such as Villefranche's always-popular Le Cosmo and those along the town quai occupied even in cooler months. And from late June through early September, take in a current (usually English-language) film once the sun sets at the Monaco Open Air Cinema. Talk about a stunning backdrop to the action -- the cinema's perched on the Rock of Monaco, overlooking the sea and with spectacular views of the Prince's Palace and Old Town. Even Hollywood couldn't stage a scene like this. 9. Sleep well. Choices abound when cooling your heels after long days and nights on the Riviera. High rollers choose the celeb-favored Hôtel du Cap-Eden Roc at the southern tip of Cap d'Antibes or the InterContinental Carlton Cannes on the La Croisette waterfront promenade. If you're looking for stunning sea views, balconies and a more laid-back artistic vibe, the 35-room Hotel Welcome in Villefranche-sur-Mer is a great bet. (Writer/artist/filmmaker Jean Cocteau used to stay here, and painted the interior of the 14th century Chapelle St-Pierre across the street.) Get more space by renting one of seven stylishly furnished flats (three on the Villefranche waterfront, most of the others in the colorfully charming Old Town) from Riviera Experience, which offers personalized service and every home comfort you might need. 10. Get around in style. No matter how you arrive or depart the Côte d'Azur, you'll be treated to world-class views. Take the high-speed TGV to or from Paris or regional trains from nearby Ventimiglia, Italy, and gaze at mile after gorgeous mile of Mediterranean beaches. Fly into or out of Nice -- one of France's three busiest airports -- and drool at the scenery you'll see from the air. Since the Riviera is home to the annual Grand Prix, consider checking out the landscape on your own wheels, zipping along the three corniches, or winding roads that stretch between Nice and Menton. Regional buses also travel many of these stunning roads. And if you're partial to the sea, use seasonal April-October ferries between Nice and Monaco, Cannes and St-Tropez for breathtaking sights you won't soon forget.

"(CNN) -- Massacres such as Newtown are horrifying and heart-rending. They are also nothing like the typical American gun murder. The typical murder has one victim, not many. The typical murder is committed with a handgun, not a rifle. And in the typical murder, both the perpetrator and the victim are young black men. Blacks are six times as likely as whites to be the victim of a homicide. Blacks are seven times as likely to commit a homicide. The horrifying toll of gun violence on black America explains why black Americans are so much more likely than whites to favor gun control. Conversely, fears of being victimized by violence explain why so many white Americans -- especially older and more conservative white Americans -- insist on the right to bear arms in self-protection. They see gun violence as something that impinges on them from the outside. They don't blame guns for gun violence. They blame a particular subset of the population. And they don't see why they should lose their right because some subset of the population abuses theirs. A writer I greatly admire, Rod Dreher, an independent-minded conservative, gives voice to such feelings in an article posted this weekend on the American Conservative website. Dreher expresses himself forcefully and frankly. That frankness should be welcomed, because the more clearly a mistaken idea is put, the faster we can reach a better understanding. Dreher wrote: . ""Yesterday the Baton Rouge Advocate published a lengthy analysis of the 2012 murder stats in the city. Take a look at this PDF of one of the inside pages. Last year, 83 people died by homicide in Baton Rouge. Of that number, 87% were black, and 87% were male. Two-thirds had been in trouble with the law before, and one-third had been in trouble with the law for drugs. The median age of victims: 26. ""Of the perpetrators, the median age was 22. Get this: 96% of them were black, and 90% were male. Almost two-thirds had previous arrests. One out of four had a drug record. ""Most of the murders took place in the poorest parts of the city. ""What can we learn from these statistics? That murder in Baton Rouge is almost entirely about young black men from the poor part of town killing other young black men from the poor part of town. It's mostly a matter of thugs killing thugs."" If you look at the world that way, gun control must seem a pointless diversion from the real problem: not guns, but one particular group of gun owners. Somebody else's problem. But life is not so neatly separated. Guns offer equal opportunity tragedies. More than 8,000 white Americans had to be treated for nonfatal gun injuries in 2008. Eighty percent of those who commit suicide with a gun are white males. The gun that the suburban family buys to protect itself from ""thugs killing thugs"" ends up killing its own: One important new study finds that a gun kept in the house is 43 times more likely to kill a household member than to be used in self-defense. Thugs killing thugs? Maybe. But many of those seeming thugs are carrying guns for the same reason that people who consider themselves respectable carry them : in a futile quest to protect themselves with greater firepower. One person can find safety that way. But if two people carry firearms, a confrontation that might otherwise have ended in words or blows ends instead with one man dead, and the other man on his way to prison for life. Louisiana sends more people to prison than any other state, at a total cost of almost 7% of its state budget. Prison is always expensive, but the incarceration of murderers costs the most, because they remain in prison to the end. The oldest of Louisiana's prisoners cost the state almost $80,000 a year, including their health care. Widespread gun ownership means not only more gun killings, but also more gun maimings and cripplings. The National Rifle Association's Wayne LaPierre hailed the ability of a ""good guy"" with a gun to stop a ""bad guy"" with a gun. Sixty seconds later, however, that bad guy may need a wheelchair for life. We can't dismiss these human costs as pertaining to only somebody else. They are all part of us. Yet the urge to subdivide runs strong among Americans. Monday on Fox News, the popular conservative commentator Ann Coulter claimed that the murder rate among white Americans is as low as the murder rate in Belgium. ""So perhaps it's not a gun problem,"" she concluded. ""Perhaps it's a demographic problem."" But countries cannot dismiss the sufferings of great blocks of their people by dismissing some ""demographics"" as unworthy of attention. If you ignore America's poor, you can make all kinds of problems disappear from view. Not counting the poor and minorities, the country does not have an obesity epidemic. Not counting the poor and minorities, the United States has perfectly adequate schools. Not counting the poor and minorities, America would have a higher average income. Likewise, not counting hurricanes, America would not have so many natural disasters. Not counting divorces, America would have more intact families. Not counting wars, America would have a smaller public debt. But what's the point of this exercise? The people who make up America count as Americans, and their problems count as America's problems. Their problems do not occur in isolation, but are manifestations of failures to which all Americans contributed together. Those young men in Baton Rouge who are killing each other in such horrific numbers do not manufacture their own guns. They did not organize the gun trade that brings the guns to their town. They did not write the laws that prevent their town government from acting against guns. They carry guns -- and misuse guns -- thanks to a national system of gun regulation that makes guns easily accessible to those least likely to use guns responsibly. The gun laws intended to put guns into the hands of ""good guys"" are the laws that also multiply guns in the hands of ""bad guys"" -- bad guys who might not have become such bad guys if the guns had not been available to their hands. The price of redefining gun violence as an issue pertaining only to ""those people"" -- of casting and recasting the gun statistics to make them less grisly if only ""those people"" are toted under some different heading in some different ledger -- the price of that redefinition is to lose our ability to think about the problem at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Typical American gun murder isn't like Newtown massacre .

"Washington (CNN) -- It should have been a happy day for Raymond Jose: He had been accepted to college, with scholarships to help pay for it. But when he told his parents, his mother started to cry. ""I was puzzled why she was crying after hearing such great news,"" said Jose, who was to attend Montgomery College in Maryland. ""That was when she started to explain to me we were undocumented, that we had overstayed our tourist visas."" Jose's family had come to the United States from the Philippines in 2000, when Jose was 9. They first lived in the Tampa Bay, Florida, area but moved four years later to Maryland. Jose had been assimilated into American life and culture and didn't know that he was undocumented until that day. When he found out, he was heartbroken. His undocumented status prevented him from using scholarship money to help pay for school. ""Every day after that, it was really hard to get out of bed,"" Jose said. The debate over immigration reform has been focused on border security and immigrants from Latin America. But the Asian population in the U.S. grew by more than 40% between 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of those identifying themselves as Asians, either alone or in combination with another racial group, grew from 11.9 million to 17.3 million. U.S. settles case in immigration raids, must follow new guidelines . Of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., 1.3 million are from Asia, according to the Department of Homeland Security. As this year's immigration reform efforts began, Asian-American advocacy groups laid out their priorities to the Gang of Eight negotiating a bill in the Senate, along with other key legislators like House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Their priorities in the immigration debate include establishing a humane pathway to citizenship, restricting the use of electronic employment verification systems such as E-Verify and reducing visa backlogs. The groups are also trying to fight efforts to increase the number of business-related visas at the expense of those that allow immigrants to join resident family in the U.S. and change the policy of deportations for minor offenses. The Asian American Justice Center, based in Washington, has been focused on family visas. ""Lindsey Graham and others have been very public on eliminating the married adult children category and brother-sister category,"" Mee Moua, president and executive director, said of the Republican senator from South Carolina. The justice center has met with legislators to argue that such visa categories shouldn't be eliminated and has provided information for Asian-Americans, Latino Americans and those in the African and Caribbean communities on the impact if these visas were to be eliminated. ""Our aim is to fight for and be the champion for a common-sense solution for the family visa situation,"" Moua said. Meeran Mahmud, a staff attorney at the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, has an older sister in Pakistan who is waiting to be reunited with her family in the U.S. Her uncle applied for their papers in 1986. Mahmud was able to come to the U.S. 10 years later, but her sister had turned 22 and was no longer eligible. Her sister has since married and had children of her own. ""Been waiting since she was a little girl, and she will be turning 40 this year,"" Mahmud said. Another major issue for the Asian Pacific American Legal Center is the detention and deportation of immigrants and refugees. Anoop Prasad, a staff attorney for immigrant rights at the Asian Law Caucus, points to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 as increasing deportations. Prasad says that under the law, the U.S. can deport someone who was convicted of minor offenses as a teenager, like possession of a small amount of drugs or shoplifting. Springtime for immigration reform? The law has severely affected the Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese communities, Prasad said. ""It is a complicated question but has a good deal to do with issues with refugee resettlement issues in the '80s. Many were dealing with mental health issues from the (Vietnam) war. Almost all Cambodian refugees had lost a relative in the genocide, and many had seen relatives killed or starved to death."" Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression rates among Cambodian refugees are over 80%, Prasad said. ""Yet mental health services weren't available when they arrived. Most were resettled in neighborhoods with high unemployment and poverty rates along with drugs and high incarceration rates. In the absence of a strong family support structure, many joined gangs when they were in high school and picked up convictions."" Prasad wants more discretion when dealing with deportation cases rather than having someone's fate decided simply by a look at their convictions. ""These are actual people with names and stories and families,"" Prasad said, ""and it's our job to make sure their voices get heard."" The Chicago-based Asian American Institute has also been meeting with legislators and organizing Asian-Americans to talk with their congressmen about issues like immigration. The institute has been collecting and posting personal stories from Asian-Americans. For example, Connie wants to bring her son from the Philippines to live with her in the U.S. ""Applications where her son's is categorized normally take 11-12 years,"" Connie's story says. ""In the interim they have tried to spend every Christmas together for the past 8 years since Connie came to the US. It's a form of bonding; a pact that only gets more painful and emotional every goodbye time -- and expensive."" As for Jose, he's making do, whatever ultimately happens in Washington. After he graduated high school, his father handed him an envelope with enough money for one semester at community college. 'Illegal immigrant' title seen as a challenge . Since then, his family has been helping him pay for school. His father does landscaping and sometimes works as a vendor at RFK Stadium in Washington. His mother babysits, take cares of the elderly and cleans houses. Even his older sister has taken odd jobs to help. Jose has had to skip semesters so he could work and help his family financially. He also took part in the campaign to help pass the Maryland DREAM Act, which grants in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigrants, last year and has continued to raise awareness about others like him. ""We're here, and we're not leaving, and we want a just and inclusive immigration reform,"" Jose said.","More than 1.3 million Asians are undocumented in the U.S.; many arrived here as children .

"(CNN) -- When ""Evel Dick"" Donato left ""Big Brother 13"" during filming, he cited only ""personal reasons"" for his decision. He's now revealing the reason for his exit: He is HIV positive. The winner of ""Big Brother 8"" shared his revelation on an episode of the VH1 reality series ""Couples Therapy"" set to air Wednesday. Donato and his girlfriend, Stephanie Rogness-Fischer, are cast members on the show, and in a clip he is seen discussing wanting to come clean about his diagnosis -- which she is adamantly against doing. ""Stephanie does not want to talk about it, and if it's brought up with her she will probably leave,"" he tells the show's therapist, Jenn Berman. ""There (were) a million rumors of why I left ... but nobody ever knew and nobody ever found out."" CNN first became aware of Donato's status via Twitter. Donato exited ""Big Brother 13"" after six days. He told People magazine that the show's producers first alerted him to his diagnosis. ""They told me that something was wrong with my blood test,"" he said. ""They had done two HIV tests. One had come back positive and the other had come back negative."" He said he immediately left the show and went to the house of his mother, the first person he told. Donato said he is not gay or an intravenous drug user, ""but at this point, it doesn't matter. We create a stigma around the disease that makes it hard for people to publicly say they have it."" Donato is on medication that he will have to take for the rest of his life and said he is coming forward to help others come out of the shadows. He says he's fully aware of his reputation as a reality-show villain but grateful for the platform. ""And I decided that it was time to just publicly say what I'm dealing with,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- For the warrior or the would-be rescuer -- the heroes -- there is no time to appreciate what one click of a camera shutter means to a suffering nation. Six Marines still had an enemy to fight after they raised the American flag on Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi. Three would die in that 1945 battle. On Sept. 11, 2001, three New York City firefighters joined those who rushed to the World Trade Center to search for survivors who would never be found. Late that afternoon, they raised a small flag removed from a nearby boat. A monochromatic wall of gray debris soared in the background. ""There's no self-pity in that picture,"" said Capt. Patrick Burns, U.S. Navy liaison to New York, at the time. The photographs of the flag-raisings at Iwo Jima and ground zero quickly became icons, moments in time that galvanized Americans who found new solidarity and unity. And while the whereabouts of the Iwo Jima flag are known (it's at the National Museum of the Marine Corps), the fate of the World Trade Center site 3-foot-by-5-foot flag became a mystery. CNN Films' ""The Flag,"" which premieres Wednesday night on CNN, explores what may have happened to it. It's a story replete with mystery. Within hours of its raising, the flag disappeared from the World Trade Center site. The makers of the film documented this by looking at the background of photos taken soon after. The flag that subsequently flew over Yankee Stadium as a patriotic rebuke to terrorism, and fluttered over the USS Roosevelt as the aircraft carrier sent missions over Afghanistan, was represented as the same flag that was raised. The original flag was ""either misplaced, stolen or secreted away by unknown forces in the chaos of ground zero,"" the film's directors said in a statement. Help look for the flag . Raised flag became a national symbol . Dishonesty was not behind the story of the flag's travels, said Michael Tucker, who produced, wrote and directed ""The Flag"" with his wife, Petra Epperlein. There were more important things to do than keep up with a single flag, which was quickly joined by several others. ""(For) people who were down there, the most important thing for them was recovering people, even when they knew there were no survivors,"" Tucker said. When an official was sent to pick up the flag a week or so later, he apparently received a larger flag, and it was flown at subsequent events. ""They had no reason to believe it wasn't the flag,"" Tucker said. The story of the missing flag includes a larger, more philosophical question: Is it the actual flag that is most important -- or the ideals it represents? For its part, the WTC flag photo -- taken by Tom Franklin of the Record newspaper in Bergen, New Jersey -- quickly became a symbol. It was plastered on the cover of Newsweek, with the words, ""God Bless America,"" and the image could be seen on everything from coffee cups to tattoos. ""Most people will see it happen once or twice in their lifetime -- where the whole nation stands together,"" said Tucker. ""It was the worst of times and probably the best of America,"" Tucker told CNN on Tuesday. The makers of ""The Flag"" spoke with several photographers about going to ground zero and the heartbreaking scenes that awaited. The film is partly forensic, with an expert comparing photos of the original flag and others that appear to be larger. Among those interviewed were the couple who owned the yacht from which the flag was taken by a firefighter to hang at the WTC site. They wanted to donate the flag to the Smithsonian Institution and asked about a year after the attacks to borrow the signed flag briefly for a ceremony. ""When we got the flag, we were quite stunned that it was the wrong flag,"" said Shirley Dreifus. ""... This wraps around the two of us, and we're not the thinnest people on Earth ... So we knew right away it was the wrong flag."" Learn more than you ever knew about ""The Flag"" Does it matter whether it was the real flag? Woven throughout the film, which is based on a book by David Friend, are discussions about the powerful nature of a flag. ""We're not a country based on religion or ethnicity, or even cultural heritage"" Burns told the filmmakers. ""We're a country based on ideas and a philosophy. And that's what the flag is."" Jodi Goglio, who works for Eder Flag, said a flag ""makes you feel that we are bigger than just ourselves."" A young crew member of the USS Roosevelt wiped away tears as she described having the supposed WTC flag on board. ""It just makes what you're doing so much more, wow, meaningful,"" she said. When asked whether it mattered whether the flag was recovered, a visitor to the 9/11 memorial said, ""It would matter. It would matter to me."" Another said, ""I think it would to the families who lost their loved ones."" Among those who died were 343 firefighters. Thomas Koehler, a retired detective with the New York Police Department, said he would rather not know what became of the WTC flag. ""If you had the actual flag ... the cynic in me (would say), people want it. You put a price on it. ... then it becomes something else."" Tucker got a firsthand taste of a flag's power while making ""Gunner Palace"" with Epperlein. Released in 2004, the documentary tells the story of a group of American soldiers who fought in Baghdad. The Iraqi insurgency was growing, and Tucker, an American, wanted to leave in spring 2004 for his home, then in Germany. He stayed at a U.S. facility at the airport and awoke to find a small folded American flag under his pillow, a customary gift made by some group. ""I was so overwhelmed with emotion. That flag means home,"" Tucker said. ""While that experience is not uniquely American, when you are thousands of miles from home, under stress, and you see the colors -- it reminds you of your people.""

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- In February 1984, a group of tech enthusiasts gathered in Monterey, California, to share thoughts on three subjects -- technology, entertainment and design. It was the start of the acronym (and the organization) TED, which marks its first three decades this week with a conference in Vancouver. One speaker back in 1984, Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of MIT's Media Lab, predicted that devices with touch screens would come into widespread use, more than 20 years before Apple's iPhone delivered on that bet. On Wednesday, the 1,300 attendees at this year's conference will be shown a video with clips from Negroponte's 1984 talk, along with snippets of TED Talks that predicted advances in the use of robots, development of a driverless car, and technology that enables scientists to grow human body parts. Each of these predictions has come true, notes TED's June Cohen. One that largely hasn't, at least in any practical sense, is the personal flying car, Cohen said in an interview with CNN. (One conference included a presentation on a small plane that can be driven on roads, but it hasn't come into widespread use.) ""It's a very Jetsons concept,"" she said. ""I am waiting for that flying car."" Negroponte gave the first talk Monday at the TED2014 conference, adding a prediction that knowledge -- the ability to speak a language or absorb Shakespeare's plays -- will one day be ingested through a pill. He is one of many TED ""all-stars"" invited to reappear on the conference's stage. Among them: ""Eat, Pray, Love"" author Elizabeth Gilbert, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, inventor Ray Kurzweil, robotics expert Rodney Brooks, educator Salman Khan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand, and Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web. Others speaking at this weeks's conference, titled ""The Next Chapter,"" include Bill and Melinda Gates, Sting, author Isabel Allende, and former Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly. On Tuesday, Charmian Gooch, co-founder of the anti-corruption group Global Witness, will reveal the wish for which she was recently awarded the $1 million TED Prize. TED's breakout moment . While much of this year's conference harks back to TED's start in 1984, the organization really didn't assume its current form -- and its expansive public footprint -- until eight years ago. In 2006, TED's leadership decided to put its archive of recorded talks online for free. The thinking was that there were limits to how much impact a talk could have if its audience was only a thousand people, even if those people were influential ones. As Cohen recalls, it was considered a risky and even radical move. ""There was a lot of skepticism,"" she says. ""People worried that it might capsize our business model because we were running an expensive, somewhat elite conference. Conventional wisdom would tell you that if you have sort of a luxury item, an expensive conference, you have to keep your prices high and your commodity scarce."" But Cohen says TED never got the pushback some expected from people who had paid thousands of dollars to attend the conferences. ""They welcomed it,"" she said. ""They longed to share the talks with friends and family who couldn't be there in the room."" And it didn't discourage people from going to TED, she said. ""We raised the price of the conference by 50%, to $6,000, and we ended up selling out a year in advance with a thousand-person wait list. ... That really was a lesson for us in the power of openness."" TED followed up by allowing independently organized groups around the world to hold ""TEDx"" conferences, propagating its 18-minute video format. TED staff members can reel off the resulting numbers: 1.9 million TED Talk video views a day, 1,600-plus TED Talks online, 9,000 TEDx events in 157 countries. Making of a TED Talk . A TED Talk -- most of the main conferences have more than 60 of them -- is typically a carefully curated and rehearsed presentation by a thinker, an expert or an artist who's passionate about his or her subject, which can range far beyond the original ""technology, entertainment, design"" boundaries. Shot by as many as eight cameras, with professional set design and lighting, the video builds to an emotional (and intellectual) climax and is intended to be shared widely. What it is not is an hour-long college lecture, a panel discussion or a question-and-answer session with the audience -- all of which might make for a less dramatic and far less shareable product. Some critics have argued that TED Talks reduce complex subjects to a string of bullet points or promote a naive utopian view of the infinite possibilities of technology. That's not the way Cohen sees it. A graduate of Stanford, where she edited the student newspaper, she was working as a vice president at the online arm of Wired magazine when she attended her first TED in 1998. ""I absolutely fell in love with it from my first moment there. I felt like I had found my world and found my people. ... I think one of the reasons it spoke to me was that TED is sort of uniquely designed for people who have a wide range of interests."" Cohen is a passionate advocate for conference sessions that hop from one discipline to another. ""For me that's what TED is. It's not a single talk or even a collection of talks, it's the range of territory that we cover. ... And if we've curated it right, what happens to people in the audience during a TED session is that you can almost feel your brain lighting up in different areas. So when you see a designer speak, followed by a poet, followed by a physicist, followed by an entrepreneur, followed by a great musical performance ... it helps us create connections between the ideas that are coming at us."" Not everyone approves. ""People with a wide range of interests are often cast as dilettantes or often looked down upon for what is seen as a lack of focus,"" Cohen says. ""I see it as an existence of breadth, and one of the things you find really unites people who attend TED, or people who watch TED talks regularly, is that they do have a great interest in a wide range of areas."" ""Interestingly, there's a lot of evidence that that is the kind of thinking we really need today, that the great challenges of our times cannot be solved by experts working in their individual areas, but rather by people who can gather information from a wide range of fields and bring them together."" TED's evolution . The year that Cohen first went to TED was also the first time that Chris Anderson, a magazine entrepreneur, attended. He too was hooked. And in 2001, having sold his company, Anderson purchased TED through his nonprofit Sapling Foundation from TED co-founder Richard Saul Wurman. Anderson begins each conference with the incantation ""It's time for TED"" and shares hosting the sessions with Cohen and other staff members. Cohen helps curate the conference and also oversees TED's media arm, which includes a recently relaunched TED.com. She sees the arc of TED's lifespan as going from a ""closed conference to an open platform for spreading ideas."" Indeed the organization's motto is ""Ideas worth spreading,"" and the new website makes that tangible. A widget on each video allows a user who has shared a talk with others to see how many views the talk has gotten from those who have clicked on that person's link. Through the site, TED speakers can provide suggestions for further reading and for ways to take action on the issues raised in their talks. The boom in online video . Still, the heart of what TED offers is the short, tightly edited online video itself, and Cohen acknowledges that what was once unique to the organization has become available elsewhere. ""Over the years, the format of a recorded talk has gone from a novelty to a bit more of a staple online. I think that's great news for everyone."" As for the criticism TED has gotten, Cohen says, ""the more people you're influencing, the bigger target you'll become. It's a natural part of growing up as a media organization."" ""We work very concertedly with all of our speakers to make sure that their talks are deeply substantive and authentic. So there's no formula for a great TED talk. ... We always make it very clear to our speakers that it is essential that they not dumb down their material."" Cohen says the aim is to have the audience ""stretch up,"" and to help make that possible, she cites the advice often attributed to Albert Einstein: ""Make things as simple as possible but no simpler."" And, she adds, ""It's important to remember what a TED Talk is. A TED Talk isn't a scientific paper and it isn't a full-length book. It's a short talk meant to reach an intelligent general audience.""","TED got its start as a conference in Monterey, California, 30 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Scotland decided to trust its 16-year-olds to vote in the biggest question in its history when the country headed to the polls this week for a referendum on independence. Americans, in contrast, don't even trust theirs to help pick the county sheriff. Who's right? Many here might be skeptical about the idea of the United States following Scotland's lead in lowering the voting age. The trouble is that the main reason most people cite for barring 16- and 17-year-olds from voting looks like an equally good reason to stop most American adults from voting, too. The key argument against letting high school juniors vote is simple: Their choice would affect all of us. After all, a voter chooses for everyone, not just him or herself. Many worry that most 16-year-olds lack the wisdom or knowledge to cast smart votes, so we don't let them vote because we want to protect ourselves from their decisions. And this concern is often grounded in reality -- young adults are indeed in many cases profoundly ignorant about politics. But if that is a reason for excluding them from voting, it is surely a reason to exclude almost everyone else. Every two years, for 60 years, the American National Election Studies has surveyed what prospective voters know and don't know. And the results are always depressing -- the top quartile of voters are like B students, tending to get about 85% of questions right. The next two quartiles do little better or worse than chance. But the lowest quartile are systematically misinformed. Indeed, if you ask them which party, Republicans or Democrats, is more conservative, most of them even get that answer wrong. As political scientists Michael X. Delli Carpini and Scott Keeter noted in their 1996 book, ""What Americans Don't Know About Politics and Why It Matters,"" political knowledge is not evenly spread among all groups. Membership in some demographic groups correlates with high levels of political knowledge, depending on region, income and education, while other groups tend to correlate with political ignorance. So, this is the catch: If you wanted to exclude 16- and 17-year-olds on the grounds that they are more likely to be ignorant or misinformed, you would also in effect be arguing against other demographics having a say. Of course, you could object that the issue here is not so much about knowledge, but the capacity for political judgment. Yet nothing special happens at age 18 -- there is no sudden increase in cognitive ability, political wisdom or political knowledge at that age. In fact, in the 1970s, psychologists discovered that the biggest increases in the capacity to reason about politics occur around age 12 when puberty hits. By 16, most people have about as stable an ideology and capacity to reason about politics as they are going to get. Any improvements after that come slowly, if at all. It's true that voter turnout among young adults is low -- middle-aged and elderly citizens are far more likely to vote than young adults. And that is not necessarily a problem. Political scientists who study voting behavior consistently find that citizens vote for what they perceive to be the common good rather than their narrow self-interest. (If that seems surprising, consider: Your individual vote counts for so little that if you were just acting selfishly, you probably wouldn't bother to vote all.) But it's arguable that the needs of the young are overlooked, and that the young have valuable perspectives that are missing from the national conversation, and so perhaps expanding the voting pool would help fix that. And what should we do if we still can't get over our fear that 16-year-olds are too dumb to vote? Well, we needn't exclude all of them. Instead, we could allow any child who can pass the U.S. citizenship exam to acquire the right to vote. Of course, if you think that's a reasonable standard for a 16-year-old to have to meet, it's worth remembering that most voting-age adults cannot meet it either. So why should we demand more from our teenagers than we expect from ourselves?","Scotland allowed 16-year-olds to vote in its referendum on independence .

Now 70, Wegman has dabbled in various mediums and themes since introducing the world to Man Ray, his first pet Weimaraner, in the 1970s. But his choice of muse has remained fairly constant throughout his art, and even in the dog bed he helped design. ""He's the reason so many people know about these dogs,"" said Betsy Bottomley, who brought her 7-year-old rescue Weimaraner, Chance, to see Wegman at a recent author talk at the Decatur Book Festival in Georgia. ""Weimaraners are very people-oriented,"" she said. ""They love days like this when they can be outside with their families."" Wegman was at the festival to promote ""Flo & Wendell Explore,"" his newest children's book inspired by his blue-eyed pet Weimeraners, Flo and Topper. They're the latest in a long line of Wegman's canine muses that have inspired a robust collection of paintings, photographs, films, books and worldwide exhibits. Wegman has had 3-year-old Flo and 2-year-old Topper since both were 8 weeks old. They share the Wegman home with 13-year-old Candy and 15-year-old Bobbin, a descendant of Fay Wray, one of his most famous subjects. ""Topper didn't seem like a little boy's name. Wendell seemed to suit the look,"" Wegman said in a post-panel interview in a nearby hotel lobby, pulling out his iPhone to show off pictures like a proud parent. ""How could you not do a book about her?"" he said, pausing on a closeup of of Flo. ""She's so captivating."" The follow-up to ""Flo & Wendell"" features a combination of paintings and photographs, a departure from the images of dogs in costumes and roller skates for which Wegman is perhaps best known. It's a format that suits his current lifestyle and artistic sensibilities, he said. It allows him to ditch the studio and production crews needed to stage shoots of dogs dressed as Little Red Riding Hood or the Hardly Boys. Instead, he can paint the backdrop to Flo and Wendell's adventures beneath the skylight in his lakeside home in Maine. ""It was great, because I could be by myself in my room, like I was when I was a little boy, drawing pictures,"" he said, referring to his childhood in western Massachusetts. Wegman shared the book festival stage with author-illustrator Chris Gall for a discussion about why animals make such great subjects for books. Every dog has its own personality, which guides how Wegman portrays them, he said. He told the festival audience -- a mix of adults and children -- that he approaches children's picture books the same way as everything else he does. He just makes art, using dogs. ""I love the idea that Wegman isn't thinking about picture books any differently from his adult work, that he's approaching his books for kids with the same kinds of ideas and aesthetic concerns,"" said author and panel moderator Laurel Snyder. ""He seems to be an artist by nature and an author by default, and it shows."" Wegman knows it, too. At best, he's a ""part-time"" children's book author, a fact that became apparent to him in the company of established children's authors at the book festival. ""I don't have a TV show. You're not going to have a huge following unless you have a franchise or a creature -- something that gets in your imagination, whereas I just kind of dabble in children's books,"" he said. ""Everything that I do is sort of that way,"" he said. ""I think it's a product of being an artist in the '60s, where switching mediums was not alien."" Don't get Wegman wrong -- he loves children. He has two children of his own that he also likes to show off in pictures on his iPhone doing winter sports like ice skating and playing hockey. He also likes creating art with children, which he occasionally does in schools. They don't care about impressing William Wegman the artist -- even his appearances on ""Sesame Street"" with Fay Wray are too far in the past to register with them. ""They don't care about doing a William Wegman piece. They just want to do a Darth Vader piece, or disco dog,"" he said. ""Their language is mesmerizing."" If he could be anywhere, unsurprisingly, he'd be spending time with his dogs in the country, or taking photos of them in New York, where he spends about half the year. Dogs' personalities shine through in front of the camera, he said. It was true for Man Ray, who became ""very calm and interested"" when Wegman would point a camera at him. Same goes for Flo and Topper, who ""loves to be on top of things."" ""You really fall in love with them taking their pictures,"" he said. ""You learn so much about them.""","William Wegman's latest picture book ""Flo & Wendell Explore"" features photos and paintings .

"(CNN) -- The perils of online dating are well-documented. But the mantle of absurdity in dating folklore might now belong to a Los Angeles-area man, and it's for where his online flame turned up: behind his mantel. Genoveva Nunez-Figueroa had to be rescued over the weekend after becoming stuck inside of the chimney at a home in Thousand Oaks, California. According to the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, neighbors called police shortly before dawn Sunday to report the sound of a woman crying in the area. When they arrived, they found the source of those cries, and then ""carefully dismantled"" the chimney brick by brick in order to free the spurned and quite sooty 30-year-old. Nunez-Figueroa, who was conscious and alert, was taken to a hospital for evaluation and then arrested by the Thousand Oaks Police Department, accused of illegal entry and providing false information. According to the guy who lives inside, it wasn't the first time Nunez-Figueroa -- whom he'd met online and went on a few dates with -- had been ""over"" to his house. ""She seemed totally cool until the first flag was her actually being on my roof two weeks ago,"" the unnamed homeowner told CNN affiliate KTLA. ""I hope she gets help, and I hope she stays offline. But even if she doesn't, people are going to know who she is now,"" he said before looking directly into KTLA's camera and adding, ""you're welcome.""

"(CNN) -- Is your daughter a tomboy? Your son not especially into football? Does your daughter excel at math? Your son a skilled artist? Or does your daughter switch roles, relatively easily, from skinning her knees on a soccer field to worrying about what to wear to a party? Or does your son, like mine, come home sweaty and bruised from lacrosse practice only to sing gorgeously in the shower as a member of his high school a cappella group? If your answers are yes -- and probably most parents recognize some elements of these traits in their children -- you can breathe a bit easier today. That is, at least, if you happen to live in Wood County, West Virginia. That's because recently, under a legal challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union and its local affiliates, the Wood County Board of Education agreed to abandon for two school years its program of separating boys and girls into single-sex classes. The ACLU had filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and her daughters who claimed the sex segregation was a form of sex discrimination against girls. This little-noted legal settlement gives all of us -- parents, teachers, administrators, and kids themselves -- something to think about: Are single-sex classes really an effective way to educate our children? Historically, of course, single-sex schools -- especially private schools and colleges -- were the norm. But since the dawn of the 20th century, both educators and parents have seen them as historic anachronisms, especially for boys. Single-sex schools for girls may have challenged stereotypes, but single-sex schools for boys reproduced them, fostering what David Riesman and Christopher Jencks, in their monumental midcentury study, ""The Academic Revolution,"" called ""male arrogance."" Today, single-sex schools may provide some benefits, though these tend to be benefits that accompany the economic privilege of the families that can afford them. (That is, single sex private schools tend to also be schools for the elite.) But single-sex classes, in otherwise coeducational public schools, are entirely misguided. In recent years, single-sex classes in public schools have become increasingly popular as a low-cost remedy for two issues that plague our country's public school system: the efforts to encourage girls' ambitions in traditionally ""masculine"" arenas such as science, technology, engineering and math, and to address the ""boy crisis"" in schools, the chronic underachievement of boys, especially in traditionally ""feminine"" subjects such as English. It's a popular theory. After Title IX regulations changed in 2006, more than 1,000 public schools segregated at least some of their classes by sex, a 2010 Feminist Majority report said. The National Association for Single Sex Public Education states a lower number â€” it says 500 U.S. public schools ""offered single-sex educational opportunities"" for the 2011-12 school year. Regardless, the theory is wrong. In fact, single-sex classes might do more harm than good. To be sure, there is some anecdotal evidence that some students prefer single-sex classes (though they tend not to ""prefer"" to take calculus and we still insist they do). And especially in inner-city communities, single-sex ""academies"" have gained popularity because of their brilliant combination of rigid discipline, uniforms and powerful sense of community and school spirit. But, according to Pedro Noguera, an education expert, there is no research that shows the ""single-sex"" part of the equation has any independent effect on student performance. Instead, evidence points decidedly in the other direction. Single-sex classes reinforce harmful stereotypes about boys and girls. A 2011 article in the journal Science concluded that ""sex-segregated education is deeply misguided, and often justified by weak, cherry-picked, or misconstrued scientific claims rather than by valid scientific evidence. There is no well-designed research showing that single-sex education improves students' academic performance, but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism."" The article's authors, all researchers, were also members of the nonprofit American Council for CoEducational Schooling. These efforts are often based on the flawed notions of a few educational consultants, such as Dr. Leonard Sax. He's the founder of the National Association for Single Sex Public Education, which is now more innocuously titled the National Association for Choice in Education as if to obscure its actual mission. Under these theories, school districts have experimented with different curricula, seating arrangements, pedagogical styles and even room temperature, 72 degrees for girls and 68 degrees for boys. According to a brief filed by the ACLU in 2010, boys in one Louisiana school read ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" while girls read ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" because ""boys like 'hunting' and 'dogs,' but girls prefer 'love stories.' "" ""Girls tend to look on the teacher as an ally,"" the association's website explains. ""Given a little encouragement, they will welcome the teacher's help. A girl-friendly classroom is a safe, comfortable, welcoming place. Forget hard plastic chairs: put in a sofa and some comfortable beanbags."" In the case of Van Devender Middle School, the school in Wood County, West Virginia, the ACLU said the principal defended the layout of the boys' class -- students seated side-by-side, bright lighting because ""when they look at each other in the eye, it becomes more of a confrontational type of thing."" Girls had dimmer mood lighting, and they would, ""sit around tables, where they can make eye contact, where they can make relationships, and that sort of thing."" The ACLU said the mother who challenged the single-sex class arrangement was furious that one of her daughters was constantly told to sit still -- despite the fact that she had attention deficit disorder and the boys in the adjacent classroom had opportunities galore to move around. Another girl with poor vision struggled to read in the dimmer light. A third was prohibited from taking notes during a presentation because her teacher said that girls learn better through auditory, not visual, input. I assume that most of the parents of girls find such stereotypes deeply insulting. But I'd hope that parents of boys find them equally insulting -- that boys are only capable of learning in a Spartan setting, more like boot camp than school. What's the recommendations for boys -- that classes be experienced as unsafe, that we seat them in uncomfortable chairs, bark at them and make them read ""If"" and ""Invictus?"" We know that boys and girls are as different from each other as they are from every other child. Parents with larger families often see this better than parents who have one boy and one girl and observe categorical differences between the two, assuming that such differences are somehow biologically hard-wired. Good social science is different from good parenting, and requires a sample size greater than two. If you have, say, six kids, you'll describe one or two of your boys as ""more quiet, a bit shyer"" than the others, or a girl as ""the tomboy"" who ""loves to play sports."" Imagine what would happen to those ""nonconformists"" in a single sex class that is entirely oriented to the rough and tumble boys or the quiet girly-girls. Fortunately, the tide is turning. As the evidence mounts that single-sex classrooms confuse the norm with the normative, teaching to stereotypes rather than children, parents are challenging every effort as both discriminatory and harmful to their children. In the past year, the number of single-sex options in public schools dropped for the first time in more than a decade. Several schools -- including some in Boston; Pittsburgh; Madison, Wisconsin; and Durham, North Carolina -- have dropped existing or planned single-sex classes after ACLU involvement. Our nation's schools serve us best when they teach our children as individuals, with remarkably diverse personalities and learning styles. All our children -- boys and girls -- deserve no less. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Kimmel.","Michael Kimmel: Are single-sex classes an effective way to educate our children?

"Aleppo, Syria (CNN) -- They are so used to seeing blood outside Dar alShifa hospital, the magnet of all suffering in Aleppo, that passersby simply walk over it, oblivious. When they mop out the building's tiny reception area, the blood runs in small, dirty streams into the gutters. This is a hospital trying to get by day-to-day while lacking the most basic in supplies. It has itself been hit by shelling: two separate attacks have left its right side punctured with gaping holes in what was once the maternity ward. One afternoon, a rush of the most frail and vulnerable come towards the exhausted doctors; children, some suffering from sheer terror. One is malnourished. They have cuts, bruises -- but more often much worse. The government has, the doctors say, closed the main children's hospital owing to a paperwork issue, so this is where they must come. Baby survives as family dies in Syrian onslaught . Mohamed is aged eight and was hit by shrapnel from regime shelling in his right leg. It shattered his femur. In Europe, surgery would mean he's playing football again within months, but here a list of precarious challenges form. He remains quiet, brave, patient almost, as the doctors work out what to do. The tough natural solution they hit on is a stark reminder of how desperate the task is of getting medical care to the wounded here in rebel-held territory. The government hospital has better equipment, and can probably save Mohamed's leg. So, lifting him on the blankets they use as makeshift stretchers, they take him, bewildered and confused, into a nearby taxi to cross the front lines. His ordeal is far from over. It is perverse to know that only those who hurt him can also heal him. A Syrian family's desperate story . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose face adorns plastic skeletons used as teaching aids and trash cans inside Dar alShifa, still controls the best hospitals and much of the most precious medical resource: doctors. One medic, terrified enough that he doesn't want his face or voice on camera, is absurdly brave in the risks he takes every day to work in Dar alShifa. During the morning and afternoon, he works in the government hospital. But later, he too crosses the Line to come here. He paints a gruesome picture of caring for the Syrian regime's soldiers. Fifty a day are brought in, he tells me. Some are so wounded the doctors make a decision, he says, that sounds like it is born of mercy and perhaps rebel sympathies. Those soldiers with the worst, perhaps unsurvivable, injuries are given lethal injections. He tells me: ""If they found out I was working here, they would kill me."" Slain journalist's partner tells of grief . Suddenly, a truck arrives outside and little Ahmad is rushed inside. His right ear is hanging on only by a small thread of skin. Shrapnel -- as indiscriminate when it lands as the means by which it is fired -- hit the back of his head. The doctors work to clean the wound, but, as too often is the case, the lights and power fail. He lies there as a doctor with a head torch tries to pull the shrapnel from his head. The anesthetic they gave is not enough to stop him screaming in pain. But this is not the worst that will befall Ahmad. As he lies there, outside in the back of a truck slumps his father Yahya, lifeless, a hole in his chest from the same shrapnel. ""Allahu Akbar"" cry the men around his corpse. ""God is great."" They leave his body in the sidewalk until his brother arrives. Later his family will quickly drive the body away, so Ahmad can learn of his father's death at a more dignified time.","Children have become some of the main casualties during the Syrian civil war .

"Aleppo, Syria (CNN) -- It is impossible to get used to. The roar of a jet overhead, the hum of helicopter blades hovering around your block, the sudden thud of a blast. When you hear it, at least you know you are safe. Yet this has become daily life for residents of Aleppo. People living in rebel held territory, among whom the Free Syrian Army (FSA) mingle, and upon whom the Syrian regime's wrath is visited. The blasts continue throughout the day and also haunt the night. There is no perceivable pattern as to where they strike, for they don't appear to aim themselves at the few targets the FSA present. Their timing is also hard to follow: they hit most at dawn and dusk, yes, but the shells are sometimes few, sometimes sustained. And above all, they don't follow a pattern that suggests the artillery weapons are trying to hit-and-miss their way towards an objective. They simply fire, strike, and then move to a completely different place altogether. The only pattern to divine is that there is really no pattern, unless your aim is to terrify. That objective is simple when your target is an unarmed civilian population, defended at times by an often motley and ramshackle rebel army. The easiest way to discern there is trouble overhead is to see residents straining their necks upwards. A sniper's bullet, a dying child and a family's desperation . One morning at 6 a.m., shells and rockets slammed into the al-Shaar neighborhood of Aleppo. In one home, 12 people from the same extended family were huddled, mostly asleep. The rockets slammed into the roof, bringing the second floor down onto the first. We arrived four hours after the strike, once the neighborhood had had time to react and begun to dig its way into the rubble. It was a crowd of locals -- fathers and neighbors -- horrified at what was happening to their homes and community. The FSA stood around to rally vehicles to take away the wounded. The digging was furious: hands and shovels trying to prize away huge slabs of dusty concrete. Faces covered in dust, frantic groups of men trying to be large enough in number to get the job done but small enough to leave space to work in the cramped confines of a half-collapsed building. There is panic and frenzy, but finally a flurry of cries. ""Alla u akhbar,"" as they see a limb. Then a leg, eventually the limp body of a little girl pulled from the rubble. A blanket is rushed forwards to cover her face: they are too late, and preserving her dignity in death is all they can do. The search continues amid the endless threat that the helicopters which fired the original rockets may strike again and the risk that the building's half-filled second floor might cave in entirely. When buildings collapse, the dead are often found in groups, huddled in the same room where they sleep. In this case, the father is found shortly after the daughter. A woman outside the rubble screams: ""I swear to God we have been destroyed. I swear to God, Bashar al Assad is killing us"". But the bodies kept coming, 11 dead in total, nine of them children. They are rushed by the furious FSA to the hospital, the children placed under blankets and laid in the back of a pickup truck. Aged from four to 11. Omar, Mohamed, Fatma. One of their fathers is too distraught to name all the dead -- two related families, one of which had gone to visit the other. But amid the incomprehensible brutality, the people in this corner of Aleppo find a gift. He is barely a year old and called Hussein. He was pulled from the rubble, a simple act of care having saved his life. Hussein's mother, Najah, was breastfeeding him when the rockets struck. Najah was killed by the rubble, but her body sheltered Hussein. He is brought to the hospital, the men cursing Syrian President Bashar al Assad as a ""dog"" and hoping Hussein will live to see him hanged. They tear off his dusty clothes and clean his body, a symbol of their perseverance. Born into this bloody and continuing revolution, they pray he will grow up in a very different Syria.

"(CNN) -- While America faces many big issues -- unrest in the Middle East, the effects of climate change, uneven economic growth, growing income inequality, a costly and less than optimal health care system and more -- the contest to control the House and Senate does not really seem to be turning into a defining struggle over the national agenda. Clearly the 2014 midterm elections aren't generating much excitement on the hustings. According to Gallup, voter enthusiasm is down significantly since 2010. Republicans are more enthused than Democrats, according to Gallup, but neither party is doing very well. Given that many of the key races in competitive states might come down to a small percentage of voters, as is usually the case in midterms, enthusiasm and its impact on turnout can be decisive on Election Day. This election won't be like 1994, when Republicans took control of Congress with a rightward push, or 2006, when Democrats did the same with campaigns to move beyond President George W. Bush's conservatism. In those midterm elections, voters were mobilized as people came to believe that the collective outcome of the races offered a huge opportunity for their parties. Obama's midterm malaise . Why do so many people seem to be sleepwalking through these races? Part of the problem has to do with the fact that neither party is in great shape. Democrats and Republicans face fundamental internal challenges going into November, big long-term problems that have significantly dampened much of the enthusiasm on each side. For Republicans, the vice remains political extremism. Over the past six years, Republicans have been dragged down by the actions of congressional Republicans associated with the right wing, the tea party faction. As House Republicans were pushed further to the right and the party embraced an extraordinarily ruthless approach to handling the challenges of governance -- willing to take measures such as threatening to throw the nation into default over budget disputes -- the party's popularity has plummeted. Republicans were forced to devote an extraordinary amount of their time and energy during this year's primaries to navigating through an intraparty battle between tea party and establishment factions who were vying to face off against Democrats. Republicans fight for 2014's early voters . For tea party Republicans, the problem is a leadership that has become too embedded in Washington, too comfortable with the political status quo. For other Republicans, the tea party is the problem: They have dragged down the reputation of their party, making it seem incapable of leadership, decision-making or rational deliberation. The struggles within the GOP are so severe that it is difficult for Republican voters to perceive November to be a great rallying moment for candidates and their party. They just want to secure control of the Senate, more focused on what they are against, namely President Barack Obama, rather than what they are for. There has been some evidence in recent days that Republican candidates are finding themselves under pressure in states such as Georgia and South Dakota, where victory should have been a slam dunk. Democrats are doing even worse than the GOP when it comes to enthusiasm. President Obama has become the problem as he finds himself in a similar position to President George W. Bush. Democratic candidates are struggling to figure out how far they need to go in disassociating themselves with the president of their own party. Gergen: White House blames Panetta, not its own faults . For many liberals, President Obama has failed to deliver on key promises from 2008, ranging from measures to combat climate change to liberalized immigration rules and dealing with the growing problem of economic inequality. President Obama has done a lot of talking, but he has not been as successful at achieving his goals. And he has not displayed the aggressive political style that many on the left believe is needed to counteract fierce Republican opposition. For moderates and independents, there is growing unease and discomfort with the way in which Obama has handled the implementation of health care, the problems with the economy and the response to the growth of ISIS. Some of these criticisms have come to the forefront with the recent publication of Leon Panetta's book, ""Worthy Fights,"" in which he charges the President had been too passive in handling foreign policy . Former Sen. and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said to The New York Times that first-term Sen. Mark Udall could only win if he demonstrates to voters that he stands for ""the Colorado way, not the Obama way or the Democratic way."" Given that so many prominent Democrats are focused on separating themselves from the president from their own party, rather than proudly running on his record, it makes it difficult to rally around a platform and agenda. There are some factors that the parties can't control. Everyone these days seems disgusted with Washington, so it's difficult for people to be enthusiastic that anything will break through the gridlock. The improvement in the economy also makes it harder for both parties to rally the troops than in 2010, when the recession generated more anger and zeal about the elections. But there are some problems the parties can try to address. Democrats and Republicans who are getting ready to launch a candidacy for the 2016 election should be paying close attention and thinking hard about how they can move their respective parties beyond this state of affairs. Effective Republican candidates need to prove that they will make their party a serious governing force in Washington. Democrats will need to show, without creating so much distance from the President that they simply offer fodder to their Republican critics, that they can greatly improve upon and transcend what Obama has accomplished. Until then, most voters will have difficulty believing that either party is capable of moving government in a new direction and solving the problems that confront the nation.","Polls show voters are not caught up in the election, with Democrats even less enthusiastic .

"(CNN) -- A man involved in an excessive force lawsuit against police in Hammond, Indiana, faces arrest on seven-year-old marijuana charges, according to documents provided by his attorney. Jamal Jones and his partner, Lisa Mahone, are suing the city and police after a traffic stop in which an officer smashed a window next to Jones and used a stun gun on him. Police have said Jones refused to identify himself and repeatedly ignored requests to step out of the car after officers feared he had a weapon. Dana Kurtz, an attorney for Jones, said the arrest warrant on a 2007 misdemeanor charge of dealing in marijuana is ""retaliation."" ""Jamal was unaware of the warrant but will comply with the law. The traffic stop had nothing to do with this,"" Kurtz said. Hammond police didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. On September 24, two officers pulled the family over because the two front passengers -- Mahone was driving --- were not wearing seat belts. Both police and the family argued they feared for their safety during the traffic stop, which was videotaped by a teenager in the car. The video in question . ""I'm scared for my life,"" Lisa Mahone says in the video. Jones is talking to officers gathered outside his door. His window is rolled down only a few inches. ""I don't know what's going on,"" he says. Joseph Ivy, 14, and Janiya Ivy, 7, are in the back seat. One of them holds a camera, recording the exchange. ""Are you going to open the door?"" an officer asks Jones. ""How can you say they are not going to hurt you? People are getting shot by the police!"" Mahone says before her voice breaks into screams as an officer smashes the passenger window. Jones joins her screams as his body convulses from the electric shock of the stun gun. Officers then pull him out of the car, handcuff him and take him away. Fear on both sides . Minutes before the incident, Mahone was driving to the hospital to visit her dying mother when she was stopped by Hammond Police Officers Patrick Vicari and Charles Turner. The officers placed spike strips under the car's wheels and approached Mahone. Mahone ""informed the officers that her mother was dying and that (they) were on the way to the hospital to see her before she died,"" the lawsuit says. ""Rather than issuing Lisa (Mahone) a ticket for failure to wear a seat belt, the officers demanded that Jamal (Jones), the passenger, provide the officers with his identification as well."" But Jones didn't have any identification. He had previously turned over his license for an unrelated citation. ""Jamal offered to show the officers the ticket, which had his information on it, but the officers refused,"" the complaint reads. Police tell a different story. Call to 911 . Jones refused to identify himself and repeatedly ignored requests to step out of the car, Hammond Police spokesman Lt. Richard Hoyda said. ""The first officer saw the passenger inside the vehicle drop his left hand behind the center console inside of the vehicle. Fearing for officer safety, the first officer ordered the passenger to show his hands and then repeatedly asked him to exit the vehicle,"" Hoyda said. Meanwhile, Mahone was on the phone with a 911 operator requesting to speak to a supervisor. 'Fear for their safety' Mahone, Jones and the children ""were in reasonable fear for their safety,"" the complaint says. ""After a minute or two for no reason, the officers drew their weapons."" At this point Mahone is heard pleading with someone in the video. ""He (Jones) is looking for his information in his book bag. When he goes into his book bag, they pull a gun out. What was the purpose of a gun? And now they ask me to open my door so I can get out. I'm scared. If you can pull out a gun in front of ... there is two kids in the back seat."" Both the police department and city officials are standing by the officers. ""Police officers who make legal traffic stops are allowed to ask passengers inside of a stopped vehicle for identification and to request that they exit a stopped vehicle for the officer's safety without a requirement of reasonable suspicion,"" Hoyda said. Hammond Mayor Thomas M. McDermott Jr. cited two recent police officer deaths in Indiana as the reason for heightened precautions. ""While I hope that situations like this one can be avoided in the future, I am standing solidly behind the actions of these police officers,"" McDermott said. Mahone was cited for failure to wear a seat belt and a license plate reciprocity violation. Jones was arrested and accused of failure to aid an officer, resisting law enforcement and was also cited for a seat belt violation, Hoyda said. Lawsuit . In the lawsuit filed this week in the Northern District Court of Indiana, Mahone, Jones and the two children accuse the city, Vicari, Turner and ""other unknown officers"" of excessive force, false arrest and imprisonment, assault and battery, and Intentional infliction of emotional distress. Hammond Police directed media inquiries to the law firm Eichhorn & Eichhorn. CNN called the firm and asked whether they were representing Hammond Police regarding the September incident. An unidentified woman said, ""That's true and we have no comment."" CNN attempted to contact Turner and Vicari, but was unsuccessful. Using Taser on an 8-year-old? Mom sues police, city .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The number of anti-Semitic incidents around the world more than doubled from 2008 to 2009, according to a Tel Aviv University study. In 2009, 1,129 such incidents were recorded -- an increase of more than 100 percent from the 559 incidents noted in 2008, according to the study, released Sunday by the university's Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism and Racism. ""In addition, many more hundreds of threats, insults, graffiti signs and slogans and demonstrations featuring virulently anti-Semitic content were registered, sometimes resulting in violence,"" the study said. Researchers documented only those incidents that showed ""clear anti-Semitic content and intention,"" according to the study. However, the actual number might be higher, as some Jews may not have reported incidents, the study said. The sharp increase can, at least partially, be attributed to Israel's incursion into Gaza in late 2008 and early 2009. The 22-day operation ""triggered a wave of anti-Semitic manifestations that swept the world,"" the study said. ""This trend subsided in February and March, but even during the months that followed this peak of anti-Semitic incidents, the baseline remained higher than before the war. ""In fact, there has been a rising trend since the early 1990s, even in years when there was no significant Middle East trigger. Thus, the origins of the 2009 escalation in anti-Semitic expressions must lie deeper."" Arie Zuckerman of the European Jewish Congress, a co-sponsor of the report, said: ""In the past we have seen spikes in the level of anti-Semitism after violent events occurred in the Mideast, but it would recede. But we have never seen such a sustained, organized campaign being waged against Israel's legitimacy and its supporters around the world."" The report said, ""Memory of the Holocaust lies at the core of much anti-Israel and anti-Semitic agitation. It encapsulates several and even contradictory themes: the Holocaust did not happen; Zionists use the Holocaust to divert attention from Israeli actions against Palestinians; it's a pity that not all Jews were murdered in the Holocaust; Israeli behavior is comparable to that of the Nazis."" For purposes of the study, researchers considered incidents involving physical violence, not verbal threats -- an assault on an individual, for instance, vandalism at Jewish institutions or arson. The largest increase in the number of violent anti-Semitic incidents and vandalism in 2009 occurred in the United Kingdom -- 374, compared with 112 in 2008, according to the study. The number of incidents in France rose from 50 to 195. There were repeated attacks on synagogues in France as well as a September incident in which a Molotov cocktail was thrown at the Jewish ORT Bramson High School in Marseille. No one was injured, but a fence and vehicles were damaged. The United Kingdom and France are home to the largest Jewish communities in Europe, the report said. Both also have some of the largest Muslim communities in the European Union ""and since 2000, in particular, have become centers for the activities of extremist anti-Israel groups and individuals that preach and disseminate anti-Semitic messages."" Other incidents in Europe included a March 2009 attack on three Jews in Brussels, Belgium. The victims were beaten with a steel bar, while the perpetrators shouted ""Allah Akbar"" or ""Allah is great"" and ""Yahud, Yahud"" or ""Jews, Jews."" One victim was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the study. In Canada, anti-Semitic incidents rose from 13 in 2008 to 138 in 2009. The United States posted a small rise -- 116 from 98. The study points out that many countries where anti-Semitism has risen have large Muslim minorities. Traditionally, in the past anti-Jewish acts were the product of right-wing, neo-Nazi groups, but the study said most of the European incidents in which perpetrators were classified pointed to those of Arab or Muslim background. The study expressed great concern over what it called ""the abuse of the Holocaust as a political tool ... the equation of Israelis/Zionists/Jewish supporters of Israel with Nazis became practically an axiom in demonstrations and in expressions voiced in the political and academic arena. The equation of the Star of David with the swastika symbolizes the ultimate evil --- extreme brutality and a disregard for human values -- and implies that those that allegedly behave like Nazis, the monster of the modern era, have no right to exist."" Anti-Israel activists often insist they are not against Jews as individuals but are opposed to Israeli policies regarding the Palestinians. But the study insists that those distinctions are being blurred. ""Incited by demonization of Israel and the idea that 'Jews must pay,' perpetrators of anti-Semitism make no distinction between Israel and Jews worldwide, who for them are part of a single evil entity."" The study was released the day before Holocaust Remembrance Day. Sirens sounded nationwide in Israel for two minutes Monday in observance. In remarks Sunday night at a state commemoration of the day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took note of anti-Israeli sentiment. ""Here we are today again, witnesses to the fire of the new-old hatred, the hatred of the Jews, that is expressed by organizations and regimes associated with radical Islam, headed by Iran and its proxies,"" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu called on nations to oppose such sentiment. ""If we learned anything from the lessons of the Holocaust, it is that we must not remain silent and be deterred in the face of evil.""

"(CNN) -- Congress is reaching a point where it will no longer be able to function at all. Over the past two years, some members of the Republican Party have ramped up the partisan wars on Capitol Hill. They are threatening to bring the legislative process to a standstill. For many years, journalists and scholars have lamented the rise of partisan polarization on Capitol Hill. The number of moderates has vastly declined and the number of bills that receive bipartisan support has greatly diminished. The usual culprits range from the advent of the 24-hour news cycle to changing demographics. But now observers are starting to note that both parties are not equally to blame, especially in recent years. In their new book, ""It's Even Worse Than It Looks,"" Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein -- two of the most prominent talking heads in Washington, known for their balanced view and proclivity toward moderation -- say that the Republican Party is to blame. ""The GOP,"" they wrote in a Washington Post op-ed based on the book, ""has become an insurgent outlier in American politics."" Mann and Ornstein trace the partisan style back to the emergence of Newt Gingrich and Grover Norquist in the 1970s, when the two men promoted a style of slash-and-burn, take-no-prisoners politics that has remained integral to the strategy of congressional Republicans. There is always a certain amount of nostalgia in American politics. The notion that Congress used to be a better place is one of the staple arguments in public rhetoric. But there are times when things are worse than usual. While both parties have played roles in the growth of polarization since the 1970s, since 2007 congressional Republicans have been taking the partisan wars to new extremes in several areas. The first is with the kind of brinksmanship budgetary politics that has now become normative. Last week, House Speaker John Boehner once again threatened that Republicans would not vote to increase the debt ceiling unless Democrats agreed to certain tax and spending policies sought by the GOP. Republicans have used this tactic repeatedly in the past few years, each time bringing the nation closer to the brink of default. This is no way to decide on a budget or to handle the nation's debt. Holding the debt ceiling hostage to win political battles has undermined international confidence in the U.S. political system. It has also created an unhealthy atmosphere where politicians are willing to take great risks with the goal of winning certain legislative battles. There need to be some limits to what legislators are willing to do in the pursuit of victory. The second way Republicans push the envelope of partisanship is with the filibuster. As political junkies know, use of the filibuster has greatly increased since the 1970s. Both parties have been guilty. A tool once reserved for high-profile legislation such as civil rights became a normalized tool of combat making the Senate a supermajoritarian body on almost every decision. Senators don't even have to filibuster anymore. They can simply raise the threat and that brings the discussion to an end. Senators have also employed additional tactics such as anonymous holds, whereby senators can secretly prevent action on a bill and nobody can know who was responsible. But the number of filibusters by Republicans has escalated, and they have been far more willing to use the tactic than their opponents. Since 2007, the Senate Historical Office has shown, Democrats have had to end Republican filibusters more than 360 times, a historic record. Finally, there has been a much sharper shift to the right within the Republican Party than there has been to the left in the Democratic Party. Here, too, the data is rather clear. In January, political scientists Kenneth Poole and Christopher Hare concluded, based on their close analysis of the roll call vote, that ""in the last few Congresses, the overlap has vanished; that is, the most liberal Republican is to the right of the most conservative Democrat."" Last week, the political-science blog The Monkey Cage pointed out that Sen. Richard Lugar's political positions have changed little since he entered the Senate in 1977, and yet: ""In his first term in Congress, Sen. Lugar was the 23rd most moderate Republican in the Senate; in the most recent term (through 2011), he was the fifth most moderate."" As Lugar's recent primary loss shows, Republican activists are now targeting any member of the party who can be tagged as centrists, and they are pushing their caucus farther to the right, making compromise almost impossible. The current hardening of these procedural wars has some resemblance to the 1950s, when Southern committee chairmen, who were then the kings of Capitol Hill, used their power in the House and Senate to prevent any kind of progress on issues such as civil rights or health care. Although a series of events allowed for a huge legislative breakthrough in 1964 and 1965, the Southern committee chairs regained power after the 1966 midterm elections and continued to assert their power in the closed rooms of Capitol Hill. The situation reached a boiling point in the 1970s, when in the aftermath of Watergate, reformers transformed the system by weakening committee chairs, empowering party leaders and opening up the legislative process through sunshine rules and more. It could be that Republicans will take things so far that we may reach one of those rare moments when congressional reform happens. If reform does not happen, and these trends continue, the nation will be left with an inoperative legislative process that can't handle the problems we face with the economy, social problems and foreign policy. This is a situation that should be of equal concern to the right, left and center. Without a functional Congress, the nation's government will not be able to live up to the challenges of the day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Congress is reaching a point where it will no longer be able to function .

"Washington (CNN) -- An officer with Washington's Metropolitan Police Department came under an unprovoked attack Friday from a man wielding an ax, police said, the second such attack in two weeks that is prompting warnings and new protocols to officers on the job. The attack, and another last week in which a man attacked four New York City officers with a hatchet in Queens, prompted an immediate increase in security for officers in both D.C. and New York. The New York Police Department said in a memo: ""Police Officers on patrol should maintain a heightened level of awareness."" The attack in Washington occurred around 3 a.m. as the officer was sitting in his marked squad car in Washington's Brookland neighborhood, near the campus of Catholic University of America, police said. The officer, who hasn't been identified, wasn't injured by the ax, but he chased the suspect and suffered a shoulder injury in a scuffle before the attacker ran away, police said. No motive is known and the suspect remains at large. Police said he was an African-American man about 6 feet tall and of stocky build. A photo provided to CNN by a law enforcement official shows the ax implanted in the window of the police car, just inches away from where the officer's head was inside the car. Metropolitan Police Chief Cathy Lanier issued a warning to officers to increase their vigilance for their safety, amid concern about recent attacks on authorities in New York and Canada, a law enforcement official told CNN. In reaction to the Washington attack, the NYPD issued new patrol protocols to its officers to increase security, including ""Effective immediately, all foot posts are to be assigned in pairs of two. There are to be no solo foot posts assigned citywide."" The memo said officers will be required to remain together and take meal breaks in pairs. Mary Kay Mallonee and Evan Perez contributed to this report.","A D.C. police officer was attacked in his car with an ax Friday, police say .

"London (CNN) -- Delicate, rare and striking - forgotten photographs of black Britons in the late 19th and early 20th century have been unearthed from the depths of the Hulton Archive -- one of the world's oldest and largest archives holding over 80 million images. Black Chronicles II, a photographic exhibition at Rivington Place in East London is currently showcasing over 200 images that explore black presences in Victorian Britain, the majority of which have never been revealed to the public. Part of ""The Missing Chapter"" -- a three-year project devoted to researching and revealing the earliest imagery of black people in Britain -- curators RenÃ©e Mussai and Mark Sealy of archive and research centre Autograph ABP have re-introduced a neglected part of history to the public consciousness. ""We have been doing this work around black representation through the prism of photography for 25 years,"" says Mussai. ""What we wanted to do with this research project was to expand, if you like, the narrative back to the very early days - to the invention of photography in 1839."" Going far back in time . The history of black people in Britain is most commonly traced back to 1948, when the ""Empire Windrush"" ship carried 492 Jamaican passengers to British shores, following an ad in a Jamaican newspaper promising affordable carriage on board for those seeking a new life and work in the UK. Searching for images taken prior to this moment proved to be both exciting and overwhelming. ""We didn't know what we would find in the archive."" Mussai exclaims. ""The Hulton Archive didn't know what they had because they didn't look at it with this particular remit in mind, and with 80 million records, you can imagine things get lost!"" After extensive rummaging, a wealth of hitherto unknown photographs, carte-de-visites (thin paper photograph mounted on thick paper card), cabinet cards and albumen prints resurfaced. A different light . Among the various treasures found, Mussai highlights the intriguing case of Kalulu, a young African boy whose photographs are featured in the exhibit. Images of Kalulu are easily searchable online and in various publications, but he is often portrayed as servant to Sir Henry Morton Stanley - the infamous writer and explorer of central Africa. The images in the exhibition, in contrast, center on Kalulu alone. He is not an accessory or an extra part; he is instead the main focus. ""Kalulu holds his own in the frame and is dressed in an outfit that any other boy of that era would wear -- not a cloth, not semi-naked."" says Mussai. Visualizing existence . The images, however, do more than point to a history that has been overlooked and neglected, they ask the question of who documents our histories and who gets to choose them. Mussai holds that the preference for certain stories and the evasion of others relates to how we prioritize different people's existence. ""The most important thing to remember here is that when one is not visualized in history, one doesn't exist."" Says Mussai. ""So in terms of memory, in terms of contribution and actually being here -- people are often erased...that means their existence is not acknowledged."" These images do occupy a specific time-frame, loosely between the ends of 1830 - 1940s, but the chapter, so to speak, is not over and done with. In fact, the aim of the project is to constantly revise and evaluate a neglected era rather than to fill in the holes and then move on. ""These gaps will always exist and there will always be more"" says Mussai. Wider collaboration . Much of the project's excitement is tied to unpredictability, a sense of continuous discovery as new images are unearthed from neglected albums across the globe. People are now submitting images from their own personal collections in a bid to help construct a history that has been forgotten -- a welcome by-product of the current showcase at Rivington Place. ""Someone currently based in Canada has sent through about 8 or 9 cabinet card scans of his family here in Britain, I think his great-great-grandmother came from Jamaica originally"" Mussai exclaims. ""There were photographs in the studio which appear to be from the 1860s, judging from the scan."" Despite the success of the research so far, the current collection dates back only to the 1850s. Baring in mind photography was invented in the late 1830s, an approximate 10 years' worth of photos are still left to be uncovered. The search for the earliest photograph of a black person in the UK, it seems, is still underway. ""Even if we find it, there is absolutely no certainty that it is the earliest"" Says Mussai."" So far however, the journey to such discovery has proven to be just as important as the discovery itself. ""All we can do is move close and closer.""

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron and the ""No"" campaign are entitled to savor their victory in the referendum on Scottish independence. At the end of the day, the Union flag still flies with Scotland's Cross of St. Andrew. But Cameron and the No campaign should resist the temptation to whistle past the graveyard of Scottish nationalism. Despite the success of the No vote, the genie of nationalism is now out of the bottle. Fourty-five percent of the Scottish voters opted for straight-out independence in a referendum in which they faced the stark choice of severing the fraternal bonds of the United Kingdom entirely or sticking with an unpalatable status quo. Had the referendum included a middle way calling for greater autonomy for Scotland within the union, it would no doubt have won by a landslide. Only dire predictions of life alone in the cold bolstered by last-minute promises of greater autonomy if Scotland stayed kept the Yes campaign in a bare minority. One could fairly criticize Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond for pushing the United Kingdom to the brink of a Tartan divorce with England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. But we should not ignore the British government's part in this political drama. Cameron and his colleagues under-estimated the strength of Scottish nationalism until the 11th hour and then, in panic, gave away the middle ground of greater autonomy that the Prime Minister had initially refused to put on the ballot. Many of those promises of greater autonomy and home-rule north of the River Tweed will now have to be kept at significant cost. And London's concessions to Edinburgh are likely to accelerate the ""devolution revolution"" in other parts of the United Kingdom, including England itself, which will further federalize it, shifting British politics in unexpected directions. Things will be interesting going forward both in Scotland and other regions of Great Britain as a result. Last night's victors should also keep in mind that nationalism often flourishes in defeat -- for example, the well-spring of the Serbian nationalism that caused so much turmoil in the Balkans during the 1990s was the loss of the Battle of the Kosovo Fields to the Turks 625 years ago. Scottish nationalism is equally durable in the face of adversity. The English King Edward Longshanks captured Scottish rebel William Wallace in 1305 and publically eviscerated him in an attempt to smother the flames of resistance to English rule. But a scant nine years later Robert the Bruce secured the independence of his throne at the Battle of Bannockburn. While ethnic, linguistic, and religious separatist sentiment waxes and wanes in the modern era, it still persists despite set-backs. Quebecois separatism in Canada was defeated handily at the polls in 1980 but came back again with even greater support in 1995, only narrowly failing that time. It is important for the developed world to acknowledge and accommodate nationalist sentiment because as we have seen many other places in the world, when repressed it often explodes in violence. The breakup of the great colonial empires after World War II saw one wave of violent separatism crest, its nationalist substructure obscured by the ideological overlay of the Cold War. A post-Cold War wave destroyed the new Communist identities in the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and clearly highlighted the persistence of nationalism in modern politics. Today, the fragmenting of the artificial states of the Middle East -- particularly Syria and Iraq -- and the Ukraine emphasize the marriage of national with religious identities as the bedrock of 21st Century political identity in many parts of the world. While hardly anyone expects the violence that characterized nationalist struggle on the margins or outside of the developed world will spill over into Europe, there are plenty of nations-without-states there who watched events in Scotland with more than a passing interest. The Catalans and Andalusians in Spain, Basques in Spain and France, the Flemish in Belgium, the Corsicans in France, and the Sardinians in Italy all chafe to a greater or lesser extent under the rule of other peoples. The challenge for Britain and the other countries in the developed world facing calls for greater autonomy by proto-nationalist groups is to respond effectively within their democratic processes to demands for greater autonomy. The first step is not to be taken by surprise by separatism's persistence; the second is to respond to it with meaningful change before it reaches a crisis. This will be tricky, as the last few months in the United Kingdom amply demonstrate, but they face no choice. The future of challenge of world politics will remain the sorting out the incongruity between formal political structures and actual political identities. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Desch.","Despite the success of the No vote in Scotland, the genie of nationalism is now out of the bottle, writes Michael Desch .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- In the opening days of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial, a journalist's laptop starting making noise near the back of the court. ""What is that?"" came a voice, gentle but firm, from the judge's bench. ""I'm sorry, my lady,"" a foreign journalist stammered over the loud American-accented announcement issuing from her computer, declaring that it had found viruses and was beginning a scan. ""Stand up, please,"" the judge said. Struggling to silence her computer, the journalist complied as a hush fell over the court. She repeated her apology, explaining that new software had been installed on her computer and she was closing it down. The judge regarded the journalist silently, a schoolmistress displeased with a naughty child, as everyone in court looked on. A long, agonizing moment ticked by. ""You may sit down,"" the judge instructed the journalist. Every hand in court instantly reached for a laptop or phone to make sure it was on silent. The judge had never raised her voice. Her name is Thokozile Matilda Masipa, and she is the woman who has decided the fate of Oscar Pistorius. She was the ""my lady"" all the witnesses addressed when testifying, even though they were normally answering questions from male lawyers. A diminutive figure who moves slowly due to arthritis, Masipa was been the still, small center of the trial, calmly taking notes or watching unruffled, chin resting on her folded hands, as lawyers preened, witnesses stammered and the defendant wept. INTERACTIVE: Explore each side's case . Ground-breaking career . Masipa was a historic figure in South Africa even before the world's most famous disabled athlete landed in her courtroom on a murder charge. She was the second black woman to become a judge in the country, turning to the law after a career as a social worker and a crime reporter for the Sowetan newspaper. Mannie Witz, one of South Africa's top defense lawyers, spent a year as her tutor when she was studying to become a lawyer. He remembers his surprise when he first met her in 1991. ""She was older than me,"" he said of his student. ""A black woman, she had a son, a husband. At a much later stage in life she decided to become an advocate,"" as South Africans call some types of lawyers. She was a star student, Witz said. ""She really applied herself. She passed with flying colors,"" he said. A former colleague from her newspaper journalism days has an explanation. ""We were doing things and Matilda was not there,"" said Nomavenda Mathiane, using the name by which Masipa was known in those days. ""After work Matilda would go to the library and study."" Masipa saw a future which her colleagues could not imagine when black South Africans were resisting apartheid, her old friend said. ""If you look at where she came from and where she ended up -- she knew one day we would be there and (asked herself) 'Will I be ready when we get there?'"" It's hard for outsiders to see the magnitude of the symbolism of Masipa presiding over this trial, Mathiane said. ""This is a woman from the dusty streets of the township. Today she is trying a white boy in my lifetime ... I never thought that would happen."" Through a court clerk, Masipa declined to answer questions for this article, refusing even to provide basic biographical details. A law journal announcement from March 1999 saying that she had become a judge said she practiced law from 1991 to 1998 before her appointment to the bench. It listed her hobbies as dancing, gardening and yoga, and the rehabilitation of offenders as one of her legal interests. Not swayed by emotions or hype . Speaking before the verdict was announced, Witz said he was confident that Masipa would come to the right decision in the Pistorius case. ""There is a lot of emotional stuff"" surrounding the case, he pointed out, but predicted Masipa would rule based on the facts and the law. ""She's not the kind of person that will be swayed by emotions,"" he said, calling her ""diligent"" and ""capable -- more than capable."" In fact, Witz argued, despite all the publicity surrounding the defendant, the actual facts of the Pistorius case are ""not difficult."" Masipa's law clerk Suzette Naude, speaking before the verdict was announced, said the judge had made a conscious decision not to be swayed by the hype around the case and its star defendant. ""She told me from the beginning, 'We will treat this case as a normal case, as all other cases.' She's not showing much emotion about the case. And she's not telling me how she's feeling, she's very private about it,"" Naude said. But the largely impassive woman on the bench showed a different face behind the scenes, her clerk said. ""She's a different person in court than in the office. She's very relaxed and friendly,"" Naude said. ""She's a wonderful judge to work for. I've been working with her since January and she's just always smiling. Almost like working for an angel."" Concern for Pistorius . Masipa was assisted during the trial by two experts called assessors. Both of them, Themba Mazibuko and Jannette Henzen-DuToit, are advocates. They helped the judge decide on questions of fact, but only she could rule only on matters of law. South Africa does not have jury trials. She has stayed in her post past the normal retirement age of 65, Witz said -- she will be 67 in October. But she was not chosen specially for the Pistorius case -- she simply happened to be assigned to it, he said. Lawyers like arguing before her, Witz said. ""She has a good reputation. She's polite. She treats you with courtesy,"" he said. She went out of her way to show concern for Pistorius, particularly early in the trial when he wept, wailed and was violently sick in court, and again during his seven days on the witness stand. She stopped proceedings on occasion to give him time to compose himself, arguing that it would not be fair to have a defendant who could not represent himself adequately. (It could in fact be grounds for appeal if he is convicted.) But she came down hard on any distractions or interruptions in court, making one of the young defense lawyers stand and apologize when his phone went off in court, warning journalists against some uses of Twitter -- thought it was not clear she was very familiar with social media -- and firmly reprimanding a lawyer who appeared to be enjoying his cross-examination too much. ""This is not entertainment,"" she rebuked prosecutor Gerrie Nel. But she also seemed to have flirted gently with Nel on occasion, such as when he stumbled trying to get his tongue around some technical language. He stammered, saying it was difficult to pronounce the phrase with her looking at him. ""I won't look at you,"" she said with a twinkle in her eye and a gentle smile.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The fact-checkers have been out in force for months. With the presidential and vice presidential debates fully under way, and both parties claiming that their opponents are liars, websites and news shows are inundated with experts and reporters who inform voters about whether candidates are making claims that have little basis in fact. Like the card game ""B.S,"" in which players call fellow players when they lie about what card has been put into the collective pile, the fact-checkers shout out to Americans when they find that politicians are injecting falsehood into the news cycle. But it is not clear what impact the fact checkers are having on the public at large or, nearly as important, on the politicians. They keep laying out the facts and the politicians keep stretching the truth. There is little evidence that the public is outraged by any of the revelations nor that it has any real influence on how the politicians conduct themselves, other than to provide more campaign fodder for attacks on their opponents. Complete coverage: CNN Fact Check . What is going on? Why does all the new access to data via the Internet and the cottage industry of fact-checking experts seem to have so little influence on the basic dynamics of the election? Even with live bloggers tracking every word during the debate, the candidates are having no trouble stretching the truth or fabricating facts for their own purposes. At least thus far the polls don't seem to be registering any significant effects when the candidates are called out for doing this. Why isn't there a penalty for lying? One of the biggest challenges for fact-checkers is that they must work in a political culture that, since the 1970s has been deeply distrustful of government and politicians. Polls consistently show that trust in government has steadily fallen since Vietnam with just a few temporary upticks. The public doesn't think much of politicians, nor do they ever expect them to tell the truth. We live with the ghosts of Watergate. So when fact-checking organizations try to point out when politicians are stretching the truth, giving them Pinocchio noses for having made claims that have little bearing in fact, the public just isn't surprised. In fact, these revelations just confirm the general impression that the public has of their leaders. As a result, the fact-checkers fade in the noise of the media frenzy over the campaign. Fact-checkers must also work within a media environment that has become more polarized and openly partisan in recent years. As the norms of objectivity have weakened in many news outlets and reporters become more vocal about their political views, Americans tend to rely on websites and television stations where they expect to hear news with the partisan slant that they prefer. It is harder to find news that is really fair and balanced; the public assumes that everything they hear or read has an agenda. It is difficult for any source to break through this belief. Objective fact-checkers must also compete with openly partisan fact-checkers. The political parties and other political organizations have turned these operations to their own ends. They have released information attacking the veracity of their opponents, playing into an argument that has become important to their campaign. It's hard for people to distinguish between partisan and real fact-checkers. Democrats have made a central theme of this campaign how Republicans are not telling the truth. ""Facts matter,"" Biden said during the vice presidential debate. After Paul Ryan's acceptance speech at the convention, Democrats released an onslaught of attacks going through his claims. We have seen this same dynamic after the debates as well. Republicans have responded in kind. White House clarifies Biden's remarks on Libya . The partisanship that shapes our politics has many costs. Congress has trouble making decisions, tensions among voters over certain issues are often severe, and the quality of our discourse often suffers. Perhaps one of the worst effects of partisanship, however, has been the fact that the truth is much harder to discern and, in many cases, voters don't even expect it. The public lives in a world where it seems impossible to know what is fact and what is partisan fiction. Fact checkers, many of whom have legitimate and virtuous objectives to get Americans to really understand the choices before them, have trouble gaining much traction. When one of the players calls ""B.S."" during the political cycle, people might be listening, but it's not clear that there are lasting consequences. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Fact checking has grown tremendously in this election .

"(CNN) -- Atletico Madrid had one hand on the La Liga trophy but an unexpected 2-0 defeat Sunday at Levante has thrown the three-way title race in Spain wide open again. At the end of a momentous week which has seen Atletico reach the Champions League final for the second time, Diego Simeone's men came unstuck against the mid-table team based in Valencia. Even now, hopes of a first domestic championship in 18 years remain in the hands of the Rojiblancos if they win their remaining two games -- at home to Malaga then crucially away to defending champions Barcelona. City rivals and fellow Champions League finalists Real Madrid later failed to take full advantage of Atletico's defeat and needed an audacious late equalizer from Cristiano Ronaldo in a 2-2 draw against Valencia in the Bernabeu. Real twice trailed to goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Dani Parejo only for Sergio Ramos and Ronaldo with a backheel from a Angel Di Maria cross in injury time to rescue their title hopes. Barcelona, whose 2-2 draw at home to Getafe appeared to have ended their chances, will be hoping Real slip up again in their remaining three matches and that they can achieve a last-day win over Atletico in the Nou Camp to claim the title again. Earlier, Levante went ahead against Atletico after seven minutes through a Filipe Luis own goal but were indebted to goalkeeper Keylor Navas for a string of fine saves to deny the visitors. Desperately searching for an equalizer, Atletico were caught out with a quick break midway through the second half when David Barra converted from Victor Casadesus' cross. Adrian Lopez, a hero in the midweek win at Chelsea in the Champions League semifinal, hit the post to sum up Atletico's day in front of goal, but they now face a nervous run-in. In the English Premier League, the three-way title race effectively became two as Chelsea stumbled to a goalless draw at home to relegation haunted Norwich. The draw at Stamford Bridge does little to help either side, with Chelsea now trailing leaders Manchester City and Liverpool by a point, but having played a game more. It was a lackluster display by Jose Mourinho's men after the 3-1 setback against Atletico, although they were unlucky when Andre Schurrle and David Luiz hit the woodwork with efforts. Norwich battled hard and had a first half penalty appeal turned away, but they are two points from safety and have played a game more than Sunderland, who are safe in 17th after a 1-0 win at Manchester United Saturday. In the other match in the EPL Sunday, fourth-placed Arsenal beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 with Olivier Giroud scoring the only goal in the first half. The title race in Spain and England will almost certainly go down to the last round of matches, but in Italy Juventus wrapped up their third straight Serie A crown with three games to spare. Juve did not need to take to the pitch as closest rivals Roma suffered a shock 4-1 defeat at Catania Sunday. It left Roma eight points adrift of the leaders with only two more games to be played. Mariano Izco's double for Catania put them on the front foot before Roma skipper Francesco Totti pulled one back before the break. Goals from Gonzalo Bergessio and Pablo Barrientos wrapped up the win for Catania in the second half to lift them off the bottom of the table. Antonio Conte's newly-crowned champions will celebrate their latest Scudetto success and 30th in all with a home game against Atalanta Monday.","Atletico Madrid falter in La Liga title race losing 2-0 at Levante .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Nelson Mandela on Saturday morning underwent endoscopic surgery to have gall stones removed, President Jacob Zuma's office said in a statement. The procedure was successful and Mandela, who has been hospitalized since last weekend due to a recurring lung infection, is recovering, the statement said. Mandela has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa. The former president gets round-the-clock care since abdominal surgery this year and an acute respiratory infection in 2011. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed from prison. Despite his rare appearances, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Read more: Nelson Mandela has lung infection .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- In most of Africa, football reigns supreme among sports, but in Senegal wrestling challenges it for popularity. It provides entertainment and exercise, and offers young men dreams of fame and fortune. Wrestling's popularity in Senegal makes it big business. For the sport's superstars the rewards can be huge, with the biggest names earning up to $200,000 per contest. In a country where unemployment is pushing 50%, some young men see it as a way out of poverty. Gris Bordeaux is a star in Senegal, a wrestling champion who also teaches at a wrestling school in the capital Dakar. He says wrestling is a mental, as well as physical, discipline and that reaching the top of his profession takes dedication. ""It's all about making sacrifices,"" says Bordeaux. ""It requires training and meditation; your mindset is important. You have to educate yourself well. ""Not all wrestlers get to realize their dreams, because on the bigger level it is few that get to where I am. You need to be focused on the sport -- like over 5,000 wrestlers you will get only 10 that make it."" See also: Senegal island exposes horrors of the slave trade . Bordeaux credits wrestling with changing his life, bringing him success and wealth. ""What I do know is that it has given me a lot of opportunities,"" he says. ""It has opened doors for me because I am able to take care of myself and my family and especially to help the young people in the community."" It's perhaps a desire to emulate the likes of Bordeaux -- as well as a desire to keep fit -- that motivates young Senegalese men to work out on the beaches of Dakar. Wrestlers fight to unite world's newest nation . Lacking the money to use a proper gym, some men have built a makeshift gym of their own. On the city's public beaches they have set up workout benches, using whatever materials they can -- be it car tires or wheel rims loaded with rocks to make them heavier. Some of those training at Bordeaux's school and pumping iron on the beach may one day make it onto the professional wrestling circuit, earning the right to wear the wrestler's traditional pre-fight regalia. Bordeaux describes the costumes as art. He says: ""The way we dress is to show harmony -- we dress for the fight and we become different. When we wear the full attire for a fight, you won't recognize me!""","Wrestling is hugely popular in the West African country of Senegal .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A Palestinian turned himself in to Israeli authorities Thursday to say he was responsible for one of two incidents in which vehicles smashed into Israelis a day earlier, the Israeli military said. Though the motives weren't immediately clear, the incidents were the latest in a series of vehicles striking pedestrians in Israel and the West Bank as the long-taut tensions between Israelis and Palestinians worsened in recent months, agitated in part by killings and a seven-week Israeli-Gaza conflict earlier this year. They also came amid days of outrage and clashes in Jerusalem over the status of one of the holiest sites in Judaism and Islam -- the Temple Mount, known by Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary. The man who surrendered Thursday said he was the driver who rammed into an Israeli military post Wednesday near Al-Aroub in the West Bank, injuring three Israeli soldiers, the Israeli military said. The driver fled after the incident. The injured soldiers were taken to Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. All three are in moderate condition, said Dr. Asher Salmon, the hospital's deputy head. Earlier, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said one was in critical condition. Earlier Wednesday, a Palestinian man drove a van into pedestrians at a rail station in eastern Jerusalem, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people, police said. Police shot and killed that driver, identified by Israeli authorities as a member of the Islamist Hamas movement, Samri said. News of the driver's killing ignited fierce clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian youths at the entrance of an eastern Jerusalem Palestinian refugee camp where the suspect lived, according to witnesses. No motive was immediately released, but Hamas supported the hitting of the Jerusalem pedestrians in a text message to the news media: ""Hamas blesses the action. What is happening in Jerusalem is pushing us to prepare for war."" Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld called the incident ""a terrorist attack."" Wednesday's developments came on the heels of two hit-and-run incidents that happened in Jerusalem and the West Bank last month. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. Palestinian state news reported that a 5-year-old girl died on October 19 after an Israeli settler deliberately ran over her as she returned home from kindergarten near a village to the north of Ramallah in the West Bank. Clashes at Jerusalem holy site . Wednesday's pedestrian crashes also came against a backdrop of days of unrest over the Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif. Israeli police on Wednesday clashed with Palestinian youths at the holy site, leaving more than 15 people injured, according to paramedics with the Red Crescent. It was just the latest round of unrest there since activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick was shot and gravely wounded last week after championing more Jewish rights at the site, where Jews can currently gather, but not pray. Israeli police shot and killed a suspect in Glick's shooting. Glick's October 29 shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in Jerusalem and prompted Israeli authorities to close the holy site for one day -- a move that a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called a ""declaration of war."" Recent tension at the holy site . Some of the recent tension centers on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif and Glick, who has argued that Jews must have a place of worship there. Such a Jewish prayer right is a sensitive issue for Muslims, who suspect a plan to expel them from the site. A spokesman for the military wing of Hamas said Wednesday that the site's al-Aqsa Mosque ""is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier."" ""We salute the heroes of the mujahideen of Hamas,"" Abu Abiada said in a message posted on the military wing's website. Since Muslims began construction at the site in the seventh century, Haram al-Sharif, now controlled by an Islamic trust, has been an almost constant source of tension between Muslims and Jews. Jordan controlled the site for a time until 1967, when Israel seized eastern Jerusalem. With its golden dome overlooking Jerusalem, the site is said to have hosted sacred events in the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. Jewish tradition holds that the Temple Mount contains Mount Moriah, where Abraham, the Hebrew patriarch, is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under God's orders -- before an angel intervened. Later, Israeli King Solomon constructed the first Jewish temple on the mount, including the Holy of Holies, a room that kept the Ark of the Covenant. At the foot of the Temple Mount, the 62-foot-tall Western Wall, or Wailing Wall, stands. Once supporting the courtyard of the ancient temple, Jews gather there now to hold religious services, to pray or to slip notes into its cracks. For Muslims, the Noble Sanctuary contains one of the most sacred sites in Islam: the al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims believe that the Prophet Mohammed was carried on a flying steed from Mecca to the site during his miraculous Night Journey, said Muqtedar Khan, an expert on Islam and politics at the University of Delaware. CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem. CNN's Jason Hanna reported and wrote in Atlanta.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas lashed out Monday at Al-Jazeera, calling the Arabic TV network's release of alleged secret documents from Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations ""shameful."" ""The report aired by Al-Jazeera is an intentional mixing between the many Israeli proposals and the Palestinian positions,"" Abbas said in Cairo, Egypt, in comments published by the Palestinian news agency Wafa. ""We do not have anything secret to hide,"" he added. ""All our negotiations and meetings and every issue discussed were presented to Arab countries with documents."" Dozens of Palestinians gathered Monday in central Ramallah, burning banners for Al-Jazeera and holding posters comparing the channel to Israel, Wafa reported. The documents, which Al-Jazeera has dubbed ""The Palestine Papers,"" suggest that Palestinian negotiators offered to give up large swaths of East Jerusalem to Israel during negotiations dating back to 2008. They suggest Palestinians have been willing to offer much larger concessions in private than previously acknowledged in public. In one document from 2010, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Eraakat is quoted as telling a U.S. State Department official that the Palestinian offer would give Israel ""the biggest (Jerusalem) in Jewish history."" In a statement Monday, Erekat said that ""a number of reports have surfaced regarding our positions in our negotiations with Israel, many of which have misrepresented our positions, taking statements and facts out of context. Other allegations circulated in the media have been patently false."" He added, ""Our position has been the same for the past 19 years of negotiations: We seek to establish a sovereign and independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital and to reach a just solution to the refugee issue based on their international legal rights,"" and any proposed agreement ""would have to gain popular support through a national referendum."" Abed Rabbo, one of Abbas' top advisers, accused Al-Jazeera of a ""smear campaign."" ""What happened is a manipulation of the documents and a misrepresentation of the facts and a true distortion, just for mockery and defiance,"" Abed Rabbo told reporters. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a representative for the Middle East Quartet, told CNN he does not believe Abbas would offer as much territory as the documents suggest. The Middle East Quartet -- composed of the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations -- has been trying to broker a peace deal. ""The idea that the Palestinian leadership had been offering concessions fundamentally in disagreement with the international negotiation that's known publicly is absurd,"" he said, adding that Palestinian leaders have ""been sometimes probably too emphatic for the rest of us in their defense of Palestinian interests."" The U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Robert Serry, weighed in as well.  ""I can personally attest to the commitment of the Palestinian leadership to secure the legitimate rights and interests of the Palestinian people, based on international law and U.N. resolutions,"" he said, as quoted by Wafa. While the Palestinian Authority controls the West Bank, the militant group Hamas controls Gaza. Hamas quickly pounced on the Al-Jazeera reporting, condemning the Palestinian Authority team and saying it ""does not have credibility to negotiate because it offered essential concessions."" ""All the doubts and all the concerns of the Palestinian people and the resistance were true,"" Oussama Hamdan, head of Hamas foreign relations, said Monday in a CNN interview from Lebanon. ""Those negotiators have no credibility and they are not authorized to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians because of the division, because there is no united Palestinian institution and because they don't have cards of power to negotiate with the Israelis."" Hamas, which refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, has carried out numerous terrorist attacks and is branded a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to comment. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, speaking to Israel radio, pointed out that the alleged negotiations took place under former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, a more left-wing government than Netanyahu's. ""If the Olmert government was not able to reach an agreement despite the far-reaching concessions, everyone understands that a long-term interim agreement is what is needed,"" Lieberman said. Yanki Galanti, a former Olmert spokesman, said an agreement was almost reached during negotiations between Olmert and Abbas from the end of 2006 to September 2008. ""After dozens of meetings ... there was a proposal that was reached. ... This offer was on all the issues we call core issues,"" Galanti told Israeli Army radio. The core issues in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are considered to be the status of Jerusalem, borders and refugees. Rabbo, the Palestinian official, condemned not only Al-Jazeera, but also the leadership of Qatar, where the network is based. ""This is a first-class political smear campaign and the decision comes from the highest level in Qatar,"" Rabbo said, adding sarcastically, ""and we thank the emir of Qatar on his commitment to transparency and to deliver the truth to a wider audience."" Referring to the ""transparency"" that Al-Jazeera said it was offering with its reporting, Rabbo added, ""We hope that they extend this so-called 'transparency' to the greatest degree and address the role of the U.S. base in Qatar in spying on the Arab countries, and talk about Qatari relations with Iran and Israel."" The government of Qatar had no immediate comment. On its website, Al-Jazeera says it was ""given unhindered access to the largest-ever leak of confidential documents related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are nearly 1,700 files, thousands of pages of diplomatic correspondence detailing the inner workings of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. These documents -- memos, e-mails, maps, minutes from private meetings, accounts of high level exchanges, strategy papers and even (PowerPoint) presentations -- date from 1999 to 2010."" The network added, ""We believe this material will prove to be of inestimable value to journalists, scholars, historians, policymakers and the general public. We know that some of what is presented here will prove controversial, but it is our intention to inform, not harm, to spark debate and reflection -- not dampen it."" Rabbo, however, accused Al-Jazeera of plotting to weaken the Palestinian Authority and Abbas, Wafa reported. He called on independent Palestinian organizations to set up a committee to look into the authenticity of the documents, according to Wafa. He vowed that the Palestinian Authority will not take action against Al-Jazeera staff in the Palestinian territories, the report added. Al-Jazeera is not disclosing the source of the documents it received ""over the last several months."" CNN could not immediately verify the authenticity of the documents. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley tweeted Sunday night, ""The U.S. government is reviewing the alleged Palestinian documents released by Al-Jazeera. We cannot vouch for their veracity."" ""The U.S. remains focused on a two-state solution and will continue to work with the parties to narrow existing differences on core issues,"" Crowley added. Al-Jazeera said it will be revealing the documents through Wednesday. The documents outline meetings among Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. officials in which Palestinian negotiators offered in 2008 to relinquish claims on nearly all of the settlements built in East Jerusalem. The offer was flatly rejected by the Israeli side, according to the posted documents. Israel seized the eastern half of Jerusalem following war with its Arab neighbors in 1967 and considers it the nation's sovereign capital. The claim is rejected by the international community, which considers Israeli building in East Jerusalem to be illegal. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city as the capital for their future state. The leaked documents could prove to be politically damaging for Abbas. Officials from the Ramallah-based government have consistently condemned growing Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem, and disclosures that Palestinians officials were willing to make offers that would allow Israeli construction to continue were being seized on by critics. Sami Abu Zhuri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said the leaked internal documents about Palestinian concessions on East Jerusalem illustrate the collaboration between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. He accused the Abbas government of working with Israel to put an end to the notion of a Palestinian state. In addition to details about concessions made on the issue of East Jerusalem, Al-Jazeera reported that Palestinian officials also offered compromise positions on sensitive issues such as the right of return of Palestinian refugees and control of the Temple Mount, where stands the Al-Aqsa mosque, one of the most important sites in Islam. CNN's Kevin Flower, Saad Abedine, Michal Zippori, Nic Robertson, Shira Medding, Talal Abu Rahma and Nada Husseini contributed to this report.","NEW: Palestinians protest and burn Al-Jazeera banners .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department concluded in a blistering report on Wednesday that female inmates at one Alabama prison live in a toxic environment marked by sex abuse and harassment by corrections staff. The Department's Civil Rights Division said the Alabama Department of Corrections has repeatedly violated the women's constitutional rights at the Julia Tutwiler Prison. The state was urged to take immediate remedial steps, but there was no indication the federal government was prepared to take any formal legal action. ""Our investigation has revealed serious systemic operational deficiencies at Tutwiler that have exposed women prisoners to harm and serious risk of harm from staff-on-prisoner sexual abuse and sexual harassment,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels. ""These problems have been festering for years, and are well known to Alabama prison officials. Remedying these deficiencies is critical to ensuring constitutionally protected treatment of women prisoners at Tutwiler and will promote public safety,"" she said. In a letter to Gov. Robert Bentley, federal officials said the inmates ""universally fear for their safety"" and ""live in a sexualized environment with repeated and open sexual behavior."" The alleged violations included ""strip shows"" and ""cross-gender viewing"" of female prisoners as they undressed in front of correction staff. The Justice Department also said female inmates at the facility in Wetumpka, north of the capital of Montgomery, had ""inadequate conditions"" of confinement and medical and mental health care. Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Kim Thomas said the findings were ""off the mark"" and that his agency is cooperating with the Justice Department. ""We have been proactive from the beginning,"" Thomas said. ""We have never downplayed the significant and serious nature of these allegations. I do not, however, agree that Tutwiler is operating in a deliberately indifferent or unconstitutional manner."" Thomas said that his agency will ""continue our efforts to implement changes and recommendations with the goal of improving prison conditions and avoiding potential contested litigation."" Thomas said the letter was based on a federal oversight visit from last year, noting improvements have been made. The state said it was informed in March of last year that the Justice Department was investigating the prison as a civil rights matter. ""The department stands ready to work with the state of Alabama on solving the problems at Tutwiler,"" said U.S. Attorney George L. Beck Jr. for the Middle District of Alabama. ""The report has identified a very serious and troubling situation at the facility. Action needs to be taken immediately.""

"(CNN) -- Last week, three teenage girls from Denver were alleged to have tried to join ISIS. The girls were stopped by FBI officials as they transited Frankfurt airport in Germany and were sent back to Colorado. The key lead in this case wasn't high-tech surveillance by the National Security Agency or a tip by a government informant, but a tip to the FBI by the girls' worried families. Assad Ibrahim, the Sudanese-American father of one of the girls, received a call from his daughter's Denver school telling him she was missing. When he tried calling her, she did not pick up. Ibrahim went to the father of the other two girls to check whether their passports were missing. They were. The families then went to the FBI, which intercepted the girls at the Frankfurt airport. The key role that families play in preventing violent extremism is often overlooked in favor of focusing on more exotic counterterrorism measures such as the National Security Agency's surveillance programs or the use of paid informants. In fact, a survey by the New America Foundation of 251 jihadist terrorism cases in the United States since 9/11 found that almost a third of the individuals accused of engaging in some kind of terrorist crime have been implicated by a tip from a family member or a member of the Muslim-American community. By contrast, only a little more than 1% of these cases was generated by one of the NSA's most controversial surveillance programs, in which the agency collected every American's phone data for several years. Families are often critical in stopping radicalizing individuals from stepping over the edge into militant activity. Take Adam Dandach, a 20-year-old Orange County man who was charged in July with committing passport fraud in an effort to join ISIS. His mother hid his passport so he could not leave the country. When more than 20 Somali-Americans left from Minnesota after 2007 to fight for the al Qaeda affiliated Al Shabaab group in Somalia, family and community members played critical roles in the ensuing FBI investigation. After Abdirizak Bihi's nephew, Burhan Hassan, left to fight for Al Shabaab in Somalia in November 2008, Bihi worked to organize community cooperation with the government's investigation. As Ralph Boelter, who oversaw the FBI's investigation, put it in 2009 when the Justice Department unsealed charges against eight men accused of supporting Al Shabaab, ""It is through the sustained and dedicated efforts of the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force and the support of the Somali-American community that today we are able to disclose some of the significant progress we have achieved in this critical investigation."". Families are not a panacea. Sometimes family members intervene with a radicalizing individual, but the intervention doesn't work. Shannon Conley, a 19-year-old Colorado woman, pleaded guilty in September to conspiring to provide material support to ISIS. Her family sought to dissuade her from seeking to join jihadists in Syria, but their efforts failed and she was arrested on April 8 at Denver International Airport on her way to Syria. Samir Khan traveled to Yemen from Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2009 where he became the editor of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire magazine despite several attempts by his family members and elders from the local Muslim-American community to dissuade him from his militant views. Two years later Khan was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen. Sometimes a family will warn U.S. authorities about a radicalizing child, but the warning isn't sufficiently followed up on. The Nigerian ""underwear bomber,"" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to blow up a bomb secreted in his underwear over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. Luckily the bomb failed to detonate. A month earlier, Abdulmuttalab's father had gone to the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, and told State Department officials there that he believed his son was meeting with extremists in Yemen. The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria issued a warning to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, but Abdulmuttalab was not put on the ""no fly"" list and the center's analysts did not make an effort to determine if Abdulmuttalab possessed a valid U.S. visa. Families are often, of course, the first to notice if a son or daughter is radicalizing and are a key bulwark against extremism. Why and how some people radicalize is a subject that is complex, but one indicator is usually unambiguous and that is that radicalizing individuals will often spend a great deal of time on jihadist websites or consuming jihadist social media. Many parents don't have much of a clue about what is happening online, but a common sense approach if they suspect their son or daughter is radicalizing is to get a better handle on their children's social media use and profile.","3 Colorado girls are intercepted on their way to the Middle East, allegedly to join ISIS .

"(CNN) -- He founded modern South Africa. The boy who grew up herding cattle in the hills of the rural Transkei area and attended a Methodist missionary school where he was given the name ""Nelson"" has dedicated his adult life to opposing the racist and segregationist policy of apartheid. Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela at first advocated peaceful opposition to white rule in early work with the African National Congress, a liberation movement. But the stubbornness of the apartheid regime increasingly frustrated him, until he turned to armed struggle shortly after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 in which police killed some 69 black protesters, shooting many of them in the back. Shortly after the protest the regime banned the African National Congress and another liberation movement, the Pan Africanist Congress. In 1964, Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment for carrying out acts of sabotage. In prison he became an international symbol of opposition to apartheid. Over the decades that followed, as the movement against white rule in South Africa began to grow and unrest inside the country became increasingly violent, it became clear to the white government that they could no longer continue to govern without consulting the African National Congress and, in particular, Nelson Mandela. In the 1980s, Mandela worked from prison to facilitate talks between the apartheid government and the ANC. He was unconditionally released from prison in 1990, just days after the ban on the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress was lifted. After spending 27 years in prison, on his release Mandela pursued a policy of reconciliation between black and white in South Africa. Many of the apartheid laws were repealed in the early '90s, but a few of the apartheid era laws are controversially still on the books. Mandela became president of South Africa in 1994, but he stood for only one term before stepping down and continuing to foster national reconciliation. Some have criticized Mandela for placing too much emphasis on reconciliation and not transforming the country enough, but the vast majority of South Africans revere his legacy and its meaning in the society they inhabit today. Visitors to the stunning nation at the tip of the continent can retrace many of Mandela's most significant moments, among them his release from prison 23 years ago, on February 11, 1990. CAPE TOWN AND SURROUNDS . Robben Island . Robben Island is one of South Africa's premier tourist destinations The ferry ride from the Cape Town waterfront alone is worth doing for the beautiful view of the city and Table Mountain from the sea. But ""the Island,"" as it was known during the days of apartheid, gives the visitor an eerie sense of desolation. To really understand Nelson Mandela's struggle and the sacrifices he made for the freedom of his people, you need to take a tour of the prison where he was held. Walking through the now silent empty jail cells, you bear witness to the loneliness and suffering he overcame to become a world icon of reconciliation. Groot Drakenstein Prison (Victor Verster Prison) Set incongruously in beautiful vineyards near Paarl, the Drakenstein Prison is where Mandela spent the last 14 months of his imprisonment. Here he was treated with greater respect by the authorities and eventually was moved into the warden's rather comfortable suburban house. Shortly after his release, Mandela built a house at Qunu, his birthplace in the Transkei, based on the layout of his prison lodgings. It has been said that the one thing he missed from his prison experience was the solitude and the chance to reflect, and the house reminds him of that feeling. Mandela was released from Drakenstein on February 11, 1990, and images were broadcast around the world of him and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela walking hand-in-hand toward the crowds, their fists clenched. Today, outside the main gate, there is a dramatic bronze statue of Mandela that commemorates that event. Stand on the road on the way to the prison gates and stop to imagine the excitement that erupted among the crowd in 1990 as Mandela finally emerged after 27 years. JOHANNESBURG AREA . Soweto . Now a fascinating small museum, Mandela's old house in Vilakazi Street in Orlando West in Soweto shows just how black people lived under apartheid. Even relatively well-to-do people like the young Nelson Mandela, who was a lawyer, lived with their families in small four-room brick ""matchbox"" houses. Mandela returned to this house a few days after he was released from prison, and many journalists interviewed him in the tiny garden, but after his release he never really lived there again. Archbishop Desmond Tutu lived here, too, just down the road, so it is the only street in the world where two Nobel Prize winners have lived in separate houses. Up the hill from Mandela's house is the Hector Pieterson memorial and museum. This is the point where the famous Soweto Riots began on June 16, 1976, and where the iconic picture was taken of a dying Hector Pieterson being carried while his sister ran crying alongside. The museum is excellent and well worth a visit. Apartheid Museum . While not only about Nelson Mandela, this fascinating museum recreates what life was like for both black and white South Africans under apartheid. It gives an excellent idea of what Mandela and other activists were fighting against and of their ideals for the future. Walking into the museum is an eerie experience as the entranceway is divided -- a gateway for blacks and a gateway for whites. It seems hard today to believe that such a system existed, but this museum lays it all out. Constitution Hill . Constitution Hill is the site today of South Africa's Constitutional Court, which is regarded as a post-modernist architectural icon. If you're lucky, you might be able to listen in briefly on a constitutional hearing in the main chamber, and the court has a celebrated art collection. The older buildings have a more ominous history. Built in 1892 under the old Boer Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, many of South Africa's most famous political prisoners, including Boer war leaders, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, spent time in the Old Fort Prison Complex. A tour through the old prison gives you a sense of South Africa's layered and complex past. Liliesleaf Farm . Out in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg is the famous Liliesleaf Farm. It was some 12 miles outside the city in the 1960s and was purchased by the South African Communist Party with secret funds smuggled in from the Soviet Union. Arthur Goldreich, a white communist, fronted as the owner of the farm while Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and other prominent ANC activists hid from the police in the outbuildings. Many political discussions were held in the main house and by 1963, it was becoming clear to the ANC that they were putting themselves under too much risk. It was too late, on July 11 of that year, the police swooped in and arrested a number of top ANC leaders. Mandela was already on Robben Island for a previous conviction when the raid happened, but many still say today that his gun was buried on the farm and lies somewhere hidden in the earth. NATAL AREA . HowickIf you are driving down to Durban from Johannesburg, you might want to make a short visit to the site at Howick where Nelson Mandela was arrested. Set in the beautiful Natal Midlands, the spot is only a few minutes off the main highway, the N3. Though there's not a great deal to see, a sculpture recently has been erected to mark the spot. An ongoing mystery is tied to the place, though, as some activists have said the CIA tipped off the South African security forces, pinpointing Mandela at this spot. No one has proved the claim, and it remains uncertain. EASTERN CAPE . Qunu . Qunu, on the Eastern Cape, is Nelson Mandela's hometown. His house -- which you cannot visit -- is right on the N2 between Durban and East London. If you're on the highway, the small museum at Qunu is certainly worth a stop. If you find the right people at the museum, they will grab a small piece of plastic chair and you can slide down the vast curved rock that Nelson Mandela slid down when he was a young boy playing hooky from his duties as a cattle herder. If you're lucky and have the time, you may be able to sit with a group of elders and sip the local sorghum beer known as Umqombothi. There is a tiny, reasonably priced bed and breakfast called Lili's where you can sleep in a typical Xhosa hut and try Xhosa food. The surrounding area is extremely poor but there are interesting things to see and do. Nelson Mandela's life and legacy are layered into the life and landscape of South Africa, and as the years go by, his stature grows.","Nelson Mandela was released from prison after 27 years on February 11, 1990 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A majority of Americans are dissatisfied or angry with President Barack Obama's administration and GOP leaders, according to exit polls released Tuesday and analyzed by CNN. And about 8 in 10 Americans disapprove of how Congress is handling its job, according to a survey of voters outside of polling places on Election Day. Nearly six in 10 voters are either dissatisfied or angry with both the White House and Republican leaders in Congress. Less than a third of Americans are satisfied with the Obama administration and GOP leaders. Follow the election on CNN Politics' livestream . And heading into the voting booth, seven in ten Americans said they were concerned about economic conditions. Most voters had a negative view of both parties, with the Democratic Party barely edging out the GOP to pull a positive view from 44% of voters compared to 40% for the Republican Party. But the two parties will be playing to moderates, with about 40% of voters identifying themselves as neither liberal or conservative. The conservative bloc is also larger than the liberal bastion, with about 36% of Americans calling themselves conservatives. And after an election that has played up government dysfunction and crises both at home and abroad, exit polls reveal that voters are concerned and anxious about the current state of the country and the direction it is headed. Two-thirds of voters said they believe the country is headed on the wrong track, and only 22% believe the next generation of Americans will be better off. And about 72% are at least somewhat worried that there could be a terrorist attack on U.S. soil. And voters' confidence in the government has been seriously shaken, with only 1 in 5 voters saying they trust the government to do the right thing. On the issues . Ebola: Ebola also hit the campaign trail this season and about six in ten Americans said they followed news about Ebola. And only about 44% of Americans believe the federal government has done a good job combating the disease. ISIS: The threat of ISIS has also been played up by some Senate candidates, and a majority of Americans surveyed Tuesday support airstrikes against the militant group in Iraq and Syria. Check out CNN's 2014 midterm elections Magic Wall . Immigration: About half the electorate said they believe illegal immigrants should get an opportunity to gain legal status in the U.S, while about 37% of voters said they want all illegal immigrants deported.

"(CNN) -- Last week, after the Senate defeated a measure to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline by a single vote, a Native American sitting in the gallery broke into a traditional victory song. Greg Grey Cloud, of Lakota and Dakota heritage, was quickly detained and hauled out of the Capitol. But the biggest slight to Native Americans came not from Grey Cloud's arrest for bursting into a victory song in honor of the senators who voted against the bill but from some of the media coverage of the incident. ""Once I was released, I found out the media [was] saying there was an outburst of a Native American wailing and chanting,"" Grey Cloud said. A chant? Really? Did Luciano Pavarotti chant? Does Barbra Streisand? Of course not. So why is it that when a Native American begins to sing, and if the song is not in English, people immediately assume it is just some kind of wordless wailing? For future reference, Native Americans sing, we don't chant. Here's the thing: November is Native American Heritage Month, as it has been since 1990 following a decree by then-President George H.W. Bush. So this should be the time of the year when people learn about Native Americans, our significant contributions to this country, and maybe even the appropriate language to use in the 21st century. (Squaw is a bad word, and so is -- you guessed it -- redskin). Opinion: What you don't know about Thanksgiving . Sadly, I can't help but worry that this column will be the only thing that many people will read about Native American Heritage Month. So please bear with me, while I take a moment to mention someone I hope will not be forgotten -- Wilma Mankiller, the first female Chief of the Cherokee Nation and a champion of access to clean water. Mankiller was brave and brazen and is now the subject of the new film, ""The Cherokee Word for Water."" I recently chatted about her with Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt, who donated a song to the film and is an admirer of the late chief. ""Wilma's just one of my heroes,"" Raitt said. Gloria Steinem, the revered feminist and journalist, echoed these warm words. ""From my perspective,"" she said, ""[Wilma] should've been president of the United States."" Mankiller was the epitome of determination, and so it irks me that so few Americans have heard about her diplomacy, eloquence and backbone -- especially during a month when we all should be recognizing indigenous people like her for their prowess and influence. Then again, I also remember what Grey Cloud said when I asked him why Native American Heritage Month barely gets a mention compared with, say, Black History Month or National Hispanic Heritage Month. ""We're first nations people,"" he said. ""They don't value us as much."" Right. In fact, Native American Heritage Day falls on the one day each year when Americans ravenously indulge in material possessions -- Black Friday. So is this an insult to Native Americans? Of course it is. How could it not be? If Native American Heritage Day fell on November 5, for example, then students would be in the classroom and teachers could offer lessons about the Native American today. But no, instead streams of bundled up shoppers are standing in line to make their purchases, with the class the last thing on any kids' mind as they sit watching TV. If we're going to choose a day for Native American Heritage Day when school is out, then how about Thanksgiving Day itself? Why not? That way we could learn about the real history of the holiday, and not the romanticized version we all hear about. Or maybe that discussion is too real, too much of a downer for people to stomach on Thanksgiving. I mean, I get it -- I'm sure it's tough to hear that the first Thanksgiving in Connecticut was in celebration of the subduing of Native Americans or that the pilgrims decapitated the son of the guest and sent his head to Plymouth to be displayed on a pike just outside the colony's entrance, where it would stay rotting for two decades. Too gruesome? Maybe that's a good thing. Facts are facts, and rejecting them bodes ill for everyone. So, this Native American Heritage Month, tell a family member or friend that Native Americans sing, they don't chant. Let them know that the pilgrims were themselves illegal immigrants who documented themselves. Talk a bit about how Wilma Mankiller was a warrior and dedicated environmentalist. And remind someone that Native Americans have contributed to this country since the first white man stepped off the boat and refused to learn our languages. Happy Native American Heritage Month, folks.","November is Native American Heritage Month .
Simon Moya-Smith: The months should be a time for learning of natives' contributions .
However, many Americans remain ignorant of real history, he says ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal from a female death row inmate who said fetal alcohol syndrome should have been considered by the state court that reviewed her sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court has closely monitored Louisiana's capital punishment system in recent years. The justices gave no reason for rejecting the appeal, which challenged the constitutionality of Louisiana's capital sentencing procedures and argued that Brandy Holmes' alleged developmental disabilities should disqualify her from execution. Holmes, 29, is one of two women scheduled to be executed in Louisiana. She and a male co-defendant were convicted of murder in the New Year's Day 2003 death of Julian Brandon, a retired minister near Shreveport. Holmes is being held at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women at St. Gabriel. Experts on fetal alcohol syndrome call it the nation's leading preventable cause of mental retardation. As many as 40,000 newborns in the United States are affected each year by their mother's alcohol use, according to an advocacy group. The syndrome can lead to brain damage, behavioral problems and intellectual disabilities. Holmes' attorneys said she functions like a 10- to 12-year-old. ""Brandy has a hallmark case of FAS,"" said Tom Donaldson, president of the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which supported the defendant in her high court appeal. ""Her mother testified that she drank throughout her pregnancy, and in fact named her daughter after her favorite drink. Brandy's capacity to appreciate the criminality of her actions or to conform to the law is very seriously impaired."" Donaldson and others argue the medical and legal system is unprepared to recognize, intervene and educate when presented with the majority of FAS-related cases, especially those involving younger defendants. In a petition to the justices, Holmes' attorney, Charles Ogletree, argued the Louisiana Supreme Court did not ""review the extensive mitigating circumstances that limited Ms. Holmes's moral culpability and compare them to the mitigating circumstances presented in similar cases. The [state] court also failed to consider that petitioner's co-defendant received a death sentence and that the prosecutor stated at the co-defendant's trial that he (and not the petitioner) was the more culpable party."" That co-defendant, Robert Coleman, remains on death row at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Ogletree is a noted Harvard Law School professor who taught President Obama when he was a law student. The state in its reply brief noted the violent nature of the robbery-murder. The victim's wife also suffered gunshot wounds in the attack. She lived in a severely impaired state for years and passed away in October 2008. Investigators said Holmes tried to use the victims' ATM card and destroyed evidence of the crime. Detectives said she even stole a videotape of her confession that was left unattended at the police station. ""Holmes destroyed this tape by sneaking it into the ladies' room and flushing the magnetic tape down the toilet, after substituting a blank tape in the stack of taped statements that had been left unsecured on a detective's desk,"" according the the state's brief. Police also suspect she flushed jewelry she had been wearing, which they suggested may have been stolen from the Brandons. The Supreme Court previously had banned execution of the mentally retarded, though the justices established no clear benchmark on IQ test results to guide criminal courts. The justices also have closely monitored Louisiana's capital punishment system in recent years, criticizing in some cases the role of some prosecutors and the procedural guarantees required in such cases. The justices last year ordered a new trial for an African-American capital defendant after finding problems with how prosecutors excluded blacks from an all-white jury. That same year, the high court blocked use of the death penalty for a New Orleans-area man convicted of child rape. Louisiana was one of the few states that had actively pushed execution for nonhomicide crimes. Fifty-three women remain on death row around the country. Forty women have been executed in the past century -- 11 since 1976 when the Supreme Court restored capital punishment, according the Death Penalty Information Center. The other woman on death row in Louisiana is Antoinette Frank, a former New Orleans policewoman convicted of three murders, including that of her former partner on the police force. Her scheduled execution last year was delayed indefinitely by appeal. The high court also announced Monday that it will not hear appeals in the following cases: .","Defense argued alleged disabilities should disqualify Brandy Holmes from execution .
Justices cite no reason in rejecting appeal of Louisiana death row inmate .
Holmes and a co-defendant were convicted in the 2003 killing of a retired minister .

"(CNN) -- NBC is reportedly considering a TV series follow-up to Cameron Crowe's 1989 classic ""Say Anything,"" but both Crowe and star John Cusack are vocally against the idea. On Monday, Deadline reported that NBC had a script commitment in place for a single-camera comedy based on Crowe's landmark coming-of-age story. In the movie, Cusack played mediocre student Lloyd Dobler, who was smitten with the high school valedictorian, Diane Court (Ione Skye). NBC's potential show would be set 10 years after the events of the movie, picking up in the aftermath of a breakup as Lloyd tries to win Diane back. The movie was both written and directed by Crowe. The TV series would be tackled by ""Better Off Ted"" producer Justin Adler. Crowe, meanwhile, has made it known he's not at all on board. ""Regarding the announcement of a 'Say Anything' tv show... @JohnCusack, @IoneSkye1 and I have no involvement... except in trying to stop it,"" Crowe tweeted Monday night. Cusack was just as disturbed by the news of a TV series, tweeting that he knew Crowe would be ""repulsed at this horror."" ""No end to the exploitation of other people's sincere efforts in shameless slime,"" the actor said on Twitter. ""(T)errible idea - they never want the creators only to make money off it themselves."" This isn't the first time NBC has tried to create a new concept from a beloved movie.

"(CNN)  -- Enhanced screening procedures for U.S.-bound air passengers traveling through ""state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest"" such as Pakistan, Yemen and Nigeria amount to religious profiling of Muslims, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said Monday. The Transportation Security Administration announced the strengthened security steps Sunday, saying that ""effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders."" A senior government official, not authorized to speak on the record, provided CNN with the list of 14 countries subject to the enhanced screening for travelers heading to the United States: Cuba, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen. The new guidelines target 13 Muslim-majority nations and will ""disproportionately target American Muslims who have family or spiritual ties to the Islamic world,"" the Council on American-Islamic Relations said, adding that the tougher measures ""amount to religious and ethnic profiling."" ""Under these new guidelines, almost every American Muslim who travels to see family or friends or goes on pilgrimage to Mecca will automatically be singled out for special security checks -- that's profiling,"" said Nihad Awad, the council's national executive director. ""While singling out travelers based on religion and national origin may make some people feel safer, it only serves to alienate and stigmatize Muslims and does nothing to improve airline security."" A TSA spokesperson, Kristin Lee, responded that ""TSA does not profile."" ""As is always the case, TSA security measures are based on threat, not ethnic or religious background,"" Lee said. The tougher measures followed a botched bombing attempt on Christmas Day by a Nigerian man who boarded a U.S.-bound flight in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The suspect, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, originated his trip in Nigeria and changed planes in Amsterdam to a Northwest Airlines flight headed for Detroit, Michigan. On the flight's final approach, the suspect allegedly attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear. The attempt failed, and the suspect was grabbed by other passengers and crew members. U.S. officials said the suspect received training and help for the attack from al Qaeda in Yemen, one of the countries of origin on the list for enhanced screening. A senior State Department official, who could not speak on the record because of the sensitive nature of the material, said Sunday the countries on the list are places ""where we have concerns, particularly about al Qaeda affiliates."" The official said the State Department was heavily involved in compiling the list, along with the Department of Homeland Security and other intelligence agencies. The State Department compiles the annual ""Patterns of Global Terrorism"" report, which details terrorism trends in countries around the world. Passengers from other countries could still face enhanced security for other reasons. Awad said the suspicious behavior of AbdulMutallab in the failed Christmas bombing case, rather than his religion or ethnicity, should have alerted authorities. For example, Awad said, AbdulMutallab paid cash for his ticket and boarded without checking in baggage. Improved monitoring of such anomalies is the solution, said Awad, who called for increased spending ""to obtain more bomb-sniffing dogs, to install more sophisticated bomb-detection equipment and to train security personnel in identifying the behavior suspects."" The American Civil Liberties Union issued a similar statement on Monday that called profiling an ineffective strategy. ""Singling out travelers from a few specified countries for enhanced screening is essentially a pretext for racial profiling, which is ineffective, unconstitutional and violates American values,"" said Michael German, national security policy counsel with the ACLU's Washington legislative office. ""Empirical studies of terrorists show there is no terrorist profile, and using a profile that doesn't reflect this reality will only divert resources by having government agents target innocent people. Profiling also can be ""counterproductive by undermining community support for government counterterrorism efforts and creating an injustice that terrorists can exploit to justify further acts of terrorism,"" German said. A federal counterterrorism official said the new TSA security directive lacked an expiration date, meaning it was intended to be ""sustainable and long term."" The directive, issued to domestic and international air carriers, states that any individual flying into the United States who is ""traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening."" The TSA did not elaborate on what those enhanced security procedures might entail. In addition, the directive also keeps in place a mandate issued after the attempted Christmas Day attack giving pilots discretion to prevent passengers from keeping pillows and blankets on their laps during certain international flights, the official said. Also retained is the option for pilots to limit movement in the cabin on those international flights. CNN's Mike Ahlers and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Extra screening planned for passengers coming through ""state sponsors of terrorism""

"(CNN) -- An attorney representing the family of a 7-year-old girl shot to death Sunday in a police raid is accusing the Detroit Police Department of misrepresenting the incident. In an interview with CNN affiliate WDIV on Monday, Michigan attorney Geoffrey Fieger said he obtained video footage of the incident captured by a crew filming for the A&E network show, ""The First 48."" Fieger, who didn't say how he received the tape, said it shows officers rushing the home and throwing a flash grenade through a window before one officer fires into the home from the front porch. However, according to Assistant Police Chief Ralph Godbee, preliminary information indicates that members of the Detroit Police Special Response Team approached the house and announced themselves as police. Godbee cited the officers involved and at least one independent witness. Godbee said officers used a ""flash bang"" device, entered the home and encountered a 46-year-old female inside the front room. ""Exactly what happened next is a matter still under investigation, but it appears the officer and the woman had some level of physical contact,"" Godbee said in a statement Sunday. ""At about this time, the officer's weapon discharged one round which, tragically, struck 7-year-old Aiyana Stanley Jones in the neck/head area."" Police were executing a search warrant in the search for the suspect in a shooting Friday that killed a high school student. Godbee said the 34-year-old suspect was found and arrested at the home where the girl was shot. In addition, a vehicle and a moped matching the descriptions of those involved in the shooting of 17-year-old Jarean Blake were also found, he said. Fieger called the explanation from police ""entirely false."" ""Of course, I have seen the videotape and the videotape vividly portrays the fact that a percussion grenade device was thrown through the front window and a shot was fired immediately from the outside from the porch,"" he said. ""No murder suspect was found in Aiyana's house,"" Fieger said in Monday's interview. ""In fact, there's an upstairs apartment next door which the police did not have a search warrant for and that is where he surrendered, they went into that house too. But he was not in Aiyana's house."" Aiyana's father, Charles Jones, also has denied that the suspect was in his home. Detroit police spokesman Phillip Cook told reporters Monday that he was not aware of the video and declined to comment. The investigation, he said, has been taken over by state police to preserve the ""community's trust."" A source at A&E, who asked not to be identified citing company policy, confirmed that a crew was on the scene and that the footage was confiscated by police. He would not comment on what the crew had captured on video. Another police spokesman said the department would not identify the suspect in Blake's shooting death until he has been formally charged by prosecutors. The suspect remains in custody. Godbee, in his statement Sunday, said he wished to ""express to the family of Aiyana Jones the profound sorrow that we feel within the Detroit Police Department and throughout this community. We know that no words can do anything to take away the pain you are feeling at this time."" Police obtained the ""high-risk search warrant"" based on intelligence, and it was approved by the prosecutor and a magistrate, Godbee said. ""Because of the ruthless and violent nature of the suspect in this case, it was determined that it would be in the best interest of public safety to execute the search warrant as soon as possible and detain the suspect ... while we sought a murder warrant.""","Attorney for family of girl killed in police raid says he has video footage of raid .

"(CNN)  -- A political crisis in Honduras escalated Thursday as a defiant President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales, followed by hundreds of supporters, led a loud but peaceful protest to a military base in order to personally take possession of thousands of ballots to be used in a contested referendum Sunday. President Manuel Zelaya Rosales, middle, reviews troops with Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, right, in 2008. Zelaya, a leftist elected in 2005, suddenly found himself pitted against the other branches of government and military leaders over the issue of the referendum. The referendum at the center of the storm asks voters to place a measure on November's ballot that would allow the formation of a constitutional assembly that could modify the nation's charter to allow the president to run for another term. Zelaya, whose four-year term ends in January 2010, cannot run for re-election. The Hondurans Supreme Court had ruled the referendum illegal, and Congress and the top military brass agreed, but Zelaya remained steadfast. ""Sunday's referendum will not be stopped,"" Zelaya said at the entrance of the military base where boxes of ballots were removed from storage and put into trucks to be taken to the presidential palace. Moving the ballots prevented them from being voided or destroyed to comply with the court's ruling of the illegality of the vote. Zelaya and his supporters braved an overcast and rainy day and sang the national anthem as the cardboard boxes filled with ballots were moved out of storage. ""We have the right to vote and the right to organize,"" Zelaya said. ""The military should rectify their position in favor of the people and ignore the extortion of the elite."" The protest was the latest in a day of developments that have created a political crisis in a country where some 70 percent of the population lives in poverty. Earlier Thursday, the Supreme Court ordered that the military's top commander be returned to his job immediately, a little more than 12 hours after Zelaya fired the general for saying the armed forces would not support the referendum. Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez had said the military was caught in a difficult position because the Supreme Court had ruled earlier that the referendum is illegal, but Zelaya was going ahead with the vote and instructed the armed forces to provide security. The heads of the army, navy and air force had resigned to show their support for Vasquez. Zelaya referred to the court as the ""Supreme Court of Injustice"" after their ruling. The court ruled 5-0 that Zelaya violated the general's constitutional rights by firing him without cause, said magistrate Rosalina Cruz. Also on Thursday, the National Congress convened an emergency session at which many members lauded Vasquez and the military, calling them ""heroes."" The general's firing was arbitrary, many members said. The president of the Congress, Roberto Micheletti, said the assembly unconditionally supports the armed forces for respecting the constitution, news reports said. In another blow for Zelaya, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said Thursday the referendum is illegal. The military chief had said after he was fired that he respected the president's decision to dismiss him but could not violate a Supreme Court order last week that prohibited the military from supporting the referendum. ""We are soldiers and we have to comply with our responsibilities,"" Vasquez said early Thursday. ""We are not afraid of any judge,"" he said. ""We are only afraid of the judge of history."" Zelaya said he would ask the Organization of American States to investigate the ""crisis,"" which he said was being perpetrated by people who want to hurt democracy in Honduras. Congress passed a law Tuesday night that would prohibit a referendum 180 days before or after the planned November general election. Under that law, Sunday's referendum could not be held. Politicians huddled Thursday as tension gripped the nation. Rumors of a coup had been circulating for days, heightened Wednesday when the armed forces were placed on high alert and held training exercises to prepare for civil disturbances and urban warfare, news reports said. There were no signs of any military intervention Thursday, though. David Matamoros, a member of the nation's Supreme Electoral Tribunal, said on CNN affiliate Televicentro that the election panel supports the military's action. The military ruled Honduras for 25 years, until a democratically elected civilian government came to power in 1982. Zelaya narrowly won the presidency on November 27, 2005, garnering 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo.","NEW: President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales: ""Referendum will not be stopped""

"(CNN) -- After 14 years, Larry Page has confessed to the Financial Times that Google ""probably does need"" a new mission statement. Back in 1999, Google came up with ""ten things we know to be true"" that defined the then-little Silicon Valley start-up. So here are some suggested tweaks to make the Google's original mission statement more relevant in 2014. Ten things we still know to be true. 1. Original mission: Focus on the user and all else will follow . Tweak: Follow the user and all else will come into focus . Google, of course, relies on knowing everything about its user to make money. Its ""free"" service isn't really free for us, since Google has become the preeminent ""big data"" company, mining our personal information to sell advertising. Indeed, as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt boasted, Google follows us so closely that it not only knows where we've been, but also where we are going. 2. Original mission: It's best to do one thing really, really well . Tweak: It's best to do many, many things really, really well . Google started as just another search engine. But today, the $372 billion leviathan, one of the world's three most valuable companies, not only dominates the world's advertising industry, but is also increasingly powerful in the publishing, movie, automotive, education and mapping industries. Google does many, many things really, really well. So well, indeed, that the company has grabbed the attention of anti-trust regulators in Washington DC and Brussels. 3. Original Mission: Fast is better than slow . Tweak: Fast is worse than slow . As the Internet critic Nicholas Carr famously asked: ""Is Google Making Us Stupid?"" In his 2011 Pulitzer Prize nominated best-seller, The Shallows, Carr concluded that yes, Google is indeed making us stupid. It is shortening our attention spans and making us more and more reliant on links. Through Internet companies like Google, Carr says, we have become information skimmers, snacking continually on unedifying links and other superficial content. 4. Original Mission: Democracy on the web works . Tweak: Democracy on the web doesn't work . Last week, UK spy chief Robert Hannigan said that terrorist groups like ISIS are exploiting the web to successfully peddle their radically anti-democratic message. Describing social media as ""a terrorist's command-and-control network of choice,"" Hannigan warned that unless companies like Google actively cooperate with security services, the web will become an increasingly effective bastion for anti-democratic forces and messages. 5. Original Mission: You don't need to be at your desk to need an answer . Tweak: You don't need to be at your desk or in your car or at a cafÃ© or in bed to need an answer . Google, of course, now has many, many more ways of following users than its traditional search engine. From Google Glass to Google self-driving cars, the view from the Googleplex is increasingly ubiquitous. Wherever we are, Google is coming up with devices to track our behavior. The desk is so 1999. Today, Google is transforming the whole world into a desktop environment where all our movements and thoughts can be tracked and analyzed wherever we are -- from our cars to our bedrooms. 6. Original Mission: You can make money without doing evil . Tweak: You can make a lot of money without doing good . Okay. So Google isn't any more evil than Exxon, General Motors or Raytheon. But it isn't morally better either. Google was founded on the hubristic notion that one could simultaneously become very rich and do good. But this, of course, is the ultimate Silicon Valley conceit. Ten years on from its original mission statement, Google has emerged as one of the most powerful and profitable multinational corporations in the world. Its mission is making money for its shareholders, not improving the world. Rather than a public service, Google is -- with Apple -- the most successful for-profit company in today's global capitalist system. 7. Original Mission: There's always more information out there . Tweak: There's always more and more information out there . See #5 . 8. Original Mission: The need for information crosses all borders . Tweak: The need for information crosses all borders (except China, Russia and Iran) For a mixture of idealistic and self-interested reasons, Google has branded itself as the information platform for the world. But, of course, the world isn't a United Nations-style high school project and countries like Russia, China and Iran are increasingly making it hard for its citizens to use Google. Indeed, this is Google's greatest challenge in its second decade: how to compete against state-supported search companies like Baidu and Yandex. 9. Original mission: You can be serious without a suit . Tweak: You can be serious with a suit . One of Google's most remarkable accomplishments over the last 14 years has been to disrupt traditional corporate culture. Disruption now is business orthodoxy. Everyone -- from IBM to Ford -- wants to ""do a Google"" and disrupt entire industries. The Google way -- of encouraging play and creativity -- has become the new corporate conformity. If you want to rebel these days: wear a suit. Everyone else is trying to look like Larry Page. 10. Original Mission: Great just isn't good enough . Tweak: Google just isn't good enough . Google was originally conceived as a way of reinventing the world. ""Ultimately, our constant dissatisfaction with the ways things are becomes the driving force behind everything we do,"" the company wrote in 1999. But today, Google has become the standard operating system for the world - the way things are. Its real challenge over the next 14 years is to convince its billions of users that we can trust a company that relies on mining our personal data for its massive profits. Currently, Google just isn't good enough. Let's hope by 2029, this will have changed.","Google's Larry Page admits Google ""probably does need"" a new mission statement .

"(CNN) -- When I was a little girl, I watched a lot of TV. I loved sitcoms and had a special love for talk and variety shows. I loved it whenTotie Fields, Moms Mabley and Phyllis Diller came on, but there was no one who affected me like Joan Rivers. Like every other misfit Jewish girl growing up in the suburbs of New Jersey, I may have adored Barbra, but I could relate to Joan. She was a perfect stand-up comic. Self-deprecating without being self-deprecating. Her jokes were flawless. And she was always the smartest person in the room. Every time she came on TV, my mother would say, ""You know she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard ... Ivy League."" (My mother was obsessed with Jewish celebrities, and Ivy League graduates). But the best part of Joan was how she made me laugh. And I mean belly laugh. And if you know a comic, you know that we don't laugh easily. Joan Rivers was a role model to comics everywhere, but especially to women. She got the first laugh and the last laugh. I learned from this. When the kids in school taunted me because of the way I looked (6-foot-2 at 13), my mother advised me to act like I couldn't hear them. I would come up with insults and retorts and play them out in my head, but those insults never came out of my mouth. I censored myself, something Joan had the courage to never do. Humor is the best way to get your point across and nobody got their point across better than Joan. This tiny little loud-mouthed Jewish woman was my hero. When Joan Rivers walked through the curtain on ""The Tonight Show,"" nobody in my house was allowed to utter a sound. Her gait was full of pep and purpose and her voice unmatched. Her first appearance was in 1965, when I was 3. Johnny Carson called her over to the couch and whispered, ""You're going to be a star."" She looked behind her to see if he was talking to someone else. She never stopped. She kept working in clubs, opening for other celebrities, writing jokes and books, recording albums, and being a mother -- and eventually a single mother. She never revealed her pain and struggles, she just kept on working -- making other people laugh. We all know showbiz isn't easy, but being a comic -- especially being a female comic -- can be quite punishing. Whenever it got rough enough for me to wonder, ""Is this really worth it?"" I immediately thought about Joan. It was she who made me never, ever give up. She was sometimes vilified for saying exactly what she thought (something no one in our business had ever done before or has done since). Everything and everyone was fair game. She found humor in the most tragic, forlorn and traumatic circumstances. Yes, she offended lots of people, but she laughed at herself first. She knew what you were thinking and trumped you with a joke every time. It's one thing to be able to say the thing everyone else wishes they could think of saying, but it's another thing to say it with aplomb, even as you know you're opening yourself up to recrimination. Whether it was her plastic surgery, her age or her weight, she beat you to it. When I first met Joan, on this silly shopping show she was doing, I was so nervous. But she put me right at ease with her warmth and humility. Whenever I saw her after that, she would bestow loving, motherly, sage advice upon me. After my first son was born, I told her I was worried that I was screwing up his sleep because he would always wake up in the middle of the night when I got home from a gig and we would end up hanging out until he fell back asleep. Said Joan: ""Who cares! The most important thing is not what time it is when you spend time with your child - It's that you SPEND time with your child."" I told her once: ""I hope you know all you have done for female comics. We wouldn't be here without you."" ""Oh baloney!! I did nothing,"" she replied. ""You are funny. That's all that matters -- and that you don't let anyone take your hard-earned money!! Do everything yourself!"" She would never listen to how great she was, but she would always make you feel like a million bucks. Joan Rivers broke down barriers, advocated for free speech, and never apologized for who she was. Everyone knew how much she loved her daughter and her grandson. She loved the people she worked with. She loved her fans. She loved her friends. But just like every other Jewish mother, she was uncomfortable hearing about how much she was loved. A few weeks ago, I emailed her and asked if her ears were burning because fellow stand-up Lynne Koplitz and I were up at the Montreal Comedy Festival talking with some other comics about how much we loved her and how good she was to us. She emailed back, ""Adore you both. XXX"" She was so much more than a simple girl with a dream. She gave so many funny little misfit girls permission to dream. Thank you doesn't seem nearly enough. This is a really hard one.","As a budding comic growing up in New Jersey, Judy Gold related to, adored Joan Rivers .

"(CNN) -- There is a great, geologic break in the land that runs almost the length of Texas from around Fort Worth to just west of San Antonio. Known as the Balcones Escarpment, geologists describe the rift as the place ""where the South ends and the West begins."" An ecological transition zone between rich, black-land prairie and the arid Southwestern deserts, the Comanche people thrived on the escarpment's sweet springs and abundant wildlife. Today, they would find strip malls, McMansions and 10-lane traffic jams. Five of the 20 fastest growing cities in America might be in Texas, but they are also the municipalities moving the quickest toward failure of infrastructure and other acute problems the state's leaders ignore. Of the 387,000 people who moved here in 2013, some 150 to 200 daily landed in Austin, which has been ranked several times as the country's fastest-growing city. Hill Country, lakes, food, live music and temperate weather explain the allure, but very few newcomers know about things such as the absurd lack of mass transit. The latest INRIX Traffic Scorecard Annual Report ranks Austin is the fourth-worst city in America for commuting. Neophyte Austinites might gain outstanding cheese enchiladas in their lives but will lose 38 hours each year sitting in traffic. A commuter rail train runs in the Texas capital city, but because it was consigned to old freight tracks, it hardly serves the population density. Voters rejected two light rail projects, but they will consider yet another billion dollar train and road initiative in November. Houston, often viewed as a nightmare carscape, has a light rail line downtown that records 5,000 boardings a mile every weekday. DART rail in Dallas also has healthy ridership, but the traffic has not noticeably lessened. Our roads are a serious problem. Because the Texas constitution requires a pay-as-you-go style government, officeholders used bonded indebtedness to avoid raising taxes and being politically punished. In fact, the gas tax in the state has not been raised since 1991 while lawmakers racked up a $23 billion dollar bond bill to construct roads. Servicing and retiring that debt will cost taxpayers $31 billion over the next 20 years. As the governor of Texas tours the country trying to lure more businesses south of the Red River with tales of low tax rates, he never mentions his state has almost $45 billion in bonded indebtedness, and taxpayers will pay that bill, some how, some way. But, hey, we can tell outsiders we don't raise taxes. The greatest peril facing a booming Texas population, however, is the lack of water. An epic drought has made water more precious than oil. Outlanders from the Midwest and California arrive in Texas, build homes, plant grass, install irrigation systems and water their lush green lawns in a landscape nature created for scorpions and rattlesnakes. Green Lake, near the Gulf Coast, is the state's only natural body of water; everything else is a reservoir, and they are running dry from too many straws thirstily sipping through 100-degree days. Lake Travis, the jewel of the Texas Hill Country, which is also the water supply for Austin's swelling population, has not been full since 2007. The city's water utility director recently warned that the reservoir would run dry by 2016, even with severe use restrictions. The city of Wichita Falls, near the border with Oklahoma, made national news recently when it informed residents they would have to start drinking recycled wastewater. After treatment at a sewage plant, the water is piped to another facility where it's cleansed for consumption. Bottled water sales are said to be booming. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality predicts four dozen cities in the Lone Star state can expect to run out of water, possibly by the end of this year, if the drought does not break. If you are considering relocation, we ought to have a chat about our onerous property tax rates in Texas and what they do to your prospective house payments. We can also talk about how the legislature never gives school districts the money they need to operate and has been sued by parents and educators for that very reason since 1968, and, just recently lost another constitutional lawsuit over how schools are funded. Or, maybe, we should discuss the governor's refusal to expand Medicaid and how we have the most uninsured residents of any state in the union. But, no worries; we can fill you in when you get here. The sun is shining. The beer is cold. And a No. 2 Mexican dinner awaits. Y'all come on down to Texas.","Five of the 20 fastest-growing cities in America are in Texas; Austin is the fastest of all .

"(CNN) -- Slide on your glasses as you hit the streets of Portland. Here, amongst the VooDoo Doughnut-eaters, eclectic little coffeehouse-supporters and bookstore-browsing literary crowd, it's hip to be nerdy. Lisa Warninger,  Portland street style blogger for Urban Weeds, came to Oregon's largest city five years ago and has been captivated by the unique city vibe ever since. ""I've lived all over the world,"" Warninger said. ""I came to this conclusion that there's no perfect place. Then, I came to Portland and it's kind of like the perfect city for me. It's just full of creative types, and I'm staying!"" Besides owning a good coat and boots (""a must"") to combat Portland's long cold, rainy season, the locals are jazzing up their style with splashes of color, designer finds and thrifty picks. Below, Warninger explains Portland's bright style. CNN: What would you call the street style in Portland? Warninger: A lot of people like to support local fashion designers here, so what I find is people will invest in a designer piece and the rest of the outfit will be thrifted. People are very conscious of where they spend their money here. CNN: What is unique about the style? Warninger: This ""mash-up"" of a mix between local designers and thrift finds. It may be emerging in other cities, but Portland is doing it to an extreme. Often they'll go with an indie designer, a unique and cool company, or invest in a great pair of shoes, or something along those lines. They might have a thrifted dress and a fabulous necklace from Grayling. Maybe they found their entire outfit for free on the street but their shoes are from Nom & Ada. The fashion capital of Idaho . CNN: Have you seen any trends emerging from that style? Warninger: One trend that is never going to go away here is looking smart. Wearing glasses, that kind of nerdy cool will always be popular. It's a very bookish kind of town and this is the only place I've ever lived where I see people reading while walking down the street all the time. People here love to be informed and well-read, and I think that kind of academic nerdiness will always be fashionable. There is also a new trend for colorful tights. The rest of the outfit will be toned down, grays and blacks, with a very bright tight. There is some crazy neon tight action going on here! It's not all country in Nashville . CNN: Where do people shop in Portland? Warninger: There are a lot of nice boutiques in Portland that carry the local designers, like Frances May and Una. Adam Arnold and a lot of the designers have their shops by appointment only as well. Some of the designers that come to mind are Holly Stalder, Elizabeth Dye, Anna Korte, Kate Towers, Nom & Ada, as well as Project Runway's Leanne Marshall, Gretchen Jones, Seth Aaron (Henderson) and Janeane Marie (Ceccanti). As far as thrift stores go, there are tons here. I would say there's some in each neighborhood. San Francisco style: It's unforgettable . CNN: When you're out on the street, how do you choose people for your photos? Is there a key element? Warninger: I always look for that little something extra. They have to have something unique about the way they put their look together. I always like to see what shoes they're wearing, I love seeing good examples of layering, color combinations, textures, good styling is key. Basically if it makes me look twice, in a good way, then I stop them. Typically, I have found that the people who are stylish here tend to go where artists have always gone, and that would be the coffeehouses. I call it my ""coffeehouse tour"" while scouting and I usually go through about eight shots of espresso.","Portland's street style shows that it's hip to be nerdy by showcasing smart looks .

"(CNN) -- With the grandiloquence befitting such an occasion, Simon Watt, the British biologist, television personality and ""president for life"" of the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, made the long-anticipated announcement Thursday night. ""The votes have been counted and verified,"" said Watt. ""The mascot for the Ugly Animal Preservation Society is ... the blobfish!"" GALLERY: World's most hideous creatures . Watt presented a certificate authenticating the choice of blobfish as the organization's mascot to Paul Foot, the UK comedian who had championed the gelatinous fish as the society's new mascot. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), blobfish ""look like a big, blobby tadpole, just a mass of pale, jelly-like flesh with puffy, loose skin, a big nose and beady, staring eyes."" They're not very big either, growing only to about 12 inches in length. NOAA says nobody has ever seen them eat, but the British Science Association says they feast on crabs and lobsters. Blobfish are found mainly off the coast of southeastern Australia and Tasmania. Like many of the world's ugliest fish, they prefer to lay low, usually at depths of 2,000 to 4,000 feet (600 to 1,200 meters), bobbing around above the bottom of the ocean. Which is a shame, really. This cross between the cartoon character Ziggy and an anemic lump of jelly deserves to be seen by the masses. The Ugly Animal Preservation Society is dedicated ""to raising the profile of some of Mother Nature's more aesthetically challenged children."" Led by Watt, the group of like-minded comedians spent the summer fishing around for public nominations as part of its pursuit to name the world's ugliest animal. With the help of the British National Science and Engineering Competition, Watt put together a YouTube page on which ugly animal fans could watch 11 comedians plead their cases for 11 ugly but endangered animals. In the end, the blobfish and its champion, Paul Foot, came out on top. Other contenders included the proboscis monkey, a primate with an obscene schnoz; the flightless dung beetle; and the unfortunate pig-nosed turtle. See the video with Watt and Foot on the Ugly Animal Preservation Society website.","Blobfish named official mascot of Ugly Animal Preservation Society .

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga may love to ""Just Dance,"" but she will be off the dance floor for a while. The pop icon canceled the rest of her ""Born This Way Ball"" tour this week because doctors found she had suffered a labral tear in her right hip. Initially, Gaga, 26, said she had been hiding pain in her hip for a while and that she had a condition called synovitis, a severe inflammation of the synovial lining of her hip joint. Later, doctors determined the singer also had the tear. Tour operator Live Nation said strenuous repetitive movements caused the tear. ""(A labral tear) affects a younger subset of patients,"" said Allston Stubbs, an orthopedic surgeon at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. ""We think it's related to the repetitive mechanics of being active."" Think of the labrum as a ring of soft tissue that holds the ball of the femur, or thighbone, snugly in the hip joint's socket. Lady Gaga cancels tour, will, will have hip surgery . Live Nation said Gaga ""will need surgery to repair the problem, followed by strict downtime to recover. This unfortunately will force her to cancel the tour so she can heal."" New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, 37, had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip in 2009 and then in his left hip last month. ""A lot of these patients have been involved with a fairly high level of activity for a long time,"" Stubbs said. The average age of patients in Stubbs' clinic with this type of injury is 30, he said. Because many of them started being active when they were younger, adolescents and teenagers need to know how to stretch properly to prevent these types of injuries. ""I recommend two months of rest within a 12-month period, particularly in patients 16 and younger,"" Stubbs said. ""We want them to be active, but we also went them to allow time for their bodies to rest and recover.""","Lady Gaga has canceled the rest of her tour because of a hip injury .
