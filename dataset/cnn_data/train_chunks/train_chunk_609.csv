"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 08:53 EST, 1 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:46 EST, 1 November 2012 . Executed: Donnie Lee Roberts confessed to the fatal shooting of Vicki Bowen nine years ago . A Texas man convicted of killing his girlfriend was executed on Halloween night, using his last words to make a final plea of remorse. ‘I'm really sorry. I never meant to cause you all so much pain,’ Donnie Lee Roberts said to Vicki Bowen's father, who was seated in a chair close to a glass window in the death chamber viewing area. ‘I hope you can go on with your life.' ‘I loved your daughter. I hope to God he lets me see her in heaven so I can apologise to her and see her and tell her.’ Roberts, 41, was convicted of fatally shooting Bowen in 2003 and taking items from her home to sell or trade to support his drug habit. He became the 12th inmate to be put to death this year in the nation's most active capital punishment state, and he died via lethal injection. Roberts also asked two of his friends who watched through another window to tell his own daughter he loved her. He repeated that he was sorry and took several deep breaths as the lethal dose of pentobarbital began taking effect. As Texas no longer grants death row inmates their choice of a final meal, Roberts’ last words were really his only way to differentiate his execution from any other. He snored briefly before slipping into unconsciousness, and was pronounced dead 23 minutes later. Bowen's relatives, including some who sat on the floor where they were gathered as Roberts was put to death, declined to speak with reporters after the execution. Roberts' punishment came after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review his case earlier this week, and no additional appeals were filed to try to block the lethal injection. At the time of his arrest for the October 2003 slaying of the 44-year-old Bowen, Roberts had violated his probation for a robbery conviction in Louisiana by fleeing to Texas after dropping out of a drug treatment program. Authorities said he apparently met . Bowen, a dental assistant, at a bar and moved in with her at her Lake . Livingston home, about 75 miles northeast of Houston. Their . relationship soured because Roberts wasn't working and was abusing . drugs and alcohol, investigators said, and he shot Bowen after she . refused his demand for money. Murderer: The drug addict killed Vicki Bowen and then sold her goods to buy crack cocaine. He died from a lethal injection . Roberts was arrested at a suspected . crack house in the town of Livingston when a truck missing from Bowen's . home was spotted there the same day Bowen's body was discovered. ‘He was cooperative and confessed several times,’ District Attorney Lee Hon said. ‘He was saying he wanted the death penalty.’ Roberts . told authorities he made several trips from the house where Bowen was . shot, collecting property that he took into town to sell and trade for . crack. He also surprised . detectives by confessing to the shotgun death of a man that happened a . decade earlier in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. Authorities . initially believed the victim, Al Crow, had died of asphyxiation in a . fire at the camper trailer where he was living but reopened the case . following Roberts' disclosure, found shotgun pellets and determined it . was a homicide. Roberts was charged with murder but not tried for Crow's death. Stephen Taylor, one of Roberts' lawyers at his Texas capital murder trial, said the confessions complicated his trial defense. ‘It's almost like somebody saying he was a serial killer, that he's killed before and he killed again,’ Taylor said. ‘It's one thing to say you have the right to remain silent. Use it! ‘It's always sad for someone to lose his life, especially for something so stupid.’ Bowen didn't show up for work on October 16, 2003, and a co-worker who went to check on her found her body wrapped in a blanket and lying in a pool of blood. 'I'm really sorry. I never meant to cause you all so much pain. ‘I hope you can go on with your life.' - Donnie Lee Roberts, to his victim's family . A medical examiner determined Bowen was killed with two gunshots to her head. Roberts took the witness stand and tried to blame Bowen for the gunfire, saying he was acting in self-defense by grabbing a .22-caliber rifle after seeing her reach down inside a couch to locate a pistol that was kept there. Evidence at trial showed Roberts had a record for battery while being held in jail in Fulton County, Georgia, that he'd threatened his wife to give him money for drugs, and that he warned there would be another killing if he didn't get a single-person cell in Polk County when he was jailed for Bowen's murder. His robbery conviction in Louisiana was for a Mother's Day 2001 convenience store holdup in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the knife-wielding Roberts threatened to slice the throat of the female clerk. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice Polunsky Unit, where the state's male death row is housed, had been Roberts' home since his capital murder conviction in 2004. The prison is just outside Livingston and not far from where Bowen was killed. Earlier Wednesday, Roberts was moved about 45 miles west to the Huntsville Unit, the prison where the execution was carried out. Three more Texas prisoners are set to die in November, including one next week.","Donnie Lee Roberts apologised to family of the girlfriend he murdered .

"PUBLISHED: . 09:56 EST, 7 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:24 EST, 7 August 2012 . A shocking new attack ad from the Obama camp blames Mitt Romney for a woman's cancer death after her husband's steel mill in Kansas City, Missouri, went bankrupt under Bain Capital. The commercial, called 'Understands', is perhaps the harshest attack on the Republican presidential candidate to date. In the video, released online on Tuesday, steel worker Joe Soptic says Romney doesn't know what his private equity firm did to workers, 'and further, I don't think he's concerned.' In a separate attack, the president also tarred Romney as 'Robin hood in reverse' for his economic plan that the Obama campaign says gives $5trillion in tax cuts to the wealthy at the expense of poor and middle class families. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Laid-off steel worker Joe Soptic blames Mitt Romney for his wife's cancer death after Bain Capital shut down the mill where he worked . The ad was released by Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting the president's reelection campaign. Obama can officially disavow the attack by saying it was produced by an independent group, but the PAC is run by two former White House aides and close allies. Mr Soptic worked for GST Steel, which was purchased by Romney's private equity firm Bain Capital. The company later went bankrupt and 750 workers lost their jobs, though Bain investors made millions of dollars off the deal. Romney says the steel mill only went under after he left Bain. Obama's campaign says the investment in GST is fair game because the initial deal was struck while Romney was still at the helm. In the ad, Mr Soptic says his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer after he was cut from his job and lost health insurance for his family. 'I don’t know how long she was sick, and I think maybe she didn’t say anything because she knew that we couldn’t afford the insurance,' he says. Dispute: Romney's experience at Bain Capital has been a source of exhaustive attacks by the Obama campaign in an effort to discredit the Republican challenger . 'One day she became ill and I took her up to the Jackson County hospital and admitted her for pneumonia and that's when they found the cancer. By then it was stage four, there was nothing they could do for her and she passed away in 22 days.' Mr Soptic ends the ad by saying: 'I do not think Mitt Romney realizes what he’s done to anyone, and furthermore I do not think Mitt Romney is concerned.' Romney's campaign blasted the new spot as 'discredited, dishonest attacks.' A spokesman says Obama is trying to distract the American people from the sluggish economy and high unemployment rates. Perhaps not surprisingly, the ad stand on very shaky ground, factually. The steel company was acquired by Bain while Romney was at the helm, though it did not close until 2001 -- two years after Romney says he left the company. Mr Soptic's wife dined in 2006, five years after the plant shut down. Controversy: Many of the campaign volleys have centered around whether Bain created more jobs than it destroyed . The Priorities USA Action PAC has raised $20.7million as of June 30 and spent more than $17million on ads attacking Romney. Restore Our Future, Romney's super PAC run two former aides, has raised $62million and spent $8.2million opposing Obama so far. It also spent nearly $40million bashing Romney's Republican primary challengers and $14million support the former Massachusetts governor. On Monday Obama blasted Romney for his economic plan, which he says will raise taxes on the middle class and poor to pay for a $5trillion deduction for wealthy Americans. 'It's like Robin Hood in reverse -- it's Romney-hood,' he said.","Video features steel worker Joe Soptic who was laid and lost his health care .

The extraordinary injury claim was made after colleagues complained that their police station in Birmingham had become infested with the insects. It was one of a number of workplace injury claims paid by West Midlands Police which, over the past three years, has spent £900,000 settling cases made by more than 50 policemen. West Midlands police have come under attack for their compensation payouts.The highest single payout was £22,000. This week Home Secretary Theresa May . ordered an investigation into such payouts, amid nationwide concern that . routine injury claims are damaging the reputation of the police. Just weeks ago, WPC Kelly Jones triggered public outrage and criticism . from her own chief constable for suing a burglary victim for £50,000 . after tripping over a kerb. Claim: WPC Kelly Jones, 33, has launched the health and safety claim against the owner of the station in Thetford, Norfolk, where she tripped on a 6in kerb . In total, just under 2,000 officers received payouts worth £19.8million . last year and 6,600 officers shared £47.3million in the previous three . years, Police Federation figures show. A freedom of information request revealed West Midlands Police has been . sued by 51 serving officers and 16 civilian staff in the past three . years. The policeman who lodged the  flea bites claim follows a £1,000 payout . by the same force in 2011 over ‘insect bites’. In other claims, a worker . received £14,000 after falling from a pushbike. Another claimed £600 after . being exposed to a loud noise. The largest payout was £50,000, to an employee who sued over a data protection breach. The majority of the cases relate to officers and workers tripping over or being bitten by dogs. Former West Midlands police officer Ray Egan, who served on the force . from 1967 to 1993, said: ‘To claim for a flea bite is just too . embarrassing for words.’ West Midlands Police  said: ‘Details of injuries and payments are often more complex than statistics or brief detail suggest.’","Almost £900,000 paid to West Midlands police staff in last three years .

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:16 EST, 4 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:26 EST, 4 June 2013 . Photos of the noose Pfc. Bradley Manning made from a knotted bedsheet have been released just as the accused conspirator finished day two of the trial that will determine whether or not he willingly helped America’s enemies by engineering the biggest leak of classified material in U.S. history. The noose, which Manning admitted he made as he contemplated suicide shortly after his 2010 arrest, was used to support the military's argument that it was trying to protect the former Army intelligence officer by keeping him in strict isolation and without clothes at Quantico, Virginia's Marine Corps base. Manning said November 29 during a pre-trial hearing that he’d fashioned the noose while being held in Kuwait soon after he was accused in May 2010 of leaking reams of military and diplomatic documents to the website WikiLeaks. He said his time in Kuwait was the lowest he felt during his entire confinement. Exhibit A: Manning contemplated killing himself with this peach-colored noose just after his 2010 arrest. Hacker Adrian Lamo testified Tuesday the soldier was suicidal even before over 'American atrocities in Iraq' Now, a convicted hacker who took the . stand June 4 as part of Manning's court martial appears to back up the . military's assertion the soldier is emotionally unhealthy. According to the LA Times, Lamo . testified that Manning called himself 'morally and emotionally troubled' and felt like a 'broken soul' who was so troubled by what he described . as America's atrocities in Iraq that he'd considered suicide. Lamo also revealed during testimony . that Manning never said he wanted to aid America’s enemies over the few . days the two conversed via instance messages in 2010. Ironically, the hacker—a man named . Adrian Lamo—was the very same who alerted federal authorities the day . after Manning told him that he had large amounts of sensitive military . information at his disposal that he'd been leaking for months. When . Manning’s defense attorney David Coombs asked Lamo on the stand Tuesday . if the Private First Class had ever said he wanted to help America’s . enemies, Lamo answered ‘Not in those words, no.’ Manning is on trial for giving hundreds of thousands of documents to the secret-spilling website WikiLeaks. He pleaded guilty to charges that could bring 20 years behind bars, but the military has pressed ahead with a court-martial on more serious charges, including aiding the enemy. That charge carries a potential life sentence. Suicidal? Manning admitted he considered suicide after his 2010 arrest, and Tuesday, Lamo revealed Manning told him he considered suicide before, due to 'America's atrocities in Iraq' Lamo started chatting online with Manning on May 20, 2010, and alerted law enforcement the next day about the contents of the soldier's messages, including his mention of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He said he continued chatting with Manning on and off for six more days. On cross-examination, Lamo said Manning never told him he wanted to help the enemy and did not express disloyalty to America. Prosecutors have said they will show the . 25-year-old Army intelligence analyst effectively put U.S. military . secrets into the hands of the enemy, including Osama bin Laden. They . said they will present evidence that bin Laden requested and obtained . from another al-Qaida member the Afghanistan battlefield reports and . State Department cables published by WikiLeaks. Paying his debt? Lamo was convicted in 2004 of hacking the computer networks of the New York Times and Microsoft and served 6 months house arrest and 2 months probation . Leaked: Lamo, left, testified that Manning, right, seemed emotionally unsound when the two chatted online. Lamo alerted authorities after Manning told him he'd been leaking government documents for months . Suicidal: Manning remained unmoved during Lamo's testimony, in which the convicted hacker revealed the soldier to be emotionally troubled and suicidal . The soldier from Crescent, Okla., has said he did not believe the information would harm the U.S. and he released the information to enlighten the public about the bitter reality of America's wars. The case is the most high-profile prosecution for the Obama administration, which has been criticized for its crackdown on those who leak information. It's also by far the most voluminous release of classified material in U.S. history, and certainly the most sensational since the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers, a secret Defense Department history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The 7,000 pages of the Pentagon Papers showed that the U.S. government repeatedly misled the public about the Vietnam War. Their leak to The New York Times set off an epic clash between the Nixon administration and the press and led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the First Amendment. The material WikiLeaks began publishing in 2010 documented complaints of abuses against Iraqi detainees, a U.S. tally of civilian deaths in Iraq, and America's weak support for the government of Tunisia - a disclosure that Manning supporters said helped trigger the Middle Eastern pro-democracy uprisings known as the Arab Spring. Saintly? Meanwhile, Manning's defense described him as an idealistic and naïve young soldier who wanted to change the world for good . The Obama administration has said the release of the material threatened to expose valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments. Lamo testified Manning had contacted him because of his notoriety in the hacking community and because of his open support and leadership in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Lamo pleaded guilty in 2004 of computer fraud after he was arrested for hacking the computer networks of the New York Times and Microsoft. He was sentenced to six months house arrest and two years probation. Fame monger? Lamo's testimony came on day two of Manning's trial. On day one of the proceedings, the prosecution painted Manning as a man out for notoriety . Manning chose to have his court-martial heard by a judge instead of a jury. It is expected to run all summer. Much of the evidence is classified, which means large portions of the trial are likely to be closed to reporters and the public. Federal authorities are looking into whether Assange can also be prosecuted. He has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex-crimes allegations. 'This is not justice; never could this be justice,' Assange said in a statement Monday. 'The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity.' Serious: The 25-year-old faces 21 charges for leaking sensitive military documents and could face life in jail .","The evidence comes from a December hearing that sought to prove the accused conspirator was being stringently detained in Quantico, Virginia's Marine Corps base because he was a suicide risk .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 18:43 EST, 18 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 26 June 2012 . Microsoft is to take on Apple in a war of the tablet computers with the launch of its own ‘iPad killer’ – the Surface. It is a dramatic move for the US technology company, which historically has focused on producing software rather than hardware. But after some success with the Xbox series of entertainment consoles, it now hopes to challenge Apple and Android in the lucrative touchscreen tablet market. The Microsoft Surface tablet was officially unveiled in Los Angeles last night, and from the favourable first impressions, it looks like we have a three-way race in the tablet market. The Surface comes with a 10.6"" screen, a clever magnetic cover which doubles as a keyboard, and a kickstand to hold it upright on a table. In a huge paradigm shift for Microsoft, the traditional Windows Desktop has been scrapped for Microsoft's new 'Metro' tile-based theme. The new laptop-esque Surface tablet computer is unveiled by Microsoft, bringing a revolutionary jump to the future of Windows . Microsoft Surface: The new tablet, shown here in the hands of CEO Steve Ballmer, will compete with the iPad . Launch: The tablet is Microsoft's first foray into personal computing hardware for many years . Presentation: The contents of the launch were kept completely secret until the announcement was made . Boss: Mr Ballmer shows off Microsoft's latest gadget at a press conference in Los Angeles . The iPad has been King of the tablet market since its debut in 2010 . Surface comes with a number of features which make it more similar to a laptop than a tablet - most notably, a built-in keyboard which could help the device appeal more to business customers. And the fact that Microsoft is using the same Windows 8 operating system for the Surface as for laptop and desktop computers could mean that customers will find it easier to switch between different devices. CEO Steve Ballmer was . on hand at a press conference in Los Angeles to announce the tablet, calling it part of a 'whole new family . of devices' the company is developing. The 9.3mm-thick tablet, which uses the RT version of Windows, comes with a kickstand to hold it upright and keyboard that . is part of the device's cover. It weighs under 1.5 pounds. In a possible nod to the device's chief rival, it will apparently be 0.1mm thinner than the latest iPad. A slightly thicker version - still less than . 14mm thick and under two pounds - will work on Microsoft's . upcoming Windows 8 Pro operating system. Colourful: The Surface is expected to be available for purchase some time later this year . Visionary: Microsoft has high hopes that the Surface will allow it to break in to the lucrative tablet market . Adaptable: The device is designed to function both as a tablet and as a more traditional laptop . Weight:Surface 676g iPad 650g . Thickness:Surface 9.3mm iPad 9.4mm . Screen size:Surface 10.6"" iPad 9.7"" USB:Surface yes iPad no . Hard drive:Surface 32GB/64GB iPad 16GB/32GB/64GB . Battery life:Surface unknown iPad around 6 hours . Price:Surface unknown iPad from £479/$499 . Steven . Sinofsky, the president of Microsoft's Windows division, called the . device a 'tablet that's a great PC - a PC that's a great tablet.' They will be available when Windows 8 ships later this year, according to a Microsoft statement. No details on pricing were mentioned, except that it would be 'comparable' with current ARM tablets and Intel-powered Ultrabooks. Microsoft has been . making software for tablets since 2002, when it shipped the Windows XP . Tablet PC Edition. Many big PC makers produced tablets that ran the . software, but they were never big sellers. The tablets were based on PC . technology, and were heavy, with short battery lives. Launching its own tablet potentially . throws Microsoft into direct competition with its closest hardware . partners such as Samsung and Hewlett-Packard. The price of the tablet, which will come in 32GB and 64GB versions, has not been revealed, but the 32GB iPad costs from £479. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said the tablet will be an entertainment device ‘without compromising the productivity that PCs are uniquely known for’. Apple has sold 67million iPads in the past two years, and Microsoft is keen to grab a piece of a market where analysts predict sales will top 180million a year in 2013. But industry experts questioned whether the company could mount a serious challenge to Apple. Sarah Rotman Epps, of technology analysts Forrester, said Microsoft had to spell out how the Surface would be different from the iPad. She added: ‘They need to explain how Microsoft manufacturing this device will change people’s experience with a tablet.’ Eddie Wrenn looks at the history of three titans - Apple, Microsoft, and Google - as they battle for dominance. Acceptable in 2006: Windows Mobile just before the first iPhone came out . Microsoft has dragged its feet a bit too long in the tablet market - in almost an exact repeat of the smartphone market. The iPhone revolutionised the smartphone market in 2007, and then the iPad kickstarted the tablet craze in 2010. When it came to smartphones in 2006, Microsoft were the entrenched market-leader. The Windows Mobile 6.5 operating system - which was outstandingly ugly and built for a stylus, but very flexible software-wise - had more than 90 per cent of the smartphone market just seven years ago. It was very unintuitive - but it was all the market had, and users had to wait for the at-the-time small-fry hardware manufacturer HTC to come along and build a skin to show Microsoft that technical prowess could go hand-in-hand with eye-candy. Meanwhile Microsoft could not not have a decent tablet to market. They had kept trying to at least create the market, but kept missing the key features people wanted: portability, usability and style. But Microsoft could never get deliver anything beyond clunky . interfaces or heavy, style-less hardware in either market, and so they limited their . potential to niche appeal. With Apple breaking new ground, this should have given Microsoft a clear goal to step in and join an established market. And this would have been fine, if it was not for the Rise of Google - . or more importantly, Android. Once Apple paved the way, Google swooped . in with their open-sourced, flexible and  well-received operating . system. Hardware manufacturers, locked out of Apple's closed world, could . adapt Android with almost no cost and no restrictions, and quickly a . swarm of smartphones, and then tablets, swamped the market - some great, . some good, and others terrible. The sad thing for Microsoft is that this used to be them - they could . license their software and different vendors, such as Dell, or HP, . could build computers or smartphones. But Google has all but cleared up this market, and Microsoft being late to a market once again could be be deadly to the giant. Windows Phone 7, despite a warm reception from critics and . whole-hearted support from Nokia, still languishes at the bottom of the . mobile market, unable to gain mass-traction. It is still behind the long-dead Windows Mobile for market-share, despite all of Microsoft's advertising pushes. But whereas it took about four years for Microsoft . to compete with the iPhone, luckily the gap for the tablet market is . only around two years. This may change over the next few years, but it will be hard to break . into either Apple's hardcore fanbase, or Android's million activations worldwide a . day. The Surface may not have the same hurdles. Business professionals may find this a suitable netbook or laptop replacement. Those who do not find Apple or Google's offerings good for productivity may swarm to Microsoft. And as Microsoft unifies the experience within all its markets and builds its own eco-system, containing Windows 8 on the PC, Windows Phone 8, and the Metro-themed entertainment of the Xbox 360, they may win back a lost generation of people who like Microsoft's technical expertise. Slim: The Surface is - perhaps not coincidentally - 0.1mm thinner than its chief rival, the iPad . Innovative: But Microsoft has not yet announced how much the Surface will cost when it goes on sale . Each device comes with a kickstand to hold it upright and a keyboard that is part of the device's cover . Components: Microsoft's Panos Panay gives the audience an inside look at the tablet's built-in keyboard . Trendy: Microsoft appears to have learned something from rival Apple when it comes to presentation . Sales of tablets are expected to triple in the next two years, topping 180million a year in 2013, easily outpacing growth in traditional PCs. Apple has sold 67million iPads in two years since the device's launch. Apple, which makes both hardware and software for greater control over the performance of the final product, has revolutionised mobile markets with its smooth, seamless phones and tablets. Rival Google may experiment with a similar approach after buying phone maker Motorola this year. Watch the video .","Microsoft tablet will use same Windows 8 operating system as PCs .

Danielle Watson, now clean, says she 'loved' taking horse tranquiliser ketamine and mephedrone, commonly known as 'meow meow', at parties, and quickly fell into a pattern of taking 5g - 50 lines - of each drug every day. Both substances cost £10 per gram.

A judge has accepted James Holmes' plea of not guilty by reason of insanity - as the Colorado theater shooting suspect smirked and yawned his way through the hearing. Holmes, who allegedly killed 12 theater goers and injured 70 more as they watched The Dark Knight Rises last July, looked indifferent as he followed the ground rules of the plea in court on Tuesday. After Judge Carlos Samour Jr. read through the 18 points and asked Holmes if he had any questions, Holmes answered 'no' in a clear, firm voice. Samour then accepted the plea, setting the stage for a lengthy mental evaluation of Holmes. The judge also determined prosecutors can have access to a notebook that Holmes sent to a psychiatrist filled with violent drawings before last summer's rampage. Scroll down for video . Keeping you up James? Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes yawns during a hearing in court in Centennial, Colorado, where a judge accepted his insanity plea for the massacre . Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder following the shootings in Aurora last summer, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. The insanity plea is widely seen as . Holmes' best chance of avoiding execution, and possibly his only chance, . given the weight of the evidence against him. Holmes' lawyers repeatedly have said he is mentally ill, but they delayed the insanity plea while arguing state laws were unconstitutional. They said the laws could hobble the defense if Holmes' case should ever reach the phase where the jury decides if he should be executed. The judge rejected that argument last week. 'Killer': James Holmes sported a beard and longer hair as he appeared in court on Tuesday . Silent: Holmes only said 'no' when the judge asked him whether he had any questions about his plea . On Tuesday, Samour ordered Holmes to . undergo a mental evaluation at the state hospital in Pueblo, as soon as . the hospital is ready to conduct it. But . evaluators want to review the 40,000 pages of evidence in the case . first, so it's unclear when it will happen. Samour set a tentative . deadline of August 2 for Holmes' evaluation. Colorado law defines insanity as the inability to distinguish right from wrong caused by a diseased or defective mind. If jurors find Holmes not guilty by . reason of insanity, he would be committed indefinitely to the state . mental hospital. He could eventually be released if doctors find his . sanity has been restored, but that is considered unlikely. In court: Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. accepted the plea, setting the stage for a lengthy mental evaluation . If jurors convict him, the next step . is the penalty phase, during which both sides call witnesses to testify . about factors that could affect why Holmes should or shouldn't be . executed. The jury would then decide whether Holmes should be executed or sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. If jurors impose the death penalty, it . would trigger court appeals and open other possibilities that would . take years to resolve. The hearing came as the court . released dozens of pretrial motions filed by defense attorneys . challenging the admissibility of ballistics, handwriting and mountains . of other evidence. The . motions challenge the search and seizure of computers, a pistol from . Holmes' car outside the theater, evidence taken from Holmes' booby-trapped apartment, emails and other items. Scene: Members of the the prosecution team are pictured at the Century 16 theater last July, days after Holmes allegedly killed 12 people and injured 70 more there as they watched a film . Apartment: Authorities said Homes had booby-trapped his apartment for police after the shootings . The motions also indicate the prosecution has as many as 3,000 witnesses, including FBI and Aurora officials, and demands that prosecutors hand over as many as 2,000 pieces of physical evidence. They also signaled that Holmes will seek a change of venue because of pretrial publicity. Lawyers also argued about whether . prosecutors should have access to a notebook Holmes sent to psychiatrist . Lynne Fenton. Media reports have said the notebook contains violent . drawings. Defense lawyers . argued Fenton never received the notebook so prosecutors shouldn't have . access to it; prosecutors say police would like to do unspecified . 'additional processing' on the notebook. Samour ordered the notebook to be turned over next week. Missed: People visit a memorial for the victims across the street from the movie theater last July . Victims: Six-year-old Veronica Moser, left, and 18-year-old AJ Boik, right, a popular musician and art student, were among the 12 people who lost their lives in the shooting last July . Hundreds of people were watching a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises at the Aurora theater July 20 when the shooting occurred. The dead included a Navy veteran who threw himself in front of his friends to shield them, an aspiring sports journalist who had survived a mall shooting just two months earlier, and a six-year-old girl. Prosecutors say Holmes spent months buying weapons, ammunition and materials for explosives and scouted the theater in advance. He donned police-style body armor, tossed a gas canister into the seats and opened fire, they say.

U.S. intelligence pressured the writer of the film Zero Dark Thirty to alter or remove scenes of torture from the script, it has been revealed. The blockbuster film about the killing of Osama Bin Laden, dubbed a 'publicity coup' for the CIA and Obama administration, had scenes cut or rewritten at the request of the agency. It was already known that the filmmakers had been provided with secret information about how the raid was planned, but the latest revelations show the extent to which spies shaped its narrative. Scroll down for video . Censorship: The CIA asked the writer of Zero Dark Thirty to alter a scene so that the film's protagonist, CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, does not help torture a prisoner, a newly released memo reveals . The CIA's informal censorship efforts were revealed in a cache of documents released after a Freedom of Information request by Gawker about the agency's cooperation with director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal. Among them is a secret 2012 memo which summarises five conference calls between Mr Boal and the CIA's Office of Public Affairs in late 2011. During these conversations, Gawker reports, Mr Boal 'verbally shared the screenplay' for Zero Dark Thirty, allowing the CIA's press officers to give their feedback and suggest changes. One major alteration suggested by the CIA comes in the film's controversial opening scene, in which its protagonist, CIA agent Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, watches as a prisoner is tortured during interrogation. An earlier version of the script had . Maya participating in the torture, which included waterboarding and . shoving the man into a tiny box, but the CIA told Mr Boal this was not . true to life. Collusion: Screenwriter Mark Boal had a string of conference calls with the CIA's PR department in which he 'verbally shared the screenplay' According to the memo: 'We emphasised that substantive debriefers [like Maya] died not administer Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, because in this scene he had a non-interrogator, substantive debriefer assisting in a dosing technique.' The next sentence is redacted. But it then goes on: 'Boal said he would fix this.' That scene provoked much critical debate, with Maya's ambivalence and observer status scoured for artistic meaning. 'Of course, the scene reads a bit differently if the choice was dictated by a CIA propaganda officer,' remarks Gawker writer Adrian Chen. A second scene which the CIA took issue with, according to a memo, featured a dog intimidating a prisoner. 'We raised an objection that such tactics would not be used by the Agency,' says the memo. 'Boal confirmed in January that the use of dogs was taken out of the screenplay.' Of course, threatening detainees with dogs - an animal which Muslims tend to be culturally averse to - has been a well-known tactic in the War On Terror. The technique, which is sanctioned in certain circumstances in U.S. Army interrogation manuals, was pioneered in Guantanamo Bay and features in some of the most disturbing photos of the abuses at Abu Ghraib. The memo obtained by Gawker is just the latest document to be released revealing the extent of the collusion between the CIA and the makers of Zero Dark Thirty. In January it was revealed that Ms Bigelow and Mr Boal were provided with a complete 'roadmap' of how the Abbotabad raid was planned during a 45 minute meeting with Michael Vickers - the country's highest ranking civilian intelligence official. The filmmakers also received briefings from top CIA and military intelligence officers and Navy Seals who carried out Operation Neptune Spear - the code name for the attack on bin Laden's compound in Pakistan in May 2011. Those releases followed a freedom of information request by campaign group Judicial Watch. Its president Tom Fitton accused the White House of acting improperly by giving 'politically-connected filmmakers extraordinary and secret access to bin Laden raid information' The group accused the Obama administration of sharing the 'intimate details' to help the filmmakers release a movie ‘perfectly timed to give a home-stretch boost' President Barack Obama's re-election campaign last year.","Original opening scene had CIA agent Maya helping torture a prisoner .

Two U.S. Navy sailors were convicted and sentenced to prison on Friday for raping and robbing a woman on Okinawa in a crime that outraged many on the southern Japanese island. Seaman Christopher Browning, of Athens, Texas, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Skyler Dozierwalker, of Muskogee, Oklahoma, were found guilty by the Naha District Court of raping and robbing a woman in her 20s in a parking lot in October. Both admitted committing the crime. Browning, 24, was sentenced to 10 years and Dozierwalker, 23, received nine years. Guilty: U.S. sailors Skyler Dozierwalker (left) and Christopher Browning (right) were sentenced to nine and ten respectively for raping and robbing a Japanese woman in a parking lot in October . Anger: The case outraged many Okinawans, who have long complained of military-related crime on their island, such as the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 2005 . The case outraged many Okinawans, who have long complained of military-related crime on their island, such as the rape of a 12-year-old girl by three U.S. servicemen in 2005. According to details released during the trial, Dozierwalker and Browning grabbed the Japanese woman at her apartment door after she ignored them when they attempted to talk to her during the early hours of October 16. The men followed her home and covered her mouth while dragging her to a nearby parking lot. The pair then repeatedly choked and raped her, stole 7,000 yen (around $87) from her purse and left. In court, Dozierwalker testified that he 'felt like a monster' when he heard the details of the crime. Prosecutors had sought up to 12 years in prison for Browning and 10 years for Dozierwalker, arguing that they had 'indulged their lust,' and 'committed acts of humiliation and cruelty against the victim.' Both men admitted their guilt, but the defense had argued that such a long sentence would be excessive. Apologies: During the case, as pictured in this courtroom sketch, both sailors expressed their remorse and willingness to accept responsibility . Huge presence: Okinawa hosts around two-thirds of the 50,000 U.S. military personnel in Japan, such as at this US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan . In handing down the verdict, . presiding judge Hideyuki Suzuki said the sentences were in line with the . severity of the crimes, which he called 'contemptible and violent.' The sailors were temporarily deployed . to Japan with their unit and were reportedly drinking before the rape took . place. They will serve their sentences in a Japanese prison. During the case both sailors expressed their remorse and willingness to accept responsibility. According to Japan Daily Press, Dozierwalker even stated that he knew what sexual abuse was like as he had been molested when he was eight. Dozierwalker told the court he was responsible for the crime and claimed he was sorry for 'leading Browning down the wrong path.' Browning reportedly cried into his own hands and gave personal apologies to the victim, the Japanese public and the U.S. military.

Dozierwalker told the court he was responsible for the crime and claimed he was sorry for 'leading Browning down the wrong path.' Opposition: The rape in October came amid large protests over the U.S. military's decision to base the controversial Osprey aircraft aircraft at an Okinawan Marine facility . The U.S. military initially took the men into custody, but after protests, they were handed over to Japanese law enforcement to be tried. One man was sentenced to six and a half years while the other men were given seven years in a Japanese prison. The 2012 rape case sparked tougher restrictions for all U.S. service members in Japan, including a 11 pm - 5 am curfew and drinking restrictions. Yet since Browning and Dozierwalker were arrested there has been at least one crime committed every month by U.S. servicemen involving alcohol, as reported by the Japan Daily Press. In November a drunk serviceman reportedly broke into an apartment and punched 13-year-old boy who lived there. Tensions between U.S. troops and Okinawans are endemic because of islanders' complaints of noise, the danger of accidents and crimes committed by servicemen. The rape in October came amid large protests over the U.S. military's decision to base a new kind of aircraft at an Okinawan Marine facility. The controversial MV-22 Osprey, a hybrid between a helicopter and plane, has suffered a series of fatal accidents. Japan has asked the U.S. not to base the Osprey at Okinawa due to concerns over its safety record. Although most crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Japan are handled by military courts, they can be prosecuted in Japanese courts in cases that occur off base and are deemed to be particularly serious, such as murder and rape.

With just a week to go before The Great Gatsby hits the big screen, Prada have released a set of original sketches showing how Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher's glamorous 1920s gowns took shape. The sketches include a spectacular mint green frock laden with jewels, a neat navy and purple sequined number and a wonderful fur-collared cocktail dress embellished with supersized golden sequins. In total, Prada creative director, Miuccia Prada, produced 40 bespoke dresses for the film, many of which were inspired by selected Prada and Miu Miu runway looks from the last 20 years. Spectacular: A sparkling striped, sequinned pinafore frock and a shimmering dove grey flapper dress . The main wardrobe for the film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher, was created by legendary costume designer, Catherine Martin, who also worked with Prada on an earlier Baz Lurhman film, Romeo + Juliet. 'Baz and Miuccia have always connected on . their shared fascination with finding modern ways of releasing classic . and historical references from the shackles of the past,' explains . Martin. 'This connection is central to our relationship with Miuccia . Prada on The Great Gatsby, and has connected our vision with hers. 'In . the same way Nick Carraway reflects on a world that he is within and . without, we have tried to create an environment that the audience will . be subconsciously familiar with, yet separated from.' Costumes takes a leading role, with a shimmering succession of silk gowns embroidered with crystal and sequins; velvets, furs and dancing fringing; flickering shades of emerald, jade, topaz and gold. Wonderful: A cocktail dress festooned with large golden sequins and a pretty crystal laden mint green gown . Particularly fashionable are the pivotal ball segments, set in Gatsby’s lavish fairytale mansion, during which the Prada and Miu Miu designs look set to steal the scene - in particular Mulligan's golden Prada party gown laden with crystals. 'Our collaboration with Prada recalls the European flair that was emerging amongst the aristocratic East Coast crowds in the 1920s,' adds Martin. 'The fashions of the time saw the development of a dichotomy between those who aspired to the privileged, Ivy League look of wealthy Long Island and those who were aspiring to European glamour, sophistication and decadence. 'Our collaborations with Prada reflect the collision of these two aesthetics.' Some of the dresses in the collection have already gone on display at the Prada New York Epicenter in an exhibition which will run until 12th May. The launch party saw Great Gatsby stars Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher join Miuccia Prada and Catherine Martin at the Prada New York Epicenter for some 1920s-style cocktails ahead of the film's New York premiere the following day. The fashionable film is to make its debut in UK cinemas next week. Collaboration: Miuccia Prada (far right) with Baz Lurhmann and the stars of the long awaited Great Gatsby .

Philippa Dorries, 27, has been put on the public payroll while studying for a degree at London's BPP Law School. The revelation has re-ignited the row over MPs employing relatives, which flared up following the case of former Tory Derek Conway, who was paying his sons, but offered little evidence they worked for him. Using public money: Tory MP Nadine Dorries (left) has been paying her daughter Philippa (right) a salary of up to £39,000 to work as her office manager . According to The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which oversees MPs' pay and allowances, Philippa is listed as earning between £35,000 and £39,999. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'All the information has been on our website for about a year. It's all part of being transparent.' The spokesman said there was 'no suggestion' Phillipa was not doing the job, and said he was unable to reveal how many hours she is working or her precise income as it was only listed within a £5,000 income bracket. Mrs Dorries, the member for mid-Bedfordshire, revealed on Twitter that her daughter is only paid the hours she works. This morning she wrote that for the last two years her daughter had been working part-time at home with reduced pay because of her reduced hours. She said she had informed the IPSA.

Mr Conway, who was a Tory MP at the time, employed his son Freddie as a political researcher while he was a full-time student at Newcastle University, but a probe found 'no record' of what work he had done for his £1,000-plus a month salary. His father was suspended from Parliament for 10 days, ordered to repay £13,000 and was thrown out of the party.

Foreign crimebusters such as US supercop Bill Bratton will be given the chance to take over British police forces under radical new plans to be unveiled by Home Secretary Theresa May. And former Army officers will be recruited as police superintendents in an attempt to end the ‘closed shop’ police culture blamed for bungled investigations and corruption. The changes, set to be fiercely opposed by police chiefs, rip up the centuries-old tradition of only British citizens serving in the police. They also abolish the rule that senior policemen have to work their way up from being a bobby on the beat. Tough: Bill Bratton (pictured left) cut murders in New York but couldn't lead in London . Mrs May believes there are too few talented people at the top of the police. Crucially, she hopes the shake-up will lead to more women and people from ethnic minorities in high command. The reforms will have a major effect on policing at three levels: . Theresa May believes there are too few talented people at the top of the police . Mr Bratton, former head of New York City Police and the Los Angeles Police Department, was drafted in by David Cameron to advise on tackling gang warfare in Britain in 2011. The Prime Minister had suggested putting him in charge of the Metropolitan Police but was forced to drop the plan after protests by British police chiefs. In the end, the job advert said ‘only British citizens can apply’. Mrs May’s initiative follows mounting controversy over policing in the UK highlighted by the cover-up in the Hillsborough stadium disaster, police conduct in the phone-hacking scandal and the ‘plebgate’ row between former Minister Andrew Mitchell and Downing Street officers. Her controversial decision to cut constables’ starting pay by £4,000 can now be seen as part of a major overhaul of police recruitment and salaries. Ministers privately complain that one of the major problems in fighting crime is the ‘lack of talent’ in senior policing posts. A Downing Street source said: ‘It will bring a breath of fresh air to policing. We can’t slam the door in the face of talent just because they haven’t paced the high street as a PC. And without these changes, it will take decades to change the all-white and all-male image of the police.’ When Mr Cameron first suggested hiring Mr . Bratton, he said: ‘Why shouldn’t someone with a different skill-set be . able to join the police force in a senior role? Why shouldn’t someone . who has been a proven success overseas be able to help turn around a . force at home?’ Success: Mr Bratton became known for his 'no-nonsense' approach to policing when he was in charge of America's two largest police departments. He halved New York's murder rate . But Sir Hugh Orde, president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘I am not sure I want to learn about gangs from an area of America that has 400 of them. The notion that you can ship someone in from another country to run a police force in a  different environment and a different culture is quite simply stupid.’ Mr Bratton, 65, became renowned for his ‘no-nonsense’ approach to policing when he was in charge of America’s two largest police departments.

Council bosses have abandoned attempts to move Abu Hamza’s wife from her £1million taxpayer-funded house. Officials admitted yesterday they are ‘powerless’ to throw out Najat Mostafa, the hook-handed cleric’s second wife, from the five-bedroom property in an exclusive west London street. Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which pays her rent, asked her to downsize last year after discovering that only two of the couple’s seven children were living there with her. Exclusive: The home of Abu Hamza's wife Najat Mostafa in Shepherd's Bush, London, is the only council-owned house in a street favoured by lawyers and bankers . Terrorism charges: The hook-handed radical cleric was deported to the US to face charges last year . But it said it had changed its mind after recently carrying out an audit and discovering that two more of her children have since moved back into the house, meaning she is no longer classed as ‘under-occupying’. The local authority declined to reveal the ages of the children or how much rent is payable for what is the only council property in the street in Shepherd’s Bush, an area popular with bankers and City lawyers. Hamza also has a son from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1984, and has never officially lived in the home. His Moroccan-born wife moved into the large property in 1995 after claiming that the couple had separated. But neighbours said the hate preacher was often seen at the house until his arrest in August 2004 over allegations of incitement to murder and racial hatred. Mrs Mostafa has received thousands of pounds in benefits during her time living there and the house has twice been refurbished during the past decade, costing taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds. Hamza was extradited to the United States to face terrorism charges last year, having delayed his deportation in the courts since 2004. He is accused of hostage-taking in Yemen and supporting attempts to set up an Al Qaeda training camp in the US. Large family: Hamza has seven children with Mrs Mostafa . The cleric, infamous for his firebrand preaching against Britain and the West at North London’s Finsbury Park mosque, was previously jailed in Britain in 2006 for incitement to murder and racial hatred. Mrs Mostafa lives next door to former work and pensions secretary Lord Hutton, who declined to comment on the row over the house. But another neighbour, who described himself as retired but would not give his name, said: ‘It is ironic that she is living next door to the man who gave them so many handouts. ‘I am not happy she is here. She is very reclusive, she does not mix with neighbours. You see her walk down the street at quite a pace. ‘Nobody knows how many children are living there.’ A spokesman for Hammersmith and Fulham Council said: ‘We found that she is no longer under-occupying and she is living perfectly adequately in the property with the right number of children living there. ‘The council has no power or ability to tell her, or even ask her, to leave because she is not under-occupying.’ It is also unable to evict her as there is no time limit on her tenancy agreement. The council said that since she signed her lease, it had changed its policy and that all new tenancy agreements were limited to five years, so that tenants could be moved if their circumstances changed. Mrs Mostafa refused to comment. It emerged this week that radical cleric Abu Qatada has complained that his taxpayer-funded house is not big enough for his wife and their five children.","Council pay rent on exclusive London five-bed home for hate cleric's wife .

"By . Michael Zennie and Louise Boyle . UPDATED: . 16:53 EST, 29 February 2012 . Condemned: Robert Moormann was executed today in Arizona after murdering and dismembering his mother in 1984 . A death row inmate was executed today after killing and dismembering his adoptive mother despite last-minute appeals over his mental disabilities. Just before he was put to death, Robert Henry Moormann used his last words to apologize to his family and to the family of an eight-year-old girl he kidnapped and molested in 1972. He said: 'I hope this brings closure and they can start healing now. 'I just hope that they will forgive me in time.' Moormann was the first Arizona inmate to be executed with one lethal drug, as opposed to the state's long-standing, three-drug protocol. The switch was made after it was realised on Monday that one of the drugs had expired. It meant Moormann was given only two days' notice of how he would be put to death instead of the official seven days. Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a request for a stay, the two-member execution team gave the lethal injection to Moormann at 10.23 am. The 63-year-old was pronounced dead at 10.33 am. Moormann appeared to writhe around more than other inmates executed with the three-drug protocol. And unlike other prisoners, who appeared to fall asleep immediately, Moormann kept his eyes open during the entire execution. For his last meal he had requested  a double hamburger, french fries, two beef burritos, two 14-oz containers of rocky road ice cream and three RC Colas, according to the Arizona Department of Corrections. The execution took place just a minute's drive from the Blue Mist Motel, where on January 13, 1984, he beat, stabbed and suffocated his adoptive mother, Roberta (Maude) Moormann, 74. She had sexually abused him into adulthood, according to defense lawyers. Troubled: Moormann was released from prison for a 72-hour visit when he murdered his mother - he was caught when he asked to dump 'cow guts' in the dumpster of a local pizzeria . Robert Henry Moormann confessed to . smothering his mother and standing naked in a hotel room, 'dissecting' her. He cut off her head, legs and arms, halved her torso and flushed . all her fingers down the toilet. Moormann's lawyers claimed the 63-year-old killer was mentally retarded and had the intellect and emotional capacity of a small child. They argued the attack was provoked by years of sexual abuse by his mother Maude Moormann - even while he was in prison. Moormann was free from prison on a 72-hour furlough - given to inmates to see family or for conjugal visits. The murder prompted the state to stop its policy of allowing such leave. He was initially jailed for kidnapping an eight-year-old neighbour and trying to take her to Las Vegas in 1972. Along the way, he sexually abused her several times in dusty motels. She was found alive after the horrific ordeal and Moormann jailed for kidnapping. Prosecutors said he wanted to abduct and rape the girl's mother, but lost his nerve and took the child instead, according to the Arizona Republic. On the murder of his mother, . Moormann's lawyers told a different story. They said his mother, the . widow of a well-known businessman from Flagstaff, had been sexually . abusing him for years - forcing him to perform sex acts on her. End of the road: A lethal injection chamber at the Arizona State Prison in Florence where Robert Moorman died today . Maude . was actually Moormann's adoptive mother. His biological mother, a . 15-year-old hard-drinking prostitute, died in a car crash when she was . 17. Lawyers claimed it was in the midst of a performing a sex act on his mother, aged 72, that Moormann put a pillow over her face to keep her quiet. Once she was dead, he went about meticulously trying to dispose of her body. He put her body on the table of the motel and cut it to pieces. He then carried the pieces to dumpsters around the town and disposed of them. Adopted: Moormann killed his adoptive mother Maude. Family members say she was the only person who ever loved him unconditionally . He was caught when he arrived at a local pizzeria and asked if he could dump 'cow guts' in the trash bin behind the business. The suspicious owner called the police. He also stripped some of his mother's bones of their flesh and packed them in a box. He gave the box to a prison employee and said they were spoiled meat bones for the prison guard dogs. All of this, the lawyers said, was the result of Moormann's severely diminished mental capacity. His psychologists, and even fellow prison inmates, have testified that beneath his gruff voice, bald head and over-sized glasses, Moormann has the mental capacity of a small child and still maintains an infantile affect and demeanor. Moormann's lawyers also cited his difficult early childhood in their defense of the killing. His mother gave birth to him June 4, 1948 at the age of 15 and his father soon abandoned him. Two years later, his mother, an alcoholic and a prostitute, broke her neck in a car crash and died. Moormann was passed to his grandparents, though he was soon removed to foster care because his grandfather was an uncontrollable alcoholic. He passed in and out of foster homes before being adopted at the age of two by Henry and Maude Moormann. Henry was reticent about adopting the child, but Maude's maternal instinct won over and the couple took him in. The Moormanns were well-known in Flagstaff. Henry ran a taxi service in town. But early on, family members told the Arizona Daily Sun, they saw trouble in Robert. Grisly crime: Moorman suffocated and dismembered his mother Maude at the Blue Mist Motel a short distance from the state prison where he was officially released for a family visit in 1984 . He was classified as mentally retarded in school and given special education classes. When he was 13, he was committed to a state mental hospital after he shot his mother with a .22-caliber rifle. Moormann claimed he was simply taking the gun out to show it to his mother and that it fired accidentally. When Henry Moormann died in 1967, Maude clung to her adopted son. 'It's over, it was a horrible crime. The man knew what he was doing. There was no doubt in my mind.' Tom Rankin, retired police chief who caught Moorman . In 1972 at age 24, Robert Moormann kidnapped an eight-year-old girl next door. Court testimony indicated he might have been more interested in the child's mother - whom he wanted to rape - but lost his nerve and snatched the girl from school. Prosecutors alleged that he sexually abused the child as he carted her off to Las Vegas. However, he was never convicted of that crime. Even after Moormann was jailed, Maude, now elderly, visited her son - taking a bus more than three and a half hours from Flagstaff - three times. It was on her third visit that Moormann murdered her in the hotel room where they were staying. Rex Gilliand, a distant relative of . Maude, who knew Robert Moormann briefly, said the convicted murderer was . a 'throwaway' child who never got the attention from most of the people . in his life that other kids receive. 'The one person in the whole world who loved him unconditionally, he kills brutally,' Mr Gilliand told the Daily Sun. Tom Rankin, who was . Florence's police chief at the time of the killing and interviewed . Moormann, said he attended the execution to get some . closure in the case. Outside the prison today, the former chief said: 'It's over. It was a horrible crime.' Lock down: Moorman ate a last meal of hamburger, fries and rocky road ice-cream on death row in Arizona . Rankin, who retired from the police department in 1994, rejected arguments from defense attorneys about Moormann being too mentally disabled for the state to legally execute. He said: 'Those are excuses attorneys try to dig up to save someone's life. It just costs the taxpayers more money. The man knew what he was doing. There was no doubt in my mind.' Arizona joins Ohio, Texas and several other states that last year made the switch to pentobarbital after the only U.S. manufacturer of execution drug sodium thiopental said it would discontinue production. In July, the only U.S.-licensed manufacturer of pentobarbital announced that it would put the drug off-limits for executions. And a company that bought the pentobarbital line in December is required to also keep it from use by prisons for executions. Once states use up their current supplies of pentobarbital, executions could be delayed across the country as officials look for yet another alternative.","Robert Moorman's last words were to apologise to rape victim's family .

Cleared: Reg Traviss (pictured last week) said he was 'gobsmacked' over the rape accusation after he had sex with the woman in December 2011 . Reg Traviss today said he was ‘gobsmacked’ after hearing he had been accused of rape - and admitted his time in court last week before being cleared of all charges was ‘absolute torture’. The 35-year-old film producer and ex-boyfriend of Amy Winehouse said CCTV footage from his brother Richard’s London nightclub ‘made all the difference’ to ensuring he was found not guilty. It showed his 27-year-old accuser having no difficulty walking from the club to a taxi - despite jurors at Southwark Crown Court being told that she was ‘so drunk she couldn't stand up or walk’. ‘They were more than lies,’ he told the Sun of her accusation. ‘It is one of the worst things you can say about a man. This was a girl I thought of as a friend. I had known her since 2007.’ Mr Traviss - who was accused of raping the woman twice in his flat in Marylebone, central London - had been in a relationship with Winehouse from 2010 and they were planning to marry when she died in July 2011, aged 27. The CCTV showing Mr Traviss and the woman walking out of the club in December 2011 in heels unaided was found by the defence team and became a key part of the case. Mr Traviss and the woman later had sex at his flat. But a month after they kissed goodbye the next day, the woman told police she had been raped by Mr Traviss - leaving him devastated and wanting to be co-operative with officers ‘to clear things up’. Couple: Mr Traviss (right) had been in a relationship with Amy Winehouse (left) from early 2010 (pictured together in London in June 2010) and they were planning to marry when she died in July 2011, aged 27 . But Mr Traviss said a police report described him as ‘the famous film director and partner of the late Amy Winehouse’ and he wondered if he was a ‘big scalp’, but was not scared about telling the truth. He said the woman who gave evidence was angrier than the person he thought he knew - and has no emotions towards her now. He said the allegation was a ‘disgusting insult’ to real victims of rape. ‘It was absolute torture being locked in a glass box in court listening to shocking lies being said about you,’ he told the Sun. ‘I was so close to my life being over - and I had done nothing wrong.’ Mr Traviss said he was ‘staring at a death sentence’ and faced up to 10 years in jail if convicted - but following the end of the trial he is now looking forward to the ‘rest of my life’ and making a new film. Cleared: Speaking on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court last week, Mr Traviss said the police should have dropped the investigation after looking at CCTV that contradicted her version of events . The director, who made the 2010 film Psychosis, featuring Buffy the Vampire Slayer star Charisma Carpenter and The Darkness singer Justin Hawkins, was first arrested over the allegations in April. 'It was absolute torture being locked in a glass box in court listening to shocking lies being said about you. I was so close to my life being over - and I had done nothing wrong' Reg Traviss . His lawyer, Ian Winter QC, said last week: 'It is an exceptional case and I don't think in my career that I have defended a case where I have been so sure of my client's innocence. 'What is unbelievable is that if we hadn't found them coming out of the club on that CCTV, which the police had totally failed to identify, there was a real risk of a miscarriage of justice.' Hearing the verdicts last week, Mr Traviss closed his eyes and bowed his head. Emerging from the dock, he thanked Judge Deborah Taylor and hugged his family and friends. And speaking on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court, Mr Traviss said the police should have dropped the investigation after looking at the CCTV that contradicted her version of events.","Film producer Reg Traviss, 35, cleared of rape at London trial last week .

The former home of Bernie Madoff’s brother has been put up for auction - even though there are still signs inside which read: 'United States Marshall. No Trespassing.' Peter Madoff's mansion has gone on the market for $4.4 million complete with white tags on every item where it has been inventoried by financial crimes investigators. His reading glasses are on a mantelpiece, there is marmalade in the fridge and his clothes are in boxes in the closets - whilst one of his wife's artificial nails is still in the bathroom. On the bookshelf is a volume that has a heavy irony given what happened next: 'A Code of Jewish Ethics, Volume 1: You Shall Be Holy,' by Rabbi Joseph Telushkin. Auction: The former Long Island home, pictured, of Bernie Madoff¿s brother, Peter Madoff, has been put up for auction .

Proceeds: The proceeds of the sale will go towards paying back victims of the brothers' Ponzi scheme . There are numerous paintings of dogs, antiques along the hallway, a well-stocked library and marble and gold trim throughout the ground floor. But a closer look reveals that all is not quite what it seems - some of the paintings are missing and are just empty frames as they have been taken away to be auctioned off. The white tags on all the items were put on when financial crimes investigators went through the whole house marking up what was inside. It was then spruced up and the gardens landscaped to make it look attractive to buyers. Kevin Kamrowski, a deputy United States marshal, told the New York Times: 'When dealing with a home this grandiose, the outside world can lose sight of where all these fine things come from.

'Everything in this home was obtained on the backs of other people.' Mr Elliott said that there have been offers on the property but none have been accepted yet, although some had been curious about the Madoff history. He said: 'The less I know about a situation, for me, the better. 'My job as the real estate broker on this is to get the victims as much money as humanly possible.' The sale is not the first time that Madoff family assets have gone under the hammer.

Also under the hammer were offerings from Bernie's personal library which included politics satire Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, a guide to Judaism called Chutzpah and other works titled In the Shadow of the Law, and End in Tears. All in all more than $2 million was raised by the U.S. Marshals at the auction, which showcased items which had been seized from Bernie's New York penthouse flat. Bernie, who is serving a 150 year sentence for his crimes, has recently complained from his prison cell that he cannot sleep at night and that he is racked by remorse. Some $2.3 billion has been recovered for his victims by a fund administered by the Justice Department, although a separate fund has clawed back an additional $9.3 billion.

"By . Laurie Whitwell and Michael Zennie . UPDATED: . 10:33 EST, 9 October 2011 . As the parents of missing 10-month-old Lisa Irwin's parents patch up talks with police amid a cloud of suspicion, the Missouri couple says they will set up a trust fund in hopes of finding their daughter. But family spokesman Mike Lerette said Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley will be giving fewer media interviews, because they want full attention on finding their daughter. The couple met with police on Saturday for the first time since officers said they had stopped cooperating with the investigation on Thursday. Scroll down for video . 'We don't know:' Parents appeared on morning shows Friday to fight claims that they have stopped cooperating with police . But Irwin and Bradley said they only needed a break from incessant police questioning. Kansas City Police Department Captain Steve Young told ABC News: 'They're talking with us and that is absolutely the best thing.' Lisa Irwin has been missing from her Kansas City home since Monday night. The couple reported her missing Tuesday, saying she'd been snatched from her crib overnight. The news came as police questioned a teenage neighbour of the parents of the child. On Friday, forensic experts took a DNA sample from the neighbour who had been at the Irwins' home the day Lisa vanished. The neighbour also knew the access code to the family garage, ABC News reported. Investigators are also looking into a . second lead, after a couple in California were seen with a small child . fitting Lisa's description, relative Mike Lerette told KMBC-TV. 'They're pursuing surveillance tape on a couple with the baby in California,' said Lerette. Find her: Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin say they are frustrated with their treatment by police, who have begun accusing Bradley . Statistics on infant abductions in the U.S. show that one of the least likely scenarios in the disappearance of a baby is that a stranger broke into the family's home and quietly snatched the child from the crib. The numbers also lead experts to believe that if Baby Lisa were taken by an intruder in the middle of the night she is probably still alive. David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Centre at the University of New Hampshire, said that strangers who kidnap infants or young children, though rare, often do so because they want a child of their own, not because they intend to hurt or kill the child. Ernie Allen, president of the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Arlington, Virginia, added: 'The recovery rate for infants is very, very high. There is real hope here.' 'Suspicion almost always falls heavily on the parents, especially when it's young kids,' Mr Finkelhor said. 'Fifteen hundred parents kill their kids every year, and that's heavily focused on the under 1 year of age category.' Mr Allen said his organization has handled 278 infant abduction cases during his nearly three decades with the group. Only 13 cases involved a stranger coming into a home and taking a baby, and all but one of those children were recovered unharmed. The investigation into the . disappearance of baby Lisa took a grim turn yesterday as the FBI . revealed it has begun searching a landfill in Kansas as part of its . search for the 10-month-old who disappeared from her crib four days ago. More than a dozen investigators were . at the waste dump, 23 miles from the Kansas City house where she . disappeared, for several hours today although they did not appear to . remove any evidence. The mother of the missing baby . revealed yesterday police had accused her of having a role in her . 10-month-old daughter's disappearance from her Kansas City home. 'From the start when they've questioned . me, once I couldn't fill in gaps, it turned into ""you did it, you did . it,' Bradley, 25, told Good Morning America on Friday. Police say the baby's parents have stopped cooperating with investigators and Bradley admitted to failing a lie detector test. The . Deffenbaugh Industries Johnson County landfill is across the state line . in Shawnee, Kansas. The garbage collected in Kansas City goes to the . Shawnee dump. But . the couple are sticking to their story that little Lisa Irwin was . abducted from her crib after Bradley put her to bed at 10:30pm Monday. Jeremy Irwin, Lisa's father, says he came home from work at 4am Tuesday . and found the front door unlocked, his daughter's bedroom window open . and Lisa gone. They took to morning talk shows today to fight back against the accusations from police and renew their claims that neither of them has any idea what happened to their infant daughter. Gone: Police still have no suspects and no clear leads in the disappearance of baby Lisa . 'We don't know, which is why we need . everyone out there looking for her,' Bradley said on the Today Show Friday, with tears streaming down her face. The new developments have changed the game in the four-day-old hunt for the infant. After their announcement that Jeremy Irwin walked out of an interrogation Thursday, detectives shut down their command centre in the working-class neighbourhood where baby Lisa lived. Police said they have halted their extensive searches of the woods and areas around the home, but investigators would continue to work the case and follow leads. They still have no solid leads or any suspects. In their television interviews, baby Lisa's parents said they were still cooperating with authorities. However, Jeremy Irwin said he reached a 'boiling point' Thursday after 11 hours of questioning and couldn't stand any more. Bradley said detectives have grown increasingly aggressive in their interviews with her. 'They . took a picture down from the table and said ""look at your baby! And do . what's right for her!"" I kept saying I don't know ... I just sat there. I . didn't even ask to leave - I just let them keep asking questions,' she . told Good Morning America. At . a news conference Thursday evening, Capt . Young said baby Lisa's parents had ceased communication with . authorities. Coming up empty: More than a dozen FBI agents and officers were at the waste dump but did not appear to collect evidence . 'Tonight, they decided to stop talking to detectives, and I don't have to illustrate how that affects the investigation. That speaks for itself,' Mr Young said. Asked after the news conference what . would happen to the investigation without the parents' cooperation, . Young said he could not comment. Bradley told The Associated Press today that she took the polygraph earlier this week and police told her she failed the test. She says they didn't show her any paperwork verifying the results or know which questions she failed. Young . also said the parents' claim that whoever took their daughter also . stole their cellphones had not produced any leads. And he reiterated . that investigators still have no suspects. No leads: Police have closed down their command post and stopped searching for baby Lisa . The parents had earlier joined together to plead for the safe return of their daughter. 'We . just want our baby back. Please, bring her home. ... Please just drop . her off anywhere, please. We don’t care, just somewhere safe where she . can come home. Please,' Bradley begged, sobbing as she . clutched one of her daughter's purple teddy bears. In their first public appearance . since their daughter disappeared, . choked back tears on Wednesday as they asked the kidnapper to return their . 10-month-old daughter. More than 300 investigators took up the search for baby Lisa - using tracking dogs, horse-mounted . patrols, helicopters and taking to ropes to rappel down steep slopes. Officers stood shoulder-to-shoulder as they walked through the woods near her home. A team of FBI forensic analysts, clad head-to-toe in white sterile suits, meticulously combed the house for any trace evidence. Police . have knocked on more than 300 doors in the quiet, working-class . neighbourhood where Baby Lisa lived. But their search has been in vain . so far. One neighbour reported seeing a man with an infant in the area at 2am on Tuesday, but that tip has gone nowhere. Far from home: The landfill where authorities searched is 23 miles from baby Lisa's home . The search grows desperate but there may be hope, experts say. Most infants who are abducted are found unharmed, Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Alexandria, Virginia, told the Kansas City Star. 'The vast majority of those who take infants don’t take them to harm, so the safe return of an abducted infant is pretty high,' Mr Allen said. Strangers who kidnap infants are usually women who are looking for a baby of their own, he said. The story has attracted national attention since Tuesday. Friends and supporters from around the country gave an outpouring of support on the Facebook page 'Help Find Lisa Irwin.' More than 2,600 people have joined the group.","Parents Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin begin speaking to investigators again .

An immigrant is suing the Government for £11million for making him unhappy after he and his family were ordered to leave the country. In what appears to be a legal first, Daniel Kiunsi has issued a High Court writ for the distress he says he has suffered since the decision to eject him. He claims officials violated his human rights by confiscating his passport three years ago and says it caused his family ‘great unhappiness’. Complaint: Daniel Kiunsi, whose home is pictured, has issued a High Court writ for the distress he says he has suffered since the decision to eject him . Mr Kiunsi, who is still here, . complains that the state has failed to provide the family with their . ‘basic needs’ of accommodation and food, so he has had to pay rent, . council tax and other living expenses himself. The electrical engineer from Tanzania . says he has ‘scientifically calculated’ the appropriate figure to . compensate him and has reached the figure of exactly £11million. Conservative MP Philip Davies . yesterday described the case as ‘outrageous’ and added: ‘The whole thing . is completely ridiculous. This just goes to show how so many people see . the UK as a soft touch.’ No comment: Kiunsi's daughter told the Daily Mail her father did not want to talk about the case . The case revolves around a Home Office decision to strip Mr Kiunsi and his family of the right to live in Britain in May 2009. Mr Kiunsi arrived in the UK with his wife and three children from Tanzania on a work visa. But the Home Office revoked his right . to live in Britain when he breached the terms of the visa by returning . to the UK after working abroad. The UK Border Agency confiscated his . passport but allowed him in to the country after he gave assurances that . he and his family would return to Africa. Officials said he would be able to collect his passport when he left the country, but he remained living in Britain. Now Mr Kiunsi is demanding the right . to stay in the country as well as compensation for the ‘torture, inhuman . and degrading treatment’ he has received from the UK authorities, . citing the controversial Human Rights Act. He is understood to be citing his right to liberty, a fair trial and a private and family life to mount his case. Last night Mr Kiunsi, who is in his . forties, was unavailable for comment at his large, red-brick terraced . home in a  tree-lined street in Upminster, Essex, when approached by the . Daily Mail. Miserable: Kiunsi says the UK Government's decision to seize his passport has caused him 'great unhappiness' Requests to members of his family for . an interview via telephone went unanswered, but a young lady at the . £222,000 home, who identified herself as Mr Kiunsi’s daughter, told the . Mail: ‘My father does not want to talk about this.’ However, he is reported to have said: ‘It’s the issue of the happiness.’ The Home Office has vowed to fight the case. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We . are aware that Mr Kiunsi has made an application and we will seek to . challenge this robustly at every stage’. In a recent report by the US . government, Tanzania was judged to have serious human rights problems . including  the use of excessive force by  military personnel, police and . prison guards.

When his father took the yob responsible to a police station, he was arrested . A businessman was arrested and held in a cell for seven hours after he frogmarched a yob to a police station for shooting his son with an airgun. Stuart Pettman, 43, was furious after his 12-year-old son Oliver was surrounded by older youths and shot in the head, back and leg. Within hours, Mr Pettman had found the boy his son claimed was responsible and brought him to Bexleyheath police station, South London, to be questioned. But he was stunned the next day when police asked him to return to the station - and then arrested him on suspicion of assault and possessing a deadly weapon. The boy Mr Pettman had apprehended had falsely alleged that he was threatened with a hacksaw. Mr Pettman, who runs an internet service for financial traders, said that officers treated him 'like a criminal' by photographing him, taking his fingerprints and making him give a DNA sample. Police have told him he will not be charged, but he has decided to move his family from their £800,000 detached home in Bexley, South London, to Singapore, where he is opening a new office. 'This is typical of broken Britain, and I have just had enough,' he said. 'I work hard, I don’t break the law, I’m polite, I try to do the right thing all the time and they treated me like a criminal.' Mr Pettman’s son Oliver was in Golden . Acre Park, just yards from his home, last Saturday when he was . surrounded by a gang of seven youths who stole biscuits from him and a . friend. Suffering: Oliver Pettman (left) has endured headaches and nightmares since being shot three times and, as a close-up picture of his leg shows (right), he still has scars from the attack . The group also falsely accused Oliver of being racist. When Oliver denied he was racist, one of the thugs shot him three times with an airgun. Mr Pettman said: 'They said to him now you’re going to be my slave and told Oliver to kiss their feet.' When Oliver refused, they left him alone. Later that evening, Oliver and his father were walking down a street when he spotted the youth who had shot him. Mr Pettman insisted that the youth . accompany him to Bexleyheath police station, where the boy was arrested . and questioned before being released. Mr Pettman returned to the police . station the following day after officers called him to say they wanted to ask a few . more questions. Shortly after he got there, he was arrested. He said: 'I couldn’t understand it. I had done everything I could to help them, to get justice for my boy, and this is how I was repaid. Attack: Oliver Pettman was shot in the head, back and leg after being approached by a group of youths in Golden Acre Park, in Bexley, South London . Allegations: Oliver said he was attacked in the park after a group of youths accused him of being racist . 'It was very deceptive of the police. I thought I was only going to be there a couple of minutes so I’d even . taken my 14-year-old daughter Stephanie with me. 'They ushered her into the waiting room and took me into another office and that’s when they told me I was under arrest. 'My . son had a doctor’s appointment about his head where he had been shot. No one else could take him. I told them this but it didn’t seem . important to them. 'It was all very intimidating. For someone who’s not got a criminal record I didn’t know what the hell was going on. 'I . just couldn’t believe they’d took the word of someone who’d shot my son . over and above me and the fact my son might have had a head trauma and I . couldn’t take him to be looked at by a doctor.' Oliver's father, Stuart, frogmarched the boy his son claimed was responsible to Bexleyheath Police Station (above), but the 43-year-old was himself arrested when he was asked to return to the station the next day . After her father was arrested, Stephanie had to make her own way home. Oliver has been too scared to leave the house . and suffers from headaches and nightmares. He is awaiting a doctor's . assessment of his head wound. The case has enraged the leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, who says he has known Mr Pettman for 25 years. Mr Farage has written to the Metropolitan Police's borough commander for Bexley, Chief Superintendent Victor Olisa, demanding an explanation for Mr Pettman's arrest. In the letter, Mr Farage alleges that police searched Mr Pettman's home for 'weapons' and studied CCTV footage of the moment the businessman asked the teenager to accompany him to the police station. Mr Farage wrote: 'People rightly feel let down by a justice system which treats criminals as if they were victims and victims like they are the perpetrators of crime.' Outraged: UKIP leader Nigel Farage has written to the Metropolitan Police asking for an explanation for Mr Pettman's arrest . In a statement, Scotland Yard said that, at about 4.15pm on August 18, officers in Bexley were approached by a 12-year-old boy who alleged that he had been threatened and shot by a youth with a BB gun. The officers searched the area, but found no trace of the gunman. 'Shortly after 8pm that day a 43-year-old man brought a 14-year-old boy to Bexleyheath police station and alleged he was a suspect in the shooting and threatening allegation,' the statement continued. 'The 14-year-old boy [A] was arrested by officers on suspicion of ABH and possession of an imitation firearm.

People hoping to start a new relationship can generally expect a prospective partner will come with baggage of some kind. But Lisa Smith comes with one of the tallest orders of all - no sex. Ever. Speaking with Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes on the ITV This Morning sofa today, Lisa confessed she 'hopes to find a man who is wiling to embrace her asexuality'. While she is willing to extend intimacy to levels of cuddling, she finds the act of sex itself completely repellent. Scroll down for video . Lisa's first sexual experience was with 'someone I trusted who was wonderful, but I saw it as a chore' Sitting with ITV psychologist Emma Kelly, Lisa said: 'I don't think anything's ever set completely in stone, but this is how I feel now.' Her teenage years at school were difficult, especially in sex education. 'It didn't seem like something I would ever do. I was embarrassed because everyone was giggling - especially girls. 'I saw it as a coming of age thing - something I wanted to get it out the way.' Speaking about her first sexual experience Lisa said: 'I was in a relationship with someone I trusted who was wonderful, but I saw it as a chore and I didn't want to do it. After trying everything in the bedroom to rid her of her disgust for the act she still felt repulsed . 'It was a case of ""I want to be with him, and I have to do this in order to be with him"".' 'All my partners were patient men willing to do anything to make me happy. They didn't pressure into anything.' But, she says, even after trying everything in the bedroom to rid her of her disgust for the act she still felt repulsed and found sex didn't 'do anything' for her. Emma Kelly said asexuality affects one per cent of the population in the UK - so it's a lot more common than people might think. Lisa said she gets frustrated when people say maybe she 'hasn't met the right man', she's 'not doing it right', or that maybe she just 'likes women but hasn't realised it yet'.' Lisa wants to settle down but thinks being 'an asexual vegan who doesn't want kids' will hold her back . 'I'd love to be in a loving relationship and settle down,' she said. 'But the extent of intimacy would be cuddling.' When asked about her hopes for the future and finding a man to settle down with, Lisa's reply reveals her fears. 'I'm an asexual vegan who doesn't want kids - I'm thinking crazy cat lady.' 'I want to get married and have a house - but no sex.' She then admitted it was a 'tall order'. Psychologist Emma jumped in and said 'people underestimate men' and this is 'an opportunity'. While it's a 'tall order', psychologist Emma said people underestimate men and this is 'an opportunity' Lisa said that if she met the man of her dreams and he wanted sex, she would say no. 'I would have to tell them from the beginning. I'd feel like I was compromising myself and I would detest them for making me do something I don't want to do.' Since her article for the Mail, Lisa said she's had really positive response from AVEN [the Asexual Visibility and Education Network]. 'A lot of them don't feel they can come forward and say it,' she said. But, unfortunately, she said she has also had some 'horrible' comments, like: 'You can't get a man and this is how you cover it up'. She finished on a final hopeful note that 'there are people who physically can't have sex and still have relationships', and that 'it's harder of men to admit to it as ""being up for it"" is expected of them 24/7'. An asexual is someone who does not experience sexual attraction. Unlike celibacy, which people choose, asexuality is an intrinsic part of who we are. Asexuality does not make our lives any worse or any better, we just face a different set of challenges than most sexual people. There is considerable diversity among the asexual community; each asexual person experiences things like relationships, attraction, and arousal somewhat differently. Asexuality is just beginning to be the subject of scientific research. SOURCE: AVEN . Watch our clip of Lisa's interview on This Morning below.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 10 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 10 March 2013 . Iain Duncan Smith was embroiled in a battle with the new Archbishop of Canterbury last night. The Work and Pensions Secretary told Church leaders there was ‘nothing moral’ about their opposition to flagship welfare reforms. He reacted with fury after the Most Rev Justin Welby led an uprising against the Government’s plans to limit benefit increases to one per cent a year for  the next three years. Mr Duncan Smith, a devout Roman Catholic, insisted it was neither fair nor moral to trap millions of families on welfare payments which made it not worth their while seeking work. The intervention of 43 bishops threatens the biggest row between the Government and the Church since the Coalition was formed in 2010. Collision course: Archbishop Justin Welby and Welfare Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Defending welfare reforms, Mr Duncan Smith told the Church that there is 'nothing moral' about trapping people on benefits . Mr Duncan Smith is understood to be particularly angered because at a private meeting last week the new Archbishop made no mention of his concern about the benefit cap, let alone the Church’s plan to launch a public assault on it. The Coalition has announced that increases in out-of-work benefits and some tax credits will be limited to one per cent for the next three years, a move which will save more than £2billion a year. Traditionally, benefits have been increased in line with the rate of inflation. That prompted uproar last year, when the formula meant their value increased by more than five per cent at a time when many working families had to contend with pay freezes or below-inflation rises. The Coalition’s Welfare Uprating Bill, passed by a big majority in the Commons, will affect single parents on benefits most. They will lose on average £5 a week. Working households receiving state support in the form of tax credits will be an average of £3 a week worse off, though the Treasury insists this will be more than cancelled out by record increases in the basic-rate income tax allowance. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith says that the benefits bill rose 60 per cent to £200billion under Labour, an unfair burden on taxpayers . A letter signed by 43 bishops and endorsed by the new Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York claimed that capping benefit rises would have a ‘deeply disproportionate’ effect on children. 'People who are paying taxes, working . very hard, have hardly seen any increases in their salary and yet, under . the last government, the welfare bill rose by some 60 per cent to . £200billion.' - Iain Duncan Smith . The welfare bill will be debated in the Lords next week and bishops in the house have tabled an amendment in an attempt to exempt all child-related benefits and tax credits. Archbishop Welby, in his first significant political intervention, said the reforms could push 200,000 children into poverty, adding: ‘As a civilised society, we have a duty to support those among us who are vulnerable and in need. When times are hard, that duty should be felt more than ever, not disappear or diminish. ‘It is essential that we have a welfare system that responds to need and recognises the rising costs of food, fuel and housing. ‘The current benefits system does that, by ensuring that the support struggling families receive rises with inflation. ‘These changes will mean it is children and families who will pay the price for high inflation, rather than the Government.’ Under the welfare reforms, increases in out-of-work benefits will be pinned back to one per cent a year for three years . He added: ‘Politicians have a clear choice. By protecting children from the effects of this Bill, they can help fulfil their commitment to end child poverty.’ Mr Duncan Smith, hitting back, said the Government’s legislation was ‘about fairness’. ‘People who are paying taxes, working very hard, have hardly seen any increases in their salary and yet, under the last government, the welfare bill rose by some 60 per cent to £200billion,’ the Work and Pensions Secretary said. ‘That means they have to pay for that under their taxes, which is simply not fair. That same system trapped huge numbers, millions, in dependency, dependent on the state, unable, unwilling to work. 'What is either moral or fair about that? Objection: The Archbishop has led Church protests against the cap, claiming it will push 200,000 children into poverty . ‘There is nothing moral or fair about a system that I inherited that trapped people in welfare dependency. Some one in every five households has no work – that’s not the way to end child poverty. ‘Getting people back to work is the way to end child poverty. That’s the moral and fair way to do it.’ Labour enshrined in law its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – in law, and used tax credits to try to push families just over the line. Incredibly, nine in every ten families with children ended up qualifying for credits. The last government set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11. This was not met, with a total of 2.3million that year. The Coalition has now agreed to tear up Labour’s definition – insisting that basing it purely on a crude measure of family income is perverse, when other factors can be just as critical in determining children’s life chances. Mr Duncan Smith suggests broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether or not parents are in work, educational failure, family breakdown, problem debt, gambling and poor health. He insists that giving a family ‘an extra pound in benefits’ does not address their problems – and can even push a family further into difficulty if a parent spends the cash fuelling his or her dependency on alcohol or drugs. Justin Welby’s attack on the welfare reforms is the second time in recent years that the Church of England has become embroiled in a political row. In June 2011 his predecessor as Archbishop, Dr Rowan Williams, took David Cameron to task, questioning the democratic legitimacy of many of the Coalition’s flagship policies. The Left-leaning Children’s Society charity – which is allied to the Church of England – came up with the figure of 200,000 children who would be pushed into poverty by the welfare cap.However, such predictions are fraught with difficulties. The arbitrary nature of the current poverty measure – anything below 60 per cent of median earnings – means that the recession actually helped lift 300,000 children out of poverty without any meaningful change in their circumstances. It happened simply because average incomes fell. While some in government had wanted to freeze all benefits, Mr Duncan Smith agreed to limit increases to one per cent a year while committing to raise certain benefits in line with inflation to protect the most vulnerable. These include benefits for carers and disability benefits such as attendance allowance, the disability elements of tax credits, disability living allowance and the support component of employment and support allowance. Even with the welfare cap, Government spending on benefits and tax credits is forecast to increase from £210billion to £218billion by 2015/16. The new universal credit, meanwhile, will make three million households better off. It is hard to disagree with Mr Duncan Smith’s central contention that the best way to help children out of poverty is not by giving their parents an extra pound a week to push them over an arbitrary line – but through work.","IDS has gone head-to-head with the Church over benefits overhaul .

'I have no wish to be part of Argentina,’ said Rob McGill, 67, of isolated Carcass Island, who voted by post. 'I consider myself a Falkland Islander, but my ancestors came from Britain,' he said.

Theresa May used a speech setting out her political philosophy to make an extraordinary overture to another leading contender to  succeed David Cameron. The Home Secretary’s colleagues had expected her to use a weekend rally to try to dampen speculation about her leadership ambitions. Instead she sketched out a broad platform for power ranging far beyond her Home Office brief. As well as proposing a new industrial and economic strategy just days before the Budget, Mrs May suggested she wants to allow those running free schools and other public services to make a profit. That is a key demand of Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has been tipped as a potential leader but has said he does not have the ‘right sort of character for the job’. She vowed the next Tory manifesto would include a pledge to tear up Labour’s Human Rights Act and said she wanted to examine pulling out of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been blamed for preventing the removal of terror suspects. Maria Miller, the Culture Secretary and one of the most senior women in the Government after Mrs May, yesterday backed her as a potential leader, saying she had ‘fantastic credentials’ for the top job. The Home Secretary, hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, has become the focus of intense speculation amid rumours of unrest on the Tory benches. Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes who is not one of the ‘usual suspects’ for discontented criticism of the Prime Minister, wrote yesterday on Twitter: ‘Inner circle still look far too posh, male and white and Cameron is running out of time to fix it. Mrs May used her speech to the ConservativeHome conference to declare her loyalty to David Cameron, but it is understood that she considers Boris Johnson - another potential leader - to be 'faintly ridiculous' ‘I am a Cameron loyalist but he needs to change his inner circle which just seems to be telling him what he wants to hear.’ 'Fantastic credentials': Maria Miller gave her support for Mrs May as a potential leader . Mrs May will not challenge Mr Cameron, and used a speech to Tory faithful at a ConservativeHome conference to stress her loyalty to him. But friends say she is a ‘realist’ setting out her stall in case of defeat in 2015 and Mr Cameron’s departure. She is understood to regard Boris Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him ever becoming leader. One MP was said to have been approached on Friday afternoon by a fellow member and asked if he would support a future leadership bid by Mrs May. A hard core of around 25 malcontents is considering a push for a leadership contest if this month’s Budget and local elections in May go badly. In her speech, Mrs May insisted that ‘getting a majority Conservative government, led by David Cameron, is vital in 2015’. But she suggested she was not convinced the Prime Minister had done enough to persuade voters that the Tories are prepared to take on ‘elites’. Tory MP Conor Burns said it had been ‘refreshing to hear a frontline Conservative speaking of what an unencumbered Tory government would do differently and mean it’. He added: ‘As I’m well known for my loyalty to Lady Thatcher I’m far from opposed to female leaders.’ Tim Montgomerie, editor of ConservativeHome, said comparison with German chancellor Merkel was apt: ‘Here you have two women who are quite unfussy, quite straight talking and also well known for competence.’ Former Tory Cabinet minister Michael Portillo said he had been guilty of ‘underestimating’ Mrs May. Britain's Angela Merkel? Comparisons have been made between Mrs May and the German Chancellor . Here is what the woman hailed by her supporters as Britain’s answer to Angela Merkel said ... and what she meant: . Theresa May: ‘Today’s event is all about a choice of leadership – between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.’ What she meant: Mrs May is confident enough to open with a teasing joke that nods to speculation about her own ambitions. TM: ‘It’s often said that politics is about public service, and of course it is. But to me, it’s about much more than that.

TM: ‘Getting a majority Conservative government, led by David Cameron, is vital in 2015. We’re going to have to fight hard.’ What she meant: Mrs May pledges loyalty to Mr Cameron but suggests she is ready and waiting should he lose in 2015. TM: ‘The next Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act and we should also consider our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights.’ What she meant: In a deliberate overture to the Tory Right, Mrs May looks forward to Tory rule – without Lib Dem vetoes. TM: ‘A future Tory government should go further in increasing the number of charities, companies and co-operatives that deliver frontline services. If allowing those organisations to make a profit means we have a more diverse supply side and better outcomes, that is something we should consider.’ What she meant: In perhaps the most  radical section of her speech she floats the idea of allowing businesses and other groups to run new free schools to make a profit – a key aim of Michael Gove. Mrs May appears to be trying to forge an alliance with the Education Secretary. Mrs May's words appeared to suggest that she wanted to form an alliance with Michael Gove, left, while she also made an implied rebuke to David Cameron over his handling of NHS chief Sir David Nicholson . TM: ‘We need to think about ... taking on trade unions that are resistant to change and speaking up when people have been let down by big bureaucracy, like the appalling absence of care at Mid-Staffordshire Hospital. It also requires taking on vested interests in the private sector.’ What she meant: An implied rebuke to Mr Cameron for standing by Sir David Nicholson, the head of the NHS, in the wake of a report into the Mid-Staffs scandal. More broadly, Mrs May appears to be sketching out her own ‘underdog Conservatism’. TM: ‘We need to expand our nascent industrial strategy. We should pursue a relentless campaign to support entrepreneurs and wealth creators – like granting generous tax exemptions for start-up businesses.’ What she meant: A remarkably bold  economic and industrial policy just days before George Osborne’s Budget.

A Persian rug from the early 17th century sold for $33.7 million in New York City at roughly $600,000 per square foot. Sotheby's auction house said Wednesday's price for the Clark Sickle-Leaf Carpet was more than three times the previous auction record for a carpet. The Sickle-Leaf Carpet sold to an anonymous telephone bidder. Tidy pile: This ancient Persian rug, which dates back to the 1650s, sold for an incredible $33.7 million at Sotheby's in New York . The exquisite handwoven carpet is . more than 360 years old and measures 8ft 9ins by 6ft 5ins. It sold for $33,765,000, or about $601,380.34 per square foot. 'I thought it might sell for 10 or 15 million dollars,' Mary Jo Otsea, the auctioneer and senior consultant for rugs and carpets at Sotheby’s, told The Washington Post. 'No one ever expected to see it on the market. Its beauty and rarity — the closest comparables are in museums.' The intricately woven rug of red, blue and green colors was owned by an American billionaire  industrialist who bought it in the early 1900s, and the artifact was donated to a museum after his death in 1925. Since then the carpet, decorated with an asymmetrical pattern of sickle-shaped leaves, has been regularly displayed at the Corcoran Museum in the US capital, Washington DC. However, the museum decided to sell the rug to raise funds, generating huge excitement among antique carpet collectors across the world. Despite its age, the rug is said to be in exceptional condition, suggesting it had been hung for many years rather than being laid on a floor. Otsea said before the sale: 'This is a beautiful example of carpet weaving. 'In my 30 year career, this is the most exciting and important collection that I have dealt with. Careful owner: The intricately woven carpet of red, blue and green colours was bought by an American billionaire industrialist William Clark in the early 1900s and was donated to a museum after his death in 1925 . 'The Clark Sickle-Leaf Carpet is without question one of the most iconic and important carpets ever to appear at auction.

'It would have been for a noble person as it would have been very expensive to make. 'William . Clark, a billionaire industrialist who also became a senator, purchased . it from a dealer in Paris while on a tour of Europe in the early 1900s. 'He must have hung it because it is in very good condition and is unlikely to have spent much time on the floor. 'He bequeathed his collection of carpets to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1925 and it is being sold by them for future acquisitions. 'Carpets of this calibre don't come up that often.'

This is the toe-curling moment a wealthy motorist surveyed the scene after his £180,000 sports car was struck by a runaway old banger. The Aston Martin DBS was parked at a petrol station yesterday afternoon when the tiny pink Vauxhall Corsa lost control going round a roundabout and careered onto the garage forecourt. It smashed into the 190mph DBS - a favourite of James Bond - as its owner stood filling it up, shunting it into a petrol pump. Onlookers watched in horror as the little pink runabout crashed into the £100,000 Aston Martin yesterday . After the accident at Swindon's Kingshill Esso garage, the Aston Martin's owner, who asked not to be named, said the car was damaged beyond repair. He said: 'I was filling up and then I saw the car coming towards me. 'She drove out of the petrol station onto the roundabout, lost it and came over the kerb and straight into my car.  My car moved into the pump and bumped the pump off.' He told the Swindon Advertiser: 'My car will be a write-off.  They won't fix that.' A passer-by, who saw the incident, said: 'She lost control on the roundabout and span around and into the petrol station. 'It all happened so fast in front of me.' Paramedics and police attended but . neither driver was hurt in the incident which happened just before 3pm. The petrol station was closed while staff worked to repair the damaged . pump. Hitting the road sign might have been cheaper: The pink Corsa hit the well-polished DBS squarely on its side . Shaken not stirred: Neither the owner of the Aston Martin nor the Corsa was injured in yesterday's accident . A spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: 'We were called at 2.55pm to reports of two cars colliding on the forecourt of the Esso petrol station. 'One of the cars had gone into a pump. There was no fire but there was a strong smell of fumes.' Aston Martin sportscars have been featured in several James Bond films, with the DBS appearing as 007's car in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. A spokesman for Aston Martin said: 'The DBS is not of the understated elegance of a DB9, nor the youthful agility of the V8 Vantage. 'It is explosive power in a black tie, and has its own unique character which will equal that of James Bond.' When the Aston Martin DBS went on sale in 2007, prices started from £180,000, but the model was discontinued last year. Powered by a 6-litre V12 engine, the 510bhp DBS is capable of 0-62mph in just 4.3 seconds, and boasts a top speed of 190mph. In real life, James Bond actor Daniel Craig, who drove the DBS in Casino Royale, is a fan, too.  Earlier this month the star, who turned 45 on March 2, was pictured taking delivery of a bright red £150,000 Vantage Roadster, leaving neighbours wondering if the convertible Aston Martin was a present to himself. Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson described the Aston Martin DBS as a model which is 'as close to perfect as a car can be'.","The sportscar, a favourite of James Bond, was filling up at Swindon garage .

The foolhardy bird opted for a spot with excellent transport links - after setting up its home inches away from a busy railway line at Mallaig terminus in Lochaber, Scotland. The seagull's daring new home has become the source of much amusement with train passengers, who can see the bird sitting on its eggs on the side of the track as carriages pass by. Unruffled: The bird continues to look unconcerned even as the wheels of a large train carriage pass directly next to its home . Cutting it fine: The seagull appears unruffled by a train steaming past as it sits near its nest in Lochaber, Scotland. Home sweet home: The seagull and its unusual choice of nesting spot has become a hit with train passengers in Scotland . Retired senior manager Geoff Wheeler was one of those who took pictures of the nest while on holiday with his wife. Mr Wheeler, 69, from Ballsall Common, near Coventry, said: 'When we arrived at the station we spotted the nest next to an adjacent track with the bird sitting on top. 'I snapped some photos but it was cold and rainy so we went to a pub for a few hours to warm up. 'When we returned the gull was still dutifully warming its eggs and there were a group of passengers taking photos. 'It was incredible and I have never seen anything like it before. The train sped past and it didn’t flinch. Dicing with death: The seagull sits carefully on its eggs, apparently indifferent to the danger of the track next to its head . Despite the bird caring for its young next the railway, passengers have expressed concern that the chicks could hatch and find their way on to the track . 'I think what happened was the rail line has only recently started operating for the summer, so when the bird built its nest there were no trains around. 'I’ve been an amateur bird watcher and in my experience birds are not too bothered about the presence of a machine, it’s people they are more worried about.' Geoff added: 'My only concern is when the eggs hatch, which will be soon, the youngsters will be crawling about and could find their way onto the track. 'But it’s very difficult to move a nest because you can spook the parents and they may not come back.'","Brave bird nests inches from railway line in Lochaber, Scotland .

Going out on the Eurovision stage and performing your song in front of 200 million viewers — and knowing your country is pinning its hopes on you — is nerve-racking enough. But, as Bonnie Tyler will undoubtedly discover tomorrow night when she represents the UK in the world’s biggest song contest, that’s nothing compared to what happens after you’ve sung and you wait for the votes to come in. If you have three hours to kill, as my father Engelbert Humperdinck had last year, after being first on — waiting while the other 25 contestants sang, then waiting for the votes to come in — then it can be the longest night of your life. I should know. I was at his side that . night and for the exhilarating week we spent preparing for the show in . Baku, capital of the host country, Azerbaijan. Engelbert Humperdinck (left) came second to last with his 2012 Eurovision entry 'Love Will Set You Free'. He said he thinks Bonnie Tyler (right) can go all the way in the competition this year . He’d been mobbed by fans and given a police motorcycle escort. His odds narrowed from 10-1 to 2-1 second favourite. He’d already sung his ballad, Love Will Set You Free, on TV and radio shows in Britain and Europe, and the feedback had been encouraging. It was looking good. Even though he’s been performing for more than 50 years, Dad still gets nervous before every show, and that night was no exception. He’s superstitious. He won’t allow whistling in his dressing room and he wore a pendant given to him by Elvis Presley — he calls it his TCB (taking care of business) necklace — for luck. Going on first didn’t augur well, according to some seasoned Eurovision experts. As commentator Graham Norton observed this week: ‘Everyone has forgotten you by the time it comes to vote. If Engelbert had gone on later, maybe he would have done better.’ But we were Eurovision virgins. We’d hoped starting the show would give us an advantage. Because of the time difference between Baku and the rest of Europe, the show wasn’t starting until midnight. Dad would still feel fresh. A later slot might have taken its toll on him through tiredness.That was our theory, anyway.  He went on, sang his song and got a standing ovation. So far, so brilliant. Then we went to the Green Room to sip champagne and watch the rest of the show, while receiving congratulatory texts from friends and family all over the world. Dad, as usual, had more stamina than the rest of us, and he stayed on his feet for the rest of the show. He remained cheerful and positive — . even when the bread-baking Russian Grannies came on and it was clear . they were going to make a big impact. They’d get the sympathy vote, but he hoped the points would go to the best song, not the most striking production or staging. We would only have had cause to worry if it had been the Eurovision Bread-making Contest! When voting began, we waited expectantly for points to come our way, but there was an ominous silence. After the first three countries, Dad turned to me and said: ‘Haven’t I got any votes yet?’ I’m not just his loving son; I’m his dutiful manager, too: it’s my job to keep things upbeat. ‘No, but don’t worry because there are still many other countries to vote,’ I told him. After eight countries we still hadn’t made our mark on the Eurovision scoreboard — it was clear we were in trouble. By the time all the results were in, Dad, who had stoically kept his cool, finished second from last — just ahead of Norway — with only 12 votes in total. He took it philosophically. ‘Oh well . . . I gave it my best shot, and I hope no one in the UK feels I let them down,’ he said. ‘The voting was out of my hands.’ With his head held high, gracious in defeat, he did the rounds backstage, congratulating the winner, Sweden’s Loreen, who sang Euphoria; the Russian Grannies, who came second with Party For Everyone; and every participant on their performance. Back at the hotel, Dad changed out of his tux into jeans and a  T-shirt, and — for a man who had just had a major disappointment — he was totally relaxed, though still worrying that people might feel he hadn’t done his best. There were plenty of laughs, but no recriminations, no what-ifs, no buck-passing. Dad was still as proud at being asked to represent the UK as he had been three months earlier, when I told him the BBC wanted him to do it. ‘I’ve got no regrets,’ he told me that night after the show. ‘I’d do it all over again if I was asked.’ We didn’t get to bed until 6am, and after a few hours’ sleep we went to a great barbecue on the beach, organised by the BBC. Wine flowed, there was lots more laughter and Dad even sang songs karaoke-style. Everyone agreed there was no better voice around. When we flew home, the airport was full of well-wishers — they seemed more upset than Dad by the result. He’d given it his all. After all, we consoled ourselves, it was a song contest, not a General Election. Dad has since recorded a CD of duets with Elton John, Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, Neil Sedaka and Charles Aznavour, and he has performed in 60  countries around the world. Not once has he looked  back — his motto is ‘Onwards and Upwards’. Now he’s sent a letter of good wishes to Bonnie: we’ve got our fingers crossed for her. And Dad hopes there isn’t a bunch of bread-baking Russian Grannies to ‘totally eclipse’ her.","Engelbert Humperdinck passes words of advice and luck to 2013 hopeful .

Astronauts traveling to and from Mars would be bombarded with as much cosmic radiation as they would get from a full-body CT scan about once a week for a year, researchers predict. That dose is enough to raise their cancer risk by about three per cent, but experts caution that there are many uncertainties about the space environment's effects on the body. As plans for deep space exploration ramp up, radiation is a big concern - from high-energy galactic cosmic rays spewed by distant supernova explosions to sporadic bursts of charged particles hurled by the sun. Destination Mars: An artist's impression of Nasa's Orion capsule in . orbit. Astronauts traveling to the red planet will be exposed to high levels of radiation, raising their . cancer risk considerably, researchers predict . Earth's magnetic field helps to deflect much of that harmful radiation. The U.S. space agency, Nasa, aims to send a crew to orbit the red planet by the mid-2030s. Private outfits like Inspiration Mars - backed by Nasa engineer-turned-space tourist Dennis Tito - are seeking volunteers for a Mars flight. There have been previous efforts to gauge the radiation risk for future Mars travelers, but the best estimate is coming from Nasa's Curiosity mission. Tucked inside the rover when it launched in 2011 was a radiation sensor that took readings during the 8 1/2-month cruise to Mars. Nasa shows astronaut Clay Anderson waves during a spacewalk outside the International Space Station. NASA engineers are testing propulsion systems and researching ways to reduce radiation exposure on a Mars flight . Artist's rendering: The Orion - or Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) - can be seen in the centre of this vision of a possible mission to Mars . From those figures, scientists calculated a spacefarer's radiation exposure for a quicker six-month voyage in a similarly shielded spacecraft. A roundtrip equates to about 662 millisieverts. That's a sizable chunk of an astronaut's career cap of 1,000 millisieverts which many international space agencies use to limit the accumulated radiation dosage in space. The dose is similar to getting a full-body CT scan every five or six days, said lead researcher Cary Zeitlin of the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado. The estimate doesn't include time spent on the Martian surface. Red planet: A Nasa artist's impression of a first mission to Mars. Nasa, aims to send a crew to orbit the red planet by the mid-2030s .

Taking shape: The Orion, which mimics the classic conical shape of the Apollo mission crew capsules, is one of the most advanced craft ever built . The analysis appears in Friday's issue of the journal Science. The amount of radiation likely won't change unless there's a rocket engine that can speed up the interplanetary ride, researchers said. 'You want to get there as quickly as possible' to reduce radiation exposure, said Don Hassler, scientist in charge of the radiation instrument aboard Curiosity. The radiation dose on a Mars trip would be higher than what crew members inside the International Space Station typically face - about 200 millisieverts per year. By contrast, people on Earth are typically exposed to about 3 millisieverts a year. Curiosity flew to Mars during a period of low to moderate solar activity. A manned mission that launches during a solar flare or storm would encounter more radiation.

'Before we can send astronauts there, we . need to understand the environments and hazards that they would face,' said Chris Moore, deputy director of advanced exploration systems at .

Today they called for further research on the bones of Neanderthal man to look for signs of human tooth marks. Lunch?

'We think that modern humans, who occupied a similar ecological niche as Neanderthals, directly competed with Neanderthals for the food and other natural resources,' Martínez-Navarro told Discovery News. The researchers point out several other species have suffered similar fates, killing off their nearest relatives. In 2009, researcher may have found the first evidence of the theory analysing the markings on a Neanderthal jawbone found in Les Rois, south-west France during a study conducted by the Journal of Anthropological Sciences. The cuts to the bone are similar to those left on those of deer and other animals butchered by humans in the Stone Age, the researchers say.

When Glaswegian rockers Texas took a breather after their seventh album in 2005, singer Sharleen Spiteri thought they might be out of action for a couple of years before resuming a career that had seen them sell more than 30 million albums. She hadn’t expected the eight-year hiatus that followed, punctuated by personal upheaval, a change of record label and two solo albums. Only now, as the band finally return with new album The Conversation, does she feel ready to reflect. ‘We didn’t intend to take such a long break,’ she tells me over coffee near her London home in Primrose Hill. ‘But we needed to get away.  People were getting blasé about Texas, because we’d be on the radio all the time. I did two solo albums, but I didn’t mean to make them at the expense of the band.’ Sharleen Spiteri said the band did not intend to take 'such a long break' when they took a breather following their seventh album in 2005. She is pictured right at the 2013 Ivor Novello awards held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, earlier this month . Her first solo effort, Melody in 2008, was meant for Texas. But Sharleen felt her songs were too personal, as she wrote them after a painful split from former boyfriend Ashley Heath, father of her daughter Misty, now ten. ‘I didn’t have the patience to discuss guitar solos with the group,’ she says. ‘They are like brothers to me, but there were never any big discussions about my life.’ Another solo record, The Movie Songbook, a collection of film themes made with late producer Phil Ramone, came two years later. But Texas had been struck in 2009, when guitarist Ally McErlaine suffered a brain aneurysm and was in a coma for nine weeks afterwards. The band only began work for their new album once he recovered and said he wanted to work again. Sharleen says: ‘I didn’t think we’d make another Texas record. Ally didn’t see music as his true calling. Then, after the aneurysm, he realised he wanted to play guitar again.’ The band's new album The Conversation sees a shift from pop and R&B to the guitar-driven rock of their formative years .

The distraught couple were also . shown onto the ship from a car with blacked-out windows and taken through a staff . entrance while passengers disembarked. Mrs Coriam, 52, said: 'We were shown around the . place where Rebecca worked, through the classrooms and then we were . taken to a tiny CCTV room which had loads of people in it.' Rebecca was captured on CCTV making a mobile phone call to a friend shortly before she disappeared. Mrs Coriam said: 'We saw Bex and she looked fine on the phone - there was nothing to indicate anything was wrong. We know our daughter and on the video she seemed just normal.' Distressingly the couple were then . taken onto the deck where the captain of the ship said he thought . Rebecca could have been sitting shortly before her disappearance. He claimed she was washed over the . side by a wave. When asked about the captain's conclusions, Mr Coriam, 57, said: . 'It was very, very high up the ship, so I don't see how that could have . happened.' Mrs Coriam said she dismissed the possibility that her daughter, described as an athletic, fun and . popular girl,  had taken her own life or fallen off the ship. Missing at sea: The 24-year-old was last seen on board the cruise ship where she cared for children . She said: 'I had to climb over the . barrier to see how someone could fall over the edge - it was near on . impossible. You had to get under one rail, over another and climb onto a . wide ledge and even then there was a rail. 'I had to see and look for myself. I know Bex and I know that she would never have done that.' The as-yet unseen CCTV footage from the . deck where Rebecca is alleged to have last been seen, has been released . to the Bahamian police. Because the Disney Wonder is registered in the Bahamas, police there are handling the investigation. However, the Coriams believe the video . could contain vital clues and hope to have the footage . brought to the UK for investigation. Since their return, the . couple and their family and friends have gathered . to launch a campaign to find Rebecca who . has now been missing for six months. Vanished: The athletic children's worker disappeared after the cruise ship set sail from Los Angeles for a week-long cruise along the Mexican Riviera but her parents say they have no idea what has become of her . Mrs Coriam said: 'You go through every scenario possible. Did she fall? Was she taken off the ship? Did something bad happen to her? 'Only when we have come back and . started researching it did we realise that so many people go missing on . cruise ships every year. 'We don't know if she is dead or alive. It is the not knowing.' What was especially painful for the family was visiting their daughter's room on the ship. Among her notes and birthday cards and a banner for her 24th birthday made by children she looked after, they discovered she had a surprise for them and her sister . Rachel - four tickets to visit Disneyland Paris in April. Mrs Coriam said she had spoken to her daughter only hours before she was registered as missing: 'It was quite a quick call . but we said we would speak on Facebook on Tuesday. It was all a bit of a . rush to be honest but she seemed fine - just normal Bex. ' 'And so far as we know she worked a . normal day on Monday - she had a meal on the Monday night with all her . friends and everything was fine. 'But we never got to speak on Tuesday (March 22).' She said the phone call at 10.45pm . from Disney officials, who told them their daughter was missing, left the . couple in total shock. Mrs Coriam said: 'We just couldn't believe it. We rang everybody, all the family and everyone just arrived. It was awful. 'We didn't hear much the following day . and it was a while before they got back to us but they said everyone . was out searching for her. 'We just couldn't believe the ship hadn't stopped and no one had turned it around.' Passengers on the ship have since contacted the Coriams to tell them how much they thought of  'caring and lovable' Rebecca.","Trip to Disney in U.S. leaves them with unanswered questions .

A puppy was doused with gasoline, set alight and left for dead in Houston - with shocking photographs of the dog revealing the pain inflicted on him by the unknown heartless thugs. The Labrador Retriever, named Pier by rescuers and thought to be one to two years old, was discovered with second and third degree burns over half of his body. Large sections of fur and skin on Pier's face and body were completely burned off with parts of both ears, an eye and one of his legs irreparably scolded. Warning: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Tortured: Pier, a young Labrador Retriever suffered second and third-degree burns over 45% of his body including his face, pictured, after being covered in gasoline and set alight . Left for dead: The puppy was found after wandering the streets of Houston for a week with his horrendous injuries, pictured. He was unable to bark because of the extent of his injuries . Struggling to survive: Vets were shocked that Pier was able to survive his injuries. He was unable to bark or make a noise due to the severity of his condition but was luckily discovered  by an animal control officer near Hobby Airport in Houston and rushed to the Scout's Honor rescue shelter. Co-director of Scout's Honor, Leslie Hillendahl, said: 'This is probably one of the most difficult rescues we have done, emotionally and financially. 'We've seen a lot of bad stuff; this is hands-down the worst.' 'If you ever met the dog, he's so friendly, so nice, all he wants to do is come up and nuzzle you. I can't imagine why anyone would want to do something to a dog like that,' she added to Channel 2 Houston. Pier was discovered on February 20 - which vets believe was around a week after . the attack. Grey patches of burnt fur and pink patches of exposed skin . covered the black Labrador's body and face including his heavily injured nose and back leg. Shelter volunteers were unsure he'd survive but immediately took him to the Texas A&M Small Animal Hospital where he is still being treated. 'He'd been out about five to seven days with open wounds and burns,' Brian Hillendahl of Scout’s Honor told the broadcaster. Long recovery: The puppy is still in animal hospital. He has to be put under general anesthetic to have his bandages changes because the wounds are still so raw . Baby steps: Pier is now able to move slowly and is regaining his appetite. Vets hope his voice will return later this month . Getting better: Pier is beginning to return to a normal puppy life, even playing with a tennis ball . Fundraising drive: Scout's Honor has been raising money to pay for Pier's treatment. Thousands of supporters from across the globe have pledged their support . 'Texas A&M told us they thought it was a miracle that he didn't have any infections even though he'd been out on the street for a week in that condition.' Volunteers at the center were heartbroken by Pier's case and decided to launch a campaign to raise funds for his treatment. Since posting the pictures on Facebook they have been astounded by the response - with thousands of people from across the world writing to express their horror and offer their support for the pup. Donations have flooded in and a t-shirt has even been designed to help raise much-needed funds for Pier and other abuse cases. One donor Melissa Petersen Listul said: 'A piece of my soul died when I saw what this sweet soul has had to endure. Thank you to all those that rescued him and got him to where he needs to be.' Amanda Honeywell added: 'I hope the sociopaths responsible for this are caught and dealt with to the fullest extent of the law which probably isn't enough'. Dawn Evans said: 'I am enraged at the silence of the people - that know about who did this.' Houston police agree the attack on Pier is a horrendous case of animal cruelty but say they have little hope of catching the culprits unless someone with information comes forward. Looking up: When Pier is fully recovered he will go to a foster family in Houston . An officer told Mail Online: 'We don't have . an active investigation. It is very hard to track down any information . because he was found as a stray.' In the meantime, Pier is making huge strides forward in his recovery at a safe distance from his abusers. Initially vets thought one of his legs was so badly burned it would need to be amputated along with damaged parts of his ears but they have been able to save it. He also has sight in both eyes despite one being burned and ulcerated in the attack. And bandaged pictures of the recovering pooch have however brought some relief to his rescuers and supporters. Two weeks on he is now able to eat and move - and has even shown some interest in playing with a tennis ball. Vets say he is expected to find his bark again later this month. Although he will never fully recover - his burns are so bad he will have to have his back permanently covered - they hope he will soon begin a new happier life with a foster family. Yesterday he was put under anesthetic to change all his bandages and have a tooth also broken in the attack. 'He is one strong boy and looks like he is going to keep fighting on,' a volunteer at the shelter said.","The small puppy was covered in gasoline by his abusers before being set alight .

A British grandmother has avoided the death penalty – but faces 15 years in a Bali jail for drug-running. Lindsay Sandiford, 56, has been spared execution because of her age and for her co-operation with authorities on the holiday isle. They also rewarded her good behaviour. She is expected to be sentenced by three judges on January 3. Sandiford is one of ‘the British gang of four’ who were linked by customs officials and police after the grandmother tried to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine into the country from Thailand last May. Scroll down for video . Drug smuggling: Lindsay Sandiford, left, faces . 15 years in jail, while Rachel Dougall, right, . was jailed for just one year for her part in the plot (above, in separate . courtrooms yesterday) The usual sentence for the amount of cocaine found in the lining of her suitcase – 4.8kg – is execution and sources claimed judges still have the right to impose that penalty. Also facing an uncertain future is former antiques restorer Julian Ponder, 43, from Brighton, whose court hearing is expected to take place in the weeks following Sandiford’s case in January. But there was relief for Ponder’s partner, Rachel Dougall, the 39-year-old mother of their six-year-old daughter, when she received a one-year jail sentence in the Denpasar District Court yesterday. She could be on her way back to the UK by April, to be reunited with her daughter, because she has already been in jail for eight months awaiting trial. Nervous wait: Prosecutors on the holiday island of Bali said they would ask for 15 years jail for the 56-year-old because of her co-operation in a major drug smuggling case, but it is up to three judges . Caught: Despite Mrs Sandiford allegedly 'coming clean' and telling police who her contacts were, officers were unable to find any physical evidence to connect the grandmother with the three suspects . Hiding: Sandiford, 56, from Teesside, was stopped . at Bali Airport with 4.8kg of cocaine worth £1.6 million before being . paraded in front of the press, left, last May. In court, she . covered her face with a cloth . Lawyer Ari Soenardi said he would press for Dougall to be released on parole next month. On Wednesday, 39-year-old Briton Paul Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was also spared a heavy penalty when judges sentenced him to four years for possession of a small amount of hashish. Police originally said the four Britons faced death because of the amount of cocaine involved – but as the investigation continued, their case began to crumble. Despite Sandiford allegedly ‘coming clean’ and telling police who her contacts were, officers were unable to find any physical evidence to connect the grandmother with the three suspects. Jailed: During Miss Dougall's trial which ended yesterday, charges of possession of cocaine were dropped and instead she was found guilty of failing to inform the authorities of the presence of an illegal drug . Spared: 39-year-old Briton Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was spared a heavy sentence when the judges convicted him for possession of a small amount of hashish . Gang of four: Rachel Dougall, left, was jailed for a year after her charges were lessened while Paul . Beales, right, was imprisoned for four years for his role in the plot . Dougall and Ponder insisted that they believed a gift-wrapped package of drugs Sandiford took to their house – watched by police who insisted she go through with her delivery instructions – was a birthday present for their daughter. Although police did find drugs at the villa, it was a relatively small amount – 25g of cocaine hidden in a cigarette packet. It is understood from sources  close to the police that all  alleged conversations that took  place between Dougall and Sandiford – including one when Dougall gave the grandmother instructions on where and when to deliver the contraband – were carried out through mobile phones. Paraded: Three Britons, Beales, Dougall and Ponder, and an Indian national were seen dressed in ill-fitting orange outfits and flip-flops after their arrests in May . Arrests: Sandiford was detained at Denpasar Airport on the paradise island of Bali, Indonesia . But investigators failed to retrieve any SIM card during the raid on  Dougall’s villa. As for the cocaine found in  the cigarette packet, Ponder admitted during an earlier hearing that  it was his. Charges of possession of cocaine against Dougall were dropped. Instead she was found guilty of failing to inform the authorities of the presence of an illegal drug – a much lesser offence. For Dougall and Beales, their  relatively light jail sentences will come as a relief after Sandiford  told police that she had met both of them in Bangkok before she took the flight to Bali. She said Beales placed the drugs in the lining of her suitcase and that Dougall was the owner of the drugs, a claim both denied. Sandiford claims that her son in the UK had been threatened with reprisals if she did not agree to carry the drugs into Bali. Indonesia's drug scene is seen as something of a contradiction - as there is relatively high levels of illegal drug use and some of the strictest laws against them. The Indonesian authorities are ready to make an example of foreigners who use illegal drugs in their jurisdiction, with Bali's Kerobokan Prison housing plenty of non-Indonesians. Divided into three groups, category 1 drugs are recognised as 'therapeutically useless with a high potential for causing addiction'. They include cocaine and heroin. Sentences are the most strict - with life imprisonment for possession, and the death penalty for convicted drug traffickers. Group 2 drugs, such as morphine and methadone, are seen as 'useful for therapeutic purposes, but dangerous due to their high addictive potential'. Possession is punishable by 3 to 10 years' imprisonment, and fines of around £40,000 to £400,000. Trafficking is punishable by 4 to 12 years' imprisonment and £60,000 to £600,000 fines. Group 3 drugs, such as codeine, are seen as 'therapeutically useful and moderately addictive'. Possession is punishable by 2 to 7 years' imprisonment, and a fine of £30,000 to £280,000. While trafficking is punishable by 3 to 10 years and fine of £40,000 to £400,000.","Lindsay Sandiford, 56, was stopped with cocaine worth £1.6m in suitcase .

No job or education: Nearly one million young people have no job or education place despite a drop in the number of 'Neets' on last year . Nearly one million young people have no job or education place, despite a drop in the number of ‘Neets’ on last year. Figures show that 968,000 school-leavers aged 16 to 24 were registered as ‘not in education, employment or training’ at the end of June. While the figure is down slightly from the same point in 2011, the Coalition admitted the number languishing in what has been called the ‘lost generation’ is too high. Labour said talent was ‘going to waste’ and highlighted a rise of 100,000 in the number of Neets since the general election in May 2010. The figure reached a record high in the third quarter of 2011, with 1,163,000 young people aged 16 to 24 out of education or work. The latest data shows that one in six 16 to 24-year-olds is classed as a Neet, with many living on benefits. Rising numbers of younger school-leavers – aged 16 to 18 – are falling into the category. A total of 191,000 are registered as Neets, up from 186,000 at the same point last year. The trends emerged as a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said employers had become increasingly reluctant to hire teenagers, particularly in London. Young people are three times as likely as older workers to have been made redundant last year, it said. Only 6 per cent of employers – 3 per cent in London – recruit straight from school. For most jobs, school-leavers must compete with more experienced workers. 'Lost generation': The Coalition has admitted the number of school-leavers aged 16 to 24 in the Neet group is too high . The reluctance of firms to hire school-leavers has increased over time, even though young people are generally better qualified in academic terms. The IPPR’s Tess Lanning said: ‘The statistics show that no real progress is being made in reducing the number of young people who are not in education, employment or training. ‘The question we need to answer is why young people today find it so much harder to find stable and well-paid work than their counterparts in the 1970s, despite the fact that they are far better educated. ‘This is rooted in the lack of high-quality training and work opportunities, particularly for non-graduates. ‘Young people are far more likely to work in casual, low-paid jobs, and many of the vocational training options available offer low-level training for a specific job.’ Wasted: Shadow education minister Karen Buck, right, said the Government is allowing too much talent go to waste while education secretary Michael Gove's, left, department says they are spending a record £126billion over three years . A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are spending a record £7.5billion on education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds. ‘We are spending £126million over the next three years on extra targeted support for the 55,000 16- and 17-year-olds most in need of education and training.’ But shadow education minister Karen Buck said: ‘The Government is allowing the talents of too many young people to go to waste. Now more than ever, we need to ensure our young people have the right skills, experience and opportunities to progress in education or the workplace.’ More than half of small businesses believe school-leavers lack a basic mastery of the three Rs. Fifty-nine per cent of firms said literacy skills were poor and 55 per cent questioned numeracy skills in a survey for the Federation of Small Businesses.","Nearly one million young people have no job or education place .

Rupert Murdoch wined and dined three senior Tory Cabinet ministers and the Mayor of London during two nights in London. It emerged today that Education Secretary Michael Gove met the media mogul for a private dinner, also attended by Foreign Secretary William Hague. The night before Mr Murdoch had been joined by Boris Johnson, Chancellor George Osborne and Homeland star Damian Lewis. Rupert Murdoch held two dinners with senior Conservatives last month, including with Education Secretary Michael Gove, it emerged today . The revelations will raise fresh questions about the relationship between senior Conservatives and the Murdoch media empire. Publicly politicians have distanced themselves from media groups in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. The Leveson Inquiry into media ethics criticised how close politicians had got to senior media executives. Foreign Secretary William Hague attended the same dinner as Mr Gove . ‘Over the last 30-35 years and  probably much longer, the political parties of UK national Government and of UK official Opposition, have had or developed too close a relationship with the press in a way which has not been in the public interest,’ the report said. This included spending a ‘disproportionate amount of time, attention and resource on this relationship’ often at the expense of other more important issues. It found that there was no specific ‘deal’ between David Cameron’s Conservative party and Rupert Murdoch News International empire. But the Prime Minister is accused of undermining public confidence in politicians because there was a perception that he was too close to media executives. On Tuesday January 22 Mr Johnson and Mr Osborne met Mr Murdoch for a private dinner at the newspaper tycoon's Mayfair home. Old Etonian Lewis, who stars in the Homeland series made by Mr Murdoch's production company fox21, was also there. Critics said Mr Johnson had to be more transparent about his meetings. The following night the media mogul hosted another dinner, attended by Mr Gove, who used to be a columnist in The Times which is owned by Mr Murdoch’s News Corp. Boris Johnson and George Osborne dined with Mr Murdoch at a dinner also attended by Homeland star Damian Lewis . A source close to Mr Gove said: ‘There was a separate dinner that Michael went to that William Hague was also at.’ The Leveson Inquiry recommended that senior politicians should publicly record all contact with media bosses, including through advisors. Ministers and opposition frontbenchers should also publish a ’fair and reasonably complete’ outline details of letters, calls, texts and emails with press executives.","Education Secretary joined media mogul for dinner also attended by William Hague .

Three Jobcentre civil servants, who were the ringleaders of a £1.7million plot involving at least 1,767 bogus claims for maternity benefit, tax credit and Jobseeker's Allowance, were jailed for a total of 23 years today. They abused their authorised access to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) database to research claimants all over the country and make multiple fraudulent claims on their behalf, Croydon Crown Court heard. Anthony Ekajeh, 48, of Rainham, Essex, received ten years; Fiayo Akinwumiju, 35, of Coulsdon, Surrey, was jailed for seven and a half years; and Olufemi Kehinde, 47, of Acton, west London, received five and a half years. Three Jobcentre civil servants, who were the ringleaders of a £1.7m plot involving at least 1,767 bogus claims for maternity benefit, tax credit and Jobseeker's Allowance, were jailed for a total of 23 years today (file photo) Judge Heather Baucher said: 'These were frauds committed against the state using individuals' personal information for their own gain. 'It was public money for the most vulnerable in society and this conspiracy shows a massive amount of planning.' Three co-conspirators, who were not employed by the Jobcentre, and jumped bail, each received five years. They are Folahan Akinwumiju, 34, and Charles Okedare, 40, both from Enfield, north London; and Wale Akande, 45, of Willesden, north-west London. A seventh defendant, Akinmayowe Aiyeola, 46, from Croydon, received six and a half years; while Akhigbe, 37, of Grays, Essex, received 12 months. Neither of them were Jobcentre employees. 'This hijacking of identities is something that concerns society as a whole,' said Judge Baucher. 'These conspiracies were on a large scale, sophisticated and cleverly done.' All eight are Nigerian, who have been either granted full British citizenship or the right to permanently reside in the UK and have fathered at least 18 children between them. The gang abused their authorised access to the Department of Work and Pensions database to research claimants all over the country . Prosecutor Mr. Andrew Evans told the court: 'It was carried out by submitting a large amount of false benefit claim forms and the claimants had no idea these claims had been made and did not complete or sign the forms. 'Their identities had been hijacked. 'A large number of claims were made for Sure Start Maternity Grants (SSMG) a one-off £500 payment to help persons on benefits or low income to buy clothes or equipment for their new baby,' added Mr. Evans. A total of 1,562 bogus SSMG claims were made, plus 205 false claims to HMRC for tax credits and a lesser amount of Jobseeker claims, totalling £4,515. If the conspiracy achieved 100 per cent success, it would have made £1,722,562. In reality, more than £270,000 was obtained and a Proceeds of Crime Act investigation will follow. The civil servants were all at executive officer grade and Ekajeh worked at Dagenham Jobcentre; Akinwumiju at Crawley and Kehinde at Fulham. The vast majority of the false claims were paid into Post Office Card Accounts (POCA). 'They had also been opened in hijacked identities,' said Mr. Evans. 'The three absent defendants can be linked to SSMGs that were falsified or to the POCAs to which the benefit payments are made. 'Accounts were opened in their names or the names of their family or in one case a company under their control.' Ekajeh was suspended in March 2010 after ten years in the civil service, where he also had a deputy management role and responsibility for the stock room, which contained blank claim forms. 'From July 2009, he carried out a large number of unauthorised searches outside the area of the Dagenham Jobcentre and in his last month searched 105 other offices around the country in relation to 1,600 clients. 'He played a key and principal role in these three frauds. 'He was also involved in yet another fraud, diverting payments of genuine Jobseeker claims,' said Mr Evans. 'He altered the bank details into which the payments should have been made.' Fiayo Akinwumiju was suspended in August, 2009. 'In two weeks, he accessed 43 customers he had no legitimate reason to access. 'Shortly after, false SSMG claims were made in their identities. In one hour, he looked up 24 different benefit customers and 36 claims were made in the names of those customers. 'In a six-month period, 52 customers were accessed and false tax credit claims were made in their names.' Kehinde was suspended on October 1, 2010. 'On three dates, he used the search facility to identify and access benefit customers all over the country and false SSMG claims were made in their identities. 'He also made searches in Bedford and yielded 15 customers and 21 claims were made in those names that were false. 'All the searches were carried out after 6pm when the office was closed. He also played a key role in the fraud.' A DWP spokesperson said: 'We take internal and external fraud extremely seriously. 'It is looked into by professionally trained investigators and those caught are subject to disciplinary action, police are informed and we will prosecute. 'We have a Whistleblowers’ Hotline to enable staff to report suspicions of staff fraud and the National Fraud Benefit Hotline also refer cases of suspected staff benefit fraud.' All the defendants, except Akhigbe, were convicted of conspiring between January 1, 2009 and October 2, 2010 to defraud the DWP out of £820,000. Ekajeh, Fiayo Akinwumiju and Aiyeola alone were convicted of conspiring between November, 2005 and July, 2010 to defraud HMRC out of £898,000. Ekajeh and Aiyeola alone were convicted of conspiring to defraud the DWP out of £4,515. Akhigbe admitted five counts of fraud by false representation in relation to four SSMG claims and a community care claim.","Ringleaders were executive officer grade civil servants .

"By . Matt Chorley and James Slack . PUBLISHED: . 18:31 EST, 21 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:14 EST, 22 November 2012 . Votes: Justice secretary Chris Grayling today tabled a Bill offering three different options on prisoners' rights to vote . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today raised the prospect of Britain defying the European Court of Human Rights over giving prisoners the vote. Speaking in the Commons he repeatedly stressed the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and it was up to MPs to decide whether or not to comply with rulings from Strasbourg. Even if fines were imposed on Britain, MPs could decide not to pay them. Despite Attorney General Dominic Grieve warning Cabinet ministers they could not take a stand against a European court’s controversial diktat, Mr Grayling insisted: ‘Ultimately this Parliament is sovereign, this Parliament can decide whether it will accept a ruling of the European Court - of any sort - or whether it won't.’ It came as former justice minister Nick Herbert suggested Britain should not try to accommodate the ECHR. 'We shouldn't defy the European Court of Human Rights: we should resile from it altogether.’ Today Mr Grayling announced a joint committee of MPs and peers would consider proposals for allowing convicts sentenced to less than four years or less than six months to participate in elections. The option of retaining the outright ban would also be considered. Ministers will then 'reflect' on the report before allowing MPs to vote on one option. Mr Grayling warned the financial costs of introducing the vote for prisoners 'could be significant' but also warned of the 'political cost' if Britain defied the ECHR. 'Ultimately if this Parliament decides not to agree to rulings from the ECHR it has no sanction,' Mr Grayling added. 'It can apply fines in absentia but it will be for Parliament to decide whether it wishes to recognise those decisions, as it is with all decisions.' Scroll down for video . Attorney General Dominic Grieve has warned ministers not to express a view on giving prisoners the vote, despite David Cameron saying the idea makes him feel physically sick . Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said his party remained opposed to giving prisoners the vote. He said if the government opted to allow anyone jailed for under four years to vote, more than 4,000 burglary inmates would have the chance to choose their MP or local councillor. He added: 'The idea that depriving a prisoner of their vote means it's more likely that they will reoffend or less likely that they will reintegrate into society is absurd.' Today’s draft Bill is published one . day before the deadline to comply with the ruling by the ECHR that the . current blanket ban is unlawful. Last February, the Commons called for the blanket ban to be maintained by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22. Officials will be waiting anxiously to see how Strasbourg reacts to Mr Grayling's proposals. It could yet rule the Government is deploying a delaying tactic and decide to start issuing compensation to inmates. Former justice minister Nick Herbert said Britain should 'resile' from the European Court of Human Rights altogether . In the Commons today, Mr Grayling was repeatedly urged to stand up to Strasbourg. Labour MP Jack Straw, the former . Justice Secretary, said the ECHR had decided to 'extend its jurisdiction . from fundamental human rights into social and civic rights for which we . had not signed up'. Tory Peter Bone said the British . people would welcome Mr Grayling 'putting their views first, making this . Parliament sovereign and ignoring a Mickey Mouse court in Europe'. Nick Herbert, a former justice minister, called for the UK to leave the jurisdiction of the ECHR altogether. Writing . on the ConservativeHome.com website, he said: 'By bringing forward . proposals for a limited enfranchisement, the Government may try to claim . that it has complied with the Court's ruling,"" Mr Herbert wrote. 'But . I fear this is unlikely to be the end of the matter. The Court also . required the UK to ""enact the relevant legislation within any time frame . decided by the Committee of Ministers"". Yet it is virtually certain . that the House of Commons will vote to retain the current ban. 'There's . another absurdity in what is being proposed. Ministers may in fact be . unable to vote for, or even advocate, the existing ban - because to do . so would breach the Ministerial Code, which does not allow them to . advocate breaking the law.' He predicted that the ECHR would start awarding prisoners compensation, and the public would find that even harder to 'stomach'. 'We shouldn't defy the European Court of Human Rights: we should resile from it altogether,' he added. Mixed opinions: A string of Tory MPs - led by the Prime Minister - are resisting demands from the European Court of Human Rights for some inmates to be granted the right to vote. This is a file picture of Belmarsh maximum security jail . Sean Humber, a lawyer with Leigh Day & Co representing more than 500 prisoners seeking compensation from the Government, said: 'The Government is already facing claims for compensation running into the millions for refusing to allow serving prisoners the vote. 'Its stubborn refusal to take the necessary action is simply leaving it exposed to the cost of further claims.' David Cameron and a string of senior . ministers have made plain their disgust at the idea of giving rapists, . burglars or any other criminals the vote. But . Mr Grieve has warned senior ministers that they must abstain when the . crucial vote takes place in the House of Commons in the coming months. The law officer has also ruled that the Government must not ‘take a position’ in the debate by expressing support for a ban. His . position is that any attempt by ministers to influence the outcome . would heighten the likelihood of a full-blown confrontation with the . European Court of Human Rights. Officials . believe the UK’s case will be strengthened if Parliament as a whole – . rather than the government of the day – is seen to make the decision . that prisoner voting is unacceptable. But . it will create the farcical situation of the Prime Minister – who says . prisoner voting makes him feel ‘physically ill’ – not being able to . stand up for what he believes in the division lobby. The . instruction is likely to heighten tensions between Mr Grieve and some . of his Cabinet colleagues, who are infuriated by Strasbourg’s meddling . and want to send a clear message to its unaccountable judges. The Attorney General has repeatedly bent over backwards to accommodate the court or avoid incurring its wrath. Mr Grieve is also under pressure for his refusal to intervene in the case of SAS soldier Sgt Danny Nightingale who was jailed for 18 months for keeping a pistol given to him in Iraq.","Justice Secretary Chris Grayling tells MPs Westminster can ignore the European Court of Human Rights and refuse to pay any fines .

But in the final session before the summer recess, one Tory member appeared to get more animated than most. MP Anne Marie Morris launched into a furiously-tribal tirade today after asking a question on education. Scroll down for video: . The Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris caused a stir with her screaming rally of support at PMQs today . Despite having one arm in a sling, the Conservative MP for Newton Abbot refused to hold back . And despite having one of her arms in a sling - which she was wearing after damaging tendons in her shoulder - she appeared barely able to contain her excitement. Speaking during a typically noisy House of Commons session, the MP said: 'This government has a great record on education reform. The Prime Minister praised his backbencher for her 'feisty' form during the last PMQs before recess . The Prime Minister turned to thank his backbencher for her animated showing during PMQs . 'Given the huge success of the university technical college initiative created over 25 (sic), will the Prime Minister please confirm he will support a further round of applications this autumn and that funding is available so that businesses, universities, parents and young people in Devon...' It is not known if the round of jeers which eventually drowned out the Tory MP's question caused her outburst, or were in response to it, but either way it was not long before Morris could no longer be heard. Speaker John Bercow appeared bemused by the incident, saying: 'We got the gist of it.' The Prime Minister, who has been . criticized himself previously for getting carried away in PMQs thanked . his backbencher for her enthusiasm. In an animated PMQs - the last before the summer recess in Parliament - Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, claimed that the Prime Minister, right, was losing the confidence of his party and the country . He said: 'It's very good to see the honourable lady on such feisty form. 'She's absolutely right to speak up for university technology colleges. 'They are a great addition to the schools we have in our country.' In an animated PMQs showing, the Prime Minister also brushed aside reports that he was involved in an angry confrontation with the ringleader of Tory rebels on House of Lords reform as 'tittle tattle and rumour'. Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed David Cameron was losing the confidence of his party and the country following last night's record Tory rebellion. David Cameron was said to have approached Conservative backbencher Jesse Norman outside the House of Commons division lobbies following last night’s revolt by 91 Tory MPs. Labour MP Karl Turner wrote on Twitter that he saw a 'very angry' Mr Cameron make a beeline for Mr Norman and then start 'pointing his finger in his face'. A more sedate Anne Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot in Devon . Challenged by Ed Miliband about the incident at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron dismissed the claims as 'half-baked gossip'. Mr Miliband said: 'Last night he lost control of his party and, not for the first time, he lost his temper as well.' Mr Cameron retorted: 'If we want to see House of Lords reform, all of those who support House of Lords need to not only vote for House of Lords reform but support the means to bring that reform about.' The Government was forced to withdraw its timetable for the House of Lords Reform Bill to avoid a possible defeat with Tory rebels threatening to join forces with Mr Miliband’s party. The Bill did gain a second reading, with Labour backing, but 91 Tories rebelled including two MPs who sacrificed roles as ministerial aides to vote against the whip. Mr Miliband told the Tories: 'Last night he lost control of your party and, not for the first time, he lost his temper as well.' The Labour leader said 'we understand it was fisticuffs in the lobby' with Jesse Norman, a prominent rebel over Lords reform. 'I notice that the posh boys have ordered him off the estate today because he doesn’t seem to be here,' Mr Miliband said. He asked who was to blame for the 'disarray' in the Government - the Liberal Democrats who pushed for Lords reform or the Tory rebels. Mr Cameron replied: 'Oh dear. If the best he can do today is a bunch of tittle tattle and rumour, how utterly pathetic. 'On the day we’re introducing social care reform that’s going to help people up and down the country and we get this sort of half-baked gossip.'","Anne Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot, launched the astonishing tirade in support of technological colleges .

"By . Alice Smellie . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 1 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 1 June 2013 . The highlight of Royal couturier David Emanuel’s life was not – as you might think – watching Lady Diana Spencer emerge from her wedding carriage wearing the dress he created in 1981. It took place in a hospital office in Berkshire on February 4 this year. That is the day a Macmillan nurse showed him the blood-test result that proved he was free from prostate cancer. Every year, more than 40,000 men are diagnosed with the condition. Last year it killed 11,000. Survivor: Royal couturier David Emanuel, was diagnosed - and beat - prostate cancer thanks to his friend Andrew Lloyd Webber . David, who has also dressed Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, Jane Seymour and Bianca Jagger, has opened up about his experience to encourage other men to be tested. Although some men experience symptoms – such as frequent night urination, problems starting and stopping urinating, or pain – many, including David, do not. Indeed, it was only thanks to his friend, theatre impresario Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, that he had his prostate investigated at all. ‘I had read about prostate cancer for years but, like so many men, ignored it. Andrew, with whom I have worked many times, spoke out about his experience with prostate cancer back in 2009. Before that, he had kept it a secret from everyone. I wrote to him immediately.’ The second reason was his imminent 60th birthday. ‘Then my stepmother phoned saying that my father might have a prostate problem. So last November, I made an appointment with my GP.’ Making perfection: David Emanuel applying the finishing touches to Princess Diana¿s dress at her wedding in St Paul's Cathedral in 1981 . He was given a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test, which looks for a protein produced by the cells of the prostate, the male gland surrounding the neck of the bladder, and which releases a fluid component of semen. Elevated PSA levels may indicate a problem with the prostate. David’s level was 6.9, so his GP referred him to consultant urologist Marc Laniado at Heatherwood Hospital in Ascot, near David’s home. ‘Ideally a PSA reading ought to be under five,’ says Mr Laniado. If cancer is suspected, a variety of tests are performed. A second blood test showed that David’s PSA had gone up a little further – to 7.3. Mr Laniado also recommended he have a multiparametric MRI, with which radiologists are now able to differentiate cancerous from benign tissue. He also used the Gleason Score system, which grades cancer from one to five, with five being the most serious. The final test was a biopsy – where samples of tissue (or cores) from the rectum were removed under local anaesthetic to ascertain how much cancer is present. Unfortunately the tests concluded that David had an aggressive form of prostate cancer. ‘There was a lot apparent in the MRI, his Gleason Score was high, and most of the biopsy cores had cancer present,’ says Mr Laniado. Battle won: David Emanuel, standing in front of Diana's wedding dress at Althorp, was diagnosed with the most aggressive form of prostate cancer, but was given the all clear this year . ‘I was called into Marc’s office and just froze,’ says David. ‘I know he was talking, but I’m not sure what he said.’ ‘This numb reaction is quite common,’ points out Mr Laniado. A Macmillan nurse was in the room at the time . for support. ‘That’s when I realised it was serious,’ says David. Controversy exists over whether certain forms of prostate cancer ought to be treated. ‘In many cases the risk of side effects from treatment – such as impotence – outweigh the benefits. Prostate cancer often grows very slowly. If it is unlikely to kill the patient within their lifetime, then watching and waiting may be the right approach.’ Inspiration: Andrew Lloyd Webber, spoke of his experience with prostate cancer in 2009 . Two-thirds of those with low-risk cancer won’t have aggressive treatment. But David had very high-risk cancer – where the PSA changes fast. Mr Laniado recommended keyhole surgery to remove the prostate. ‘These days it’s possible to be very focused in removal,’ he says. David was adamant that he wanted to go ahead as soon as possible. ‘I wasn’t too worried about side effects. I told Marc that I had read what Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote. He described his impotence with great courage. 'I am one of 11, but I didn’t mention it to my nine brothers. I told my sister Margaret just before I went into the Wrexham Park Hospital on December 13, and my children Oliver and Eloise came to look after me.’ The prostate is between 2.5cm and 7cm long. Mr Laniado used a robot to help him perform the surgery. A 2.5cm incision is made just above the belly button, through which the prostate is removed, and then five small incisions – about 8mm long – above the genitals, through which the instruments are passed. ‘Cutting away the prostate is a delicate operation,’ he says. ‘But we are able to be very specific in separating it from the nerves that allow erection and stop incontinence.’ A rare complication – a minute leak from the bladder into the bloodstream – meant that David had to have a catheter for weeks afterwards. From the moment he was given the all-clear, he threw himself into his recovery. ‘I felt that I wanted to take charge and decided to be very healthy. I now swim outdoors at home every day – for about 20 minutes.’ He also drinks a rather alarming green concoction. ‘I make up huge juices out of fruit and vegetables –apple, sometimes ginger, cucumber, and some spirulina. I have a couple of these every day.’ The surgery was a huge success. ‘I had to do pelvic-floor exercises – spending a lot of time with a catheter means that you lose muscle tone,’ he explains. He also had a procedure to correct minor incontinence. But otherwise, he has not suffered any side effects. ‘This is like a second chance. And I’ve told my brothers to get tested immediately.’","Royal couturier David Emanuel was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 16:35 EST, 2 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:35 EST, 2 June 2013 . A mother of three is facing death after being refused a breakthrough cancer treatment. Kathy Craven, 43, who has been fighting breast cancer for five years, was denied the treatment because of a recent NHS funding clampdown. Just two months ago, she would have got a new type of radiation therapy, but she was not referred to hospital until it was too late. Mother of three: Kathy Craven (pictured with her three boys, Alfie, 13, Finn, eight, and seven-year-old Casey) is determined not to lose the chance of spending more time with her family . She had gone to her GP surgery 15 times with telltale symptoms that her cancer had spread to her liver – but was told  she was probably too young for that to have happened. The therapy, which could halve Mrs Craven’s tumours, was cut from the Cancer Drugs Fund list of treatments in April. In a further bitter twist, the radiation would even save the NHS money as it costs less than the chemotherapy she is having – which is failing to work. Now Mrs Craven, her partner Brian Russell, 47, and three boys, Alfie, 13, Finn, eight, and seven-year-old Casey are determined not to lose the chance of spending more time together. She said: ‘Time is of the essence, and I don’t understand why I and women like me can be refused funding – it is grossly unfair. ‘When this nightmare started and I had to tell my boys that I had cancer, I promised them that I would do everything and anything in my power to stay with them for as long as I possibly could. I was elated when I discovered there was a real chance of extending my life, but it has turned to despair. ‘My oncologist says I need to be treated within the next month, and I will fight this decision – I am fighting for my life.’ Mrs Craven, who lives near Wimborne, Dorset, had pinned her hopes on a breakthrough treatment called Selective Internal Radiation Therapy, known as SIRT, in which millions of tiny radioactive beads are injected into the artery that supplies the cancer. Battle: Selective Internal Radiation Therapy only became available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund two years ago after a fight by doctor Becky Smith (pictured), who was denied it by a local trust. She died last year . It only became available in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund two years ago after a fight by doctor Becky Smith, who was denied it by a local trust. She eventually got treatment after a U-turn but died in May last year. Since then SIRT has been axed pending a review – a decision which could stop up to 500 patients getting it this year. Doctors can make funding requests for ‘exceptional’ patients, but two attempts to get treatment for Mrs Craven have been rejected. 'Time is of the essence, and I don’t understand why I and women like me can be refused funding – it is grossly unfair' Kathy Craven . When first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, aged 39, she made the brave decision to also have her healthy breast removed because cases of cancer in the family meant odds were stacked against her. Despite the operation, by October 2010 Mrs Craven felt very unwell and feared the cancer had spread. But it took 15 visits to GPs and a private CT scan before a huge mass was found on her liver. She said she was ‘over the moon’ when her doctor said SIRT treatment might reduce the liver tumours by 50 per cent and prolong her life ‘by many months’. But Mrs Craven’s medical team at hospitals in Poole and Southampton were told last week by NHS England, which oversees such requests, they were not allowed  to treat her. She said: ‘I was so shocked. I didn’t think it would be a problem as the NHS is paying for my chemo which is very expensive and isn’t working. What can I do to be more “exceptional”? 'I still have three children at school.’ The family now face the daunting task of raising £45,000 for private treatment – when the NHS cost is around £14,000. She added: ‘My grandmother, who is now expected to outlive her granddaughter, always said “Value your health”… I just wish the NHS would give me the chance to do that.’","Kathy Craven, of Dorset, has been fighting breast cancer for five years .

They can’t afford the pre-made plastic ones you sink into the . ground so they buy old freight containers for $2000 and dig a hole.’ The FBI had considered sinking a wire . into the pipe to give them ‘eyes and ears’ in the bunker where Dykes . has access to TV and a monitor linked to a camera via which he can . monitor activity in his yard.

Residents of Midland City have been holding a nightly candlelight vigil in the hope the standoff ends without further bloodshed. 'We're doing any little thing that helps show support for . him,' 15-year-old Taylor Edwards said at one such event last night. State Rep. Mike Ball of Huntsville, who spent 15 years as a . hostage negotiator with the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, said today that . the key for authorities is to patiently build a relationship with Dykes. 'They want to build a relationship with him and calm down . the feeling of hopelessness he has,' he said. 'Any day that goes by with the . child alive is a victory.

Britain's most famous midwife, who has delivered babies for celebrities including Thandie Newton, Davina McCall and Stella Tennant, says birth in Britain has become 'industrialised', and should be stripped back to a simpler and more natural experience. Caroline Flint, 71, from Vauxhall in London, is the former president of the Royal College of Midwives, and has said she believes all babies should be given the opportunity to enter the world at home during a 'normal' and non-medical birth. Speaking about her new guide to birthing for mothers, Do Birth, Flint told the Guardian's Susie Steiner: 'Most women can give birth perfectly well on their own without interference. Of course, some need a caesarean, some need extra medical care but most don't.' Caroline Flint, left, believes all babies should have the opportunity to be born at home, and her new book, Do Birth, is a guide to giving birth for new mothers, not people within the profession . She added: 'I think if women could start . off with a midwife in their home, whether they are high-risk or . low-risk, and then if she needs to go into hospital, she can go with . them. Much less intimidating.' 'A brutal entry into the world, where the baby is pulled out of his mother's body, accompanied . by loud voices and bright lights, and then rubbed with a rough towel, . teaches this oh-so-sensitive baby that the world is a tough place where he may not always be welcome.' Flint says: 'Think of every genius you have ever heard . of and the likelihood is that they will have been born at home – . Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein, Elgar' An illustration from Do Birth, the new guide to having a baby by midwife Caroline Flint . Flint also says the theory that children born at home will not flourish academically (compared to those born in hospitals) is nonsense. She says: 'Think of every genius you have ever heard of and the likelihood is that they will have been born at home - Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein, Elgar.' Maintaing 'my life experience is that things very, very, very, very, very, very, very rarely go wrong', Flint also explains that some women have such an enjoyable experience giving birth that they can even reach orgasm - and the best place for this to happen is in the home. She says: 'After the birth you will snuggle in bed with your beloved partner and gaze at your baby, telling each other how very clever you are...fragrant, joyful and transcendent.' She adds: 'I can't imagine becoming sexually aroused in a brightly lit hospital. Can you?' Flint has been midwife for celebrities including Thandie Newton, left with daughter Ripley in 2006, and Davina McCall, right . Making Preparations . In practical terms, to arrange to have your baby at home, you need to contact the community midwives in your area and ask them to book you in for a homebirth. It is a fairly straightforward procedure. You can discuss it with the midwife at your booking-in appointment, or simply ring the community midwives directly. In some areas, you email the homebirth team - every area is different. It is unlikely, though, that your doctor will know what you should do as this is not his or her area of expertise. If you can't locate the number for the community midwives in your area, ring your local Maternity Hospital and ask them for it. If you have no response, contact the Head of Midwifery at your local Maternity Hospital. You may want to follow up your phone call with a letter so that you have a written record that you requested a homebirth. Once you have booked yourself in for a homebirth, you will be allocated a midwife who will start to visit you regularly at home. She will perform all your antenatal checks, such as taking your blood pressure and doing urine tests. She will also feel your tummy to see how well your baby is growing. She will tell you what to get ready for the birth and will give you a number to ring when you think you are in labour. When your due date approaches, she will bring all the things she will need for the birth and drop them off at your home. I keep saying 'she', but of course there are some male midwives, although the majority are women.

"By . Becky Barrow . UPDATED: . 20:58 EST, 18 January 2012 . Workers aged 50 and over are the biggest  losers in the latest  jobless figures. Every day between September and November around 1,300 Britons joined the growing army of those  without work. The picture is only likely to get worse over the coming months and it is older workers who are paying the heaviest price, with unemployment  rising faster among this group than any other. Out of work: An unemployed man walks into a jobcentre to collect benefits, as today the total number of jobless soars to 2.68 million . The figures, published  yesterday by the Office for National Statistics, show unemployment among those age 50 and above has hit a 17-year high of 432,000. The overall jobless total of 2.69million is also at a 17-year high. Of the 118,000 who became unemployed during the three-month period, 40 per cent are in the over-50 age group. Experts warn it is very difficult, if not impossible, for a worker in their 50s or 60s to find another job paying the same salary. Many never work again. To make matters worse, they are losing  their jobs at a time when the Government is increasing  the State pension age, which means their retirement date is being postponed. David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed at Prime Minister's Questions today over the latest grim figure . Dr Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, the old age experts, said: ‘Once they have lost their job it is almost like their life is over, but it is far too early for this to happen. ‘They want to work and they need to work, but many cannot find a job ever again. ‘There are people who apply for hundreds of jobs but keep on being told they are far too experienced, which is a euphemism for being too old.’ Pressure: Chancellor George Osborne will face calls to revive the economy with jobs creation . Overall, the ONS figures yesterday painted a bleak picture of a jobs market – and it is only likely to get worse. The number of unemployed women hit an all-time high of 1.13million, the largest number since records began in 1992. Youth unemployment also broke records. More than one in five of those between the age of 16 and 24 are unemployed, hitting a total of 1.04million. Ministers insist this figure is misleading because it includes 313,000 full-time students who may, for example, be unable to get a part-time bar job to subsidise their studies. Full-time jobs are disappearing rapidly, with record numbers forced to work part-time. There are 1.3million part-time workers who are in this trap which is, again, the highest number since records began. The number of full-time employees plunged by 140,000 between September and November, while the number of part-time employees jumped by 31,000. Thousands of people every day are being forced into becoming self-employed, because they cannot find a job. The national unemployment rate has risen to 8.4 per cent over the last quarter . Despite a slight drop a year earlier, the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance now stands at 1.6 million . Public sector spike: The graph shows how strikes last November caused a rise in the number of working days lost . Region/ Total unemployed /Change on quarter/ Unemployment rate . North East, 153,000, plus 11,000, 12% . North West, 307,000, plus, 25,000, 8.9% . Yorkshire/Humber, 270,000, plus 11,000, 10.1% . East Midlands, 190,000, plus 7,000, 8.3% . West Midlands, 243,000, plus 9,000, 9.2% . East, 220,000, plus 18,000, 7.2% . London, 424,000, minus 1,000, 9.9% . South East, 284,000, plus 27,000, 6.4% . South West, 175,000, minus 1,000, 6.5% . Wales, 130,000, minus 1,000, 8.9% . Scotland, 231,000, plus 19,000, 8.6% . N Ireland, 59,000, minus 7,000, 6.8% . There are 4.1million self-employed, . which the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said includes . many ‘part-time odd-jobbers desperate to avoid unemployment’. Dr John Philpott, chief economic . adviser, said: ‘The picture remains one of increasing fragility. The . jobs situation is set to get much worse in 2012.’ Nida Ali, economic adviser  to the accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, predicts unemployment, currently 2.69million, will hit three million by spring next year. This would be close to one in ten of the economically active population – workers and those looking for work. In the North-East, it has already hit 12 per cent. Yesterday the Prime Minister said unemployment was ‘a tragedy’ for each of the victims, which can lead to ‘real difficulty’ for their families. He described the rise in unemployment as ‘hugely unwelcome’, and said the Government must move ‘further and faster’ to help the private sector create jobs. For those who keep their jobs, the squeeze on their living standards remains. The ONS said the average pay rise in the private sector is 2 per cent, compared to inflation of 4.2 per cent.","Number of unemployed women hit an all-time high of 1.13million .

The chase: Richard Charles Henderson, pictured, died Friday as he chased a deadly twister through El Reno . An amateur storm chaser took a cell phone picture of Friday's frightening tornado and sent it to a friend just minutes before the 2.6 mile-wide monster killed him. Richard Charles Henderson, 35, snapped the blurry image of the twister, which has now been classified the widest on record, from out the window of his moving pick up and sent it to pal George 'Sonny' Slay at around 6:05 p.m. 'He said, ""I'm having fun,'"" Slay recalled on Monday. Soon after, the father-of-two was dead. The Hinton, Oklahoma, truck driver was among four storm chasers killed in Friday's twister, though the others were professionals, and at least 14 others lost their lives, including a mother and a baby, who have now been identified as Maria Pol Martin, 26, and Rey Chicoj Pol. 'That was the end of his life right there,' Slay told Newsok.com. He said Henderson told him he was riding around chasing the storms... 'I said ""you better quit that!"" And, then, I guess he was en route to . the position that he got in because he said, ""There goes Channel 9!"" He . said, ""You might even see me on TV."" And, then a few seconds later, he . said, ""Oop, there's Channel 5!""' When he received the worryingly close . photograph, he picked up the phone and heard a loud popping noise . coming from Henderson's end. His pal cursed and asked if he heard the ominous sound. Last photo: Henderson send Slay this photo minutes before the twister pictured killed him . Huge: The deadly tornado that plowed through an area near Oklahoma City last week was even larger and more powerful than previously estimated - a record 2.6 miles wide with winds that reached nearly 300 mph, just shy of the strongest winds ever measured . 'I said, ""Yeah, I heard it. What was it?"" And he said, ""It's debris hitting my pickup."" I said, ""You better get your ass out of there.""' Then the phone went dead. Henderson's body was found near El Reno. Little Rey Chicoj Pol is the latest victim to be named. He and his mom were killed when the storm picked up their family's sport utility vehicle along Interstate 40 west of Oklahoma City. Six victims remain unidentified. The tornado that struck El Reno on Friday night is believed to be the widest on record in the United States at 2.6 miles across, the National Weather Service reported on Tuesday. Victims: Professional storm chasers Tim Samaras, center, partner Carl Young, left, and son Paul Samaras, right, also died in Friday's storm . The May 31 twister beat the previous record, a 2.5-mile wide storm that struck Hallam, Nebraska, on May 22, 2004. The National Weather Service on Tuesday announced that the twister that hit El Reno was a top-of-the-scale EF5 twister - the second to strike the area in less than two weeks. Friday's tornado was initially rated as an EF3. But the agency upgraded that ranking after surveying damage and concluding that the storm had winds of 295 mph. Eighteen people died in the storm and subsequent flooding, including three storm chasers.

Friday's tornado was initially rated as an EF3. But the agency upgraded that ranking after surveying damage and concluding that the storm had winds of 295 mph. Eighteen people died in the storm and subsequent flooding, including three storm chasers. The Oklahoma City area also saw an EF5 tornado on May 20. That one raked Moore, a suburb 25 miles southeast of El Reno, and killed 24 people. Moore was hit in 1999 by another EF5, which had the strongest winds ever measured on earth: 302 mph. The massive tornado that formed Friday avoided highly populated metro areas, a fact that almost certainly saved lives. Winds were at their most powerful in areas devoid of structures, said Rick Smith, chief warning coordination meteorologist for the weather service's office in Norman. 'Any house would have been completely swept clean on the foundation,' Smith said. The twister marched through the countryside between El Reno and Union City, a region of largely rural farm and grazing land. Most of the destruction came toward the end of the tornado's 16.2-mile path along Interstate 40, where several motorists were killed when their vehicles were tossed around. Like many Midwestern cities, the Oklahoma City metropolitan area continues to expand in the suburbs, but the rapid growth hasn't quite reached as far west as where Friday's tornado tracked. William Hooke, a senior policy fellow of the American Meteorological Society, said the continued growth of cities in tornado-prone areas makes it only a matter of time before another monstrous twister hits a heavily populated area. 'You dodged a bullet,' Hooke said. 'You lay that path over Oklahoma City, and you have devastation of biblical proportions. In El Reno, the city of 18,000 suffered significant damage, including to its vocational-technical center and a cattle stockyard that was reduced to a pile of twisted metal. But Mayor Matt White said it could have been worse had the twister passed to the north. 'If it was two more miles this way, it would have wiped out all of downtown, almost every one of our subdivisions and almost all of our businesses,' White said. 'It would have taken out everything.' The EF5 storm that hit Moore decimated neighborhoods. 'It's very scary ... I don't think a normal person can fathom just how scary,' White said. 'I don't think they realize how lucky El Reno was.' The storm's 2.6-mile-wide path surpassed a record set in 2004 in Hallam, Nebraska. And it would have made the storm hard to recognize up close, Smith said. 'A 2 1/2-mile wide tornado would not look like a tornado to a lot of people,' Smith said, explaining that the twister would not have a tapered funnel and would instead resemble a dark cloud hanging below the horizon. Greg Carbin, a meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, said May in Oklahoma is a time of weather transition, offering the perfect fuel for violent thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes - a combination of warm, moist air combined with cooler jet stream energy that causes massive instability in the atmosphere. 'In these past two events, we've had a lot of unstable air sitting around, a lot of moisture and warm air,' Carbin said. 'That provides the fuel for thunderstorm development.'","Richard Charles Henderson, 35, snapped the blurry image of the twister and sent it to pal George 'Sonny' Slay at around 6:05 p.m. on Friday .

A four-year-old girl has been left with stainless-steel crowns on every single one of her teeth after she made a recent trip to the dentist. Savannah White was left with a mouth full of metal after she went in for a routine procedure on four cavities, her mother Alecia said on Monday. Mrs White brought her daughter to a dentist's surgery in Phoenix, Arizona and stayed with her until she was sedated before leaving for the waiting room. Scroll down for video . Metal mouth: Savannah White, four, had every single one of her teeth crowned with silver when her mother took her to a dentist in Arizona for a routine procedure . Mrs White brought her daughter home and when the child had woken up from a nap, she was horrified to look inside her mouth which had been coated in metal. The dentist's handiwork left the unfortunate little girl with the appearance of Bond villain Jaws, one of the 007's most famous nemeses, played by Richard Kiel, from movies The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. The mother, who also has a son called Zach, said that she was embarrassed by what the dentist, who has not been identified, did to her daughter. She added that the dental work made Savannah unhappy with her appearance. Mrs White told AZFamily: 'On a daily basis she says, ''Mommy, I don't like my teeth. I don't like my teeth.'' And it's really kind of hard to hear every single day.' The local TV station asked  Dr Richard Chaet, a pediatric dentist for 30 years who has written guidelines for his peers across the U.S, to examine photographs of the little girl's mouth. Dr Chaet said he was amazed by the . number of caps on the child's teeth but on closer inspection said that . the dental work had been necessary due to the level of deterioration. Embarrassed: The four-year-old has repeatedly told her mother that she did not like her new smile after a dentist gave her silver fillings . Cruel: The dentist's handiwork gave Savannah the appearance of Bond villain Jaws (right) until another dentist gave the four-year-old white veneers . A dentist later capped Savannah's teeth with white veneers so that she would not be self-conscious about how she looked. The best way to prevent children having silver crowns is to encourage a high level of oral hygiene. The American Dental Association recommends taking children to the dentist from their first or second birthday and avoid giving children sugary drinks, including fruit juices, which can cause damage. Despite not being visible, a child is susceptible to cavities from birth because the 20 primary teeth are present in the jaws.

Women who live in fear of breast cancer coming back may be able to beat the disease by taking a drug for ten years after surgery, say doctors. Using tamoxifen for ten rather than five years halves the risk of women dying from the most common kind of breast cancer, according to a study – described as a 'pivotal moment' in the fight against the disease. The study looked at the benefits for women with tumours fuelled by the female hormone oestrogen – who account for three out of four patients – and found those taking tamoxifen for longer than the recommended five years are better protected against recurrence and are less likely to die from the disease. Benefits: Taking tamoxifen for ten years after surgery halves the risk of the most common kind of breast cancer . Dr Julia Wilson, of Breakthrough . Breast Cancer, said: 'These findings are extremely exciting. Tamoxifen . is a well-established and cheap treatment.' The Cancer Research UK trial involved . almost 7,000 women with breast cancer who, after five years of taking . tamoxifen, either continued taking the drug for another five years or . stopped treatment. Among women who took tamoxifen for ten . years, 25 per cent fewer had recurrences of breast cancer and 23 per . cent fewer died, compared to those who took the drug for just five . years. The research was presented yesterday . at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago. Dr . Daniel Rea, clinical lead researcher based at the University of . Birmingham, said: 'These results are important as they establish that . giving tamoxifen for longer than the current standard of five years . significantly cuts the risk of breast cancer returning. 'Doctors are now likely to recommend . continuing tamoxifen for an extra five years and this will result in . many fewer breast cancer recurrences and breast cancer deaths worldwide. Tamoxifen is cheap and widely available so this could have an immediate . impact.' The Cancer Research UK trial involved almost 7,000 women with breast cancer who, after five years of taking tamoxifen (pictured), either continued taking the drug for another five years or stopped treatment . Despite its benefits, tamoxifen does . have side effects, including some similar to menopausal symptoms, such . as night sweats and hot flushes. Rare but serious side effects include . increased risk of endometrial cancer – cancer of the lining of the womb – . blood clots, and stroke. Professor Richard Gray, based at the . University of Oxford and presenting the findings in Chicago, said: 'This . study establishes that the benefits of taking tamoxifen for longer . greatly outweigh the risks.' Side effects: Although tamoxifen helps with breast cancer prevention, it can create symptoms similar to the menopause . Cancer specialist Professor Michael . Baum was involved in the first trials on tamoxifen three decades ago. He . said: 'This trial is very encouraging news for women. My group was the . first to report the benefits of tamoxifen in 1983 . 'It's wonderful that . 30 years later, we have the proof that the benefits last even longer . than we could have anticipated.' Professor Baum added that doctors were . likely to offer the drug to more women after they had completed a . five-year course of treatment after surgery – because many were asking . for it. He said: 'They are often very . reluctant to come off it after five years. 'It becomes a psychological . crutch that has helped them through a very difficult time, and now we . have the evidence to say with confidence that if they want to continue, . there are definite advantages.' Katherine Woods, of Breast Cancer . Campaign, said: 'These findings herald a pivotal moment for one of the . key weapons in the fight against breast cancer. 'We are delighted that . this drug, one of the most significant in the history of breast cancer . treatment, can have an even greater effect in preventing it from . returning if women take it for longer.' The Chicago conference also heard that . British researchers have discovered that a handful of so-called . 'superfoods' can help fight prostate cancer. A six-month trial involving 203 men . with prostate cancer found that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels . of those who took a capsule containing essence of pomegranate, green . tea, turmeric and broccoli were 63 per cent lower than those who did . not. PSA is a level of the protein produced by the prostate gland which . is an indicator of prostate cancer.

Real life spider man Joseph Carnevale, 25, likes to indulge his death-defying passion for what is known as ‘urban exploration’ or ‘recreational trespassing.’ Last month photos emerged showing what he claims is him sitting on top of the Space Needle during the time when the roof was painted Galaxy Gold. Real life spider man Joseph Carnevale indulges his death-defying passion for 'recreational trespassing' near the top of the Space Needle . The Space Needle is the most iconic skyscraper on the downtown skyline in Seattle . Photographer Carnevale says the Space Needle had fascinated him since he had moved to Seattle and that it took him ten months to plan and plot his trip to the top of the city's most iconic skyscraper. Planning is key to ‘recreational trespassing’ and in the case of the Space Needle that involved Carnevale carrying out a trial run without tools to determine what security was like and if there were motion sensors in place. Luck also played a key role and on the night that Carnevale achieved his goal everything worked in his favor from security not being as tight as it should have been to it not being a windy night. Carnevale is often accompanied by friends on his daredevil mission, in Seattle he has also climbed The Great Wheel and CenturyLink Field.

I prefer being on high. It’s not just the photos for me. I love being in high places as much as the photo itself,' he said. Some people have accused him of faking the photos, but he says the proof is in the resolution. ‘It’s really hard to fake, at least in the resolution that I posted these photos,’ he said. ‘I never met anybody who could whip that up in Photoshop. It’s pretty easy to tell if somebody is faking it.’ He has never been arrested for trespassing, although he has encountered security guards and janitors during his climbs.

Charged: Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, is accused of misconduct in public office . One of Scotland Yard’s most senior counter-terrorism officers was last night charged with offering to leak information to the News of the World. Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, is accused of misconduct in public office by contacting the defunct Sunday tabloid before the hacking scandal exploded. She became the first person to be charged under Operation Elveden, the controversial inquiry into the bribing of public officials for information. It is not known if any information was exchanged. Casburn is the former head of the secretive National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit which supports some of the most sensitive police inquiries. She was arrested by colleagues from her own force last December during a dawn swoop at her home in Chelmsford, Essex. Her desk on one of the top floors of the Metropolitan Police’s towering Empress State Building base in West London was also searched. The decision to prosecute her is a landmark moment in the progress of the multi-million pound anti-corruption inquiry. A total of 50 people, including journalists and public officials from police officers to prison guards, have been arrested and questioned. Among them were senior staff from The Sun and the News of the World where a committee set up by parent company News Corp has handed millions of emails to police. Searched: The towering Empress State Building on Lillie Road in West Kensington, London, where Casburn had her office on one of the top floors . Alison Levitt QC, of the Crown Prosection Service, said there is ‘sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction’. She said: ‘This charge relates to an allegation that DCI Casburn contacted the News of the World newspaper and offered to provide information.’ Casburn worked in the financial sector before embarking on a career with City of London Police and the Met, including several roles leading fraud squads. She held senior posts in the boroughs of Hackney and Redbridge before moving to Scotland Yard’s elite specialist operations wing. The branch includes counter terrorism operations, security at Parliament and airports as well as Royal, diplomatic and VIP protection units.

Burger King has revealed the whopper 'hands-free' holder that allower customers to wear their burger around their neck is a hoax. Last week rumours emerged that 50 of the strange utensils were being given away in Puerto Rico in celebration of the chain's 50th anniversary - they were showcased in an upbeat ad posted on You Tube. The contraption wraps around the neck and positions the famously flame-grilled delight just below the consumer's mouth. Scroll down for video . Serious? Burger King in Puerto Rico is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a giveaway of 50 hands-free Whopper holders and has produced a hilarious commercial to showcase the bizarre eating utensil . Focus: In each of the scenes, a character illustrates how they can perform other tasks while eating their coveted burgers . But today Burger King denied they were handing out the new product and insisted it was just a joke. 'The video featuring a ‘hands-free’ Whopper Sandwich holder was produced by an agency in Puerto Rico to celebrate the brand and the iconic Whopper Sandwich in a humorous way. However, the product depicted in the spot was not produced, or distributed to guests as some reports indicate,' reads the short statement from Burger King to CNBC. But the company said that it is true that the first Burger King in Puerto Rico opened in 1963 - so it  is the chain’s 50th anniversary in Puerto Rico. To promote the Hands Free Whopper, the commercial, that has since been taken off the Burger King site, played a multitude of scenarios in which people multitask while eating their burgers. At the beginning, a musician asks the audience in Spanish: 'In a world of multitasking, how can you use your hands to do your daily activities and eat a Whopper at the same time?' Food for fight: The burger chain has taken the ad off its site but it still remains on You Tube where so far it has drawn 1,500 views . Smooth: The witty commercial begins by asking in Spanish 'in a world of multitasking, how can you use your hands to do your daily activities and eat a Whopper at the same time?' Practice makes perfect: The seemingly ironic ad has drawn criticism from people disgusted at the idea that people could be so lazy that they wouldn't even hold their food . What follows is a witty selection of vignettes of characters performing tasks while eating the delicious fare. In one, a tattoo artist works on a client while feasting on his burger. In another, a sun-tanned young man massages a half naked woman on a beach while cheekily winking at the camera between bites. Scenarios range from dancers to cops ticketing cars, cyclists and dog walkers, all of whom are able to multitask thanks to the ingenious Hands Free Whopper. Picture of health: The device hangs around the back of the neck positioning the burger in a cup below the chin . Ta-da! Most of the scenarios feature men as the burger-eating protagonists . On duty: The repetitious lyrics outline all the things you can do with your hands if they're free and then thank the Hands Free Whopper at the end for making it all possible . Notably only one of the scenes features a woman using the equipment while she paints her nails. Produced by Burger King, Viral Visuals TV are responsible for posting the ad on You Tube and inviting users to comment. The response has been overwhelmingly negative.

Plans for secret courts were left in tatters last night by the House of Lords. Peers voted by crushing majorities for fundamental changes to the Justice and Security Bill, which would allow civil cases involving national security to be conducted in secret. By margins of over 100 votes, peers voted to remove ministers’ exclusive right to apply for secret hearings and to give judges ultimate discretion in deciding whether or not they should be held behind closed doors. As the legislation was introduced in the Lords, the Government’s plans came under devastating attack from several of Britain’s most senior retired judges and politicians. Peers voted by crushing majorities for fundamental changes to the Justice and Security Bill . Strong views: Lord Beecham backed a string of proposed changes to the legislation . The defeats suggest ministers will have to return to the drawing board and accept a series of amendments – or risk seeing the entire piece of legislation thrown out. Critics say the Government’s proposals will seriously threaten Britain’s reputation for open and fair justice. The Daily Mail has led criticism of the plans to allow so-called ‘closed material procedures’ (CMPs), in which cases are conducted entirely in private, in any civil hearing. Defendants or claimants will not be allowed to be present, or know or challenge the case against them, and must be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their own lawyer. Currently, such procedures are used in tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings, but the Government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed to involve national security. The legislation has been drafted in close co-operation with the security services, which have claimed other countries may stop sharing intelligence with Britain if it risks being disclosed in open court. But crossbencher Lord Pannick, a leading lawyer, described the measures as a ‘radical departure from the principles of common law’. how the mail led the campaign.jpg . Leading a series of amendments to the plans, he said: ‘This is a departure from the principle of transparent justice. We should be very careful in that a CMP is inherently damaging to the integrity of the judicial process. ‘Judicial decisions are respected precisely because all the evidence is heard in open court subject to acceptance and judges give a reasoned judgment which explains their decision.’ Former MI5 chief Baroness Manningham-Buller said secret court hearings should be introduced so British spies can defend themselves against allegations of torture. She said: ‘It is deeply distressing to me and to my former colleagues to be accused of inequities in cases of torture and maltreatment. We have not been able to defend ourselves.’ She claimed that presenting classified information in open court would put the lives of secret agents at risk. But Tory peer Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts said the new legislation failed the ‘smell test’. He warned that closed hearings could begin as a ‘rare event but will over time morph into the default position’. Lord Macdonald, QC, the former director of public prosecutions, accused the Government of reneging on a pledge to allow judges to have the final say on whether there should be a secret court hearing. Lord Hodgson and Baroness Manningham-Buller have made their opinions clear on the legislation . ‘These amendments would give judges appropriate discretion to balance the interests of national security with justice,’ he said. Historian Lord Morgan, a Labour peer, opposed the expansion of secret courts because it would mean a ‘tilting of the balance away from the free individual towards the interest of the state’. Labour justice spokesman Lord Beecham backed a string of proposed changes to the legislation, saying the Government’s proposals constituted a ‘radical departure from the cornerstone of our legal system – the right of a party to know and to challenge his opponent’s case’. He said: ‘These amendments place the judge firmly in control of the process with the means to balance the interests of justice and security, protecting from disclosure what is essential not to be made public.’ Advocate General for Scotland Lord Wallace of Tankerness, replying for the Government, said that at present people assumed the Government settled controversial cases because there had been ‘some wrongdoing’ whereas in fact it was often that relevant material could not be put before the court. He said there were currently 20 civil damages cases where material ‘relating to national security would be central’. Donald Campbell, of the human rights group Reprieve, said: ‘These amendments are a small step in the right direction, but the reality is that secret courts in any form are deeply dangerous. 'The only way to protect our centuries-old tradition of open and equal justice is for Parliament to reject plans for secret courts altogether.’","Peers voted to remove ministers' exclusive right to apply for secret hearings .

Slip up: Commons Speaker John Bercow (right) mistakenly introduced former England rugby star Ben Cohen (left) at an event as 'openly gay' last night . Weighing 16 stone and standing 6ft 2ins tall, former England rugby star Ben Cohen is not someone you would want to offend. So luckily the happily married father-of-two took it in good spirits when Commons Speaker John Bercow mistakenly introduced him as ‘openly gay’ last night. The MP was introducing the ex-England rugby international to a room full of guests at ParliOut, Parliament’s gay staff network, when he made the slip-up. Mr Bercow was left squirming while the audience burst into laughter and Mr Cohen called out: ‘Don’t tell my wife!’ Since retiring from professional rugby in 2011, Mr Cohen, 34, has dedicated much of his time to tackling the problem of homophobic bullying among young people through his StandUP Foundation. Keen to press home the rugby star’s credentials, Mr Bercow announced: ‘I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting Ben Cohen before but I’m delighted to remedy that serious deficit. ‘For those of you who aren’t aware his background is as a rugby international - capped no fewer than 57 times for his country - and he is openly gay and has dedicated himself to fighting for gay rights.’ As the audience roared with laughter Mr Cohen called out: ‘Don’t tell my wife!’ Mr Bercow was left squirming and tried to backtrack. Couple: Ben Cohen and his wife Abigail seen during the International Rugby Board Awards in Australia in 2003 . ‘No he’s not openly gay,’ he said, adding: ‘I am not in favour of outing people against their will and that was an ignorant outing that I apologise to Ben for. I’m not sure how I’m going to be getting back from this faux pas!’ The MP later told reporters: ‘That was embarrassing - but he took it in good humour.’ Mr Cohen - who has five-year-old twin daughters, Harriett and Isabelle, with his wife Abigail - was obviously not fazed by Mr Bercow’s blunder. Writing on his Facebook page afterwards, he said it was a ‘great honour’ to speak to the group and even posted a picture of himself with Mr Bercow at the meeting. Former star: Ben Cohen (left), the England wing is ankle tapped by Akvsenti Giorgadze (right) of Georgia during a Rugby World Cup match in October 2003 in Australia . But not everyone was so forgiving, with . followers speculating that Mr Bercow may have mistaken the rugby star . with Benjamin Cohen, the openly gay founder of Pink News. 'For those of you who aren’t aware his background is as a rugby international - capped no fewer than 57 times for his country - and he is openly gay and has dedicated himself to fighting for gay rights' Commons Speaker John Bercow's slip-up . One follower posted: ‘Bit of a faux pas . of Bercow to out you as being “openly gay”, the silly old tart could . have been more precise between Ben and Benjamin Cohen! Hope the missus . gets the right man back home!’ Perhaps Mr Bercow was not the first to . have made the mistake. Mr Cohen is considered a gay icon, has posed for . the cover of gay magazines and in 2008 was named Gay Times’s sports . personality of the year. Talking of his gay following in 2011 he said: ‘To be honest with you it’s something that’s been going on for about five or six years. I don’t really see myself as a gay icon, but I realise I have this huge following and it’s growing every day.’ Couple: House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and his wife Sally Bercow pictured in April 2011. Lord McAlpine is seeking £50,000 in damages from Mrs Bercow over comments she made about him on Twitter . Welsh international Gareth Thomas was the first top-flight rugby player to openly come out as gay in 2009. He recently said he feared few others would follow suit without a drastic change in the attitude of supporters. Meanwhile, Mr Bercow's wife Sally is facing action from Lord McAlpine, who was wrongly accused of being a paedophile. He is seeking £50,000 in damages over comments she made about him on Twitter. She tweeted: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*’, after a botched Newsnight probe claimed an anonymous Conservative figure had sexually abused boys at a Welsh care home. But Mrs Bercow, a Labour supporter, has claimed Lord McAlpine’s lawyers were ‘ambulance chasers’ and ‘big bullies’, and added that the case was ‘totally politically motivated’.","MP was introducing the rugby player at Parliament’s gay staff network .

Doctors are hailing a drug that can delay the progress of cervical cancer – the most common cancer affecting young women. Trials show that Avastin can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 30 per cent compared with chemotherapy. Using the drug led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13.3 months and almost half of patients responded to treatment. Cancer victim: Jade Goody leaving The Royal Marsden Hospital in London in March 2009 . Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under and kills about 1,000 people in the UK every year. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. But for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage, it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27, just months after being diagnosed with the disease. Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab, is already widely used in patients with colon cancer. It was launched last year for use in ovarian cancer after trials showed it could delay the progress of the disease by six months. Trials show that Avastin can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 30 per cent compared with chemotherapy . The latest study involves a trial sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute. In total, 452 women in the U.S. and Spain were recruited for the trial, which compared Avastin with standard chemotherapy, and in combination with chemo. Professor Stan Kaye, head of clinical studies at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: 'The improvements in overall survival achieved for women with advanced cervical cancer treated with Avastin are extremely encouraging.' Robert Music, of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, added: 'The results of this research look promising.' The trial showed a higher level of side effects in the group of women taking Avastin, including blood clots and high blood pressure. Roche, the maker of Avastin, was not involved in the trial.","Trials show using Avastin  led to overall survival of 17 months .

A 16-year-old computer whizz-kid managed to crash the Android version of Twitter's video-sharing app Vine on the day of its release by uploading a Rick Astley music video. Will Smidlein, who lives just outside Cleveland, Ohio, sabotaged the app by rewriting computer code that prevents users from uploading videos more than six seconds long. The cheeky teenager chose the Rick Astley clip which is used in a widespread online joke known as Rickrolling, where internet users are unwittingly redirected to a web page playing the video. Smidlein immediately took to Twitter posting: 'I think I just broke Vine', before adding: 'I truly feel awful for the engineers whose day I ruined with my stupid messing around.' The young prankster , who said he has been programming for a few years, said it had taken him less than an hour to rewrite the application. He only found out that it was successful, when someone retweeted the video which he'd posted from his account. He told WKYC.com: 'I noticed something a little funny about how they were doing uploads a little different than how most do. 'I actually reverse engineered how that app works.

The police investigation into Jimmy Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale to 340 separate lines of inquiry, Scotland Yard revealed last night. There are now 40 potential victims and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s reign of child abuse. It prompted the BBC’s Director General to issue his second grovelling apology of the week – and announce a total of three independent inquiries. Apology: The director-general of the BBC George Entwistle today issued a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to Jimmy Savile's victims as he announced two independent inquiry's would be launched . Investigation: Scotland Yard is now pursuing 340 lines of inquiry in the Jimmy Savile abuse case involving 40 potential victims, the force revealed tonight . George Entwistle offered a ‘profound and heartfelt apology on behalf of the BBC to every victim’. He added: ‘I have made clear my revulsion at the thought that these criminal assaults were carried out by someone employed by the BBC and that some may have happened on BBC premises as well as, we now discover, in hospitals and other institutions.’ Celebrities and former BBC staff potentially face arrest for alleged sex offences as police hunt accomplices of Savile’s four decades of attacks. He is alleged to have raped and molested children as young as ten. As well as the BBC, three NHS hospitals, a former children’s home in  Jersey and a now-defunct school in Surrey are accused of giving him free rein to attack children. Some victims have named people ‘around Savile’ as being complicit in his abuse. Mr Entwistle revealed that police warned him last week they would  pursue ‘live active criminal investigations’ against suspects. With more and more victims coming forward, the size of the police investigation has tripled from the 120 lines of inquiry being examined on Tuesday. An old friend of Jimmy Savile, who worked with him to raise funds for Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the 1970s, said she was saddened by allegations of sexual abuse against him but never saw him do anything 'inappropriate'. Sylvia Nicol told Daybreak: 'I am very sad, I don’t like it, it takes away 40 years of very happy, very good memories. 'Knowledge of all the good Jimmy did, because from the time he came to Stoke Mandeville I only saw him do good.' But Caroline Moore has claimed she was assaulted by Savile at the age of 13 while being treated for spinal injuries at the Buckinghamshire hospital in 1971. Nurses at the hospital are also understood to have dreaded Savile’s visits because of his behaviour and would tell children to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when he came round.Of that, he said: 'It will examine whether that culture and those practices allowed him or others to carry out the sexual abuse of children. Scotland Yard said: ‘We would once again praise the courage of and thank everyone who has come forward. ‘We have officially recorded 12 allegations of sexual offences but expect this number to grow.’ Outlining the three BBC inquiries, . each to be run by an outsider, Mr Entwistle said one would look into . what happened to a Newsnight report into Savile and examine if there . were any ‘failings’ by management over the decision to cancel it. He . insisted he knew of the abuse allegations only when reports appeared in . the Press. The second will look into the ‘culture . and practices of the BBC’ to establish if they enabled Savile to . sexually abuse children at the corporation. The third will be a broad assessment . of the BBC’s harassment procedures, following allegations by stars such . as Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig that they were groped and suffered . inappropriate behaviour at the hands of male colleagues. The BBC will name who will run the inquiries next week, but non-executive director Dame Fiona Reynolds will chair all three. ‘The BBC will not avoid confronting the events of its past,’ Mr Entwistle pledged. ‘Jimmy Savile’s victims have faced . years of pain. We owe it to them – and to our audiences – to understand . how this could have happened, and to make sure that we do everything so . that nothing like this could ever happen again.’ He added: ‘Despite our efforts to make . clear our belief the decision to drop the Newsnight investigation was . taken properly for sound editorial reasons, people have continued to . speculate. This is damaging to the BBC and is a cloud of suspicion which . cannot be allowed to continue.’ Victim: Caroline Moore claims she was a wheelchair-bound 13-year-old recovering from an operation to fuse her spine when Savile abused her during a hospital visit . Sick: Claims have also emerged that Savile, seen outside the cafe at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, groped young patients at the infirmary. Jimmy Savile penned part of a book warning children about strangers. The . late DJ wrote the introduction to Benjamin Rabbit and the Stranger . Danger, which was published in 1985. The book, which is subtitled 'what a . child needs to know about strangers,' is currently 'unavailable' on . Amazon. However, one copy is selling on eBay for £14.99 . Asked if he would quit, or order . sackings, if the inquiries uncovered wrongdoing, he said he did not want . to pre-judge them, adding: ‘The watch words are accountability, . transparency and honesty.’ The developments came after a TV . director who reported Savile to BBC bosses decades ago – when he caught . the star having sex with a 15- or 16-year-old girl in his dressing room – . revealed he was ignored. David Nicolson, 67, who had been a . director on Jim’ll Fix It, said he made several attempts to expose . Savile to the BBC, but was told: ‘That’s Jimmy’ and ‘that’s the way it . goes’. On Mr Nicolson’s claims, a BBC . spokesman said: ‘We have been disturbed to hear these allegations. All . staff past and present who have any information relating to allegations . of this kind should raise them with the BBC’s internal investigations . unit or the police.’ Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party . chairman, told BBC1’s Question Time it ‘seems unimaginable’ people at . the BBC were unaware of the child abuse allegations. Savile also . allegedly molested vulnerable children at Leeds General Infirmary, . including a brain-damaged girl, as well as Stoke Mandeville Hospital and . Broadmoor Hospital. In contrast to the BBC’s contrition, none of the NHS hospitals where Savile allegedly abused children has said sorry. Among the latest allegations,  it was . claimed yesterday Savile was banned from visiting a council-run . children’s home in the Seventies after he molested a 12-year-old girl. A . woman said he was told to leave the home in Leeds after staff found him . in a bedroom with the girl. And former Radio 1 researcher Richard . Pearson told Channel 4 News that when he met Savile once, he said he . ‘had just had 14-year-old girls’ in his trailer.","George Entwistle also announced two independent inquiry's into the 'culture and practices' of the BBC and the abandoned Newsnight investigation .

A millionaire gave £628,000 to a man who threatened to reveal he had sex with a rent boy, a court heard. The married father of three made payments for nine years in a desperate attempt to stop the secret life of which he was ‘extremely ashamed’ becoming public. He finally went to police last August after telling the truth to his wife because he was ‘nearing breaking point’ over the demands. After eight years the married father-of-three finally told his lawyers and police last August about the alleged blackmail, Chelmsford Crown Court heard . Yesterday the man, whose name is . protected by the court and is known only by the pseudonym ‘Barnaby’, . told Chelmsford Crown Court that he was a ‘bloody fool’ for paying up. The alleged blackmailer, Anthony . Still, 52, from Clacton, Essex, denies a charge of making unwarranted . demands for money between June 2003 and August last year. A jury of . seven men and five women heard that the man, who was chairman of a . successful family company, contacted an escort agency in 2002 after . reading an advert in Gay Times. He was put in contact with a 19-year-old, and Barnaby paid him for sex around nine times. They also took drugs together. Still is alleged to have started . blackmailing Barnaby after the boy’s father employed the private . investigation firm he worked for to look into his son, and he discovered . the relationship. Barnaby told the court: ‘I know if he had asked at the first meeting for £100,000 I would have told him to go and jump. ‘But I just wanted the problem to go . away, so I agreed to give the £35,000 that was demanded at the first . meeting. After that it became a “drip by drip” process.’ Asked why he . made the payments, Barnaby said: ‘In  order to protect myself and my . family from exposure.’ Speaking quietly, he said he had been . led to believe by Still, who was using an alias, that the teenager’s . father would go to the police and the Press unless he handed money over. ‘I did not want my family to read about what I am extremely ashamed of having done,’ he said. ‘I would think to myself, I have . already paid so much out. If I paid another £10,000, hopefully that will . be it but if I don’t, all the money I have already spent will . essentially have been wasted.’ He said he was forced to sell his . stocks and shares from time to time to meet the blackmail demands, but . his salary and income from his investments was ‘simply not enough to . cover’ the sums of money involved. Barnaby told the court he met the . teenager after replying to an advert for an escort agency with an . Ipswich telephone number in Gay Times. A fee of £100 was agreed before  he received a phone call from the  rent boy. Oliver Glasgow, prosecuting, said the . pair met three times in 2002, before the rent boy moved to London. In . spring 2003, the rent boy told  Barnaby that he was living in Colchester . in a house that his parents had provided for him, and the two met about . six times there. Barnaby and the rent boy stopped . contact after he agreed to pay off a £2,000 drug debt owed by his friend . in August 2003, shortly before the blackmail began.

Shamed council officials have been forced to drop a £50,000 benefit fraud case against a disabled woman - because evidence against her was made up. Mandy Barratt, 47, said she lived in 'constant dread and fear' during a five-year inquiry into allegations that she was claiming benefits illegally. But her battle with Basildon Borough Council, in Essex, is almost over after the authority halted the prosecution. Council officers admitted a key whistleblower in the case had been invented by staff. Prosecution pulled: Officers at Basildon Council, pictured, have admitted evidence against Mandy Barratt, 47, was made up . Now Mrs Barratt is considering legal action against the council, which carried out the investigation together with the Department for Work and Pensions. Mrs Barratt said: 'These were the worst years of my life - living with constant dread and fear. 'I felt vulnerable, scared and bullied. 'I have never done anything dishonest and the humiliation and embarrassment were hard to live with.' Mrs Barratt, who suffers from spinal cord damage, had been accused of wrongly claiming £54,807 of income support plus housing and council tax benefits as a single mother between July 2001 and January 2007. She split from her husband Steve Barratt, 51, back in 2000 but continued to live in a mobile home on his land in Wickford, Essex. Although the pair never divorced, they insisted that Mrs Barratt was entitled to benefits as a single parent because they were separated, even if their living arrangements were unconventional. Council officials thought otherwise and referred the case to the Department for Work and Pensions, saying they were relying on details from an anonymous phone call in April 2007. But a report by the Information Commissioner has now revealed the council were forced to change their records to show the call was never received. An investigation began after planning officials read a local newspaper article on the pair. Mr Barratt criticised council officials over their handling of the case. He said: 'They used fictitious evidence which has now been proven. 'Mandy has been through a nightmare and suffered so many stress-related illnesses.' Mrs Barratt is seeking legal advice about claiming compensation after investigators froze Mrs Barratt’s benefits between June 2008 and September 2010 leaving her with drastically reduced funds. Her benefits were later re-instated and a refund was given at a social security tribunal in September 2010. Nigel Smith, leader of the council's Labour group, raised 'serious concerns' about the investigation in February 2010. He said: 'The investigation into this matter and the papers brought before the tribunal are full of minor errors and omissions. 'There was never an anonymous referral and this needs to be made absolutely clear with an unqualified statement. 'It is important the council observes proper process in dealing with these matters so everyone - including the courts - can have confidence in the integrity of the council.' A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman confirmed the case was withdrawn, but refused to comment further. Lorraine Browne, solicitor for the council, said: 'This is a complex and detailed case and the council intends to respond in full to both the Information Commissioner and the complainant as soon as possible. 'It would be inappropriate to make any further comment.'","Mandy Barratt said she lived in 'constant dread and fear' during Basildon Borough Council's inquiry .

Two families who have teenage sons with the same name were both told that their child was seriously injured in a horrific car crash after a police mix-up. The families of Tyler Allen Weisgarber, 18, and Tyler Adam Weisgarber, 17, only discovered the mistake when they met each other in hospital - and were forced to identify the injured teenager. After the car crash in Canton, Ohio at 2.30am on Sunday, highway patrol troopers notified Tyler Adam's family that he was in the hospital, while medical staff contacted Tyler Allen's family. It was in fact Tyler Allen who had been injured; Tyler Adam returned home in the early hours of Sunday - but by that point, his family had already rushed to what they believed was his hospital bed. Mix-up: Tyler Allen Weisgarber (left) suffered a collapsed lung, bleeding on the brain and a broken vertebrae in a car crash - but authorities also told the family of Tyler Adam Weisgarber (right) that their son was hurt . His mother Connie was awoken by Ohio Highway troopers hours after the crash, and officials told her that her son was at Mercy Medical Center. After she rushed to the hospital with her daughter Jessica and Tyler's grandfather Tom, she was told that her son had suffered bleeding on the brain, a collapsed lung and a broken vertebrae. 'I couldn't believe it was happening to our family, like unreal,' Jessica told Fox8. As the family tried to come to terms with the devastating news, another man walked into the room and introduced himself to doctors as 'Tyler Weisgarber's dad' - Doug Weisgarber. It dawned on the family what had happened: 'Holy mackerel, there's two Tyler Weisgarbers,' Tom said. Shock: Tyler Adam returned home shortly after his family left for hospital but assumed they were still in bed . Relief: His sister Jessica said they were relieved he was OK - but that their thoughts were with the other family . Jessica added: 'We knew of another Tyler Weisgarber, but when a cop shows up at your house, you don’t second guess him... Then it hit us that, oh my God, it might not be our Tyler.' Her mother and Tyler Adam's father Doug went to the victim's bedside to identify him. 'I knew as soon as they opened the door and I saw Tyler's head,' Doug told the Canton Rep. 'His head was still dirty, but I knew it was my Tyler.' Connie said, 'It's not my son' and broke down in tears as she hugged Doug. 'We hugged for quite a while,' said Doug. 'I was happy for her, and she was sorry for me.' He added that he had been sure the boy in the bed was his son, as nurses had notified them of his accident after finding his cell phone and dialing 'Mom'. Confusion: Both teenagers shared the same initial, lived in neighboring towns and were the same age - they are both pictured at their senior proms before graduation.

"By . Lucy Buckland . UPDATED: . 07:04 EST, 4 November 2011 . Grimsby: 25 per cent of people living in the town are not in employment ot training . Young people face wildly different prospects depending on their home town, with up to one in four out of school, work or training in some UK cities. A new report reveals the nation's Neet (not in education, employment or training) 'blackspots', and suggests youngsters living in the north are more likely to suffer from fewer opportunities. Time spent as a Neet can damage youngsters' work skills, make them more likely to turn to crime, leave them facing lower wages in the future, and reduce life expectancy, according to a paper by the Work Foundation for the Private Equity Foundation. Just under an estimated one million 16 to 24-year-olds (979,000 in total) are considered Neet, according to official figures published in August. Of these, around 186,000 are aged 16-18. But less is known about where these young people live, the study said. Using existing figures on the labour market, it analysed Neet levels among 16 to 24-year-olds in 53 of the largest towns and cities in Great Britain. The findings showed that cities and towns in the area from Liverpool across to Hull were more likely to have high or very high Neet levels. Mapping the divide: The Work Foundation report illustrates how the country is split in terms of offering opportunities to young people . In comparison, those with low or very low Neet levels were more likely to be further south. Grimsby, Doncaster, Warrington and Wigan were all found to have very high Neet levels of almost 25 per cent. Others, such as Blackpool, and Rochdale and Oldham, were likely to have more than one in five youngsters that were Neet. At . the other end of the scale, Oxford, Aberdeen, York, Plymouth and . Cambridge all had very low Neet levels of less than 10 per cent. Separate . figures for London, which were not broken down by borough, showed that . the north east of London had very high Neet levels of more than 20per . cent, while in east London, between 18 per cent to 20per cent of . youngsters were Neet. Low level: Oxford, pictured, has one of the lowest number of those unemployed or not in training in the country . The south west of London was found to have the lowest levels in the capital with less than 14 per cent considered Neet. The . report warned that a failure to address the problems facing young people would not just . damage individuals, but lead to growing costs for 'the government, our . economy and society'. Cities . with high Neet levels tended to have 'wider problems, with weak . economies, low skills profiles and often dependent on the public sector . for employment', the study said. And the recession had widened the gap between cities with high Neet rates and those that were lower. 'The government urgently needs to consider the problems faced by young people in many of our towns and cities,' it said. 'Neets . in these cities face a double hit: reduced employment opportunities and . a weak economy and reduced services resulting from public sector cuts.' Consequences: The report warned failure to address the problem of those unemployed and without educational opportunities would lead to growing problems for society . Shaks . Ghosh, chief executive of the Private Equity Foundation, said: 'This . report has highlighted the great disparity in opportunities for young . people across Great Britain. 'The . fact that nearly a quarter of 16 to 24-year-olds are disengaged from . education or employment in certain cities is not only shocking but very . sad. 'Children from deprived areas urgently need the right support to continue in school, go to college or to get a job. 'To neglect these Neets, risks a crisis in too many of our communities.'","Up to one in four considered Neet (not in employment, education or training) in some northern cities .

The body of a diver . missing for more than a decade has been found in the cold waters of Lake . Michigan, where he drowned after he saved his friend's life. Dirk Kann of Guttenberg, Iowa, disappeared in September 1999 while exploring . a popular and extremely dangerous shipwreck, the legendary Lakeland, . 225ft below the surface with his trusted diving partner Greg Olsen . before tragedy struck. After . Mr Olsen's air supply was depleted at the bottom of the lake, there was . a frantic fight for survival as the two men shared a single tank, . alternating breathes and desperately clinging to their diving line as . they ascended toward the surface. Mr Kann never made it and the 52-year-old's remains were found in Whitefish Bay on Saturday, the Door County Sheriff's Department confirmed, still in his dive suit and with air tanks connected to him. Scroll down for video . Found: Dirk Kann of Guttenberg, Iowa, disappeared in September 1999 after trying to explore a popular shipwreck 225ft below the surface. He is pictured at right beside his daughter Susan . Tragedy: The 52-year-old's remains were found in Whitefish Bay on Saturday near the Lakeland, pictured, an iron steamer loaded with new cars lost off Sturgeon Bay in 1924 . 'He still had his diving gear on, in fact,' Sheriff Terry Vogel said. Sheriff Vogel said that two experienced divers found the remains while also exploring the wreck of a boat called the Lakeland. Rose Kann, the wife of Mr Kann, spoke exclusively to the MailOnline about the news of her husband's discovery. She . said that 'of course' the news was a great relief to the family, adding . that they did not plan any memorial or service to commemorate Mr Kann. Morose, she told the MailOnline that she was having difficulty speaking about it. Officials say Mr Kann disappeared while diving with friends on September 4, 1999 and was last seen by his dive partner, Greg Olsen, a 49-year-old man from nearby Appleton. Police . reports from the incident show that Mr Olsen, Mr Kann and their friend . Richard Boyd were on a diving trip on Mr Olsen's ship named the Navy . Boat. All three men were close friends and diving companions for more than a decade. They . told police that the three of them had been visiting the Lakeland for . more than five years and explored it more than 20 times together. Using . a permanent line connecting the Navy Boat with the Lakeland, Mr Olsen . and Mr Kann proceeded to head down for a photographic expedition of the . wreck they had come to know over the years. Mr Boyd had planned on joining his friends, but was delayed and stayed behind. Both divers had three air supplies: a primary regulator, a secondary regulator or 'octopus' and a pony bottle. Mystery: Mr Kann was a celebrated businessman and inventor before he disappeared . 'They knew what they were doing and they had the equipment to do it,' an officer wrote in his report. The . descent to the wreck was 'uneventful,' Mr Olson told police. The pair . toured the bow of the ship and visited the part where the ship was . broken in half. The two of them were making their way back to the . mooring line when Mr Olson's air regulator began to 'free flow.' When . air regulators free flow, or freeze up, during dives, the tanks deliver . air constantly, causing a diver's air supply to be depleted in a matter . of minutes. Mr Olsen . signaled Mr Kann for help, but Mr Kann accidentally turned off Mr . Olsen's secondary air supply, leaving Mr Olsen's primary air supply to . deplete entirely. A frantic Mr Olsen hooked himself up to his smallest container of air and the two men headed toward the surface. 'Both . divers now had an emergency situation and they aborted their dive and . made a hard swim for the bow of the Lakeland to the ascent line,' the . police report reads. The two grabbed hold of the line facing each other and made their way toward the surface hand-over-hand. Search: Two experienced divers found the remains while also exploring the wreck Lakeland . Three-quarters of the way up, Mr . Olsen's tank was empty. Mr Kann gave him his own secondary air supply . and the two men continued upward. The situation under control, Mr Kann went to release the stringer line because, according to Mr Olsen 'they had beat the dive.' A moment later, Mr Kann was in trouble. The Lakeland was a 2,425-ton iron steamer built by the Pittsburgh Steamship Company in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1887 as the Cambria. She was renamed the Lakeland on May 24, 1910, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. On December 3, 1924, after departing . Sturgeon Bay, she began taking on water and sank in 210 feet of water six . miles east of the canal entrance with a cargo of Nash, Kissel, and . Reynolds automobiles. Today, she lies upright and largely intact with many of her automobiles intact in her hold. Experienced divers flock to the wreck site to explore the vessel, though it is considered a highly technical and dangerous dive. 'When Greg turned around, Dirk was . right on him. Greg stated Dirk did not have his regulator in his . mouth... Dirk was bumping into his chest, chest-to-chest, . eyeball-to-eyeball,' the report read. 'Dirk's eyes were wide and big.' Mr Olsen gave Mr Kann his own air . supply and the two began to 'buddy breath' back and forth, but . eventually, Mr Kann became completely incapacitated. 'He was like fading away,' the report said. Mr Olsen said he had two options at . this point. Completely out of air and holding his breath, he could rip . the regulator out of his friend's mouth and continue his own ascent, or . leave his friend with the air and make his way toward the surface. He chose the second option. On his . way up, he kept looking back for Mr Kann, hoping he would appear behind . him, but he never came up. Bottles for decompression and . emergency air, tied to the point in the line where Mr Kann was last seen, . were all that remained of him. Mr Boyd and Mr Olsen said that there was till 2,600 psi, out of a possible 3,000 psi in the tanks. They continued to search for their friend until the U.S. Coast Guard arrived. The  Coast Guard and local law . enforcement mounted an exhaustive search of the area following his . disappearance, utilizing a helicopter, 41-foot patrol boat and numerous . fishing vessels to assist. Once . the interview was completed, the two men asked for permission to return . to the water to find their missing friend and to tell their wives of . the incident. Two days . later, the search was called off, having only located Mr Kann's wallet, . his open water diver certification and his wreck diver certification. 'There . was a death investigation, I wouldn't call it a homicide . investigation,' Sheriff Vogel said to the MailOnline. 'There were no . suspicious circumstances.' The sheriff added that a few years ago, Mr Kann's body was found by a local fisherman. 'Six, . seven years ago he was snagged by a fisherman, but he was released,' he . said. 'Somehow they lost the snag. We did another search for the body . but couldn't find him.' Sheriff Vogel said that each time, his office notifies the Kann family of the body's appearance. Mr Kann was a celebrated businessman . and inventor before he passed.  He founded a recumbent bicycle company, . Linear Mfg. in Iowa during the 1980s. He also ran Kann Mfg, which was . founded by his father, which manufactures garbage trucks, marine boats . and barges. His son and daughter both still work at the family company. Mummy: Mr Kann was found perfectly intact, more than a decade after his disappearance . 'We made numerous attempts through the years to try to recover him with technological advancements,' Sheriff Vogel said. 'We used some of that to go down there, but his remains weren't found until Saturday.' Authorities say Mr Kann's body was . recovered near the wreck which sits about seven miles east of the . Sturgeon Bay canal in more than 200ft of water. It's unique because the original cargo . of early 20th century cars is still visible. That makes it a popular . diving destination, but only for experienced divers. 'That particular shipwreck is what we call a technical dive,' explained diver and owner of Green Bay Scuba Alan Pahnke. 'When it's so deep, you need much more training to go down there than a normal sport diver would.' Mr Pahnke told Fox 11 Online that the water temperature at that depth is around 2.2C (36F). He said the conditions would preserve a body for a long time. 'Because . of the pressure and the depth it's at, there's not a long of oxygen . down there,' Mr Pahnke said. 'Plus the cold, it's like a refrigerator, . it'll keep for quite a while.' The . sheriff's department did not release the exact condition of the body, . but reports show that Mr Kann was identified in part by the fact that he . had two fingers amputated. A flashlight with the name 'Dirk Kann' was also found on his person.","Businessman Dirk Kann, 52, disappeared on a dive on September 4, 1999 .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . UPDATED: . 06:01 EST, 16 August 2011 . The research carried out by Professor Andy Phippen found that one parent even invited others to join in attacking a teacher . A third of teachers have said they have been subjected to online bullying - including by parents who see them as 'fair game'. Facebook and Twitter have been used to intimidate teachers over bad grades or simply because they are not liked. More than a quarter of those that admit they have been targeted say the abuse has come from parents with one headteacher was driven to the brink of suicide by a year-long online hate campaign. One parent even set up a 'Google group' and asked others to join in their abuse. Andy Phippen, professor of social responsibility in IT at Plymouth Business School who researched the matter, said: 'You expect a little bit of abuse from children. But when parents launch 12-month campaigns of abuse you have to think ""something has gone wrong here"". 'Parents are saying ""You gave my child a bad grade, I'm going to give you a slating on Facebook"" - it is something that is growing and growing.' On top of the abuse from pupils and parents, one in 10 said they had been a victim of another teacher's cyber-bullying. The report said: 'It seems to a subset of the population the teacher is no longer viewed as someone who should be supported in developing their child's education, but a person whom it is acceptable to abuse if they dislike what is happening in the classroom.' One headteacher told the team: 'A parent set up a Google group and devoted it to saying unpleasant things about me. It started off as ""the Head"" and then he started referring to me just by my surname. He invited other parents to join in but only one did. 'I eventually had a mini breakdown in the summer holiday needing an emergency doctor to be called out - as I had become suicidal - a fact that none of my staff know as I was much better by the start of the term - greatly helped by him removing his children from school.' Websites like Facebook, Twitter and ratemyteacher have been blamed for the rise of cyber-bullying of teachers . The survey was carried out by academics working for the UK Safer Internet Centre and it found that the most common type of abuse was through Facebook groups that targeted specific teachers. There was also evidence of pupils creating fake Facebook pages in a teacher's name, posting videos of teachers in class on YouTube, and setting up whole websites to be abusive about a single or group of staff. RateMyTeacher.com was also mentioned a number of times as a site where abusive comments had been posted. In some cases where teachers had complained, the comments still remained. 'While some defenders of free speech have argued that such sites have a right to exist, we would question the role of a site where pupils can freely post slanderous and abusive material about a member of the teaching profession and threats of violence toward them,' the team wrote. Prof Phippen said it was important more training is provided to senior managers and others to help combat the rise of online bullying. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘At Facebook we have worked hard to develop reporting mechanisms that enable people to report offensive content they are concerned about. 'Having the tools to report content in this way gives people more control over what is said about them on Facebook than over the wider web where few such controls exist.’",Facebook and Twitter used to attack staff over poor grades or simply because they are not liked .

"By . David Richards . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 7 December 2011 . Speaker's wife Sally Bercow has pleaded for Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty to be spared jail after he admitted affray following a bare-knuckle brawl which police linked to an underworld shooting. In fresh embarrassment for her husband John Bercow, the 42-year-old described Doherty as 'quite a softie' adding: 'I would very much hope the sentence is suspended'. Mrs Bercow has a history of leaving her Common's Speaker husband red-faced and just last month revealed her favourite gadget is a sex toy, weeks after openly discussing their 'spicy' sex life on Celebrity Big Brother. The Speaker's wife Sally Bercow took Doherty to the Houses of Parliament in September. The pair formed an unlikely friendship on Celebrity Big Brother and now she has pleaded for him to be spared jail . Doherty, 52, who was the show's winner, will be sentenced for the offence in the New Year. He was left bloodied and bruised with part of his ear bitten and . hanging off after he took on his cousins Johnny and Dougie Joyce in a . street fight outside a PC World store in Manchester. The brawl was filmed on a mobile phone . and uploaded to YouTube and a witness was overheard baying for blood . shouting: 'Come you dirty Doherty b******, give it to him Johnny, give . to the dirty tramp, floor the dirty tramp.' A bloodied and bruised Paddy Doherty, 52, immediately after the fight with his cousins outside a PC World store in Manchester . During the video a blood-spattered . Doherty - who also featured in Channel 4 show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding - was . seen perched on his toes like a boxer, grunting 'like a bull' and . holding his fists up to protect himself as he landed in a heap with . Johnny Joyce. Doherty admitted . affray after the brawl and had been expected to give evidence against . his cousin Johnny, who was accused of causing him grievous bodily harm. The GBH charges against Johnny Joyce, 21, were dropped. Instead, he and his 23-year-old brother Dougie - who filmed the violence on a . mobile phone - and Doherty were all charged with affray. Doherty, who has also appeared on Britain’s Deadliest Men, pleaded guilty to the . charge at  Manchester Crown Court last week. The Joyce brothers finally admitted their part in the fracas - part of an ongoing family feud -  yesterday shortly before their trial was due to begin. Johnny Joyce admitted affray, while Dougie Joyce’s plea to a lesser public order offence was accepted by the prosecution. Johnny Joyce, left, and his brother Dougie, right, outside Manchester Crown Court at an earlier hearing. Johnny had previously had a fight with Doherty at a caravan park in Salford. All three men will be sentenced in January and were remanded on bail for reports. Yesterday's hearing comes as Doherty is . due to star in 'When Paddy Met Sally' a life swap show on Channel 5 with Mrs Bercow. Filming began in North Wales last . month and in the programme viewers will see Mrs Bercow move into a . mobile home with Doherty for two weeks and experience the life of a . traveller. In the second . week of the challenge, Mrs Bercow was able to set rules and challenges . for Doherty including a cleaning rota and the task of cooking a meal for . his family. Doherty's fight in a car park outside PC . World was the latest round of a bloody feud between him and the . Joyce brothers which was sparked by a row at a family funeral. That led to a brawl with Doherty at a . Salford caravan site in August 2010. A few hours afterwards Johnny Joyce . handed himself into police. Later that day there was a bungled gangland . shooting at the home of Johnny’s mother . Roseanne in Manchester. Two gunmen were dispatched to fire a shot at the house only to mistakenly blast a neighbour’s car. Last month two men were jailed for firearms offences over the shooting. In February of this year Johnny Joyce was tried and acquitted of causing grievous boldly harm after claiming he acted in self defence. Four months later Johnny and Dougie came across Doherty on Great Ancoats street in Manchester while the TV star was out jogging and the Joyce brothers were shopping for a birthday present. At an earlier hearing, Gareth Hughes, . prosecuting, said of Doherty: 'He saw the two Joyces in a vehicle. It . was alleged they had been aggressive towards him. He was approached by . Johnny Joyce and there was a punch by Johnny Joyce.' The . court heard Joyce had been wearing a ring covering two of his fingers . and that Doherty received an injury to the left eye requiring stiches. Mr Hughes added: 'There’s then a . stand-off, recorded by Douglas Joyce on his mobile phone, a mobile phone . that was seized by the police where we can hear Douglas Joyce . encouraging his brother. 'The footage then stops but what we . know happened is that Johnny Joyce the better of Doherty in the fight . and the top of Paddy Doherty’s ear get bitten almost completely off. The . piece of his ear that remained was connected by a bit of skin and was . sewn back on. Street fight: Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty was left bloodied and bruised after a brawl outside this PC World store in Manchester . 'Douglas Joyce was actively encouraging his brother, shouting, ""Bite him"". The footage has already made its way into the public domain and it is understood to already be on YouTube. 'The footage shows that after the initial punch there’s a stand-off, fists raised by both but it doesn’t show the next bit. This was all in the middle of the road at the junction, cars came to a stand-still, they couldn’t get any further.' Mr Hughes described Doherty’s injuries as being the 'partial amputation of the left ear, requiring stitches, a cut requiring stitches to the left eye and a cut to the top lip'. Defending the Joyce brothers, Declan Doherty said: 'Mr Paddy Doherty describes himself as a star, who is well known because he has starred on a programme called My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. 'What he doesn’t mention is that in the past few years he has been on Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men, where for a full hour Paddy Doherty described to Danny Dyer his 30 or 40 years of his fighting career within the travelling community. 'He’s recorded as saying he what he would do to a man in a fight, saying he would chew him up like chocolate bar. He’s not a stranger to violence or to the crown. 'There’s been a history of trouble between the families. This all started about this time last year when there was an argument at a funeral. 'Paddy Doherty felt he had been disrespected by the younger man at this funeral. He lured him back to his caravan site and assaulted him. Johnny Joyce was acquitted by a jury of his peers within 30 minutes. 'There have been a number of other incidents. I understand that associates of Paddy Doherty have been convicted of firearms offences and there are a number of undocumented incidents over the years. This family received warnings that their lives may be in danger. 'Two brothers were in the city centre at four in the afternoon, a very busy time. They were going to JD Sports to buy their sister a birthday present. 'Paddy Doherty was jogging along and he saw them and started to shout abuse at them and makes his way towards them. He doesn’t need to do that but that’s what he decides to do. 'They got out of the car which they shouldn’t have done. Johnny Joyce said: ""We’re not doing this again, getting involved with you again, go away."" Douglas was standing between them. 'In the course of this Paddy Doherty gets past Douglas Joyce and gets to Johnny Joyce and slammed him in the car door. 'Johnny Joyce didn’t want to fight and he told Paddy Doherty several times to, ""Go away, I want nothing to do with you"". ' The lawyer said Doherty hit Joyce 'several times' and that it was a 'fair fight'. He added: 'When Paddy Doherty fell down, Johnny Joyce let him get back up. When Johnny fell down Paddy Doherty was standing over him and Douglas Joyce pulled him off.' The court heard that the brothers rang the police when they returned home, co-operating with them to give them their mobile phones, where the fight was recorded and their old clothes. A lawyer who brought the two gunmen jailed over the bungled shooting incident to trial said: 'On the same day of the incident there had been a man called Paddy Doherty who had been subject to an assault by a man called Johnny Joyce. 'Doherty received serious injuries and required hospitalisation. Joyce handed himself in and had been interviewed for the offence and it was on this day he handed himself in. 'He claimed self-defence and he was tried and acquitted. We cannot say how these two became involved except that we say it’s more than a coincidence that on the day Joyce handed himself in this address was targeted.'","Speaker's wife Mrs Bercow says Doherty is 'quite a softie'

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:25 EST, 30 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:49 EST, 31 December 2012 . A beauty queen who resigned after alleging that the Miss USA pageant had been fixed says she is stunned by a ruling that she must pay the pageant organization $5 million for defamation. Former Miss Pennsylvania USA Sheena Monnin said that the 'most logical course' would be to contest the arbitrator's ruling but she is considering her options. Arbitrator Theodore Katz says Monnin's allegations that finalists had been selected in advance were false, harmful and malicious and cost the pageant, owned by billionaire Donald Trump, a $5 million fee from a potential 2013 sponsor. Accusations: Miss Pennsylvania Sheena Monnin (left) said Miss Florida Karina Brez (right) said she had seen a list of the Miss USA finalists before they were called. Another contestant claimed that she heard the same . Best of the best: Olivia Culpo, pictured with competition owner Donald Trump, was crowned Miss Universe this month in Las Vegas . Monnin points to a Miss USA contract . clause giving top pageant officials the power to pick the top five . finalists and the winner, but a company official calls that a catch-all . that's never been used. Earlier this month, Donald Trump was victorious in a lawsuit he filed against . Monnin, who called the Miss USA pageant 'fixed' and 'trashy' after she . failed to make the semifinals of the beauty contest this summer. The eventual winner of Miss USA, Olivia Culpo, . beat 88 other beauty queens on December 20 to take the Miss Universe . title from Leila Lopes of Angola at the Planet Hollywood casino in Las . Vegas. Mr Trump, co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization, sued Monnin for defamation after  she alleged in June that a fellow contestant . in the competition had seen a list of the top five winners before the . finalists were named on stage. A U.S. District Court Magistrate ruled in favor of the Miss Universe Organization, awarding it $5 million in damages and stated Monnin's statements 'showed a reckless disregard'. Miss Pennsylvania's Sheena Monnin accused Miss Universe Organization of rigging the competition when . she resigned from her position in mid June. She claimed Karina Brez, who was representing Florida at the contest in Las Vegas, Nevada on June 3, recited the top five women after seeing a list of their names backstage. Battle: Donald Trump, the co-owner of Miss Universe Organization, successfully sued Miss Monnin (right) for her claims. A judge has awarded the pageant $5 million in damages . In a Facebook post announcing her . resignation, she wrote: 'Apparently the morning of June 3rd [Brez] saw a . folder lying open to a page that said 'FINAL SHOW Telecast, June 3, . 2012' and she saw the places for Top 5 already filled in. 'After . the Top 16 were called and we were standing backstage she hesitantly . said to me and another contestant that she knew who the Top 5 were. I . said 'who do you think they will be?' She said that she didn't 'think' she 'knew' because she saw the list that morning. 'She . relayed whose names were on the list. Then we agreed to wait and see if . that was indeed the Top 5 called that night. After it was indeed the . Top 5 I knew the show must be rigged.' Miss . Universe Organization vehemently denied the claims and said that Monnin . had cited the new rules allowing transgender contestants as her reason . for resigning. Donald Trump . also denied the claims and proceeded with the lawsuit against Monnin, who he believed . was suffering 'loser's remorse'. Top five: Monnin claims another contestant told her Miss Ohio, Miss Maryland, Miss Rhode Island, Miss Nevada and Miss Georgia would be the top five before they were even read out . 'I did see her for about a second. I . never felt that she had a chance,' he told the Today show over the summer. 'I know what I heard, and I know what I in turn witnessed... so I’m prepared to continue to march forward,' Monnin responded on Today. 'I . feel an injustice has been done, not only to the other people who were . not in the top five, but to the thousands of pageant girls across the . country who competed, believing this is an honest system.' But Brez has also come forward to deny she made the claims seriously. 'Backstage . during the pageant, I did see a piece of paper with names on it and . like most people in such frenetic circumstances, joked that they must be . the names of the final contestants,' Brez said. 'It . was a throwaway comment, in the stress of the pageant, and was never . meant as fact. The list I saw didn’t even have the eventual winner on . it.' Monnin told Today she believes Brez changed her story out of fear. 'She looked a little bit scared because . she had just seen something that would potentially, drastically change . the reputation of the Miss Universe Organization,' she said. 'This is a big deal.' Deserved? After the 51 contestants were whittled down, Olivia Culpo from Rhode Island was named the winner . Good answer: Culpo, pictured with hosts Andy Cohen and Giuliana Rancic, impressed during the Q&A round . The latest accuser, who was not identified, said Miss Brez had appeared 'very, very flustered and upset' as the top 15 girls were announced. 'I thought it might be because she . didn’t make the top 15 cut, but at that point she was able to reveal to . me at least four of the five names who went on to be the top girls,' the . contestant told FOX News. 'She couldn’t remember the fifth . because she was so upset. Several of the girls then started hearing . through the grapevine about a list; a lot of people were upset.' 'A lot of the girls now are very upset . about how Pennsylvania is being treated and aggressively attacked by an . organization that claims to empower women,' she said. Top . ten: Monnin said the contestant told her about the discovery as the top . 16 were announced. But organizers have said she resigned because she . was against the new rule allowing transgender contestants . The top 15 girls are decided by preliminary judging in the days before the broadcast, and fan voting determines the 16th. The top ten, top five and winner are decided in the live show, a rep said. The scores for the competition are believed to be entered into a computer system as the show is live. These results are monitored and verified by Ernst & Young. 'In accordance with the rules of the competition, Ernst & Young's tabulation of the judges' votes which determined the final five contestants did not occur until after the evening gown competition had been completed,' a representative said. Judge Joe Jonas tweeted after the accusations: 'All I can say... Is the Miss USA competition was NOT rigged. Miss [Rhode Island] USA won fair and square.' The pageant named Ms Culpo, a 20-year-old cellist, the winner after she made it clear that she embraced all beauty queens - transgender or otherwise - during the interview portion. In the dreaded final question round, Ms . Culpo was faced with the most difficult question of the night: Would it . be fair for a person born a man to be named Miss Universe after becoming . a woman? Final rounds: But organizers said the contestant denied telling Monnin she had seen any such list . Rearly lovely: The pageant was held at the Planet Hollywood casino on the Las Vegas Strip . Ms Culpo never stumbled as she embraced the Miss Universe Organization's recent decision to admit transgender contestants. 'I do think that would be fair,' she said. 'But I could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road.' It is an opinion that Monnin does not share. In her resignation email, she wrote: 'I refuse to be part of a pageant system that has so far and so completely removed itself from its foundational principles as to allow and support natural born males to compete in it. 'This goes against ever moral fiber of my being.  I believe in integrity, high moral character, and fair play, none of which are part of this system any longer.'","Sheena Monnin claimed Miss Florida had seen a list of the five finalists before the show began .

After days of glorious sunshine, Britain is set to be hit by a wave of wintry weather - with temperatures halving across much of the UK and even dropping to as low as -11C in some parts. Forecasters predict that this weekend will be less settled than recent days, with rain likely to affect most areas and temperatures dropping to 13C in London. Met Office spokesman Charles Powell said: 'By Saturday the temperatures will be down to 12C and 13C. We will still . get some bright weather but we will lose the wall-to-wall sunshine we . have enjoyed. Summer weather in Swansea: Students Louise Green, Hannah Green, Anna Roberts and Chloe Jennings take a break from studying to enjoy the sun . Forecasters Netweather suggest that temperatures in the Scottish Highlands will dip to as low as -11C by Wednesday with widespread freezing temperatures across much of the UK . Downpours are likely in the north and snow is expected over the Scottish Highlands with up to six inches of snow possible on high ground. The wintry weather will then spread south during the week. And temperatures are likely to plummet to an average of 45F by Wednesday - in stark contrast to this week's high of 73F. Weather experts say the dip in . temperatures is caused by a change in wind patterns, with Arctic blasts . replacing warm continental breezes. Freezing overnight temperatures could lead to icy roads, but with roads still warmed from the recent high temperatures the snow is unlikely to settle. MET Office spokesman Helen Chivers said current forecasts indicated there was a slim possibility that the Shetland Islands may see some snowfall on Sunday with chances of snow in the Scottish Highlands by Tuesday. She said: 'Cold air in the Norwegian Sea at the moment is likely to catch up with a frontal system, turning the back edge of rain over Scotland into snow. 'It will start in the high ground over 400 metres but as it moves south there will be a small risk of snow or sleet at lower levels.'

Mike Pawson enjoys the box, filled for the first time during the untypical heat . Residents on a quiet cul-de-sac were stunned when the council filled their grit box - as they were sunning themselves during one of the warmest Marches on record. Mike Pawson was stunned when a diesel pick-up truck chugged down Plantation Avenue in Alwoodley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, and filled the long-empty grit bin. Mr Pawson said the small street had been an ice rink for the last two years during cold weather as the bin had been empty. He said: 'I could not believe it when they arrived. 'It has been like an ice rink the last two years because there has been no sand in the box. When it snows the council snow clearing machine does not come up to our end as it’s a cul-de-sac so it’s quite bad. 'The bin was paid for by local councillor money and the sand was much appreciated the first year we had the bin. But the following year we were told that with the cutbacks there was no more sand available. 'I’m amazed they’ve decided to bring it now it’s so warm.' The blue grit bin had been bought with councillor ward funds in the winter of 2009/10. A Leeds City Council spokeswoman said a request had been received for it to be refilled in February. But because of the 'cold snap', staff had been unable to do so. Local councillors had asked that the bin still be filled with sand in preparation for the future. Swathes . of East and South Yorkshire from Chesterfield up to Scarborough are . officially suffering from drought, with areas around Sheffield, . Doncaster, Hull and Driffield affected. The . areas join the South East and eastern England in drought, most of which . has been affected since earlier this year, although parts of East . Anglia have been suffering drought conditions since last summer. Earlier . this month, seven water companies across east and southern England . announced hosepipe bans would come into force before Easter in a bid to . conserve water supplies in the face of two unusually dry winters.

Cats with no homes: The summer heat is causing havoc to cat hormones, prompting a surge of litters across the country . Britain’s unseasonably hot weather has been having an odd effect on . our cats - causing a kitten crisis for animal rescue charities . nationwide. Frisky felines have seen the unusually warm winter and spring play . havoc with their hormones causing the kitten population to rocket in . recent months. Experts from animal welfare charity the RSPCA have reported a large . rise in the number of abandoned kittens and are blaming the recent warm . weather for the increase. Gill Lewis, who manages the RSPCA kennels in Rayleigh, Essex, said: . 'The warm weather is putting a spring in the step of our feline friends. 'We are always looking for new homes for cats and kittens but this . year the number of adult cats being given up and kittens being handed in . is steadily increasing week on week.' The kitten population doesn’t usually peak until later in the year as . feline ovaries become inactive during the shorter winter days with new . litters usually arriving, at earliest, in late March. But sunny days and warmer weather have seen mating happen throughout . the warm winter and spring period producing an influx of kittens in . February. The rise has pushed kitten kennels to breaking point as people . struggle to look after their pets in the current economic climate. RSPCA south Essex branch volunteer Neil Fullbrook agreed adding: 'We . certainly do think the warm weather is a factor and, with this economic . climate, many people seem to think just dumping their pets is the . easiest option. 'We’ve been inundated with kittens being dumped. It’s happening all over the place.' Animal rescue charity Cats Protection has also seen a sharp rise in . the number of unwanted kittens this year with warm weather once again to . blame. Cats Protection’s Clinical Veterinary Officer, Beth Skillings, said: . 'Many of Cats Protection’s 287 branches and adoption centres across the . UK have been taking in unwanted and abandoned mums and kittens from as . early as February, when we would usually expect to see litters coming in . from March onwards. 'We have two theories as to why kitten season has started earlier. The first is that the warmer weather we’ve been experiencing may have . increased food availability for cats as their prey has been awoken from . hibernation. Increased food availability gives cats an improved body . condition which may have had an effect on their fertility rates - hence . more kittens born early. 'The other possibility is that there are simply more unneutered . queens this year than last year. This could be as a result of people not . neutering their pets due to the current financial situation. This lack . of neutering could be causing more kittens to be born, in . proportionately larger numbers earlier in the season. 'Either way, this could signal an even worse kitten crisis this year . as our branches and centres are currently full to capacity caring for . around 6,000 cats so this could seriously affect our ability to help. 'The best thing owners can do is get their cats neutered as this will . help prevent unwanted litters of kittens. Cats Protection recommends . neutering from four months of age. Cats are prolific breeders, and if . not neutered a female cat can be responsible for 20,000 offspring in . just five years.'

"By . Claire Ellicott and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 18:08 EST, 23 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:10 EST, 25 May 2012 . Google has said plans to block pornography from search engines would still fail to protect British children. Sarah Hunter, the company's head of UK public policy, believes the Government's plan for a bar on adult content would give parents a false sense of security and would be a 'mistake'. Instead she says adults should always supervise younger children while they surf the internet and chat openly with them about sex as they grow up. Protecting our youngsters: David Cameron has promised tougher restrictions on explicit music videos, violent computer games and internet porn but Google say it would be a mistake . 'Legislation would be a mistake,' she said at the Google conference in Watford yesterday, adding a filter would only 'overblock or underblock' and 'deskill' parents. 'The best thing we can do is make sure parents sit with their children on the internet when they're very young and have conversations with older children about sex in general. 'We at Google also believe that children shouldn't be seeing pornography online. 'What we disagree with is the mechanisms by which we protect our children. It's not that easy and the solutions that are being discussed are not perfect.' The Google executive also claimed yesterday to have ‘no idea’ how much money the search giant makes from advertising alongside online pornography which can be viewed by children. Ms Hunter pleaded ignorance during a debate hosted by Google on whether to block porn on the internet to protect youngsters. A spokesman for the firm later said: ‘We do not break out our revenues  for any area.’ But it is clear that Google makes thousands of pounds per day from paid-for advertising alongside search results after a user keys in a word such as ‘porn’ on the British site. Google’s own AdWords programme, designed to help advertisers work out how much it will cost to buy the top advert next to a key word such as porn, indicates it will cost as much as £8,000 a day. Power: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in a position to filter out adult content for all searches . Adverts further down the list cost less, but Google’s British profits would clearly run to thousands from ads placed next to every word associated with pornography. Worldwide profits would be far more. Mrs Hunter told the Google Big Tent media event yesterday in Hertfordshire that the responsibility for protecting children from pornography on the internet lies solely with parents. Her comments fly in the face of a Daily Mail campaign to protect children by blocking internet porn from computers unless an adult user specifically opts in and elects to see the content. Google has nearly total domination of the search engine market and is in a position to filter out adult content for all searches, but it refuses to do so as it insists it is a parental responsibility. Campaigners suggested one reason for Google’s insistence that children’s internet use is the responsibility of their parents is the amount of money the search giant makes from porn advertising. Daily Mail columnist Amanda Platell argued that the internet was ‘full of the most debasing sado-masochistic pornography that no child should ever see’ and said an opt-in policy was the best option. But Mrs Hunter, a former adviser to Tony Blair on media issues, warned that legislation to filter pornography on the internet was a ‘mistake, absolutely’. Fortune-maker: The boards at the Nasdaq change one by one as Facebook begins trading at the Nasdaq in Times Square in New York City . CONCERNS over Google’s creeping intrusion into private life were heightened yesterday when its executive chairman said it would like to know even more about its customers.Eric Schmidt told the Big Tent event that knowing who users’ friends were and what they cared about would improve its services.‘Don’t you think that Google search –  with your permission, I need to say very precisely – will do a better job if we have more information that singles you out – who you are, what you care about – in terms of search results?’ he asked.His words will strike a sinister note for civil liberties campaigners who already believe that Google harvests too much information about its users. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Sadly it is impossible for the average person to figure out what data Google is collecting and how it is being used, a problem exacerbated by the company’s pursuit of combining data from across its services. ‘As far as companies like Google are concerned, you and I are not their customers, we are their product.’ Asked about the amount of money pornography brings in for Google, which makes almost all of its profits through advertising, Mrs Hunter said: ‘I have no idea. We don’t go out of our way to make money from pornography. ‘Like all search engines, we do allow advertisers to place adverts alongside searches that show adult content. ‘But it’s legal. Let’s just be clear.

"By . Ed Monk . PUBLISHED: . 10:47 EST, 3 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:39 EST, 3 July 2012 . Barclays has released details of a telephone conversation between chief executive Bob Diamond and the Bank of England which Barclays believes led to systematic falsifying of Libor submissions. An email account of the conversation is included in written evidence submitted to the Treasury Select Committee in advance of Mr Diamond's appearance before MPs tomorrow. Barclays claims the dialogue between Mr Diamond and Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, was the ultimate cause of Libor submissions being altered downwards. Lost in Translation: Bob Diamond (left) told Paul Tucker (right) that he thought other banks were posting Libor submissions that were too low. Diamond told colleagues the Bank of England man told him Barclays did not always appear as high as they did. The email is dated 30 October 2008 and was sent by Mr Diamond to then Chairman John Varley and Jerry del Messier, who today stepped down from the position of chief operating officer. In it, Mr Diamond explains that Mr Tucker had told him that he had received calls from 'senior figures within Whitehall' who had expressed concern about the high rates being reported by . Barclays and wanted them lowered. The email reports that Mr Diamond asked Mr Tucker to explain to the Whitehall figures his belief that other banks were submitting Libor rates lower than their actual transactions, which had the effect of making Barclays appear out of step. 'Misunderstanding': Jerry del Missier . who resigned from Barclays today, apparently took the email as an instruction to lower the Libor rate . The email from Mr Diamond concludes . that 'while (Mr Tucker) was certain we did not need advice, that it did . not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as have . recently'. This last sentence, it appears, was taken by Mr del Messier as an instruction from Mr Diamond to lower Libor submissions, and he then passed this instruction to the Libor submitters. The written evidence makes clear that Mr Diamond did not subsequently believe Mr Tucker had made such an instruction, or that he had intended to give such an instruction to Mr del Messier. The evidence also outlines how . in 2008 Barclays repeatedly raised the issue of other banks posting Libor . submissions that appeared too low. In the written evidence, the bank . said: 'Barclays was consistently raising concerns with the BBA (trade . body that compiles Libor), questioning why other banks’ Libor . submissions appeared to be so high compared to those of Barclays. Many . of these concerns were based upon Barclays observations that other banks . were making submissions which were lower than levels at which they . appeared to be undertaking transactions.' That will raise question for the . British Bankers' Association to answer about how it responded to . Barclay's alerts of possible Libor errors. Barclays . boss Bob Diamond has released a memo documenting a phone call he had . with the Bank of England's deputy governor about the bank's submissions . regarding Libor. The . memo was sent on October 30, 2008, to the then-chief executive John . Varley and Jerry del Missier, who was president of Barclays Capital. RED is Bob Diamond and stands for Robert E Diamond. Here is the memo in full: . File Note: Call to RED from Paul Tucker, Bank of EnglandDate: 29th October 2008 . Further . to our last call, Mr Tucker reiterated that he had received calls from a . number of senior figures within Whitehall to question why Barclays was . always towards the top end of Libor pricing. His response was 'you have to pay what you have to pay'. I . asked if he could relay the reality, that not all banks were providing . quotes at the levels that represented real transactions, his response . 'oh, that would be worse'. I . explained again our market rate driven policy and that it had recently . meant that we appeared in the top quartile and on occasion the top . decile of the pricing. Equally, . I noted that we continued to see others in the market posting rates at . levels that were not representative of where they would actually . undertake business. This latter point has on occasion pushed us higher than would otherwise appear to be the case. In fact, we are not having to 'pay up' for money at all. Mr . Tucker stated the levels of calls he was receiving from Whitehall were . 'senior' and that while he was certain we did not need advice, that it . did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have . recently.","Email sent in 2008 by Bob Diamond after his conversation with BofE deputy governor Paul Tucker .

He may be a big fish in the Westminster Bubble but Boris Johnson had his ego well and truly pricked when he ventured outside it yesterday. The London Mayor – on a six-day tour of India – found himself being confused with the German tennis hero Boris Becker. At an event in Mumbai which saw the handing over of petals from the Olympic Cauldron to Indian  athletes, the Old Etonian was asked if he was the red-haired Wimbledon legend. Scroll down for video . A royal error: Boris Johnson was believed to be the King of England by some confused locals as he started his tour of India . Different ball game: The London Mayor, playing cricket here, was also mistaken for former tennis player Boris Becker . Not out: Mr Johnson was lucky not to have any wickets to defend as he faced tricky balls from Delhi school children . Akash Bharadia, an 18-year-old on a . gap year volunteering at the temple, said: 'One of the locals shouted . out it was Boris Becker while some people asked whether he was the King . of England. 'They know it's Boris, that's the main thing.' Perhaps the locals could be forgiven . for getting mixed up - Mr Johnson was given a royal welcome as he was . shown in to the inner sanctum of relics from Bhagwan Swaminarayan, a . figure believed by Hindus to be God's incarnation on earth. Mr Bharadia explained: 'I have never seen someone allowed in there before. It's only usually VVIPs such as the Queen.' The locals weren't the only ones who were unsure of his role. An American businessman who had his . photo taken with Mr Johnson referred to him as 'that guy on the zip . line', referring to when he got stuck while travelling over . Victoria Park at the Olympic Games. Presentation: Boris offered petals, which were part of the Thomas Heatherwick designed cauldron which burnt throughout the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London . Centre of attention: Mr Johnson met schoolchildren in New Delhi as part of his visit to India . Plan: Mr Johnson wants to use the trip to boost business links with the subcontinent . After his visit to the temple he went on a log flume ride which featured a narration of the history of India. He then nearly missed a round of interviews after officials sat him down to view a 45-minute film on Hinduism. Mr Johnson did take time out to back Prime Minister David Cameron's stance . against a referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the . European Union. Ambitions: Mr Johnson also wants to sort out issues over student visas while abroad . He said Mr Cameron should concentrate on repatriating powers from . the European Union rather than holding a vote on whether we should . remain in the bloc. He . said the question was not worth considering, because even if the UK did . leave Europe, we would still have to maintain an enormous staff in . Brussels. Mr Johnson arrived in Delhi at the start of the tour which will also take in Hyderabad and Mumbai . and aims to confront UK visa system problems which limit Indian students . from coming to the UK to study and to pick up tips on how to develop . infrastructure. An aside: Mr Johnson's backing for David Cameron over an EU referendum will be one less headache for the Prime Minister . The Akshardham Hindu temple he visited is a sister temple . to the Neasden Temple in north west London. On Monday he showed off his cricketing prowess, facing a young bowler from a . school in Delhi before presenting two London 2012 Olympic cauldron . petals to Indian Olympians. He will also meet up with the England . cricket team, in the country for a test series, appear on a high . profile television chat show, and visit the Bollywood film studios. Mr Cameron has suggested there could . be a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU - but only after . the eurozone crisis has played out. Mr Johnson argued that Britain was . better off in the EU because it had a seat at the table deciding the . rules under which the single market - which is valuable for the UK - . operates. His surprise . intervention comes days after an EU summit collapsed in acrimony after . failing to agree on a seven-year budget deal. Mr Cameron had argued that there should . be no real-term rise in the budget, at a time when member states are . having to make tough cuts to public services. Visitor: Mr Johnson is chased by street vendors at India Gate in New Delhi, on the first of a six-day tour of India, where he will be trying to persuade Indian businesses to invest in London . Tourist: Mr Johnson visits the Akshardham Temple in New Delhi, a sister temple to the Neasden Temple in North West London, on the first of a six-day tour of India . Yesterday, Foreign Secretary William Hague repeated the government’s position that now is not the time for an in-out referendum. But . last year, more than 80 Conservative MPs defied the Prime Minister and . voted in favour of a referendum on our future in Europe. Mr Johnson was asked whether he agreed with the calls during an appearance on Pienaar’s Politics show on BBC Radio Five Live. Mr Johnson said: ‘I don’t think it’s as simple as yes, no, in, out. ‘Suppose . Britain voted tomorrow to come out. What would actually happen? In real . terms, what would happen is that the Foreign Office’s entire delegation . would remain in Brussels. Charm offensive: The London Mayor meets visitors at India Gate in New Delhi . ‘UKREP would remain there, we’d still . have huge numbers of staff trying to monitor what was going on in the . community, only we wouldn’t be able to sit in the Council of Ministers. We wouldn’t have any vote at all. Now I don’t think that’s actually a . prospect that’s likely to appeal.’ The Mayor said it was better to . renegotiate our relationship with Europe, so we got a better deal which . returned powers to Westminster. ‘What you could do, is think of a new . arrangement, new areas of the treaty that we didn’t want to participate . in any more,’ he said. ‘That is the where people are thinking now. ‘With great respect to the sort of in-outers, I don’t think it does boil down to such a simple question.’ All smiles: Mr Johnson arrived on his first overseas mission in Delhi yesterday . On call: Mr Johnson took time out from his India trip to support Prime Minister David Cameron's stance on a referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the EU . Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr . show, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Government would offer a . referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU after the end of the . Eurozone crisis and negotiations on repatriation of powers. ‘The . Prime Minister and I have set out our position on this, and he will . speak further about it at the appropriate time,’ he said. ‘We’ve . said enormous changes are happening in Europe, partly because of the . crisis in the eurozone that may change the relationship between the . countries of the European Union. We’ve also said we want to improve our . relationship with Europe. ‘Of course at the last general election we stood in the Conservative party on returning some powers to the United Kingdom. ‘We . do believe that sometimes less is more in Europe; that doing less at . the European level is better for this county and for other countries, . and what we’ve said is that when we see how that crisis in the eurozone . plays out and when we’ve tried to improve our relationship with Europe, . well that will be the time to seek fresh consent from the British people . and the cleanest and clearest way of doing that would be in a . referendum. ‘But we . will spell out our policy for the coming years and for the next general . election when the Prime Minister speaks about these things.’ Meet and greet: The Mayor of London will visit Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai and will boost his celebrity status by appearing on a high-profile television chat show and visiting Bollywood film studios . On business: Mr Johnson will party with the England cricket team, in India for a Test series . On Friday, an EU summit in Brussels collapsed after the 27 members failed to agree on the budget for the next seven years. Mr Cameron accused the EU of existing in a ‘parallel universe’ and ‘insulting taxpayers’ by refusing to cut ‘a single euro’ from their spending plans. Influential backbencher Mark Pritchard, a former secretary of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, urged ministers to bring forward legislation for a referendum before the end of the parliament. ‘This should be an in/out referendum - anything short of that simply won’t deliver,’ he said in an article for the Telegraph website.","Mr Johnson arrived in India for a six day tour to boost trade links and see student visa issues addressed .

A high school student claims she has been fined $1,000 and had her diploma withheld for wearing an eagle feather in her graduation cap as a symbol of her Native American heritage. Chelsey Ramer, 17, from Alabama, is a member of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, and wanted to wear the feather to show her pride in her culture. However, she says Escambia Academy High School forbade her from wearing the feather and then refused to give her the diploma when she broke the rules. Chelsey Ramer, 17, was fined $1,000 after wearing an eagle feather in her cap (left) during the ceremony . She said the eagle feather is an important symbol of the heritage and spirituality of the Poarch Creek Indians . Now, the teenager says she has been told she cannot pick up the certificate until she pays the fine imposed by the private school. Miss Ramer told the Indian Country Today Media Network that she was 'excited' about the ceremony on May 23 but has been left dismayed by her school's reaction. She was warned she would be pulled out of the ceremony if she wore the feather but instead was refused her diploma afterwards. She said: 'I feel like this wasn’t fair. It felt like it wasn’t legal. 'It really did hurt my feelings. I have watched others wear it and I looked forward to it my whole four years there. Now when it was my turn, [they said] I couldn’t.' The teenager believes the refusal is 'discrimination'. She said repeated requests from herself and her tribal teacher, as well as other Indian seniors, were turned down. Tribal teacher Alex Alvarez told the network that the eagle feather is an important sign of their heritage and spirituality and the refusal was 'ridiculous'. The teacher said requests before the ceremony to speak to school administrators were turned down. Mr Alvarez said: 'We don’t have much left as Indian people, to give a child an eagle feather as an achievement should be adhered to.' Miss . Ramer said she approached the school's then head teacher Betty Warren . about wearing the feather but was refused permission. The teenager said she, like all other . graduates, were told they must sign a school contract that states no . 'extraneous items' should be worn during the ceremony without prior . permission. Tribal teacher Alex Alvarez (right) said the school's refusal was 'ridiculous' and said Ramer (left) should have been allowed to wear the feather as a sign of her spirituality and heritage . She said she refused to sign and wore the feather anyway with the full support of her family. A friend tied it to the tassel on her cap. According to local newspaper the Atmore Advance, Miss Ramer intends to pay the fine and believes the money is worth paying to display her pride. She said: 'It was worth every penny of the thousand dollars. This is what I’ve been waiting on, and I feel like I have a right to wear it.' The newspaper said head teacher Warren resigned after the incident and was replaced. The school has not commented on Miss Ramer's claims. A Creek Indian village. The Poarch Band are descended from the tribe . The Poarch Band of Creek Indians is the only federally recognised tribe of Native Americans in Alabama. They are descended from a segment of the original Creek Nation, which once covered all of Alabama and Georgia, and operate as a sovereign nation. Poarch Indians have their own legislative, executive and judicial branches in Alabama and operate three gaming casinos and a hotel. They have lived as a distinct community in the state for past 200 years and unlike many tribes were not removed from their tribal lands. Creek Nation was defeated in the battle at Horseshoe Bend after the tribes fought settlers when they began taking over Indian land. The Creeks were illegally forced to cede their territory to the United States and most were forcibly removed from their land. The Poarch Creek Indian Reservation is located in southern Alabama near the city of Atmore, Alabama. As of December 31, 2011, there are 3,095 members of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians, of which over 1,000 live in the vicinity of Poarch, Alabama.

Mr Stewart, a former commander of UN forces in Bosnia during the Balkans conflict, addressing Mr Cameron, said: ‘Terrorists hide, come from and are sustained by groups of people around them. ‘Could I ask if you will ensure that the taskforce for tackling extremism puts quite a lot of effort to trying to isolate these misguided people away from those that allow them to operate and sustain them?’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘I think you are absolutely right. It is not simply enough to target and go after violent extremists after they’ve become violent. We have to drain the swamp in which they inhabit. ‘And that means looking at the process of radicalisation on our campuses, it means looking at Islamic centres that have been taken over by extremists and gone wrong, it means looking at those mosques who are struggling to throw out the extremists and to help them in the work they are doing. ‘It means going through all of these elements of the conveyor belt to radicalisation and making sure we deal with them.’ Scroll down for video .

Because sacks didn't become an official statistic until 1982, Jones' total is uncertain. However, he was renowned as a premier pass rusher and team leader. Jones made the Pro Bowl every year from 1964-70 and played in eight overall. Jones was a member of the legendary Los Angeles Rams defensive front four, known as the 'Fearsome Foursome.'

He combined with fellow Hall of Famer Merlin Olsen, Rosey Grier and Lamar Landry on the defensive line that, at times, was unblockable. George Allen, who coached the Fearsome Foursome, called Jones the 'greatest defensive end of modern football.' The Allen family had Jones present George Allen for his Hall of Fame induction in 2002. The Rams' unofficial stats show Jones with 159 1-2 sacks for them and 173 1-2 for his career. Jones also was one of the most durable players, missing just five games in his 14 pro seasons. A 14th-round draft pick in 1961 out of Mississippi Valley State University, which later produced Jerry Rice, Jones was the first defensive lineman with 100 solo tackles, reaching that mark in 1967. In 2009, his number was retired before the start of an NFL football game between the St. Louis Rams and Green Bay Packers. Most recently, he was the CEO of his own foundation, which he began in 1997. He also made several trips to visit troops on active duty in the Middle East.","David 'Deacon' Jones died of natural causes at home in Southern California .

"MPs condemned the commission, which now faces a fresh investigation . By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 19:07 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:51 EST, 4 June 2013 . The Cup Trust was granted charitable status - a move approved by the regulator's controversial then-chairman Dame Suzi Leather . The Charity Commission was accused of ‘unacceptable’ and ‘damaging’ failures yesterday for allowing a huge tax avoidance scam to masquerade as a children’s charity. The Cup Trust was granted charitable status – a move approved by the regulator’s controversial then-chairman Dame Suzi Leather – despite a lack of checks, MPs said. Its decision was made even though the trust was set up in the British Virgin Islands by a company whose directors were known tax avoidance specialists. The affair was the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of fake charities exploiting charity tax law, the Public Accounts Committee said. MPs condemned the commission, which now faces a fresh investigation, for ‘lack of rigour’ in policing rogue organisations over the past 25 years. Their report follows a series of political rows over the commission’s priorities following Dame Suzi’s appointment in 2006. The 57-year-old Labour Party member was handed 13 prominent quango jobs after Tony Blair’s 1997 election victory. The Charity Commission role, which she quit last summer, paid £80,000 for a three-day week. The Cup Trust applied for charitable status in 2009. But it was a front for a £176million tax avoidance scam which the Charity Commission did not begin investigating until a year later. The trust spent only £55,000 on charitable causes but tried to claim £46million in charity tax relief. MPs said that it was ‘unacceptable’ that the Cup Trust was ever registered as a charity. ‘My committee does not believe the Cup Trust ever met the legal criteria to qualify as a registered charity,’ said committee chairman Margaret Hodge. ‘Its purpose was to avoid UK tax. ‘The trust’s true purpose might have been easily detected by the Charity Commission had they carried out more checks before registration, including with HM Revenue & Customs.’ The scandal had damaged the reputation of the commission and the charity sector, she said. ‘It was only after it had registered the trust as a new charity that the commission found out that it had been set up by people active in tax avoidance schemes. The commission has investigated but a year later its findings have not been published.’ The Charity Commission said last night: ‘We regularly share information with HM Revenue  & Customs. We are discussing  better ways to work together to tackle abuse of charity. ‘We are targeting our resources on the areas of highest risk, with a particular emphasis on tackling fraud, terrorist abuse and risks to vulnerable beneficiaries. ‘We have strengthened our board with new members with considerable experience of regulation in such areas.’ Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said that the committee did noy believe the Cup Trust ever met the legal criteria to qualify as a registered charity . The Cup Trust was launched by tax avoidance expert Matthew Jenner, who in the past has numbered comedian Jimmy Carr, former Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles and Coronation Street star William Roache among the associates of his companies. Mr Jenner’s interests have also included pawnbroking and debt collection agencies, and used car businesses. The Trust has operated by borrowing large sums from banks and using the money to buy gilts, government bonds which attract no capital gains tax or stamp duty when traded. The gilts are then sold to wealthy investors for a tiny token sum. The investors sell the gilts on the open market for the proper price. They then give the proceeds back to the charity, which takes six per cent in fees. The money is used to pay back the Trust’s bank borrowings. Investors can then claim Gift Aid, which can amount to between £250,000 and £375,000 in tax relief for every million ‘donated’ to the charity. Dame Suzi, 57, who was made Dame in 2006, is a Labour party member who was handed a series of prominent quango jobs after Labour’s 1997 election victory. She quit as chairman of the Charity Commission last summer. The job, which paid £80,000 for a three-day week, was one of three quango posts and three posts on committees running state institutions which she held last year. She has since 1997 run or been a member of 13 quangos and boards, alongside a post as Deputy Lieutenant of Devon. Her replacement at the Commission, William Shawcross, has also come under criticism from MPs, in particular for the Commission’s decision to ban a Plymouth Brethren church from charity status on the grounds that it did not do enough for the public good. The Charity Commission said yesterday that it has opened an inquiry into an organisation called The Public Safety Charitable Trust. The body rented 1,500 empty buildings at peppercorn rents and installed wi-fi transmitters to broadcast public safety messages. Landlords then claimed they did not need to pay business rates because the buildings were used for charitable purposes. Three councils who said the charity was a tax avoidance scheme won a High Court case allowing them to recover tax last month.","Cup Trust directors were known tax avoidance specialists .

Get used to 'nightmare' bad weather causing chaos on Britain's  roads as it's only going to get worse - and not even a 'gritter on every corner' will be able to cope with extreme wintry conditions, the RAC Foundation warned today. A growing number of potholes will follow in the wake of the savage cold snaps, as well as lurking hidden beneath sudden snowfalls, which remain ' a matter of concern' it warns. A combination of more frequent and more 'extreme' bad winter weather means drivers will have to change their habits and expectations and follow the Scouts' motto of 'Be Prepared'. Too many drivers fail to heed weather warnings 'and had been caught out or unprepared,' the RAC report found . Despite the severest conditions, some drivers still expect their journeys to be 'normal' the 54-page dossier discovered . Even with masses of the latest technology, man still cannot deal 'with whatever nature might throw at us,' it concludes. The 54-page dossier called 'Ploughing On' was commissioned by the RAC Foundation from expert  Brian Smith, a former director of Environment and Transport at Cambridgeshire County Council and member of the Government's Quarmby Winter Resilience Review in 2010 following widespread chaos during the severe winters of 2008/09 and 2009/10. It concludes that the official response to the extensive ice and snow across England and Wales in January 2013 - and again in parts of the South East of England in early March -  was 'generally good'. Local highway authorities and the Government's Highways Agency were this year well prepared for winter and there was no shortages of salt though there were sometimes glitches in supplies, and councils did not  cut back on winter resilience spending,  the report concludes. But at temperatures of minus -7C and below, the effectiveness of salt decreases. It found that although councils and . the Highways Agency responded well to snow and ice in January and March, . changing weather patterns mean changing strategy from trying to change . the conditions to one of 'coping' with them. Motorists must also take responsibility for their actions and 'be prepared' - by staying at home if necessary, it says. Too many drivers failed to heed weather warnings 'and had been caught out or unprepared.' One of the biggest problems in extreme weather is gritters getting trapped in jams caused by stranded or abandoned cars and 'inconsiderate' drivers, and therefore unable to lay grit . There are also concerns about 'poor driving and lack of experience and skills.' One of the biggest problems is gritters getting trapped in jams caused by stranded or abandoned cars and 'inconsiderate' drivers, and therefore unable to put down their grit on the affected roads. The  Highways Agency should consider more removable sections of central reservation barriers to allow gridlocked  snow ploughs and gritters easier access to the points where they are needed. On potholes the report notes: 'RAC patrols expressed concerns about the  number of potholes in all types of road, and the observation that these are particularly dangerous when it has snowed. Because they cannot be seen.' 'It is inevitable there will be many more requiring repair as a result of this winter. 'Snow and ice not only  exacerbates damage but also hides potholes, through which road users then unwittingly ride or drive.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director . of the RAC Foundation, said: 'When we are warm and snug in our modern . cars it is tempting to think we are immune from the elements and have . the technological resources to deal with whatever nature might throw at . us – but the experience is that we do not. 'We need to consider revising our view of what is ""normal"". Drivers need more advice on the potential benefits of winter tyres and 'add-ons' such as snow-socks and snow chains, the RAC found . 'As the climate appears to change we should not confuse extreme weather with rare weather.' There was a balance to  be struck between need, expectations and expense. It said:'Councils could put a gritter and a snow plough round every corner if that is what the public desire but the trade-off is greatly reduced expenditure on other essential services.' Professor Glaister noted: 'For hundreds of drivers who were trapped in nightmare conditions it will be hard to believe, but this report concludes that by and large the authorities have significantly upped their games in recent years. The reality is that the climate is an evolving beast. No longer can we regard periods of severe weather as isolated incidents. They seem to be getting more frequent and more extreme and the impact of one compounds the effects of another.' Many drivers do change their travel plans following severe weather warnings, but there are still too many who do not. Despite the severest conditions, some drivers still expect their journeys to be 'normal' it notes: 'They may feel that we have the technological resources to  deal with whatever nature might through at us – but the experience is that we do not.' But drivers need more advice on the potential benefits of winter tyres and 'add-ons' such as snow-socks and snow chains, as well as keeping adequate – rather than legal minimum -   tread depth on normal tyres  of around 4mm. Despite common perceptions to the contrary  in Britain , the review says much of Continental Europe also suffers disruption from snow and ice and is just as heavily criticised, though winter tyres are often obligatory. The report took evidence from the Highways Agency, 32 local authorities in England and Wales, Boots, Asda, the RAC breakdown business and 13 motoring clubs across Europe.","'Climate is evolving beast' that needs to be coped with, RAC report finds .

A mother has credited her baby daughter with saving her life after she was diagnosed with cervical cancer while pregnant . Jane Heffey, 28, received the devastating diagnosis when she was 20 weeks pregnant with Ciara last February, after having suffered excessive bleeding. She said: 'At first I assumed it had something to do with being pregnant before, and that my body was readjusting. Ms Heffey, a nurse at Aintree Hospital, in Liverpool, said: 'If hadn't pregnant with Ciara, I might have brushed it off. Lifesaver: Jane Heffey mother has credited her daughter Ciara, now 11 months, with saving her life after she was diagnosed with cancer while pregnant . 'I was worried that the bleeding meant was something wrong with Ciara. I never imagined it would be me.' After an initial check-up, Ms Heffey was given an examination at Liverpool Women's Hospital, where she received the devastating news that she had a 9cm tumour on her cervix. As baby Ciara developed in her womb, she was putting pressure on her cervix, causing heavy bleeding. But there was more devastating news to come. The cancer had already spread to Jane's lymph nodes and the medical staff were worried that it had reached her bladder, too. She said: 'When the doctor was delivering the news, it felt like an out-of-body experience. It was like everything had been perfect. I had my house, my career, my partner and my family. Then my whole world just crumbled. 'I couldn't understand why it was happening to me. I went running, I ate healthily, I didn't smoke. And then this happens, I found that very hard.' Ms Heffey, who at that point already had a nine-month-old daughter, Niamh, with partner Stephen, 30, added: 'It wasn't just my life hanging in the balance. 'Being pregnant with an eight month old baby, it was the worst news imaginable.' Shock diagnosis: Ms Heffey was told she had a 9cm cervical tumour when she was 20 weeks pregnant.  She had to undergo chemotherapy while pregnant, which led to her shaving her head . Relief: Baby Ciara was born by C-section at 32 weeks. Despite her mother having to have chemotherapy while pregnant, she was perfectly healthy . In order to stop the cancer from spreading even further, Ms Heffey was told she would need to have chemotherapy while she was still pregnant with Ciara. She said: 'I signed the consent form and I was warned about the side effects, like how the chemotherapy could affect Ciara's growth and her hearing.' She was also given the option to abort her daughter, which would have allowed her to start intensive treatment sooner - something she immediately dismissed. She said: 'Just one word could have ended Ciara's life, but there's no way on earth I would have done that. Not when she's the one who had saved my life.' Still reeling from the news, she was introduced to Dr Karen Whitmarsh, a gynaecologist  who would supervise her treatment at The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre, Wirral. Last March, while she was 24 weeks pregnant, she started her first cycle of chemotherapy. She said: 'The potential effect of the treatment on Ciara was terrifying, but this was my only option. It had to work.' Gruelling: Three weeks after Ciara was born, Jane had to start intensive chemotherapy again . Clear: Her tumours have now disappeared completely, thanks to radiotherapy and chemotherapy . That same month Jane returned to hospital for the results of an MRI scan. Incredibly, the tumour had shrunk from 9cm to 5cm, while the cancer on her lymph nodes had been reduced by half. The remainder of her treatment was put on hold until Ciara was born, as a second round of chemotherapy could potentially harm her. At 32 weeks baby Ciara was delivered by caesarean on April 12, 2012 at Liverpool's Women Hospital. 'When I woke up Stephen told me Ciara was fine. It was the best news in the world.' 'When I saw her for the first time she was curled up in an incubator. I just burst out crying. She was beautiful.' Three weeks after Ciara was born, Ms Heffey had to start intensive chemotherapy. Although she had been warned about hair loss, she was alarmed when Niamh pulled out a huge clump. Fundraising: She is now planning to do a skydive to raise money for the cancer centre that treated her . Ms Heffey said: 'That really frightened me, and I realised I needed to take control. I called Stephen and he grabbed the clippers and that was it. We shaved my head and I toasted my new look with a glass of champagne.' After weeks of gruelling chemotherapy, her next scan came in July, where she discovered the tumour had disappeared completely. But she still needed 25 external sessions of radiotherapy across her pelvis, as well as more chemotherapy to blast the cancerous cells still left in her body. She said: 'I was whacked but Stephen made me laugh every day, and he was always there for me. 'Seeing my daughters' smiles made the fight worthwhile. Priorities: She said: 'I used to be career orientated, but being a mum is my priority now' 'At times I felt vulnerable and ugly, but the nurses in the radiation unit were great. It's not always been easy, and there are times when Ciara, now 11 months old, and Niamh, now 22 months old, are at the dinner table and there are peas flying everywhere and both of them are crying. 'At times like that, me and Stephen just look at each other and we burst out laughing. After the year we've been through, we're not about to moan.' This month Ms Heffey will be falling 10,000ft when she performs a sponsored charity skydive for The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre with Stephen. She said: ""Any other time and I would be having a heart attack at the thought of doing that. But now I feel like I can do anything. 'I'm taking HRT to replace the hormones that would have been produced by my ovaries, which were destroyed by the treatment. 'It's only now that it hits me how bad it could have been. When I see a funeral car I have a little panic. That could have been my future. 'I used to be career orientated. Being a mum is my priority now. Being with my kids and cherishing every moment is so important.'

Paleontologists have discovered a family of triceratops, including one of the most complete skeletons ever found.

They believe the rare find of skeletons belonged either a to a parent group of triceratops or two females and a youngster. Paleontologists from the Black Hills Institute and Naturalis Biodiversity Center prepare the excavated bones . The team uncovered bones from three Triceratops at the dig near Newcastle, Wyoming . The three-horned dinosaurs lived more than 65million years ago and were often meals for predators, such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, which left behind only their skulls for dinosaur trophy hunters to find. Paleontologists also discovered the left foot and left leg of a T-Rex, which roamed the same area. It is believed the three Triceratops were attacked by a T-Rex. Black Hills Institute president Pete Larson said he was excited when he first saw the T-Rex foot, but he soon realized the potential presented by the Triceratops bones. 'We have been given a rare, I would say unprecedented, opportunity,' Larson told AP. The dig will continue for about four weeks as Larson while his 25-person team excavate the site.

Mr Larson said few Triceratops skeletons have ever been discovered, so the new find could provide a lot of information. He said the family group is an 'unprecedented' find. 'We have the opportunity to really rewrite the book on Triceratops,' he told Rapid City Journal. After the fossils are prepared and mounted into a display, they could be sent to the Naturalis gallery, he said.","The bones of three Triceratops were found by a team of 25 paleontologists .

The skeletons, which were first discovered by a British forest guard in 1942, were initially thought to be the bodies of Japanese soldiers travelling through India as part of a World War II land invasion. But although the cold climate around the Lake of Roopkund, at 16,000ft above sea level, had preserved some of the hair, flesh and leather clothes of the victims, the bodies were dated to around 850AD. Scroll down for video . The mystery of how dozens of skeletons ended up on the shores of the Lake of Roopkund has puzzled locals and scientists for centuries . Scientists discovered they appeared to be from two main groups - one was closely related which seemed to be a family group and another of shorter local people. They concluded that the family were likely to be pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals as guides. Theories ranging from a landslide to a mass suicide were put forward to explain the deaths, but it is only now that researchers believe they know what caused the cracks in their skulls. During World War II the British government feared they were the remains of Japanese soldiers, but tested showed they were much older .

Ambitious plans for a ‘Boris Island’ airport were dealt a bitter blow today as a powerful all-party group of MPs urged ministers to reject the idea and instead expand Heathrow to three or even four runways. As Europe’s busiest airport and the ‘jewel in the crown’ of international aviation, expansion at Heathrow is ‘long overdue’ and by far the best option after decades of dither by Governments of all complexions, they said. The prospect of  expanding Heathrow by creating two additional runways two miles to the West – instead of one extra ‘third’ runway to the North- was put forward by Policy Exchange and CentreForum and has captured the interest and imagination of senior ministers, as well as MPs on the committee. Grounded? An influential commons select committee has voted against plans for a 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames Estuary . Backers say it they would cost between £8billion and £12billion and be ready by  2030. The MPs’ report notes: ’Relocating the runways in this way might result in less noise annoyance for residents under the current flight path, thus addressing the most politically significant objection to the expansion of Heathrow.’ But they also encouraged Gatwick to press ahead with plans for a second runway. Today’s verdict by the influential Transport Select committee is uncompromisingly clear noting : ‘We conclude that a third runway at Heathrow is necessary,  but also suggest that a four-runway proposal may have merit.’ A brand new airport in the Thames . Estuary to the East of London would be too expensive, impractical, . harmful to wildlife and ‘not commercially viable’ without huge public . subsidies, said the MPs. The . report was agreed by a majority of the Committee with six voting in . favour and just  one (Torbay Lib Dem Adrian Sanders MP) voting against, . with  no abstentions. The . findings in the 124-page report  will infuriate residents and . campaigners around  the West London airport as well as London Mayor . Boris Johnson who supports a brand new airport in the Thames estuary . already dubbed ‘Boris Island.’ But . it will delight airlines including the UK’s flagship carrier British . Airways and the boss of its parent company Willie Walsh, as well . business leaders in the capital. The findings will infuriate London Mayor Boris Johnson who supports the idea of a Thames estuary airport . The report comes as former CBI and Financial Services Authority chief Sir Howard Davies and his team on the Whitehall-appointed Airports Commission continue their investigation into airport capacity. The commission is due to present an initial report by the end of this year and a final report in summer 2015 – after the next general election. The report says MPs on the Transport Committee ‘have today rejected calls for a new hub airport east of London and urge the Government to permit the expansion of Heathrow where a third runway is long overdue.’ The verdict was announced by Louise Ellman, chairman  of the House of Commons’ Transport Committee and Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside. Launching the report of an inquiry that examined the UK Government’s Aviation Strategy, Mrs Ellman said: ’Heathrow – the UK’s only hub airport – has been short of capacity for a decade and is currently operating at full capacity. ‘We conclude that a third runway at Heathrow is necessary,  but also suggest that a four-runway proposal may have merit, especially if expanding to locate two new runways westwards from the current site could curb the noise experienced by people affected under the flight path.’ Rejecting the ‘Boris island’ plan for a brand new airport in the Thames Estuary, Mrs Ellman said:’ ‘Research we commissioned made plain that building an entirely new hub airport east of London could not be done without huge public investment in new ground transport infrastructure. 'Evidence to our inquiry also showed a substantial potential impact on wildlife habitat in the Thames estuary. ‘ . She added:’The viability of an estuary hub airport would also require the closure of Heathrow – a course of action that would have unacceptable consequences for individuals, businesses in the vicinity of the existing airport and the local economy.’ MPs ‘looked closely’  at the three main options to increase UK hub airport capacity noting:’We conclude that adding new runways to expand a number of other existing airports will not, on its own, provide a long-term solution to the hub capacity problem. We do however encourage Gatwick’s operator to develop a robust business case for their vision of a second runway. ‘And the third so-called Heathwick’ option was rejected as ‘uncompetetive’ with MPs noting:’We reject the notion of linking existing airports by high-speed rail to form a split-hub.’ The MPs report says Government failures to get a grip of the issue has been ‘immensely disappointing’  adding: ’Following decades of policy papers, inquiries, taskforces, and commissions, it is the lack of a long-term cross-party political strategy for aviation that is principally to blame for the very real danger that the UK could lose its status as an international hub for aviation.' Continuing with a two-runway Heathrow hub  ‘unsustainable’ because  it is not adequate for the needs of the UK concluding ‘on the basis of the evidence we have heard we recommend that the Government allow Heathrow to expand.’ It adds:’Heathrow is the jewel in the crown of international aviation and we believe that a third runway is long overdue. British businesses are overwhelmingly in favour of this option.' Jewel in the crown: The committee concluded that a third runway at Heathrow is necessary, but it also suggested that a four-runway proposal may have merit . The report said it was ‘less than ideal’ that the Airports Commission was working to ‘a protracted timetable, with a final report not to be produced until after the 2015 general election’. To avoid matters being again ‘kicked into the long grass’ it challenged the Commission to make a decision  ‘once and for all’ . In December Willie Walsh, the feisty boss of British Airways' parent company told the MPs’ committee that cowardly  politicians have been ‘too afraid’ to take tough decisions on airport expansion and  that they would  live to regret ducking the  issue which has already put the UK ‘out of the game’ compered to its international rivals. Today’s report also calls on the Government to establish a national scheme to ensure adequate compensation for people affected by noise from expansion at Heathrow. It also calls for controversial Air Passenger Duty (APD)  airport departure tax  to be reduced or abolished if research suggests it is harmful  to the economy or Government revenue. Chancellor George Osborne has admitted it is a revenue raiser not a ‘green’ tax as originally billed. In the short-term the MPs said ministers should introduce an APD ‘tax holiday’ for a 12-month trial period for new services operating from airports outside south east England. Chancellor George Osborne has admitted the controversial Air Passenger Duty airport departure tax is a revenue raiser not a 'green' tax as originally billed . MPs also want assurances that the controversial  HS2 high-speed rail line rail network serves Heathrow. A Department for Transport spokesman said the Government was ‘determined to find a lasting solution’  adding; ’The strength and range of opinions expressed on the issue shows precisely why we are right to ask Sir Howard Davies to conduct a detailed, independent review of all the options, based on the most up-to-date information.’ Labour Shadow Transport Secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘Since David Cameron has asked Sir Howard Davies not to deliver his final report until 2015, it will be for the next government to decide on the way forward.’ Heathrow welcomed MPs’ recognition of the ‘unique importance’ of their airport to  the UK economy. Councillor  Rodney Chambers, leader of Medway Council in Kent,  said: ‘This confirms what we've always known, and have campaigned loudly about  - that the Thames Estuary airport is a non-starter.’ British Airways said the report ‘backs up our view that a Thames Estuary airport is not a credible option’. Jill Brady, Virgin Atlantic Director of External Affairs noted the ‘crippling lack of political consensus around the future of aviation’ and welcomed the findings as ‘a breath of fresh air’. Simon Buck, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA) welcomed ‘some refreshingly pragmatic and straight forward cross-party thinking’ which   puts the ‘the national interest first.’ Corin Taylor, senior economic adviser at the Institute of Directors praised the ‘hugely positive recommendations on the future of air travel in the UK’ and said expanding Heathrow ‘by far the best option’ adding: ’We urge the Government to accept the committee’s recommendations.’ But Paul Kehoe, chief Executive of Birmingham Airport said the focus on a Third or even Fourth Heathrow runway was ‘ a missed opportunity’ as he published new research recommending more expansion in the regions: ’Britain’s great cities need great airports.’ London First’s chief executive Baroness Jo Valentine  said any solution will take years but  that in the meantime more flights were needed from Heathrow: ‘We have to make the existing airports work harder.’","Transport Select committee votes against new airport in the Thames Estuary .

T-Rex was not just a fearsome hunter on land, the cunning monster could also wade across rivers in pursuit of their victims, new research reveals. The discovery is the latest round in a 50-year argument among scientists over whether or not the biggest land-dwellers of the period could swim. And it suggests that while they were hardly graceful in the water, they could at least paddle short distances to cross rivers if they had to.

Canadian researchers discovered 100million-year-old markings on the floor of an old river bed known as Dinosaur Highway because of the number of fossilised finds there. But unlike the footprints previously found, these were scratchmarks from a two-legged, land dwelling beast rather than a water-dwelling species of the time. The size of the clawmarks suggests it may well have been a Tyrannosaur or other, similar sized carnivore, said the University of Alberta fossil hunters. And the way they were scratched on to the surface show it was not running, as it would on land, but propelling itself as if in water - a kind of 'dino paddle' action. Alberta researcher Scott Persons, who made the find in China's Szechuan Valley, said the markings show a co-ordinated 'left-right, left-right' movement of the feet. The area is known as Dinosaur Highway because it has provided evidence of so many different species of the beasts moving through the area. Scott Persons told the journal Chinese Science Bulletin: 'What we have are scratches left by the tips of a two-legged dinosaur's feet. 'The dinosaur's claw marks show it was swimming along in this river and just its tippy toes were touching bottom.' It is estimated the creature paddled at least 15 metres but the scratches are not enough to positively identify exactly which species it was. However, the overall size would suggest it was a large predator such as a T-Rex or a Sinocalliopteryx, both of which were common to the area of China.

Skoda has clinched a ‘superb’ double victory with two of its cars topping the league-table of the most satisfying to drive in Britain. The top-of the range Skoda Superb from the Czech manufacturer - once the butt of cruel jokes - took top honours with the Skoda Yeti sports utility vehicle in second place. They were ahead of the British-built Jaguar XF saloon in the respected What Car? 2013 UK Vehicle Ownership Satisfaction Study. The Skoda Superb came first in the poll with an 83 per cent satisfaction rating . The more adventurous Skoda Yeti came a close second, cementing the manufacturers success . But Jaguar as a whole leapt ahead of the opposition by clinching the top ranking when it came to car manufacturers, beating Japan’s Lexus and Honda - with Skoda in fourth place ahead of Germany’s Mercedes-Benz. The Skoda Superb Saloon had a satisfaction rating of 83 per cent, while their Yeti sports utility vehicle had 82.2 per cent. the Jaguar XF saloon came a close third with 82.8 per cent. The company laughed off decades of jokes as it celebrated its double win. The . car firm said jokes about them had long been consigned ‘to the dustbin . of history’ leaving its satisfied customers smiling, and their downcast . rivals laughing on the other side of their faces. The company even managed to beat luxury manufacturer jaguar who came a close third with their XF . And Jaguar’s off-road sibling Land . Rover won the accolade of the most improved car-maker, bounding into the . top ten for the first time in the What Car? poll carried out with car . quality experts J.D. Power and Associates. By contrast, bottom of the satisfaction ratings were Chevrolet, part of US giant General Motors, Alfa Romeo and Mitsubishi. The Chevrolet managed a satisfaction rating of 70.2 per cent, while the Alfa Romeo Mito reached 70.7 per cent. The findings are based on a wide-range of detailed satisfaction ratings - from comfort and performance to quality and running costs - from more than 16,000 UK motorists covering 16 cars and 27 manufacturers.

The study was fielded in December 2012 and January 2013.

What Car? editor-in-chief Chas Hallett said: ‘Skoda’s knock-out performance comes on the back of a 20% sales increase in 2012. Not only does the Superb score a stonking victory after a three-place climb up the chart, the Yeti takes second place. The Chevrolet Spark failed to deliver as voters left it last in the poll with only a 70.2 per cent satisfaction rating . 'Winning attributes included practicality that didn’t compromise driving appeal and prices made more affordable by Skoda’s no VAT and 0% finance offers.’ On Jaguar’s success Mr Hallett said: ‘This is another great achievement for everyone at Jaguar. For the second year in a row, Jaguar has claimed the top spot. This study shows that customers are really satisfied with their Jaguars. Q: Why do Skodas have a heated rear windscreen? A: To keep your hands warm when you’re pushing them. Q. What do you call a Skoda with twin exhausts? A. A wheelbarrow. Q: What do you call a Skoda with a sun roof? A: A skip. Q: How do you make a Skoda go at 60mph? A: Drive it off Beachy Head. Q: How do you make a Skoda disappear? A: Apply rust remover. A man goes into a shop and says: ‘Can I have a new petrol cap for my Skoda?’ The salesman replies: ‘That sounds a fair swop.’ 'Owners said they didn’t regret spending a single penny on [the Jaguar XF], rating it excellent across all categories. 'Jaguar dealers were reported to be ‘as slick as the cars with helpful staff taking the time to explain things, and going out of their way to accommodate owners’ schedules’. Mr Hallett added:’Land Rover is the star performer in the 2013 survey, moving up six places to take sixth place, the first time it has appeared in the top 10.’ On bottom of the pile Chevrolet and its new Spark, the What Car? report notes: ‘It’s a miserable first survey showing for the Spark, entering the running at rock bottom. 'Owners rated it below par in every area; body panel gaps, unyielding fuel caps, tyre wear and even some horn problems led them to question the car’s quality, and they struggled to find anything positive to say about it at all. 'Engine stalling, noisy brakes, seat rattles and wind noise were also reported. At least Chevrolet dealers were friendly, even if they did charge too much.’ Founded in 1895 . to make push-bikes, with the Skoda name used for the first time from . 1925, the firm had its proud pre-war heyday in the 1930s.

Targeted: Scientists used MRI scanning to show that, when we're looking for something, areas of the brain used for other mental tasks are redirected to help with the search . The human brain can quickly mobilise a highly focused 'search party' to track down a lost item, scientists claim. When people hunt for lost keys, a missing mobile phone, or a pet gone astray, their brain rapidly redirects areas normally dedicated to other mental tasks to help. According to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, when we embark on a targeted search, various visual and non-visual regions of the brain shift their focus to track down the missing item. It means that, if we are looking for a child lost in a crowd, brain regions usually dedicated to recognising other objects - or even those associated with abstract thought - are reallocated to the task in hand, transforming the brain into a highly-focused child-finder. 'Our results show that our brains are much more dynamic than previously thought, rapidly reallocating resources based on behavioural demands, and optimising our performance by increasing the precision with which we can perform relevant tasks,' said Tolga Cukur, a postdoctoral researcher in neuroscience at U.C. Berkeley, and lead author of the study. 'As you plan your day at work, for . example, more of the brain is devoted to processing time, tasks, goals . and rewards, and as you search for your cat, more of the brain becomes . involved in recognition of animals,' he said. The findings, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, help to explain why we find it difficult to concentrate on more than one task at the same time. The results also shed light on how people are able to shift their attention to challenging tasks, and may provide greater insight into neurobehavioral and attention deficit disorders such as ADHD. Lost something? The results show our brains are much more dynamic than previously thought, scientists say . The results were obtained via studies that used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of study participants as they searched for people or vehicles in movie clips. One experiment saw subjects hold down a button whenever a person appeared on screen, while in another, they did the same with vehicles. As they were doing so, the brain scans simultaneously measured neural activity via blood flow in thousands of locations across the brain. The scientists said the biggest changes they identified occurred in the prefrontal cortex - an area usually thought to be involved in abstract thought and long-term planning. Researcher Tolga Cukur . Researchers used regularized linear regression analysis, which finds correlations in data, to build models showing how each of the roughly 50,000 locations near the cortex responded to each of the 935 categories of objects and actions seen in the movie clips. Next, they compared how much of the cortex was devoted to detecting humans or vehicles depending on whether or not each of those categories was the search target. They found that, when participants searched for humans, relatively more of the cortex was devoted to humans, and when they searched for vehicles, more of the cortex was devoted to vehicles. For example, areas usually involved in recognising specific visual categories such as plants or buildings switched to become tuned to humans or vehicles - vastly expanding the area of the brain engaged in the search. 'These changes occur across many brain regions, not only those devoted to vision. In fact, the largest changes are seen in the prefrontal cortex, which is usually thought to be involved in abstract thought, long-term planning and other complex mental tasks,' Mr Cukur said. The findings build on a previous U.C. Berkeley brain imaging study which revealed how the brain organises thousands of animate and inanimate objects into what researchers call a 'continuous semantic space'. Those findings challenged previous assumptions that every visual category is represented in a separate region of the visual cortex. Instead, researchers found that categories are actually represented in highly organised, continuous maps.","Brain mobilises extra areas to help track down lost items, say scientists .

When Mark Smith saw police searching for a wanted man in his street he didn’t hesitate to do his civic duty and help them to find him. The suspect was duly arrested – but as Mr Smith looked on from outside his door he was savaged by one of the police dogs in a terrifying ordeal that left him fearing he was going to die. The German Shepherd mauled the father of three’s arm so badly that surgeons likened the injuries to a ‘shark attack’. His left arm was ‘ripped to shreds’ and he may never regain full use of it. Mark Smith who was attacked by a police dog while helping officers catch a wanted man outside his home in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire . To make matters worse, instead of apologising straight away, the police handler said: ‘That’s what my dog does.’ Mr Smith, 45, a brewery worker, is consulting lawyers and will be making a formal complaint. ‘My arm is basically useless,’ he said yesterday. ‘The dog has almost eaten me. I have never experienced power or severity like it. The doctors don’t know if I will get the use back in my arm.’ The incident happened as three police dog handlers were hunting a suspected criminal who had run into back gardens of a cul-de-sac in Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, last Thursday morning. Mr Smith had just returned from the bank and saw the suspect go into a neighbour’s garden. He and other residents helped police look for the man. (File picture) Surgeons said Mr Smith's injuries were like those caused by shark attacks following the mauling by a police German Shepherd . When he was found, officers took the dogs out of their van to make the arrest and told Mr Smith to go back to the safety of his drive. The suspect, who had allegedly tried to run down a police officer, was caught and arrested. But Mr Smith was then attacked by one of the dogs as he stood outside his door watching the drama. The 45-year-old brewery worker fears he could loose his arm having been mauled by the dog . He said: ‘Suddenly one of the police dogs, who was not on a lead, appeared from nowhere. It just flew straight at me, it was not growling, not barking. ‘It grabbed me by my left arm and took me to the ground and just started to bite. I can’t describe how horrific it was. I am a big lad and its jaws were completely around my left arm. I could hear my arm crunching and severing. It must have had me for five or ten seconds. I was screaming. ‘I passed out with the pain and I assume the handler managed to call off the dog because I felt the jaws release my arm just as I faded out of consciousness. ‘The attack was brutal. I could hear it crunch and crack, and I’m having trouble sleeping now as I can hear the sounds ringing through my mind. I thought I was going to die, if it had stayed on me much longer then I might have done.’ His wife, who was in their house, was ‘distraught’. Police called an ambulance when they realised Mr Smith was badly injured and he was taken to Leeds General Infirmary. He faces extensive plastic surgery and hospital treatment on his arm. ‘The surgeons have cleaned it and tried to reconstruct it but there are bits missing,’ he said. ‘There are still huge gaps under the bandages.’ The next day an officer phoned Mr Smith to apologise and promised an investigation. A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed a member of the public had been bitten by a police dog. ‘The matter has been passed to the force’s Professional Standards Department who will investigate should a complaint be forthcoming,’ he said. The arrested man, 26, was wanted for a breach of a non-molestation order. He was later charged with theft, drug possession and breaching the order .","Mark Smith suffered injuries like those caused by shark attacks .

The Aurornis xui was roughly the same size as a chicken, was 20 inches in length and had tiny, triangular teeth. It was also covered almost head-to-toe in primitive feathers. Scientists from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels say the complete fossilised skeleton throws new light on the evolution of birds. A new flying dinosaur that lived about 150 million years ago has been dug up in China, which scientists say throws new light on the evolution of birds. The Aurornis xui was about the same size as a chicken, had tiny triangular teeth and was covered almost head-to-toe in primitive feathers . The chicken-sized Aurornis xui found in China is related to the earliest known flying bird, the Archaeopteryx. Both were avialans - dinosaur-birds that diverged millions of years ago from the theropods of land dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the velicoraptor . Archaeopteryx are the earliest known flying birds, thought to have been about the size of a modern-day magpie. They lived around 150 million years ago and developed flying abilities that are believed to have evolved from gliding out of trees. The first complete skeleton of an Archaeopteryx  was discovered in Jurassic limestone in Germany in 1861. Scientists said the fossils represented the transition between reptiles and birds. The Archaeopteryx forms the missing link, sharing sharp teeth and a long bony tail with small theropod dinosaurs, and a wishbone and feathers with the birds. Unearthed in at a quarry in Liaoning Province, near the North Korean border, it was closely related to the earliest known flying bird Archaeopteryx. Both were avialans - dinosaur-birds that diverged millions of years ago from the theropods that included Tyrannosaurus Rex and the velicoraptor of Jurassic Park fame. Discoveries of feathered theropods over the past 20 years have questioned whether Archaeopteryx was the archetypical bird-like dinosaur. Now the analysis into Aurornis, carried out by Dr Pascal Godefroit  of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels and his colleagues, puts Archaeopteryx back at the head of the tree of when dinosaurs turned into birds. Dr Godefroit said the results support a 'single origin of powered flight'. This means that all the dinosaurs which eventually became birds decided at a very similar time to take to the sky, while keeping some of their defensive and hunting features such as tiny teeth. These features were later lost as the birds developed further and no longer needed them while in the air. He added traces of soft feathers comprising a bundle of filaments joined together are preserved along a third of the tail, above the neck and around the chest. The fossilised skeleton of the Aurornis xui bird was found in a quarry in the Liaoning Province in China, near the North Korean border. Liaoning has proven a rich source of 'dino-birds' over the years with the discovery and naming of dozens of types of species in the region . The chicken-sized bird would also . have had longer feathers designed for flight rather than show - and help . it catch prey or escape predators - but these have not been preserved.

When some of these . creatures died they floated to the lake's bottom where they were . preserved by the silt or buried by sudden, deadly rains of volcanic ash. The Aurornis xui, left, was a similar size and shape to the modern-day chicken, right. It evolved from land dinosaur theropods including the velociraptor. It was 20 inches long and had tiny triangular teeth . Dr Goedfroit continued: 'This new comprehensive phylogeny, or evolutionary development, shows that point of origin avialans were already diversified in northern China during the Middle-Late Jurassic.' The study, published in the journal Nature, also places another family of small, upright, bi-pedal theropods called Troodontidae as a sister group to the avialans. Magpie-sized Archaeopteryx developed flying abilities that may have evolved from gliding out of trees or simply running along the ground. The first complete skeleton was discovered in Jurassic limestone in Germany in 1861 and is a very important fossil, almost certainly representing the transition between reptiles and birds.

With 17 whiplash accidents in eight years, Mohammed Saeed might have been considered the unluckiest motorist in Britain. But after hearing details of a recent compensation claim, a judge decided the 30-year-old may really be an unscrupulous fraudster riding the ‘crash for cash’ bandwagon. And in an unprecedented move, Judge Simon Brown QC ordered a perjury inquiry into the previous payout bids of the serial claimant and his gang, who may have made thousands of pounds from 23 ‘bogus’ accidents. Persistent claims: Saeed's claims were brought to light when a claim that he was in a car hit by a National Express coach (file picture), was challenged by the firm . Saeed and three other people alleged they were in a parked car in March 2011 when it was hit by a National Express bus. The motorist said he pulled the bus over several miles down the road and told the bemused driver he had damaged his vehicle. However, investigations revealed the damage to the car couldn’t have been done by the bus and National Express decided to challenge the compensation bid in court – a case that brought Saeed’s previous claims to light. At the hearing at Birmingham County Court, the address given for an orthopaedic surgeon who is said to have signed the driver’s medical report was revealed to be that of a taxi company. Saeed and his friends were found to be lying. Judge Brown said he ‘disbelieved the claimant’s evidence in its entirety’ and ruled that the bus ‘accident’ had never happened. The unemployed motorist was ordered to pay £15,700 towards the bus firm’s legal costs. At least two other people were in the process of claiming compensation for injuries they said they had suffered in the same incident. One of them was Saeed’s girlfriend Adele Raven, 27, who has made a total of three accident compensation bids in recent years. Crash for cash: Experts believe about £60 of a motorist¿s annual car insurance premium pays for losses in the industry caused by fake compensation claims (file picture) Judge Brown also ordered a transcript . of the hearing to be sent  to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a . view to a possible prosecution for perjury in relation to this and all . the previous accident claims. The judge said the investigation should include Saeed’s witnesses in the car, his solicitors and the medical expert. He . added that he ‘found it incredible’ that Saeed had filed yet another . whiplash compensation bid against another party since the bus crash . claim. The motorist began . his compensation requests in September 2003, sometimes claiming for . three separate whiplash accidents a  year – there were six bids in total . for 2010-11. Precedent: A judge at Birmingham County Court, pictured, ordered a perjury inquiry after Saeed's previous whiplash claims came to light . It is not . known whether the DPP or the police have begun a perjury investigation, . but National Express said it was willing to make a criminal complaint. Joanne Francis, solicitor for the bus company, promised to defend against ‘dishonest claims’ and ‘prosecute where necessary’. A National Express spokesman said the firm was ‘delighted’ with the result of the case, adding: ‘We always fight claims in which evidence raises serious concerns. ‘We hope this will make anyone thinking of making a dishonest claim think again.’ The scale of ‘crash for cash’ scams is driving up insurance premiums for innocent motorists. Experts believe about £60 of a motorist’s annual car insurance premium pays for losses in the industry caused by fake compensation claims. A gang in County Durham swindled so much money, car insurance firms raised bills in the area by about £100 a year. The 60 gang members were all either convicted of the estimated £3million fraud or admitted the crime during the past 18 months. Insurance experts recently told MPs that half of all whiplash claims from car crashes – an estimated £1billion a year – are fraudulent because symptoms are ‘too easy to fake’.

Smug: Richard Oliver, 25, of Jarrow, South Tyneside, is pictured after walking free from Newcastle Crown Court on Friday . When police and paramedics responded to a 999 call about a badly damaged minibus they appeared to have a serious emergency to deal with. Six ambulances took 13 men to hospital with what they claimed were serious injuries after they had ‘crashed’ on their way to a stag party. But the ‘accident’ was a brazen scam designed to fool the authorities and get £134,000 from a false insurance claim for whiplash injuries. The men faked their injuries and made a ‘dramatic recovery’ after arriving in hospital. Some had been put in neck braces for the journey to A&E where they were given ‘unnecessary’ neck and spine X-rays, a court heard. Police were suspicious as the group had no overnight bags or clothes for the weekend away  in Edinburgh – more than two hours’ drive from the crash scene in North Tyneside. And when paramedics initially approached the minibus, driver Robert Paul, 45, and his passengers seemed to be ‘quite well’. James Adkin, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendants were laughing, smoking and chatting on mobile phones. What followed was a domino effect as they began to hold their necks and say they had suffered injury.’ Despite being responsible for tying up NHS resources in a busy casualty unit, the gang walked free from Newcastle Crown Court on Friday with suspended jail sentences. Judge David Wood told them: ‘If there had been a serious accident in this area on that night in which people were genuinely hurt or dying, the emergency services would have been unable to help them because they would be dealing with you.’ During a break in their sentencing hearing some of the gang went  outside the court. One of them, Richard Oliver, 25, pulled out a  wad of notes and showed them off, knowing that he was being photographed. The ‘accident’ happened in August 2009. The ‘crash for cash’ gang weren’t arrested until December 2011 after Aviva had compiled a dossier  of evidence. Cash: Oliver's gang would have taken £134,000 between them from Aviva if they had pulled off the scheme . Investigators working for the insurer . discovered the minibus had been damaged elsewhere – probably by being . driven into a post – and debris spread at the ‘crash’ scene on a slip . road of the A193 near the Tyne Tunnel. The minibus was supposed to have . collided with a Peugeot car, but the car had never been at the crash . scene. Ben LeBlond, the Peugeot’s owner, was a . friend of the stag-do ‘groom’, Stephen Paul, 28, and came forward . claiming to have been driving it. His ‘passenger’, girlfriend Marnie . Simpson, 21, also made a fake whiplash claim. Community order: Miss Simpson had been under the pressure of her boyfriend, the court heard . The court heard the gang had lied to . paramedics, doctors and insurers in an attempt to ‘line their own . pockets’, but Aviva did not pay out any money. Mr Adkin said insurance investigators . discovered LeBlond was no stranger to the minibus group as he claimed . but friends on Facebook with many of them. Stephen and Robert Paul were given 12 month suspended jail terms and a £360 fine, and ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work. Oliver, Anthony Clark, 24, Jonathan . Aurey, 24, Anthony Ward, 23, John Seymour, 23 and Daniel Laidler, 26, . were given six-month suspended jail sentences and 150 hours of unpaid . work. Oliver and Ward were also fined £360.

Bill Pertee was known for his role as the air raid warden Hodges in the 1970s comedy Dad's Army . As stroppy air raid warden Mr Hodges, he was the scourge of Captain Mainwaring and his bumbling Home Guard platoon. Seldom did an episode of Dad’s Army go by without the officious character in the white tin hat trying to sabotage their efforts or ordering all and sundry to: ‘Put that light out!’ Yesterday the light went out for ever on Bill Pertwee, the actor who played Hodges as a man on the edge of hysteria during his frequent clashes with the Walmington-on-Sea troop in the church hall they were forced to share as a base. Pertwee, 86, appeared in 60 of the 80 episodes of the much-loved BBC comedy, which ran for nine series from 1968 to 1977 and is still being repeated now. His death means that the only surviving cast members are Ian Lavender, 67, who played ‘stupid boy’ Private Pike, and 81-year-old Frank Williams, who was the vicar the Rev Farthing. Pertwee had been ill over Christmas and was living in a residential home in Wadebridge, Cornwall. He was airlifted to hospital and died in the early hours of yesterday with his family at his bedside. Marion McLeod, his wife of 45 years, died on the same date in 2005. Pertwee became involved in showbusiness in 1954 by helping his cousin Jon Pertwee, who later starred in Doctor Who, when he was on tour performing a seaside variety show. Scroll down for video .

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 01:29 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 11 May 2013 . Paedophile: West Yorkshire Police insist there was no cover-up over Jimmy Savile's sex crimes . A police report clearing officers for failing to expose Jimmy Savile as a paedophile during his lifetime was yesterday dismissed by victims as a ‘cover-up and a bag of lies’. The cosy relationship between Savile and his local force involved regular Friday coffee morning chats with officers at his flat in Leeds, along with invitations to a VIP lunch with senior officers and to open a police station gymnasium. Despite police being contacted by Surrey colleagues in 2007 about a sexual abuse inquiry involving Savile, he was still used the following year to front two crime prevention campaigns in his home city. Savile even offered the use of his home to police controlling crowds at a Robbie Williams concert in a nearby park, the report revealed. The internal inquiry by West Yorkshire Police investigated alarming allegations about missed chances to expose the celebrity DJ over several decades. They included claims a police officer knew about rumours of Savile taking girls to a barge for parties during the 1960s and that the vice squad investigated Savile during the 1980s for indecent assaults on two girls as well as being aware of rumours he was a ‘pervert’. Savile himself recalled an incident in his personal diary of how a police officer visited his club in Leeds one night and spoke to him about a teenage girl ‘absconder’. If she turned up he promised to return the girl but ‘keep her all night first as a reward’. Savile wrote that he did take her to police the next day and implied  officers failed to challenge him because of his close relationship with the force. The report team could find ‘no records’ to back this account. Celebrity: Police used Savile's fame to promote their publicity campaigns even after accusations . The report concluded: ‘There is no . evidence that he was protected from arrest or prosecution for any . offences as a result of his relationship with WYP, or individual . friendships with officers.’ The review team ‘did find mistakes . were made in how WYP recorded and handled some intelligence relating to . Savile’, and added: ‘WYP has been unable to fully establish all the . facts.’ Although several matters have been . referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, several of . Savile’s victims condemned the  59-page report. A 52-year-old man, who was attacked . by Savile when he was a teenager, said: ‘There is clearly a cover-up . going on. 'The police knew what was happening and were protecting him at . the time. ‘The police are now running around . like headless chickens trying to appear as though they are acting on . these allegations but the fact of the matter is something should have . been done a long time ago. ‘I hope no one believes for a second what is published in that report. It’s a complete whitewash.’ A 56-year-old woman, who Savile tried . to rape at a party when she was 19, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned the . report is nothing more than a bag of lies. 'I find it impossible to . believe it wasn’t covered up by those he worked with and by the police.’ Alan Collins, a lawyer representing . 40 victims, accused police of having ‘collective myopia’ and said the . report ‘doesn’t add up’. Temporary West Yorkshire Assistant . Chief Constable Ingrid Lee admitted police had ‘let the victims down.’ She added: ‘The police are not infallible, the police are human beings.’ Host: Many officers attended coffee mornings at Savile's flat in Leeds, the report said . Nine of Jimmy Savile's West Yorkshire victims were under 10 at the time and one of them was only five. As part of today's report, West Yorkshire Police analysed the characteristics of the 68 victims who have come forward in the force area so far. These victims have reported 76 crimes between them, 72 of them taking place in Savile's home city of Leeds. The youngest victim was five and the eldest was 45. The report said nine victims were under 10; nine victims were 10 to 13 years old; 30 were aged 14 to 17; and 20 were adults. Of the 68 complainants, 49 were female and 19 were male. Most of the offending took place in the 1960s and 70s but two claims related to the 1950s and three were made in the 2000s. Of these offences, eight were alleged rapes. Four of these complainants were women but four were men. Other offences detailed by his victims have been recorded as sexual assault, sexual activity with a child, indecent exposure and common assault. Honour: Savile in 1996 after being knighted by the Queen for his broadcasting and charity work . Investigation: Ingrid Lee took charge of the review of Savile's relationship with West Yorkshire Police . Jimmy Savile's details were recorded as part of the hunt to find the Yorkshire Ripper, in the 1970s, but no evidence has been found that he was a 'person of interest' to the inquiry. Questions were raised about the broadcaster's relationship with the Ripper investigation last year when a retired senior officer claimed the disgraced DJ was a suspect in the notorious case more than 30 years ago. But today's report from West Yorkshire Police concluded it could find no evidence of this being true. The review found that many records have been destroyed, but detectives had found huge numbers of record cards with information about thousands of men who had been spoken to. The report said: 'Searches of the paperwork relating to the investigation have identified four index cards relating to Savile. They contain scant information and do not indicate whether Savile was a ""person of interest"" to the enquiry team. 'The information held was his name, date of birth, home address and various reference numbers. It was not possible to establish the relevance of the reference numbers as a large proportion of the investigation paperwork had been destroyed in the 1980s.' But the review said: 'One card does make reference to Savile offering his services as an intermediary for the police, should the ""Ripper"" wish to make contact.'","West Yorkshire Police report claims police did not protect Savile .

Fraudster: Businessman Guy Brudenell has been jailed for five years and four months at Teesside Crown Court after conning three business associates out of £1.24m . He lived in a country mansion with its own cricket pitch, travelled by private helicopter and enjoyed holidays in some of the world's most glamorous hotspots. But flamboyant businessman Guy Brudenell's seemingly limitless wealth was no more than a façade, a court heard today. When he hit hard times Brudenell conned three acquaintances out of £1.24 million to service mounting debts and pay for a £15,000 Swiss skiing holiday and a trip to St Tropez. His empire eventually collapsed around him as he declared himself bankrupt with £21million debts in 2009. Today Brudenell, 43, was jailed for five years and four months after pleading guilty to fraud and perjury at Teesside Crown Court. Prosecutor Nicholas Dry told how Brudenell's 'financial gymnastics' in 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' led to him swindling business colleagues who believed he was a highly successful tycoon. Her persuaded them to part with £600,000, £400,000 and £240,000 with the promise of quick profits on deals to buy repossessed houses. Brudenell told one victim in an email: 'I have yet to get a business deal wrong. I have a 100 per cent record for integrity and honesty. My word is my bond.' As a respected figure in North Yorkshire high society, with interests in two leading hotels and a successful business past, no one doubted him until it was too late. Although he angered neighbours by landing his helicopter in the garden, Brudenell cultivated his respectable image shamelessly. He was photographed at Royal Ascot and even persuaded the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu to take part in a charity parachute jump with him. Behind the scenes he was using 'ever more desperate, and ultimately criminal, measures in his bid to stay afloat,' said Mr Dry. Guy Brudenell, pictured with left his ex-wife Pennita Wilshire at Royal Ascot in 2005 and right at their home Kirkdale Lodge in North Yorkshire, which he was forced to sell for £1.3m, pleaded guilty to fraud and perjury . Luxury lifestyle: The former home of Guy Brudenell, Kirkdale Lodge in Nawton near Helmsley, North Yorkshire, which he put up for sale in after declaring himself bankrupt in 2009 . Brudenell sent fraudulent emails and faked bank statements to convince his victims he would repay them and repeatedly sent cheques that failed to clear. Mr Dry told the court: 'He was a friend and acquaintance of many wealthy individuals with whom he would hunt, shoot and generally socialise. 'He lived a high life with beautiful homes, cars, expensive holidays and a helicopter, but by 2008 all of that had become something of a facade behind which lay a reality of spiralling debt and unsustainable borrowing.' Brudenell was forced to put his £1.3m home in Nawton, North Yorkshire, on the market. His 2005 marriage to wife Pennita - who arrived at their wedding in a Cinderella-style glass carriage - ended in divorce. Lavish: Guy Brudenell, whose former Kirkdale Lodge home boasted a full size cricket pitch and village style pavillion, swindled his business colleagues who thought he was a successful tycoon . And soon police were probing his financial affairs. One of his victims went to police who uncovered a 'web of lies, deception and fraud.' Passing sentence, Judge Howard Crowson branded Brudenell 'selfish' and told him: 'Your intention was to continue your luxurious life by reason of this fraud.' Looking tanned and dressed in a pin-striped suit and open-necked shirt, Brudenell sat with his head bowed throughout the majority of the proceedings. Alasdair Campbell, defending, said Brudenell planned to repay his investors, but suffered badly with the credit crunch. Outside court Detective Inspector Ian Wills of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'Brudenell blatantly abused the trust of his friends. He was a persistent liar whose deception was compounded by fraudulently altering official documents and lying during legal proceedings in a feeble attempt to delay repayment of the loans and avoid exposure.'

"By . Mark Duell, Graham Smith and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 23:28 EST, 24 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 25 October 2012 . Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has insisted the New York Times public editor is ‘completely correct’ to question whether he is fit to be her new boss following the Jimmy Savile scandal. Mr Thompson, who will start as the newspaper’s chief executive next month on an estimated £3million a year with bonuses, spoke out after Margaret Sullivan questioned his integrity and ability in the wake of outrage against the corporation. But apparent contradictions in his account of what he knew about Savile's abuse while he ran the corporation have emerged today. Thompson - who left his BBC post last month - said in an interview with The Times today he had 'formed the impression' last year that Newsnight was probing widespread sexual abuse by the DJ. But ten days ago in the New York Times he claimed he 'never heard any allegations' about Savile when director general. New job: Former BBC director Mark Thompson (left) has been under fire over the Jimmy Savile (right) scandal . In today's revelations the 55-year-old admitted he first heard about the probe from BBC foreign correspondent Caroline Hawley last Christmas, who told him: ‘You must be really concerned about Newsnight's investigation into Jimmy Savile. Is there in issue about an investigation on Newsnight about child abuse?' Mr Thompson, who is set to start his new . job on November 12, then spoke to an unnamed senior executive at the corporation before approaching BBC head of news Helen Boaden who then . told him he should not be concerned by Newsnight's investigation into . Savile and that it was dropped for journalistic reasons. 'By this stage I think it is clear to me that it's allegations which relate to sexual abuse of some kind,' he told The Times. 'So, at this point, I think I have formed the impression and I'm aware that they have been looking at allegations of abuse of some kind related to Jimmy Savile. But crucially I'm told that the normal editorial process has taken place and Newsnight has decided not to proceed with the investigation.' After the interview Thompson's spokesman Ed Williams spoke to the paper about the apparent contradiction. Mr Williams claimed Thompson had been 'speculating' nearly a year on about a general impression he may have formed at the time. Talking about scrutiny from his future employer, he told the Guardian it . was ‘totally reasonable for institutions like the New York Times and . the BBC to be free to examine everything, including subjects of . corporate interest in the institution itself’. Mr Thompson also said he was unaware if the allegations were sexual at the time, but was concerned by the limited details he received from the reporter and promptly tried to find out more. However, he said that after speaking to Miss Boaden, he didn’t need to take any further action as he believed her - and, regardless, ‘nobody said there was an allegation of sex abuse on BBC premises’. At conference: In a blog post on Tuesday, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself, said: 'How likely is it that (Thompson) knew nothing?' Mr Thompson said that he would have . done something if those allegations had been raised. Then he missed . press cuttings in January and February that referred to the Newsnight . probe being axed. 'I don't think there is anything in the account I have set out and what I did which would in any way affect my ability to discharge my duties as chief executive and president of the New York Times company,' he said. 'His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly' Margaret Sullivan, New York Times public editor . His comments came after Mrs Sullivan . questioned the man who was BBC director general when the report that . would have exposed Savile as a predator who targeted young, vulnerable . girls, was cancelled. In a blog post on Tuesday, the public editor, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself, said: 'How likely is it that (Thompson) knew nothing? 'His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly.  It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.' Worries: Mr Thompson said he first heard about the probe from BBC journalist Caroline Hawley (pictured), whom he said told him: 'You must be really concerned about Newsnight's investigation into Jimmy Savile' Scandal has engulfed the BBC after an . ITV documentary accused Savile of being a paedophile who had abused . hundreds of young victims in hospitals, schools and even on the . corporation's premises. But . even as the documentary went out, it emerged that Newsnight had carried . out its own investigation - including an interview with the same victim - . nearly a year before. A . team spent six weeks probing allegations that the presenter abused . pupils at a school in Surrey, speaking to at least four women who . claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events. The . report was shelved at the last minute at the request of the programme's . editor Peter Rippon. It was not until this week that the BBC aired its . own investigation into the scandal, on Panorama. Discussions: Mr Thompson said it was BBC head of news Helen Boaden (pictured) who told him he should not be concerned by Newsnight's investigation into Savile . It covered both Savile's crimes and . the Corporation's reaction. Mr Rippon stood aside from his role at . Newsnight after the BBC said his explanation for shelving the story was . 'inaccurate or incomplete'. Earlier this week new BBC director general George Entwistle was grilled by MPs in parliament. He denied that the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that Savile preyed on women. The BBC has now launched two inquiries into the affair. One will address Savile's actions and how he went undetected during his career. A second will examine why the Newsnight report was pulled. Meanwhile pressure grew on his predecessor Mr Thompson, who left his £622,000 post at the BBC earlier this year. One Wall Street analyst called for the paper to delay him taking over the company. 'It seems to me he will have to attend a hearing in the UK parliament,' Evercore Partners analyst Doug Arthur said. 'That is going to be a distraction. It's unfortunate. It's an unexpected complication.' Influential: The front cover of the New York Times on October 24, with President Barack Obama pictured . Public Editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in her blog: . 'How . likely is it that he knew nothing? A director general of a giant media . company is something like a newspaper’s publisher... publishers usually . don’t know about editorial decisions — unless they are very big ones, . fraught with legal implications. 'His integrity and . decision-making are bound to affect The Times and its journalism — . profoundly.

'What . are the implications of these problems for him as incoming Times chief . executive? What are the implications for the Times Company to have its . new C.E.O. – who needs to deal with many tough business challenges here – . arriving with so much unwanted baggage?' Mrs Sullivan declined to comment further on her blog as did the New York Times. As public editor and a representative of readers, she writes about issues affecting the newspaper independent from New York Times management, including chairman and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr and executive editor Jill Abramson. Since stepping into the role in September, Mrs Sullivan has already made waves including a post that criticised the paper's decision not to publish on the front page a story about a congressional hearing into attacks on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, last month in which four Americans were killed.","Former BBC director general starts as New York Times chief executive next month .

Wealthy ‘ladies who lunch’ in Britain’s most prosperous areas drink more alcohol than any other social group, research has found. Women in Knightsbridge and Hampstead in London, Esher in Surrey and Merchiston in Edinburgh are twice as likely as average to exceed a recommended limit of three units a day. Two-thirds (66 per cent) of women in such areas – where  multi-million-pound homes and six-figure salaries are common – drink more than the limit, compared with 28.9 per cent nationally. Nearly two-thirds of women in rich areas drink more than three units of alcohol a day . Women in wealthy areas such as London's Knightsbridge are also more likely to suffer from mental health problems . Experts warned the figures add to growing fears of a ‘silent epidemic’ of middle-class drinking. Men and women in these areas were . twice as likely to suffer from anxiety or nerves, at 6.5 per cent rather . than 2.9 per cent nationally. The study identified a ‘footballers’ wives’ effect in areas such as Totteridge, north London, Heswall in the . Wirral and Hale Barns in Altrincham, all of which are known to attract . wealthy footballers. While men were slightly more likely to drink too much, women were much more affected, with four in ten over-indulging. Patrick Tate of CACI, which wrote the . report, said: ‘Women in these areas have lavish lifestyles, but without . the need to work, and are extremely socially active. 'It is the classic . group of ladies who lunch.’ Lyn Brierley-Jones, research  fellow . at the University of Sunderland’s department of pharmacy, health and . wellbeing, said affluent drinkers could conceal problems. She said: ‘Middle-class drinkers may . be disadvantaged by their advantage – in other words, aspects of their . lifestyle known to promote health, such as low-fat diets and exercise, . mask symptoms related to alcohol problems. 'Our research shows a common . perception among some middle-class groups that regularly drinking at . home, particularly wine, is safe and sensible. ‘Evidence suggests such regular drinking will lead to significant health problems later in life.’ The Government advises men not to . regularly exceed 3-4 units of alcohol per day (equivalent to a pint and a . half of 4 per cent beer), or 2-3 units of alcohol for women (one 175ml . glass of wine). Research suggests middle-class professionals drink more as a way of coping with stress. They regard a glass or two of wine or the odd tipple as a necessary ‘reward’ after a long day at work or looking after children. But many are oblivious to how small, regular amounts can cause long-term problems including liver damage and certain cancers. Women in wealthy areas who drink above the daily limit . Earlier this year, the British Liver . Trust warned that rising numbers of ‘everyday drinkers’ – including . middle-class adults – were being admitted to hospital with . alcohol-related illness. Charity 4Children last year said that . parents need to be warned about how drinking can affect their parenting . in the same way that mothers are advised about the impact of alcohol . during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Chief executive Anne Longfield said: . ‘Drinking can seriously dent people’s judgement and the way they engage . with their children.’ A £25million programme is to tackle alcohol misuse among older people. In . the past five years, drink-related hospital admissions for the over-65s . have increased by 62 per cent, more than the number of cases in 16 to . 24-year-olds. Those . aged 55 to 74 have the highest number of deaths linked to alcohol. The . over-65s drink for six or seven days a week, more than any other age . group. Reactions to alcohol get slower and the liver less efficient at breaking down alcohol with age. Peter Ainsworth of the Big Lottery Fund told the Observer: 'Most older people drink moderately. '[But] . a silent story is evolving among older people as they experience . life-changing events such as retirement, redundancy or bereavement.' One . woman, 72-year-old Ann, told the paper: 'We always enjoyed nice wine, . and when the girls moved on we'd open a bottle most evenings.' She said her husband's death, where she was too drunk to understand what she was being told, prompted her to get help. The Big Lottery Fund is investing in the Rethink Good Health programme to set up 15 to 20 centres across the UK. A . recent report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists said that about a . third of elderly people with drink problems did not abuse alcohol when . they were younger.","66 per cent of women in affluent areas drink more than three units a day .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 03:34 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:40 EST, 5 June 2013 . Victims of crime are to be given the power to appeal against decisions not to charge suspects. Top prosecutor Keir Starmer said victims are treated as ‘bystanders’ in the justice system with little say about what happens in their cases. A new Victims' Right to Review will cover any decision taken by the Crown Prosecution not to press charges, potentially affecting up to 75,000 cases every year. Bystanders: Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said too many victims felt they had only a 'walk-on part' in their cases . It will mean any victim of crime, including bereaved family members or other representatives, will be able to ask the CPS to look again at a case following a decision not to charge, to discontinue proceedings or offer no evidence. Mr Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said a ‘realistic prospect of conviction test’ would ensure the new measures did not tie up the criminal justice system in extensive reviews. ‘This is big step forward for victims, for many years they’ve been treated as bystanders in the criminal justice process with a sort of with a walk on part if their case goes ahead,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘This is about giving them greater confidence in the decision that starts the process in the first place. ‘If we take a decision not to prosecute then that’s very significant from a victim’s perspective and this new initiative enables them to say to the Crown Prosecution Service “I’d like that decision reviewed”.’ Around 75,000 cases do not proceed every year, but Mr Starmer said that in many of those the victim will ‘readily accept the decision not to prosecute, they may have even indicated beforehand they don’t want to support it’. Around 1,600 people complain each year at . present about a decision not to press charges, and the CPS would expect . this number to rise when the right to review is introduced. Challenge: Victims will be able to demand a review of decisions by prosecutors not to press charges against suspects in their case . The plans, which have been put out to consultation, come after a Court of Appeal ruling involving a case in which the CPS decided in 2007 not to bring sexual assault charges. The decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal and in 2011 disabled man Christopher Killick was jailed for three and a half years for sexually abusing two fellow cerebral palsy sufferers. Intimidated: Justice minister Helen Grant said the criminal justice system makes victims' 'already horrific experiences worse' The court stated ‘as a decision not to prosecute is in reality a final decision for a victim, there must be a right to seek a review of such a decision’. Victims' Commissioner Baroness Helen Newlove backed the move, but vowed to challenge any 'shortcomings' in the way it works. She said: 'On my appointment I was keen to work with Mr Starmer, victims and families of those who have suffered the loss of loved one's to put right this injustice. 'I am pleased that Mr Starmer has listened to the representations I have made on their behalf and today is a positive step forward for victims and their families.' Javed Khan, chief executive of independent charity Victim Support, said: ‘The Right to Review strengthens the rights of victims during the criminal justice process and is welcomed by Victim Support. ‘Too often victims tell us that they don't have much of a voice in our justice system. This new initiative by the Crown Prosecution Service is a step in the right direction and will help to re-position victims back at the heart of our justice system.’ The CPS only allows prosecutions to begin or continue if there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to prosecute. Decisions not to charge or stop a prosecution on either ground will be open to review. VRR does not apply to cases where the police have decided to take no further action and a file of evidence has not been submitted to the CPS. Victims' Minister Helen Grant said: ‘Too often victims feel intimidated and treated as an afterthought by a 'system' that makes their already horrific experiences worse - the Victims' Right to Review is an important step towards changing this. ‘All victims deserve to know that the Criminal Justice System will work as hard as possible to deliver justice for them and help them recover and move on with their lives. ‘That's why if a victim has the strength to come forward, it is right that we give them every possible chance to get the justice they so deserve.’","New right of review will allow victims to question prosecutors' decisions .

But whatever you call them new research shows they don’t just make you look old, but wrinkles make you look angrier as well. Researchers found that signs of ageing like wrinkles around the eye and a furrowed brow can change the way people interpret your emotions to think that you are sad or angry even if you are not. Signs of ageing can change the way people interpret your emotions to think you are sad or angry when you are not . The study found that stereotypes about older people could be to blame for the results, reinforced by TV shows such as One Foot in the Grave, featuring the grumpy — and wrinkly — pensioner Victor Meldrew. The US researchers asked test participants to look at 64 faces and rate their emotional state. Despite all the faces being neutral, participants thought that the older looking people also looked less happy than the younger ones. To confirm their finding researchers did a follow-up study which had similar results. Participants were asked to look at images of people who had been trained to make clear expressions of sadness, happiness and anger. They then rated the sad expressions on the older faces as more intense than the younger ones. Stereotypes about older people could be to blame for the results, reinforced by TV shows such as One Foot in the Grave, featuring Victor Meldrew . Researchers also found that there was no . link between the level of sadness or anger participants though older . adults experienced in real life and their ratings of the faces. Carlos Garrido,lead researcher at Penn State University, said that wrinkles in different places on the face caused emotions to be misread differently. Wrinkles at the side of the face may cause the mouth to droop, which could look sad whereas a wrinkled forehead could also make people think that somebody is frowning even when they do not believe they are making any expression. Mr Garrido suggested that this could affect how older patients are treated when they see their doctor, as GPs may mistakenly think they in more pain than they are. It may also affect how grumpy their families think they are as well.","Research found signs of ageing makes people think you are angry or sad when you are not .

Boys with ADHD are more likely to grow up to be obese adults than those who do not have the condition . Boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are more likely to grow up to be obese adults than those who do not have the condition, a new study suggests. Researchers surveyed two groups of 41-year-old men and found those with a history of ADHD were 19 pounds heavier than their non-ADHD counterparts, on average. ‘There's definitely been enough research now where it does appear there is some connection between these two disorders,’ said Dr Sherry Pagoto, who has studied ADHD and obesity at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Data for the new study came from 207 white boys with ADHD in the U.S. who were referred to a research clinic at around age eight and followed as they grew up. Ten years later another group of teenage boys without ADHD, who were otherwise similar to the original participants, were added to the study. By the time they were asked to report their weight at age 41, 111 men from each group were still in the study. Men with a history of ADHD reported weighing 213 pounds, on average, and 41 per cent of them were obese. In comparison, men without ADHD weighed in at an average of 194 pounds, and 22 per cent qualified as obese, Dr Xavier Castellanos from the Child Study Centre at NYU Langone Medical Centre in New York said. ‘As we learn more about the regions of the brain that may be implicated in obesity, they overlap with brain regions implicated in ADHD,’ Dr Castellanos told Reuters Health. ‘The reward system seems to be relevant to both conditions.’ He added: ‘There is the speculation that the obesity is at least partly reflecting some of the impulsiveness, poor planning and the difficulty in making choices that come with ADHD.’ Dr Pagoto, who was not involved in the new research, agreed that young people with the disorder could be more impulsive when it comes to their food choices and may also spend more time in front of screens than their peers. Men with a history of ADHD are 19 pounds heavier than their non-ADHD counterparts, on average . ‘Parents of children who have ADHD should pay special attention to how that child's weight is changing over time, knowing that they may be at greater risk for becoming obese,’ she said. If they're at higher risk of obesity, that may bring other things with it, such as type 2 diabetes, she added. Contrary to the team's hypothesis, it was found that men who no longer had their childhood ADHD symptoms were especially likely to be obese. Dr Pagoto agreed that finding was unexpected and said the study may simply have been too small to tease out reliable differences among adults with a history of ADHD. According to the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, one in ten children and teenagers in the U.S. has been diagnosed with ADHD. Boys are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed as girls. Dr Castellanos recommended parents of children with ADHD make sure their children are getting enough exercise and help them cut back on sugary drinks and other high calorie foods.","Men with a history of ADHD weigh an average of 19lb more than those who have never had the condition .

Thousands of new cases of kidney stones every year are caused by ignorance or denial of the need to drink three litres of water a day, according to a leading doctor. Bhaskar Somani, a consultant urological surgeon at Southampton General Hospital, said a lack of awareness about the dangers of dehydration was responsible for an annual increase in renal stone admissions, including among young people in their twenties. 'The number of people admitted to hospital suffering severe pain and discomfort due to kidney stones is increasing by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent every year,' he said. The British population's ignorance of the need to drink three litres of water a day is leading to more cases of kidney stones, says a leading doctor . 'Over the past decade, the number of hospital admissions for renal stones in the UK rose by 63 per cent to more than 80,000 and there is no sign of these numbers letting up.' Kidney stones develop when crystals of salt gather into lumps and are not flushed out of the body due to a lack of adequate hydration, often lodging in the urinary system's tubes. They can cause severe abdominal and groin pain which, in many cases, can only be corrected through surgery. The condition affects about 10 to 20 . per cent of men and 3 to 5 per cent of women . between the ages of 30 and 60. At Southampton General Hospital, the number of patients admitted to hospital every month has almost doubled - a trend Mr Somani said would continue without intervention. 'The only way to drive this down is to drive home the message that healthy lifestyle, diet and fluid intake is the best way to prevent the development and recurrence of stones,' he said. The condition affects around 10 to 20 per cent of men and 3 to 5 per cent of women between the ages of 30 and 60 . 'With evidence that 50 per cent of patients treated are likely to have a recurrence within ten years, largely due to complacency around hydration within a few years of having surgery, we know we face an uphill battle to change the national mindset, but we must make a start.' Mr Somani said all adults should aim to drink between two to three litres of water a day, while former stone patients should maintain a daily intake upwards of three litres to avoid recurrence. He has also called for the introduction of a screening programme for all high risk patients - those with diabetes, gout or inflammatory bowel disease - and regular monitoring of people who suffered their first incidence of stones under the age of 25.","Dehydration leading to 5 to 10 per cent annual increase .

Thousands more GPs and casualty ward doctors will be recruited over the next five years to solve the crisis in emergency and out-of-hours care, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will announce today. An extra 2,000 family doctors by 2018 will aim to encourage people with chronic conditions to head to local surgeries rather than overstretched hospitals, he will say. A new NHS training body will also be ordered to sign up an unspecified number of A&E doctors. And in a move to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust scandal – where 1,200 people died through neglect – Mr Hunt will demand that half of all student nurses will undergo community training to revive the traditional caring ‘values’ of the NHS. The plans are included in a ‘mandate’ issued to Health Education England (HEE), a new quango with a budget of £5billion a year to train NHS staff. At the moment just 40 per cent of the 6,500 student doctors each year go on to be GPs. HEE will be charged with lifting that number to 50 per cent, increasing the number of community doctors by 400 a year to 3,250. At least half of the 17,000 student nurses each year will be expected to undertake community placements by March 2015. Ministers hope it will encourage more trainees to take jobs outside hospitals and help keep patients away from overcrowded wards. They will also spend a year working as health care assistants to improve basic caring skills and will receive training in dementia care. In a foreword to the document, Mr Hunt wrote: ‘The terrible events at Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust reinforces the need to recruit NHS and public health staff with the right values. ‘Effective and high quality education and training must ensure that NHS staff are available in the right numbers with the right skills, values and competencies to deliver both excellent clinical outcomes together with patient-centred care. Winning back trust: The move by the Health Secretary to hire thousands new family doctors is meant to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust scandal . ‘Our NHS must become increasingly responsive to the patient and public need to deliver more care in the community and in people’s homes – in particular, to better support patients, and their families, with long term conditions and disabilities such as diabetes and dementia.’ A health department source said its . five-year blueprint will tackle ‘historical shortages’ in emergency care . doctors amid growing fears that casualty units are at crisis point. 'The events at Mid-Staffordshire reinforces the need to recruit NHS and public health staff with the right values.'- Jeremy Hunt . Up to 100 patients a day – 37,000 in 2012 – are being forced to wait more than an hour in ambulance ‘jams’ outside overcrowded A&E units, with delays of up to four hours at some hospitals. And health bosses say there is growing evidence that up to a third of older patients need not be on the wards. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter added that the changes  would ensure those with long-term needs spent ‘less time in hospital and more time being treated at home’. ‘It is essential that we have the right staff to meet these changing needs, to ensure that we have set ambitious but achievable targets to make sure the NHS has a workforce fit for the future to deliver the highest quality of care to patients,’  he said.","Health Secretary to announce five-year recruitment drive of doctors .

Historian Yuri Felshtinsky, who has . known Mr Berezovsky since 1998, said: ‘We do not have facts yet but we . must bear in mind that there have been several questionable deaths of .

Lord Bell said such a . suggestion was ‘nonsense’ and the oligarch remained as much as ever a . target of the Russian state. Mr Berezovsky, a former mathematician . who had made his fortune in oil, aviation and television in the . immediate aftermath of the fall of communism, fled Russia in 2000 and . was put on the country’s official wanted list in 2001 on charges of . fraud and money laundering.

Nick Clegg launched an extraordinary attack on the media yesterday for exposing the Lord Rennard scandal. The Deputy Prime Minister accused journalists investigating a cover-up of being ‘self-appointed detectives’. His ill-judged remarks shocked Tory and Labour MPs, who said he should focus on getting to the truth. Ill-judged: Nick Clegg (left) launched an attack on journalists for exposing the Lord Rennard scandal. Alison Smith (right), a former Lib Dem activist, went public with groping claims against Lord Rennard . And Alison Smith, a former Liberal Democrat activist who went public with groping claims against Lord Rennard last week, said Mr Clegg was wrong to attack a ‘free press regarded by most as important in a democracy’. In another twist, the Mail has learnt that senior Lib Dems were attempting to silence whistleblowers only this week. On Monday, Lord Stoneham, who was the party’s director of operations at the height of the claims against Lord Rennard, made an ‘aggressive’ telephone call to a former party activist who claimed she saw the peer molesting a young woman a decade ago. He was apparently furious she had contacted this newspaper to complain that her allegations had been swept under the carpet. On another black day for the Lib Dems: . The affair started when former Lib Dem activists went public with claims of sexual harassment against Lord Rennard, who retired as the party’s chief executive in 2009 – ostensibly on health grounds. After initially denying he knew about the claims until shortly before three women made allegations on Channel 4 News, Mr Clegg admitted he had asked his then chief of staff Danny Alexander to probe ‘non-specific concerns’ about Lord Rennard in 2008. It has since emerged that Mr Clegg’s office failed to act on specific and detailed allegations of misconduct by the peer made in 2010. Sandra Gidley, the ex-frontbencher who raised her concerns with him, said: ‘I spoke to Nick Clegg about general concerns. I didn’t know of any specific incidents and neither did he.’ Peers: Lord Ben Stoneham introduced to the Lords (left) standing next to Lord Rennard (right) A spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Sandra Gidley did raise general concerns with Nick Clegg about Lord Rennard’s conduct. She did not know of or raise specific allegations. As Nick Clegg has said, he was aware of general concerns which were acted upon by his then chief of staff Danny Alexander.’ Yesterday Mr Clegg, speaking outside his south-west London home, called for detectives who are now reviewing the claims to be allowed to do their job. He said: ‘I understand there are many people who appear to want to act as self-appointed detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years ago. 'But the only way that we are going to get to the bottom of the truth, the only way we are going to ensure that the women whose allegations were broadcast on television last week are properly listened to, the only way were are going to establish exactly what happened and who knew what and when, is by allowing the two investigations that I established immediately after the Channel 4 broadcast to do their job and, indeed, to allow the police, whom we have now approached, to do their job as well. 'And in the meantime I cannot – and my party cannot – provide a running commentary on every shred of speculation about events which happened many years ago.’ His intervention drew a stinging response from Miss Smith, who wrote on Twitter: ‘Clegg slams “self-appointed detectives”, otherwise known as the free press. Regarded by most as important in a democracy.’ She added: ‘They covered up a massive scandal, and now they don’t want people asking questions.’ She also dismissed the idea that the allegations had been timed to damage the party leadership ahead of a crucial by-election in Eastleigh, which will take place tomorrow. Toward the end of last year, she and some of the other alleged victims of Lord Rennard’s unwanted advances agreed to go public with their story, and told the party at the end of last month that they had done so. Therese Coffey, a Tory MP and member of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘It is only through the power of the free press and TV that these allegations have come to light. Instead of trying to divert attention by blaming journalists, Nick Clegg should be focusing on getting to the unvarnished truth.’ Conor Burns, another Tory MP, said: ‘Only someone with the genius of Nick Clegg could have a sex scandal that doesn’t involve sex and turn it into a leadership crisis. Mr Clegg would have to answer fewer questions from the press if he put out a statement that he could stick to about what he knew and when.’ Labour MP John Mann, who wrote to police asking them to investigate, claimed Mr Clegg treated the Rennard accusations as an issue of ‘political management’. ‘The real issue is why didn’t Clegg and the Liberals do the appropriate thing in dealing with this as serious allegation, rather than as political management,’ he said. Mr Clegg’s aides insisted he had not been attacking broadcasters in his remarks but rather Conservative-supporting newspapers he believes are revelling in the scandal. At least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by Lord Rennard . Lord Rennard yesterday dramatically denied Nick Clegg’s claim that he had been confronted about sexual harassment allegations. As yet more senior party figures were dragged into the scandal, the peer at the centre of the claims categorically denied anyone had spoken to him about his conduct. But Mr Clegg’s office insists Cabinet minister Danny Alexander confronted Lord Rennard about rumours of unwanted advances to women Lib Dem activists in 2008. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Clegg said that Mr Alexander had ‘put these concerns to Chris Rennard and warned him that any such behaviour was wholly unacceptable’. But a spokesman for Lord Rennard insisted: ‘In 27 years of working for the Liberal Democrats he received no complaint or allegation about his behaviour. Nor is he aware of any personal complaints being made in the three and a half years since he stood down as chief executive until last week.’ In an indication that the key players in the affair are beginning to turn against each other, sources close to Mr Clegg insisted Lord Rennard’s meeting with Mr Alexander ‘categorically did happen’. One said: ‘He raised the concerns that had been passed to him, that were non-specific, about Chris’s behaviour. Chris denied them.’ The Deputy Prime Minister’s aides also suggested for the first time that the peer did not stand down solely for health reasons in 2009, as was publicly stated, but after pressure from Mr Clegg’s office. ‘We did act,’ said one. ‘Chris Rennard was spoken to, then in 2009 he was ill and he stood down. The timeline speaks for itself.’ In his statement Lord Rennard’s spokesman said he ‘refuted the allegations’ that he had behaved inappropriately with as many as ten female activists. The spokesman added: ‘He has been notified of an internal investigatory panel within the party. ‘The matter must now be regarded as sub judice pending its proceedings and no further statement will be issued in the interim. He expects others to respect the sub judice principle, and he notes that under the party rules concerned it is for any case made against him to be proved by evidence to the requisite standard. He denies impropriety.’ Former Liberal Democrat  leader Lord Ashdown suggested yesterday he and colleagues had ‘all picked up the rumours’ about Lord Rennard ‘some time before’ women went public with allegations of sexual harassment last week. But he insisted he did not hear any speculation about the peer’s conduct while he was leader. And although one of the victims claimed allegations against Lord Rennard dated back as far as 2001, Charles Kennedy, who was party leader at the time, insisted he had never heard anything about them.","Ill-judged remarks have shocked Tory and Labour MPs .

The former Tory MP, who chairs the London 2012 organising committee, called for competitive sport to be promoted more in schools to help combat childhood obesity. He urged politicians to capitalise on the success of the Games and demanded more focus on sport in primary schools. Legacy: Lord Coe, pictured at the offices of the London 2012 organising committee, has called for more focus on sport in schools after the Olympics . 'It is very important that we recognise that has to be underpinned by good quality physical education and by getting people into patterns of exercise,' Lord Coe told the Guardian. 'We have to recognise that we are probably going to be the first generation of parents that are marginally fitter than our kids.' Central to London's successful bid to host the Olympics was a promise by organisers that the Games would inspire the nation's young people to become more involved in sport. Lord Coe, who won Olympic gold medals in 1980 and 1984, said he was convinced that the Games had lived up to expectations. But he urged politicians not to let a debate over the post-Games legacy to descend into political point scoring. Weighty issue: Lord Coe said the current generation of parents was likely to be the first to be fitter than their children . The shadow Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, has called for a cross-party consensus on the best way to maximise the positive impact of the Olympics.

"Report today criticised Tyne and Wear health chiefs . By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 13:30 EST, 28 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:51 EST, 28 May 2013 . Killed: Mental health worker Ashleigh Ewing, 22, was savagely stabbed to death by paranoid schizophrenic Ronald Dixon. A report today said she should not have visited him alone . A mental health worker killed after being savagely stabbed 39 times by a paranoid schizophrenic in his own home should not have visited him alone, a damning report has concluded. Ronald Dixon broke three knives  during the frenzied attack on 22-year-old graduate Ashleigh Ewing after she had gone to his home in Newcastle to deliver a letter telling him he was in debt. An investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death has today heavily criticised health chiefs from Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and said that Dixon should not have been managed in the community. Dixon, described in the report as a loner, had a history of mental illness and had previously attacked his parents with a hammer while they were in bed. The report, commissioned by the North East Strategic Health Authority, outlined how by 2006 when the stabbing took place, he was in relapse and had disengaged from services. But in spite of this, on May 19, 2006, psychology graduate Ms Ewing, who worked for housing support charity Mental Health Matters, was sent by herself to his home with a letter telling him he was in debt. Within 15 minutes of her walking through the door a neighbour heard screams and shouts of 'get off’ and 'stop it'. A minute-long 'hysterical screech' was then heard, before Dixon changed his bloodied clothes, showered and with his dogs walked to a police station and said he had murdered someone. The report said: 'It is the view of the panel that if a robust risk assessment had been completed including a consideration of the lone working policy with P [Dixon], such lone working would have been abandoned and joint visits implemented. 'Thus, it must follow, that A [Ewing] would not have been attending P’s [Dixon’s] house on her own on 19 May 2006.' Brutal: Ronald Dixon, left, stabbed Ashleigh Ewing, right, 39 times and broke three knives during the attack after she had gone to his home to deliver a letter from her employers . It describes the letter she had with her as 'provocative' and said that it was 'entirely inappropriate' for her to have delivered it to him. It also says there was 'a misplaced but substantial over reliance upon Mental Health Matters’ staff' by clinicians from the Trust. It says: 'The reliance on Mental Health Matters staff to report on P [Dixon] led to a situation where P’s mental state was never properly established or assessed on a regular basis. 'It was, in our view, wholly inappropriate to rely upon Mental Health Matters as the conduit for reporting on P’s [Dixon’s] mental state and clinical signs.' While the panel found that 'it is impossible to conclude with absolute certainty that the vicious attack could have been predicted or avoided', they do say he should have previously been detained under the Mental Health Act. Horrific: Ronald Dixon killed the 22-year-old in May 2006 when she attended his home in Heaton, Newcastle, pictured, for a support visit, as part of her work for the charity Mental Health Matters . They also conclude that throughout the . period in question a 'light approach' had been taken towards Dixon’s . care, but his condition 'demanded a more robust intervention'. In October 2007 Dixon pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric unit. Mental Health Matters have also previously admitted health and safety breaches and been fined £30,000. A statement by the Trust said: 'We welcome the publication of this report, we accept its findings and we apologise for the shortcomings identified in it. 'We particularly extend our condolences to the family and friends of Ashleigh Ewing. This was a shocking and tragic incident which provides lessons for all the agencies involved and for the wider health and social care systems. 'It is important to remember that this tragic death occurred over seven years ago and much has changed since then. 'We would also like to reassure Ashleigh’s family and the public that since these tragic events, the trust has rigorously and continually improved the areas of care that have been found by this report to fall short of good practice.' A statement from Mental Health Matters said they acknowledged there had been failings in its procedures regarding risk assessment and have conducted a thorough review of their procedures.","Ronald Dixon stabbed Ashleigh Ewing 39 times during frenzied attack .

"Andrew Castle pleaded guilty to attempted murder after trying to kill his wife of 18 years . He rigged a metal chair up to the mains then invited Margaret in 'for a chat' By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 06:15 EST, 7 July 2011 . Andrew Castle set up the home-made electric chair after his wife Margaret asked to end their 18-year marriage . A husband built a makeshift electric chair in his garage and tried to kill his wife after she asked for a divorce. Andrew Castle, 61, ran a cable from a plug to a metal-framed armchair, then asked his wife Margaret in ‘for a chat’, a court heard. Once she was sitting down, he tried to knock her out with a rubber cosh, planning to electrocute her with the live wires. But she managed to wriggle free before 230 volts of mains electricity could pulse through her body, running out screaming. Castle was arrested after trying to electrocute himself with his own device then attempting to slash his wrists, and yesterday was beginning a ten-year prison sentence after admitting attempted murder. The macabre execution bid caused amazement among neighbours in the Lancashire town of Knott End-on-Sea, near Fleetwood. Castle, a former shop worker, and his 61-year-old wife, who used to be a clerk, married 18 years ago in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, before retiring to their £110,000 bungalow on the coast. Outdoor struggle: The couple fought outside their home in Knott End On Sea, Lancs, after Margaret had escaped from the garage . Neighbours believed the couple, who went on regular walking and cruising holidays together, were happy and content. But Mrs Castle found her husband ‘domineering and controlling’, and she . asked him for a divorce last autumn. From that time they were said to . have lived separate lives under the same roof. Castle moved the armchair into the garage before secretly rigging up the length of cable. On March 5 he told his wife he wanted a chat about her desire for a divorce, and got her to sit down. He told her he was going to kill her and grabbed a 12-inch rubber cosh, . apparently chosen to insulate him from the deadly current. But as he rained blows at her head she grabbed a stepladder, warding him . off for long enough to escape through a side door as he continued to . swing the cosh. Castle then tried to electrocute himself with his own contraption before slashing his wrists with a kitchen knife. Police called by a neighbour found him bleeding in the back garden crying: ‘What have I done, what have I done?’ Mrs Castle was treated in hospital for minor head injuries. Officers who examined the garage found a length of cable running from a . 13-amp plug to a lamp which was attached to a further cable with one end . exposed. When switched on at the plug, the live and neutral wires, if touched to . Mrs Castle’s skin or to the chair, would have given her a potentially . deadly shock. Castle immediately admitted what he had planned to detectives, . describing himself as ‘a nutter’. At Preston Crown Court he admitted . attempted murder and was jailed for ten years. The court heard he had planned to kill himself after murdering his wife. Castle later claimed he had been ‘simply unable to cope’ with the divorce and found it ‘overwhelming’. A psychiatric report concluded he had obsessive compulsive disorder and an adjustment disorder. Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘This was undoubtedly a planned attempt to kill, followed by a sustained and brutal attack. ‘There can be no doubt it was a very frightening experience for your . wife, but the physical injuries you inflicted were mercifully slight. However, the psychological effects must have been considerable.’ Neighbours were astonished by the attack. ‘Margaret is a lovely person . and everyone is very distressed that this happened,’ one said yesterday. ‘We always thought they were a lovely couple. ‘Margaret was understandably in a terrible state after what happened to her and she moved out of the house. ‘It’s incredible to think this man could have gone to such lengths to get even because of a divorce.’ Last night Mrs Castle, who is staying with relatives, said the trauma of the attack would always be with her. In a statement she said: ‘I finally decided that because of Andrew . Castle’s domineering and controlling behaviour, which got worse over our . 18 years of marriage, I would seek a divorce. ‘As a direct consequence of that decision he attempted to murder me. It . is by sheer good fortune that I am here today and the events of that . Saturday evening will always be with me.’","Andrew Castle pleaded guilty to attempted murder after trying to kill his wife of 18 years .

It has long been recognised for its wrinkle-busting properties. Now, scientists believe Botox could also help to treat mental illness. New research shows that the cosmetic treatment can dramatically improve the symptoms of severe depression in more than a quarter of patients. Dr Eric Finzi, medical director at the Chevy Chase Cosmetic Centre, in Maryland, has carried out research which suggests that physical expressions of emotion influence our feelings. For this reason, he believes that smoothing out frown lines using Botox can actually improve the mood of people with clinical depression. For example, he claims his latest research shows that forcing a frown can cause a depressed mood, while deliberately smiling can temporarily increase happiness. As American actress Phyllis Diller once said: 'A smile is a curve that sets everything straight.' This is the second of Dr Finzi’s studies which comes to this conclusion. He first proposed the theory that by preventing frowning, the toxin is interrupting signals to the brain that indicate the body is under stress or cannot cope. For the newest study, Dr Finzi worked with 84 people with severe depression that lasted for an average of two years and which had not fully responded to treatment with antidepressants. The patients all received either Botox treatment to smooth out frown lines, or a placebo injection into the same facial region. They were then assessed three and six weeks later. By the end of the study, 27 per cent of those receiving Botox reported nearly complete remission of their depression compared to just 7 per cent of those who received the placebo. Dr Finzi said: ‘This trial shows that inhibition of frowning can lead to remission in depression.’ The researchers suggests that physical expressions of emotion influence our feelings . Botox is a well-known cosmetic treatment for age-related wrinkles around the eyes and forehead. However, the powerful toxin also has a wide range of medical applications, and is used to treat stroke victims' muscle spasms, can ease migraine and even helps people with Parkinson's disease control their movements. It works by 'paralysing' small groups of muscles to prevent them going into spasm or contracting regularly. This stops the surrounding skin from wrinkling. Scientists have also recently discovered that Botox could help fight cancer by boosting the effects of chemotherapy, speeding up the destruction of tumour cells. In another experiment, Australian scientists have been trying to establish whether applying Botox gel to the nose could give hay fever sufferers relief from sneezing, itchy eyes and runny noses for up to three months. It is hoped that the botulinum toxin will affect the nerves in the nose and potentially block some of the chemicals released by the nerve endings which play a large role in causing hay fever symptoms. To try and treat the allergy, the Botox molecule has been re-engineered to be able to penetrate through the skin but also through the lining of the nose. 'My life did a 360-degree turnaround': A patient's verdict of Dr Finzi's earlier experiment . In his first study, in 2006, Dr Finzi and his colleague Dr Erika Wasserman recruited ten women aged between 36 and 63 with a medical history of depression. The average period of depression was 3.5 years, although one patient had been ill for 17 years and had not responded well to conventional treatments. 'Patients who have had their frown lines treated with Botox are perceived by others to be happier' Seven out of the ten had been on anti-depressants but continued to be dogged by severe depression before taking part in the study. Each volunteer - none of whom had had Botox before - underwent a thorough assessment by a clinical psychologist before the experiment began. They were then injected with the toxin and told to report back in two months, when another psychological assessment was carried out. Using a questionnaire designed to measure the scale of depression, the researchers discovered nine were no longer clinically depressed and the one who still was reported a significant improvement in symptoms. 'Patients who have had their frown lines treated with Botox are perceived by others to be happier,' says Dr Finzi. One woman with an 11-year history of depression said her life 'did a 360-degree turnaround' after the experiment. She got a new job and rekindled an old romance. Some of the volunteers were seen again eight months later and their symptoms had returned as the toxin's effects had worn off.","In a US trial, the treatment relieved symptoms in more than a quarter of patients - compared to just seven per cent of those given a placebo .
Scientists believe it works because it physically stops people frowning, something which can trigger negative emotions ."

Amy Winehouse spent her final hours drinking vodka alone in her bedroom and watching YouTube videos of herself, a court was told yesterday. A second inquest confirmed the 27-year-old died of alcohol poisoning at her north London home on July 23, 2011. Miss Winehouse drank so much that she stopped breathing and fell into a coma. The inquest was re-heard because the coroner at the first hearing did not have the correct qualifications. St Pancras Coroners Court was told that the Grammy award-winning singer, who was battling alcoholism and bulimia, spent the night before her death watching clips of herself on her laptop. She was found dead on her bed 12 hours later, with the laptop beside her and two empty vodka bottles on the floor. Her live-in security guard Andrew Morris said Miss Winehouse was her ‘usual, bubbly self’ on the evening of July 22. In a statement read out to the court, he said she was watching television and listening to music in her room. Later, she came to show him YouTube clips of a man she had gone out with. He said she had been drinking but he could tell she ‘wasn’t completely drunk’. She ‘stayed up in her room watching YouTube clips [of herself]’, which he had not seen her do for some time, he added. Mr Morris left Miss Winehouse at around 2.30am, before checking on her at 10am. Seeing her face-down on her bed, fully clothed, he assumed she was sleeping but realised something was wrong when she was in the same position at 3pm. He called emergency services but she was pronounced dead shortly after paramedics arrived at her Camden home. Miss Winehouse’s private GP, Christina Romete, said the singer had started drinking again three days before her death because she was ‘bored’. Fresh inquest: Police officers leave the second inquest into the death of the singer, called after the previous coroner was found not to be qualified . Crush: Journalists wait to enter a new inquest, which also found that Ms Winehouse died from misadventure . Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe upheld the original verdict that Miss Winehouse died from misadventure. Pathology tests showed she had 416mg of alcohol per decilitre in her blood – 350mg is considered enough to be fatal. Dr Romete had been helping her battle drug and alcohol addiction for several years, and saw her the day before she died. ‘In the course of the last consultation, Amy did not appear to be depressed at any stage’, she said. ‘She specifically said she did not want to die.’ Sadness: Winehouse's home in London, where she died, became a shrine after her death in 2011 . Thousands came to Camden to pay their respects, in some cases even leaving alcohol as a tribute . Professor Michael Sheaff said the amount of alcohol drunk was enough to stop her breathing. ‘When levels are extremely high, it can have an effect on the central nervous system’, he said. ‘At that level, it is likely Ms Winehouse had a respiratory arrest.’ The inquest heard Ms Winehouse had a well-documented battle with alcohol, being admitted to hospital several times but struggled to stop boozing. ‘It was apparent Amy was a highly intelligent individual’, said Dr Romete. ‘It was not possible to convince her to take a course of action unless she wanted it.’ Inspiration: Despite problems in her private life Amy Winehouse was considered one of the great singers of recent times . Tributes: Mourners gather outside Amy's flat in Camden to pay their respects after her death in July 2011 . Dr Romete said the singer was sober for ‘12 to 13 days’ prior to her death, but had been back drinking for three days prior to being found unconscious. The original inquest verdict into the death had to be ditched after it emerged deputy coroner Suzanne Greenaway, who oversaw the hearing, was under-qualified. She was appointed in July 2009 by her husband, Andrew Reid, who was the coroner for Inner North London, after working as a solicitor and barrister in Australia. But she resigned in November last year when it became clear she did not have the required five years’ experience in the Law Society. Dr Reid also quit from his post last month as he faced disciplinary proceedings and the possibility of being removed. ‘There is evidence she consumed a very large amount of alcohol at some point before her death’, said Dr Radcliffe. ‘Amy died as a result of alcohol toxicity.’ Tragic: Amy's father Mitch is consoled by friends at her funeral in 2011. He said today the family did not want to attend the second inquest . Amy Winehouse's father said that . coroners had made a 'massive cock up' which led to his daughter's . inquest having to be heard again. But he said he was not surprised that the fresh ruling matched the original findings of the court. Mitch Winehouse said he 'expected' the . ruling but he attacked as 'preposterous' a series of blunders that . meant the inquest into Amy's death had to be rescheduled after it was . revealed the original coroner Suzanne Greenaway was not properly . qualified. 'That is what we expected. It is the . same evidence so it was bound to reach the same conclusion. What other . conclusion could they reach?' he said. Asked whether he felt let down by the coroner's office, which failed to undertake adequate checks to make sure Miss Greenaway was qualified to practice in the UK, he said: 'It was a massive cock up. 'They messed up twice - once when they . sent the original coroner's report to the wrong address and the second . time when a coroner who wasn't qualified oversaw the inquest. 'It is preposterous.' Mitch said he had chosen not to go to . today's inquest because he wanted to spare himself and his family the . ordeal of hearing the circumstances surrounding his daughter's tragic . demise. He said: 'There was no need for us to . go today. If we had been in London we wouldn't have gone, I wasn't going . to put my family through that, it was horrible.

The former mistress of the father accused of killing six of his children in a house fire designed to frame her said that she and his wife would take turns to sleep with him in a caravan. Lisa Willis, 29, was giving evidence in the case of Michael and Mairead Philpot, who are accused of torching their home to frame the mistress who had walked out of the home she shared with them. Giving evidence from behind a curtain, . Miss Willis, 29, told the jury she and Mairead Philpott ‘took it in . turns’ to sleep with Philpott, initially in a double bed in the box room . of the home and, later in a caravan on the driveway.

The court has heard Philpott, 56, his wife, and his ‘best mate’, Paul Mosley, 45, set the fire in a ‘joint enterprise’ to ‘set up’ Miss Willis – three months after she walked out on him with her five children. Just hours after the fatal blaze last . May, Philpott and Miss Willis had been due to face each other in a court . custody hearing to decide their children’s place of residency.

Relationship: The court was told that Michael Philpott (right) would sleep with his wife Mairead Philpott (left) and his former mistress Lisa Willis on alternate nights . Prosecutor Richard Latham QC said the . alleged ‘set-up’ went ‘horribly wrong’ when the fire went out of control . because too much petrol was used, killing the six children Philpott had . with Mairead. Yesterday, a . court heard that Miss Willis had a ten-year sexual relationship with . Philpott, during which time she lived at the ‘cramped’ three-bedroom . home he shared with his wife and up to 12 of his children. Philpott slept with his wife and mistress on alternate nights. As . well as the six children Philpott had with his wife – who all perished . in the blaze – Miss Willis had four with the unemployed former baker, . plus a fifth by another man who was raised as part of the family. Miss Willis walked out of the Derby address in February last year.

A mother accused of killing her six children in a house fire admitted to a jury she was a ‘disgrace’ yesterday for taking part in a threesome with her husband and his friend following the fatal blaze. Mairead Philpott, 31, claimed she took part in the sordid sex session to keep her husband Michael, 56, who has fathered 17 children with a string of women, happy. Emotional: Mairead Philpott paid tribute to her husband Mick while testifying in court today . Following the fire, Mrs Philpott was . secretly recorded by police having sex with forklift truck driver Paul . Mosley, 45, at a hotel as her husband watched. Her barrister Sean Smith QC asked ‘what on earth’ she was doing in a threesome so soon after losing her children, Mrs Philpott replied: ‘Mick wanted me to do it. My mind was elsewhere. My mind was with the children.’ She added: ‘I am a disgrace.’ Mrs Philpott said she had had . threesomes on ‘three or four occasions’ before the blaze with her . husband and the couple’s co-defendant Mosley, Philpott’s ‘best friend’. Couple: The pair pictured last July after their six children died in a house fire at their home in Derby . She also told the court how the wages . from her hospital cleaning job and benefits were paid into her husband’s . bank account – and how ‘there would be trouble’ if she accessed it . without asking his permission. The court has previously heard that as . well as her money, Philpott also harvested the benefits of his then . live-in mistress, Lisa Willis, 29. Miss Willis acted as chief bridesmaid . at the couple’s marriage in May 2003, the court heard, while pregnant . with her first child by Philpott. The Philpotts and Mosley are accused . of starting the fire last May to frame Miss Willis after she walked out . of the council home three months earlier, taking the five children she . raised with Philpott with her. During more than three hours on the witness stand, Mrs Philpott described each of her own children’s personalities to the jury. She said Duwayne, 13, was ‘quiet and . caring’, while Jade, ten, was her ‘little princess’. Jack, nine, was her . ‘blue-eyed little boy’, Jesse, six, was her ‘little Irish stamper’, . while Jayden, five, was her ‘miracle baby’ because he was born six weeks . premature. Unorthodox: Mr Philpotts used to divide his attentions between his wife and his live-in mistress . The court heard that in the hours . before the fire, she had sex with her husband three times, including one . session on the couple’s snooker table which also involved ‘full sex’. She told the court they woke to the . sound of the fire alarm. Flames ‘gushed’ towards them when Philpott . opened the lounge door to investigate. She admitted that dogging sessions – . where the couple had sex in a  public place as others watched – in the . six months before the fatal blaze were her idea, although she said her . husband encouraged it. Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott and another woman . The court was told she had been abused . by a relative as a child, raped while on holiday and physically . assaulted by a boyfriend before she met Philpott at a pub darts match in . around 2000. She told the court she considered . Philpott her ‘guardian angel’ at the time because he made her feel . ‘loved and protected’. Asked why she had tolerated him taking a . mistress, she said she was ‘scared of losing my family’.

Devastated: Westlife singer Shane Filan, seen performing in Liverpool last night, is 'devastated' after he was declared bankrupt . He has sold more than 45million records as part of the boyband Westlife. But singer Shane Filan has been declared bankrupt after his property empire crumbled. The decision came after the 32-year-old was revealed to have debts of £18million. Speaking to the Mirror Shane said: 'I . have worked long and hard to try to reduce my debts, and I am devastated . that it came to this conclusion.' Confirming the sad news, Irish heartthrob Shane explained he had spoken to several bankruptcy experts in an attempt to find a solution to his financial issues, but his efforts had failed. Shane added that he would be concentrating on his commitments with Westlife, who are currently completing their final tour. He said that after the tour has finished, he will be 'looking to rebuild a future for my wife, my . three children and myself'. Before the economic crisis hit, Shane and his brother Finbarr had borrowed millions from several banks in their native Ireland. Their company Shafin developments had taken out a series of large loans to construct a 90-home estate in Dromahair, Co.Leitrim. However, out of the 90 houses planned, only half of them were actually constructed - with many selling for less than they had cost to build. At the end of last year, Shane made the decision to relocate from Ireland to Surrey so that his finances could be dealt with in the UK. His bankruptcy could have lasted up to 12 years in Ireland but will last just one year if he complies with the rules. After the boom of the Celtic Tiger in . the mid-2000s, the global recession hit Ireland hard as many who . used cheap credit to take out mortgages suffered badly in the economic . downturn. The property booms in Ireland and Spain, built on a mountain of debt, were far bigger than anywhere else and saw the biggest slumps after lending collapsed and debts were called in during the credit crunch. In Ireland, vast estates remain half-built and new-builds stand empty. Since the crash in 2007-2008, average house prices in the country have fallen by more than 60 per cent with commercial properties falling at a similar rate. Happier times: Shane with his developer brother Finbarr Filan, of Shafin Developments Ltd. In concert: Westlife performing last night . Bankruptcy rules in England and Wales were made more 'progressive' in 2004, making the process less onerous. Bankrupts can be discharged within 12 months - and as little as four months. This compares with three years before, or two years when the debts came to less than £20,000. You can apply to a court, and pay £700, to make yourself bankrupt. Your creditors can force you into bankruptcy if you owe more than £750. The order normally lasts up to one year, or until the court appointed trustee can decide what can be claimed from your assets to clear what you owe. Your bank account may be frozen with a living allowance being agreed.Your home, car and other assets may be seized to clear your borrowing. Pensions are usually excluded. Certain debts will remain even after bankruptcy: court fines, child maintenance and student loans. If your assets are insufficient, you might have to make monthly payments, if you can afford it, for three years. A note remains on the credit files of bankrupts for six years, making it difficult to borrow money. Debt Relief Orders (DRO), a simplified and cheaper alternative to bankruptcy, was introduced in 2009. It lasts for 12 months, after which, if their circumstances have not changed, the debt is written off. It costs just £90. A survey at the beginning of the year . which looks at the performance of the world's mainstream housing . markets placed Ireland firmly at the bottom. At the end of March data from the . Central Statistics Office revealed that residential property prices fell . by almost 18 per cent in the year to February. At the end of last year, The Irish . Taoiseach revealed tough new austerity measures including hiking VAT to . 23 per cent in a bid to save €3.8billion. Enda Kenny pledged to get Ireland's budget deficit under an EU limit of 3 per cent of GDP by 2015 and said this budget would be the toughest in a four-year run of belt-tightening. The proposals included rises in indirect taxes - including a 2 per cent hike in VAT, increases in excise duty, cuts in social welfare and reduced child benefit. It also featured an increase in VAT, as well as a new property tax, taxes on luxury items and raising the pension age. The property crash has also resulted . in more than 1,600 ghost estates, with houses completely abandoned, . across Ireland, including the Glenall development in Borris-in-Ossory, . Co. Laois. Westlife have scored 14 number one singles in the UK and more than two dozen top 10 hits. In 2010, the group were estimated to . have amassed a £31million fortune after shifting more than 44 million . copies of their records around the world. The group will bring to an end their 14-year career with a show at Croke Park in Dublin on June 23. Following the end of Westlife, Shane will be concentrating on releasing his own solo album next year. The group's manager Louis Walsh told the Mirror: 'Shane is going to have a massive career after Westlife. 'He’s . going to have a great solo career and make millions. He’ll start all . over again and remake the riches in no time at all.' 'He had no money when he started off before Westlife, and now he’ll make it all back when he becomes a massive star.' Luxurious: The house in Carraroe, Co Sligo, where Shane and his family lived before moving to Surrey . Father of three: Shane and his wife Gillian now live in Surrey with their three children . Filan is just the latest celebrity to go bust due to property debts. Many footballers, in particular, have been caught out as new developments have been left empty due to the slump in house prices. Jason Euell, 33, who earned £6million over his career, which started at Wimbledon, but suffered from the collapse of a property investment and was declared bankrupt. Others invested their money in films, largely because of the tax breaks, but these high-risk punts have failed to pay off. Former England player and Aston Villa favourite Lee Hendrie was declared bankrupt in January after film and property investments failed. The 34-year-old, who earned £24,000 a week at the peak of his career,  owed HM Revenue & Customs £200,000 in unpaid tax. He had unsuccessfully tried to sell his £1.7million home in Solihull but officials discovered in any case that the mortgage exceeded the property's value. Grant Bovey, husband of TV presenter Anthea Turner and failed buy-to-let investor, was discharged from bankruptcy last year - just a year after his property company collapsed with debts of £50m. The 50-year-old entrepreneur managed to hold on to some of his lavish lifestyle, staying in a pretty cottage in Hascombe, Surrey, owned by his wife and the couple managed to keep their £4m French ski chalet. Other high profile bankruptcies have included former Atomic Kitten singer and reality TV star Kerry Katona and TV presenter Miquita Oliver, aged 27, who faced a £170,000 unpaid tax bill. Katona finally cleared her debts at the end of last year after being declared bankrupt in 2008 - it normally only takes one year to be discharged but she had failed to comply with the order.

A headmistress wrote to a mother telling her to postpone her daughter’s birthday party because it is on the night before her younger sister’s exams. Tina Adams was outraged when she received a letter from Cathy Noble suggesting the party for her older daughter Roisin, who is no longer a pupil at the school, might prevent 11-year-old Niamh from preparing for her Year 6 SATs. To add insult to injury, the letter was riddled with errors. Miss Adams, with daughters Roisin and Niamh, was asked to consider postponing the birthday party . Miss Adams, 50, claims teachers at . The Castle Primary School in Tiverton, Devon, found out about Roisin’s . Grease-themed 13th birthday party and quizzed Niamh about who was going . and how long it would last. Some of Niamh’s classmates had also been . invited. Miss Adams then received a letter . from Mrs Noble, suggesting that the timing of the two-hour party, due to . end at 9.30pm on Sunday, was inappropriate. Miss Adams, of Tiverton, said: ‘They . are blowing the whole thing out of proportion. I am a responsible parent . and said to other parents that if they didn’t want their children to . come, or if they wanted to pick them up early, then I wouldn’t be . offended. ‘But I feel very strongly that this is a parental matter and not something the school should get involved in. ‘The kids have worked extremely hard . for these tests and there’s nothing wrong with a bit of rest and fun to . let their hair down. It might even improve their performance. ‘Now Niamh is upset about it and . thinks we’ve done something wrong. When she was taken out of lunch and . asked who was going she didn’t know what to say, she told me she was so . embarrassed.’ Cathy Noble of The Castle Primary School in Tiverton suggested to Miss Adams that her timing could be better . The council housing officer added: . ‘The teachers are worried about SAT results, which are more about the . school’s reputation than anything else.’ Miss Adams also pointed out . grammatical errors made in the letter, including misplaced apostrophes . and a lower case letter at the start of a sentence. It also makes reference to Niamh’s ‘brother’ even though she has two sisters, Roisin and Katie, who is 16. Miss Adams said that the party had . been all but ruined by the school. She said: ‘There was going to be . about ten girls going in all and now it looks like there will be just . five. Some of the mums have stopped their daughters going. School head Mrs Noble wanted to ensure all pupils at her school, right, were rested and ready to sit their SATs . ‘Roisin has said she’d rather not have the party now but it’s still going ahead.’ Mrs Noble said she was concerned about the party and had merely suggested another date might be more suitable. ‘SATs are the culmination of our . pupils’ primary education and I wanted to make absolutely sure that the . family were aware these important exams begin the next day.

The gunman who killed a woman and injured five others during a drive-by-shooting rampage with an assault rifle has been identified by Texas police as a U.S. Marine. Esteban J. Smith, 23, died in the resulting shootout with police early Sunday morning after he randomly fired on five vehicles from his truck as he ran amok through Concho County, Texas, according to Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Smith's rank and service record have not been made public, but he is an active duty marine and was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Police also revealed that Smith is believed to be responsible for the death of another woman in North Carolina on Saturday.

The exact details of his contract have yet to surface. His . comments are likely to attract ire from the show's co-creator Chuck . Lorre and his bosses at Warner Brothers, who are yet to comment. The teen's outburst continued: 'Please stop watching it and filling your head with filth. People say it’s just entertainment. 'Do . some research on the effects of television and your brain, and I . promise you you’ll have a decision to make when it comes to television . and especially with what you watch on television ... it's bad news.' Regrest: Angus is contracted to the program and his comments are likely to attract ire from his bosses at Warner Brothers . Intense: A reflective Angus ones in his 'testimony' as a 'soldier of truth' He adds: 'If I am doing any harm, I don't want to be here. I don't want to be contributing to the enemy's plan. 'You . cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like . that. I know I can't. 'I'm not OK with what I'm learning, what the bible . says and being on that television show.' Jones . gives his testimony sitting with a representative of The Forerunner . Chronicles in his trailer on the Warner studio lot, where his series is . filmed. 'Filth': Angus is paid $350,000 an episode to star in the show, in which he is seen with guest star Miley Cyrus in a recent episode . In his younger days: A chubbier Angus with then co-star Charlie Sheen . New co-star: Angus with Ashton Kutcher, who replaced sacked Charlie Sheen as the new star of the show . In the video the young star laughs as . he admits his worried family have likened his recent 'awakening' to . the Seventh-day Adventist movement to joining a 'cult'. 'Of course all my family, not all my family, but some of my . family were like ""he's going to a cult"" trying to tell me to get out of . there,' said Jones. 'But I didn't feel like I was being fooled, I could study it for . myself. Its there in the bible and there's no evidence for the opposing views.' Found a home: Jones' search for religion has seen him become a member of the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church in California's San Fernando Valley . Jones' comments are just the latest . crisis for the show, which was put in jeopardy when its original star . Sheen was fired and replaced by Ashton Kutcher after attacking Chuck . Lorre amidst a storm of bizarre behaviour. The show has since struggled to maintain its high ratings. Jones talks about his education . in the 'basic messages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church', a . Protestant Christian denomination which is marked by its observance of . the Sabbath on a Saturday. Members . are discouraged from purely secular activities on the Sabbath, instead . spend the day worshiping. Preparations begin on the Friday night at . sundown. The official teachings of the denomination are expressed in its 28 Fundamental Beliefs, which Jones revealed he was studying. Jones' 'testimony' was released by the ForeRunner Chronicles. According to a tweet for The Forerunner Chronicles Jones is now a 'soldier for truth'. They . state on their Facebook page: 'The Forerunner is dedicated to . proclaiming the truth that you need to know. ""To live and die for the . truth"" is the moto [sic] and Jesus Christ is our general. 'He gives the orders... we put in the work! No questions asked.' The . ForeRunner has previously released a series of 11 videos entitled the . Jay-Z Deception, which chronicle the 'darkness' of pop stars like the . Rihanna and argue that they are 'antagonistic to Christianity'. Having peeked at 28.7million viewers when . Kutcher made his debut, ratings have slipped hitting a recent high of 13.6million when . Miley Cyrus guest starred in an episode. Jones has appeared on Two And A Half Men since 2003 and received a pay rise in May when the show was renewed for a tenth series. But he recently complained of reduced storylines, telling E! Online: 'My character does Skype calls. He only . does one scene Skype calls... It's easy . but it's boring.' In a further testimony on the . Seventh-day website the Voice Of Prophecy, Jones revealed that he felt his role in Two And A Half Men was an opportunity to spread his believes to a wider audience. 'I am confident I am there for a reason,' he said. 'I don't think I would . be on the show this year if God hadn't pushed me into it because . otherwise I genuinely didn't want to do another year of the show. 'I'm so . thankful to be there its a lot of fun and God will get the glory out of . it.' Jones also revealed that he found the . church during a difficult period in his life. With . his parents going through a divorce, he began spending as much time as . possible out of home and admits he experimented with drugs. 'When . I look back now I see that... the enemy was trying to push my in a . different directions but God... pulled me out right at the last second,' he said. 'I was running . away from that situation. Slowly that led to drugs. I never drank. And . I'm still a virgin so God protected me from those things.' He . described how the Holy Spirit spoke to him through a friend and he . accepted Jesus into his life. He then went about the process of finding a . church. In his ForeRunner Chronicles video Jones explained that a schoolfriend . introduced him to the Valley Crossroads Seventh-day Adventist Church, where he felt at home. 'I really started to get into reading . the bible and I started to look for a church to go to. Every Sunday I . was going to like three or four churches, I was just looking for the . right church,' he said. And he added: 'I was looking to go to . a church with an all-black congregation,' explaining that he had . imagined himself as a member of a gospel church. 'The first day I went there I went by myself and I walked in and . sat down at the back... It was just like, that was my church. Special guest: Angus T Jones gives his testimony in a video posted online on Seventh-day website the Voice Of Prophecy . Speaking out: Angus describes how his parents divorce, coupled with doubts about his future, led to his life heading in a difficult direction until he was saved by finding religion . 'Then I started the bible work at the . church. And I was like this is really awesome, it seems so much more . appropriate and it was right from the bible. 'I just kept learning the basic . messages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and every single time I was . learning all this new stuff and I was just loving it.' Jones also explained that he had begun observing the Sabbath. While he may have raised eyebrows with his outspoken views, by finding religion Angus T Jones has avoided following in the criminal path of close family members. The young actor's uncle, Eric Eugene Claypool, is currently serving a . 99-year prison sentence for murder after shooting a man he claimed had . sexually abused him. According to prison documents on . November 16, 1994, Claypool, now 38, stole a .357-magnum from . 31-year-old Jay Harlan and shot him in the back of the head. Criminal past: Police mugshots show Angus' parents Carey and Kelly Jones . And Jones' family made headlines when mugshots emerged of his parents, Kelly and Carey Jones, taken in their former home of Travis County, Texas. His mother Carey, Claypool’s sister, was arrested in 1992 for ripping the meter out of a taxi and then punching a police officer in the face while she was drunk. Then in 1997 she was arrested on a burglary charge after a woman woke to find Carey in her living room. Jones' father Kelly was arrested in 1986 for possession of marijuana and carrying an unlicensed .45-caliber handgun after he created a disturbance in a bar. In 1997 Carey had Kelly arrested on an assault charge after he allegedly pulled her out of a car and pushed her to the ground. She later dropped the charge, but Kelly was ordered to complete an anti-violence class.","Teenager, who joined the show as a child in 2003, earns $350k per episode .

An entire family of seven - including four young children - was swept away and drowned by flood waters after leaving the safety home to hide in a drainage ditch during the tornado that howled through Oklahoma on Friday night. Authorities in believe 16 people died as a result of the storm. Three veteran storm chasers were killed by the twister that touched down in the Oklahoma City suburb of El Reno. The rest died in the ensuring flash floods that swept the region. Family members say Samuel Cifuentes led his wife and son, as well as his wife's cousin and her three young children, into a concrete drainage ditch just feet from his house because he believed it would provide more shelter from the tornado. They carried a table out from the home and were huddled under it when a rush of water swept all seven away. The house, which is within sight of the drainage ditch, was untouched by the storm, which touched down more than 25 miles away. Tragic: Samuel Cifuentes, right, les his wife Florinda Santos, left, and their son Alex into a drainage ditch - along with his wife's cousin and her three children on Friday night . Tragic: Yolanda Santos and her children Lesly, Cristofer and Brandon were all killed in the flooding. Rescuers are still searching for the bodies of Yolanda and Lesly . Unexpected: Mr Cifuentes believed that his family would be safe hiding under a table in this concrete drainage ditch. He never thought that the rains would cause a flash flood . Rescuers are still searching for the bodies of two members of the family. Firefighters say the creeks and rivers are still too swollen to send divers underwater. All seven members are believed killed, KWTV reports. 'They were in the ditch because they thought it was the safest spot because they just thought it was going to be a tornado, not a flooding. They didn't imagine that,' Enma Aguilar, a family member, told the news station. Family members say that the bodies of Samuel Cifuentes and his young son Alex were found on Sunday. The body of his wife Florinda Santos was discovered on Saturday, four miles downstream from the drainage ditch. Santos' cousin, Yolanda Santos, as well as her eight-year-old daughter Lesly are still missing. Yolanda's two sons, Cristofer and Brandon have been found dead. Mr Cifuentes' brother Biron told KWTV that his family is in shock over his brother's decision to leave home. All seven people drowned within sight of the house. 'It doesn't matter if they are found dead or alive, I just want them to be found,' Biron Cifuentes said. Deadly: The tornado that touched down near El Reno, Oklahoma, killed three storm chasers. However, it was nowhere near Mr Cifuentes' house in Oklahoma City . Downpour: Of the 16 people killed in Oklahoma City by the storm, 13 died as a result of flooding. Three more died from flooding in Arkansas . Searching: Rescuers are still looking for the bodies of at least five people who were swept away by floodwaters . A second family was washed away and believed drowned in a similar incident. Ten people hid out in a storm train in another part of Oklahoma City when the tornado approached. A man and three young children were swept away and have not been found. Six of the people managed to escape the rapid waters. Additionally, a man in Oklahoma County died Saturday morning when his vehicle was swept away by flood waters. A grandmother in Okfuskee County also drowned in her car when it was overtaken by high water. The tornado ultimately touched down 25 miles outside of Oklahoma City, near the suburb of El Reno. It was responsible for the deaths of Tim Samaras, 55, his son Paul Samaras, 24, and crew member Carl Young, 45 - all professional storm chasers who were caught up in the violent twister. Oklahomans are still badly shaken from the massive EF5 twister that tore through the town of Moore, Oklahoma, on Mary 20 killing 24 people and injuring hundreds. Many of the people who were killed had taken shelter in homes, schools and businesses that were reduced to splinters by winds that reached 210mph. Friday night's storm formed out on the prairie west of Oklahoma City, giving residents plenty of advance notice. The EF3 tornado near El Reno destroyed several homes - thought it didn't injure anyone inside . Several airplanes at Canadian Valley Technology Center were tossed around like kindling . A plane sits inside a crumbled building at a technology school in El Reno, Oklahoma . When told to seek shelter, many ventured out and snarled traffic across the metro area - perhaps remembering the damage from May 20. 'It was chaos. People were going southbound in the northbound lanes. Everybody was running for their lives,' said Terri Black, 51, a teacher's assistant in Moore. After seeing last month's tornado also turn homes into piles of splintered rubble, Black said she decided to try and outrun the tornado when she learned her southwest Oklahoma City home was in harm's way. She quickly regretted it. The death of the storm chasers in pursuit of the storm are believed to be the first among scientific researchers while chasing tornadoes, the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said. 'They put themselves in harm's way so that they can educate the public about the destructive power of these storms,' said Chris West, the undersheriff in Canadian County, where the men died. Cleanup: Friends and neighbors pitched in to help salvage the remains of several of the destroyed homes . The elder Samaras, of Bennett, Colorado, had a reputation for being safe, but was trapped on the highway with his son and Young, who taught geology at Lake Tahoe Community College in South Lake Tahoe, California. 'I don't know if I would say I worried about it because one of the biggest things he stressed was safety,' said Tim's brother, Jim Samaras, who confirmed the deaths to The Associated Press. 'He knew what to look for. He knew where not to be and in this case, the tornado took a clear turn toward them.' Tim Samaras and his Twistex tornado chase team produced material for the Discovery Channel, National Geographic and meteorological conferences. 'He looked at tornadoes not for the spotlight of TV but for the scientific aspect,' Jim Samaras said. 'At the end of the day, he wanted to save lives and he gave the ultimate sacrifice for that.' The Oklahoma storm that killed the three chasers developed right in front to them. Tim Samaras tweeted a photo of clouds rising through a volatile atmosphere and noted: 'Storms now initiating south of Watonga along triple point. Dangerous day ahead for OK — stay weather savvy!' It was his last tweet.","Samuel Cifuentes led his wife Florinda and son Alex - along with his wife's cousin and her three children - to a drainage ditch near his house .

Assault: Police say Monty Turner, 51, attacked his wife with a Taser and pepper spray and kidnapped his son . A three-year-old Colorado boy has been found safe 900 miles from home after his estranged father allegedly assaulted his mother with pepper spray and a stun gun and kidnapped him. Police in the small town of Brandon in Manitoba, Canada, rescued Luke Turner Sunday afternoon at a roadside motel. Officials say Monty Turner, fled the country with the boy after taking him from his mother's home in Longmont, Colorado, on Saturday morning. The kidnapping led to an Amber Alert this weekend that spanned several states. The case became more complicated on Sunday morning when Monty Turner's father was arrested in his son's car on an expressway in southwest Missouri. This was the second time Monty Turner allegedly kidnapped his son from his wife in less than 12 months. He took Luke for five months in July 2012. The child was only returned to his mother in March. Authorities say Turner hid in his wife's garage in Longmont, Colorado, and attacked her about 10am Saturday when she stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. He forced his way into the house after she fled inside and tried to call 911, according to court documents. Missing: Luke Turner's abduction led to an Amber Alert and police searches in Colorado and Missouri - where authorities believed Monty planned to go . Attacked: Brandy Turner was only just reunited with little Luke in March after his father abducted him for five months. She said she tried to fight off her estranged husband, but he overpowered her . Brandy Turner said her son cried 'Don't hurt my mommy!' as he watched his father shock her with a Taser and then blasted her in the face with pepper spray, according to the Longmont Times-Call. Turner told reports that she fought her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, but that the weapons allowed him to overpower her. Monty Turner, 51, took the couple's son as he ate breakfast at the kitchen table. Safe: Luke Turner was not harmed and will be returned to his mother this week . A judge had issued a permanent protection order barring Monty Turner from being within 100 feet of his wife or his son after he kidnapped the boy for five months last July. Police later found him hiding out with the boy in a cabin 100 miles from Longmont and returned the young child to his mother in March. Because Monty had legal custody of Luke at the time, he was never arrested. However, a judge later stripped Monty of custody. Brandy Turner said her estranged husband demanded to see his son again when he confronted her on Saturday. He became violent when she wouldn't allow it. Police searched for Monty Turner and little Luke after the kidnapping, but were unable to locate the car the father escaped in. When they contacted Turner's brother, the reluctantly told authorities that Turner had been living in Denver with his father, Ronald Turner, and that the two planned to flee to Springfield, Missouri - some 800 miles away from Longmont, according to the Times-Call. The brother told authorities that Monty Turner planned the attack in order to get his son back. On Sunday morning, Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers pulled over Monty's father Ronald Turner, 72, driving his son's car near Springfield. Monty and little Luke were nowhere to be found, but authorities discovered toys in the car. Ronald Turner denied helping Monty, but was arrested for being complicit in the kidnapping. Cross-country: The case sprawled many hundreds of miles from Luke Turner's home in Longmont, Colorado . Located: The FBI and Canadian police arrested Turner at the Casablanca Motor Inn in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, after tracking Turner through his credit card purchases . Hours later, the FBI located Monty Turner at a roadside motel in Manitoba, Canada, after tracking his credit card purchases. Local authorities and the FBI arrested Monty Turner and recovered Luke. Brandy Turner said she cannot go to Canada to pick up her child because she does not have a passport, however, she hopes to be reunited with him in the next few days. '“I don't have to live in fear. I don't know how much he understands,” she said. “""I am just so thankful that he is safe that he is OK,' she told reporters.","Luke Turner was found safe at a roadside motel in Manitoba, Canada, Sunday afternoon .

I'm trying my best to stay smiley but you have to agree it’s been a pretty glum summer so far - rain, rain, freezing . wind, and more rain. Until we finish work on this series of Made In Chelsea I . can't even jet off to the sunshine. Boo! So to . cheer myself up this week, I invited the girls round for a make-up party. As a . beauty blogger, I am very lucky to get sent tons of products to test. We had . all sorts of girly fun trying out new make-up colours and ideas, and it gave me . the chance to experiment with one of this year's biggest beauty looks: . attention-grabbing eyebrows. I've . blogged before about eyebrow grooming, and what a huge impact shaping your . brows can have on your overall look. A professional session with a brow waxer . or threader leaves you looking elegant and polished in no time. Bigger is better: This week Binky had the chance to experiment with one of this year's biggest beauty looks: attention-grabbing eyebrows to look like Cara Delevingne . Semi-permanent make-up treatments can also boost a brow depleted . by years of plucking and I had a treatment with one of the UK's leading experts Debra Robson and she really created a much stronger framing of my brow . with her Power Brow treatment. You can see the difference in the before and . after shots. It's not . just about well-groomed eyebrows though. Cara Delevingne has been THE hot model . for the last 18 months, and her thick, bold brows have prompted a major beauty . trend. I'm lucky enough to have a nice healthy pair, but there's always room . for improvement. Hence this week's subject: Binky's Bold Brows . How To Do Bold Eyebrow Makeup With Binky . Step 1: . Apply your base . Brows are . the focus of this look - obvs - so you just want a simple nude make-up look. The Vichy . Dermablend Dermasmooth Corrective Foundation creates a wonderfully even, matte base. It's quite thick, . so you only need to apply a little to conceal shadows and achieve a smooth . finish. Dab a little foundation onto the back of your hand, then apply it to . the face using a foundation brush and blend with your fingers. Step 2: . Highlight your eyes . Get the look: Brows are the focus of this look - obvs - so you just want a simple nude make-up look . The eyes . need to be subtle, so as not to distract from your bold brows. So I've used . this pretty bareMinerals eyeshadow in Chic Nude just to add a hint of sparkle. Apply the eyeshadow using a small, angled brush, blending it across the whole . eyelid and in the tear duct to brighten your eyes and create a flattering wash . of pale, shimmery colour. Step 3: . Add a darker shade . It’s always nice to add a little definition to your eyes, so . apply a soft line of the bareMinerals Sable eyeshadow along the upper and lower . lash lines and into the crease of your eyelid using a small brush. bareMinerals . eyeshadows are packed with colour and a little goes a long way, so be careful . when applying this darker shade as you don't want to overdo it. Step 4: . Luscious lashes . Finish . off your eyes by emphasising your lashes - both upper and lower - with a couple . of coats of mascara. The slimline brush on the Clarins Wonder Length Mascara is . especially good for lengthening your lashes, so the results look natural but . lush. Step 5: . Tidy and wax your brows . Now for . the brows. If you've not used brow wax before, don't be afraid - it's a . brilliant way to groom your brows, smoothing the shape and fixing the brow . hairs in place. Simply use the small mascara brush that comes with the Clarins Pro-Palette Eyebrow Kit to blend the wax from the . palette into your brows. Step 6: . Shape and darken . The best . way to achieve a bold yet natural finish is to apply your brow colour in tiny . strokes. I used the small angled brush and the darker brow colour from the . Clarins palette, but there's a lighter shade to choose if you have fair hair. Gently build up the colour until you achieve the desired shape and thickness. Wax lyrical: If you've not used brow wax before, don't be afraid - it's a brilliant way to groom your brows, smoothing the shape and fixing the brow hairs in place . Step 7: . Highlight your brows . Next use . the pinky colour from the brow palette, blending it underneath your eyebrows. This is a clever little make-up trick that helps highlight your brow bones and . adds more definition to the eyes. Step 8: . Brush on your bronzer . Finally, . its bronzer time - my favourite! Blend Guerlain Terracotta . 4 Seasons Bronzer . across the cheekbones and along the side of the forehead using a large powder brush. You know how much I adore wearing bronzer but for this look I've taken things . easy and not added too much as it might draw attention away from the eyes. And . that's it - eight easy steps to brilliantly bold brows! I didn’t add anything to my lips for this look, but for a sheer . and subtle touch of lip colour I’d recommend a moisturising lip . butter like Rodial Glamstick in the shade Lust. I'd . definitely recommend investing in the Clarins brow palette to keep your brows . looking super-groomed. However, those of you on a budget could try these lower . cost brow boosters: Revlon .

Lavinia Olmazu is able to remain in Britain with her 12-year-old son despite funneling £2.9million in false benefit claims to 172 Romanian gypsies . A Romanian gypsy campaigner jailed for her role in a £10million benefits fraud has been allowed to stay in Britain to protect her human rights. Lavinia Olmazu, 33, and her accomplice, Alin Enachi, funneled £2.9million in false benefits claims to 172 Romanian gypsies after providing false National Insurance numbers to immigrants. Olmazu was sentenced to more than two years in prison in 2010 and should have been deported automatically upon her release. But she has been allowed to stay in Britain after challenging the Home Secretary's attempt to have her removed by exploiting a loophole in the Human Rights Act. She has been able to persuade judges that because she has a 12-year-old son it would be an attack on their rights if they were to be deported. Her case will raise further concerns over how judges are interpreting Article Eight of the act, which guarantees the 'right to family life', to allow criminals to escape deportation by arguing that being removed from Britain would be a breach of that right. As reported in the Daily Telegraph, the Home Office had believed it was appropriate for her child to return to Romania with her, as he is Romanian-born, has a father who lives in the country, and lived with his Romanian-speaking mother and her Romanian partner until she was jailed. But when the Home Office tried to deport her she argued to immigration judges that being deported would breach her human rights because she has a son, 12, who she said was essentially British, having spent much of his life in the UK. She claimed he did not speak Romanian fluently. The case is among the first to be considered by senior immigration judges after an attempt by Theresa May to make it more difficult for immigration criminals to stay. In June Mrs May declared war on judges who refused to deport foreign criminals because of their human rights, saying the courts should stop allowing overseas prisoners, law-breakers and illegal immigrants to stay in Britain on the grounds that they have a right to a family life. She promised a vote in Parliament to ram home to judges ‘what the public believe’ and persuade them ‘to take into account what Parliament has said’. Failure by the judiciary to listen will result in new laws to curb the exploitation of the human rights legislation by foreign criminals, Mrs May said. MPs of all parties voted unanimously in support of the stricter guidelines. In the case of Olmazu, the Home Office appealed against the immigration court's decision to let her stay, but a senior judge ruled her son had a right to continue his schooling in Britain. Activist: Olmazu, who claimed illegal benefits for Roma gipsies, at a demonstration in South Africa in 2001 . Senior tribunal judge Andrew Jordan said the immigration courts still have significant leeway to decide where deportations should take place. Judge Jordan said in his ruling: 'There is inevitably room for different judges to reach a different . conclusion on proportionality on the same facts.' Olmazu, who has addressed the United Nations, was employed by two London boroughs and homeless charity the Big Issue to help integrate Romanian gipsies into British society. The Home Secretary said the courts should stop allowing overseas prisoners, law-breakers and illegal immigrants to stay in Britain on the grounds that they have a right to a family life . She was jailed after she abused her position of trust with the authorities and Roma community to orchestrate an elaborate fraud that cost taxpayers millions – and gained her and her partner tens of thousands of pounds. They charged £80 each to provide hundreds of immigrants from Romania with false National Insurance numbers so they could claim thousands of pounds in benefits they were not entitled to. Armed with an NI number, their clients claimed handouts including child benefit, child tax credit, working tax credit, as well as use the NHS and other welfare services. Under rules introduced when Romania joined the EU in 2007, Romanian immigrants cannot get a National Insurance number – which is the key to getting benefits – unless they can prove they have paid employment lined up. Operating from their suburban home in Woodford Green, Essex, they provided 368 false NI numbers. Of these, 172 were successfully used to claim benefits resulting in fraud totalling £2.9million. But at the time it was reported the scam could have cost taxpayers up to £10 million if all of the fraudulent documents had been used, police revealed. Olmazu was jailed for two years and three months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply articles for use in fraud. Following her release, Olmazu now works for the Media . Diversity Institute, a charity which has received hundreds of thousands . in sponsorship from the Foreign Office and the Department for . International Development. Dominic Raab, the Conservative MP, . said tougher action was needed to counter what he described as 'judicial . sabotage' and called for clearer legislation to force judges to follow . the Home Secretary's will. He told the Telegraph: 'We need a new UK Borders Act that . enables the authorities to remove serious criminals, ignore spurious . human rights claims and override the current judicial sabotage.'","Lavinia Olmazu provided false National Insurance numbers to immigrants .

Moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life, scientists believe. Astronomers came to the conclusion after identifying up to 15 new planets orbiting the life-friendly 'habitable zones' of stars. All are giant gaseous worlds similar in size to Jupiter or Neptune. James Cameron's Avatar was set on a moon filled with lush forests - and researchers say it could be more real than its director thought. While such planets would not themselves be suitable for Earth-like life, they could be circled by moons on which there are forests, oceans and living creatures, researchers now believe. Pandora, the fictional moon in Avatar, is just such a world. So far only one of the 15 newly discovered objects has been confirmed as an exoplanet with 99.9% certainty. The rest still fall into the category of 'candidate' planets while further evidence is collected. The confirmed planet, known as PH2 b, orbits a sun-like star in the constellation Cygnus several hundred light years away. Astronomer Dr Chris Lintott, from Oxford University, a member of the international team behind the discovery, said: 'There's an obsession with finding Earth-like planets but what we are discovering with planets such as PH2 b is far stranger. 'Jupiter has several large water-rich moons. Imaging dragging that system into the comfortably warm region where the Earth is. 'If such a planet had Earth-size moons, we'd see not Europa and Callisto but worlds with rivers, lakes and all sorts of habitats: a surprising scenario that might just be common. An artist's impression of of the view from a moon orbiting the planet PH2b. Scientists says Moons like the one depicted in the film Avatar may be among the most common places to find alien life, . 'It may be that the most common habitable worlds are moons around Jupiter and Neptune-size planets rather than rocky planets as in our own solar system.' Members of the public helped astronomers identify the candidate exoplanets by logging onto the planethunters.org website on their home computers. The Planet Hunters project invites 'citizen scientists' to spot graph patterns signifying the tell-tale dip in brightness as planets pass in front of their parent stars. Follow-up work with the Keck telescope in Hawaii provided the proof that PH2 b is almost certainly a genuine planet. More than 40 volunteers are credited in a paper on the research published online by the Astrophysical Journal. One, retired police office Roy Jackson, 71, from Birtley near Gateshead, said: 'It is difficult to put into words, the pleasure, wonderment and perhaps even pride that I have in some small way been able to assist in the discovery of a planet.' Another, electronics engineer Mark Hadley from Faversham, said: 'Now when people ask me what I achieved last year I can say I have helped discover a possible new planet around a distant star. How cool is that?' Planet Hunters lead scientist Professor Debra Fisher, from Yale University in the US, said: 'We are seeing the emergence of a new era in the Planet Hunters project where our volunteers seem to be at least as efficient as the computer algorithms at finding planets orbiting at habitable zone distances from the host stars. 'Now, the hunt is not just targeting any old exoplanet; volunteers are homing in on habitable worlds.' Avatar featured a world with an entirely alien ecosystem - and experts now say that moon like Pandora could be the best place to look for alien life . Before the latest finds, 19 other exoplanets had already been located in habitable zones. Also known as the 'Goldilocks zone', this is the orbital path where temperatures are not too hot or cold but ""just right"" to permit liquid surface water. Dr Ji Wang, another Planet Hunters scientist from Yale University, said: 'We can speculate that PH2 b might have a rocky moon that would be suitable for life. 'I can't wait for the day when astronomers report detecting signs of life on other worlds instead of just locating potentially habitable environments. 'That could happen any day now.'","Team say moons similar to Avatar's Pandora could be among most common places to find alien life .

Nearly half of the nation is under threat of tornadoes or severe thunderstorms this evening as more ominous weather bears down on the Heartland Wednesday and Thursday. Oklahoma City and its suburbs - still reeling from the massive storm that flattened Moore, Oklahoma and killed 24 people last week - is in the bulls-eye once again. The National Weather Service is predicting a 10percent chance of massive EF2 to EF5 tornadoes striking in a large swath from the Texas Panhandle to central Kansas. More than 59million Americans are at risk of tornado touchdowns tonight. Experts warn that urban sprawl - which has concentrated tens of millions of people in the suburbs in storm-prone Tornado Alley - means deadly twister strikes in populated areas are likely to become more common. Devastated: This home was completely destroyed when four tornadoes touches down in Fenton Township, Michigan, near Flint, on Tuesday . Under threat: Half the nation was in danger of severe weather on Wednesday. The green area shows a chance of severe thunderstorms. The Yellow area shows a slight chance of tornadoes . Funnel clouds have already been reported in Nebraska. Tornado watches, which means conditions are right for funnel clouds to form and touch down, stretch from south central Texas, through most of Oklahoma, into Kansas, Nebraska and parts of South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa. Severe thunderstorm watches are in effect for most of New York and Connecticut, as well as parts of Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Wider storm threats cover nearly half of the continental United States - ranging from Wyoming and Colorado to Florida, most of New England and the Mid-Atlantic. On Tuesday, Kansas and Michigan became the latest sites of severe storm damage. In Gensese County, Michigan, four tornadoes - including two EF2s with winds up to 135 mph, tore swaths of destruction across the county. Inside-out: A roof was entirely blown off this Michigan home and several walls collapsed . Heartbreak: Tom Mahaffy, left, reaches out to console his wife Ashlee Mahaffy, as they walk through their home, which was utterly destroyed by a tornado . Crews worked to clean up the day after the tornadoes. Seen here, is a business in Mt Morris Township, Michigan . Numerous homes were badly damaged, but no serious injuries were reported. At least one tornado also touched down in north-central Kansas, flattening a pig farm and several other homes. None of the storms had anywhere left anywhere near the devastation wrought by a massive twister that killed 24 people and injured another 375 when it hit the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore. Bill Hooke, director of the American Meteorological Society, told NBC News mass-casualty twister strikes are likely to become more common in the coming years, thanks to the population growth patterns in large cities in Tornado Alley. He said fast-growing sprawling suburbs are becoming larger and denser as people leave small towns. Danger: Oklahoma City is in the bulls-eye of the newest storm systems to threaten Oklahoma with tornadoes . Battleship: Scientists say more disasters like what happened in Moore, Oklahoma, pictured, are likely because of urban sprawl . He compared the chances of a twister touching down in a populated area to a game of Battleship. 'Think of the Midwest as a blank sheet of graph paper with the towns and cities being the ships,' he said. 'When you keep adding people, and more urban sprawl, and farms turn into housing developments, tornadoes are much more likely to hit something. 'With that added into the picture, you’re exchanging many smaller encounters for fewer bigger ones. You have fewer events, fewer collisions, but when they do happen (the area) will be more populated and the damage will be greater.' For example, Cleveland County, Oklahoma - home to Moore - grew at a rate of 23percent in the last decade, nearly three times as fast as the state as a whole. One to two decades ago, the EF5 twister might have flattened several homes, but there would not have been the development in place for it to cause $2billion in damage and injury hundreds, Hooke added.","59million Americans are at risk of tornado touchdowns Wednesday .

Julie-Anne Wanless, a food bank co-ordinator in Liverpool told The Times: 'Most of us are only one or two pay packets away from not having any money,' she said. Recipients of food bank supplies are usually identified by care professionals such as doctors, health visitors, social workers, CAB and police. They are issued with a voucher which they can redeem at a food bank. The Trussell Trust food banks provide a minimum of three days emergency food and support to people experiencing crisis in the UK. Each foodbox contains a minimum of three days nutritionally balanced, non-perishable food. This could be delivered in a box to a client's home or received in the form of 10 meals at a the food bank centre.

Last year their UK food bank network fed over 60,000 people experiencing food poverty and this year they predict they will feed over 100,000 people. But the charity fears the situation is going to worsen in the near future. 'With incomes flat-lining or falling and prices steadily rising we expect the situation to get significantly worse. The full impact of the recent budget won’t kick in until 2013 and again squeezes people on lower incomes hardest so we are gearing up for a long period of intense pressure,' said Mr Mould. Almost 40 per cent of food bank clients last year experienced benefit delay, according to the charity. Anne-Marie and Danny, 22, were forced to use the food bank when a delay in benefits hit at the same time as Danny was off work with flu. He received no sick pay and finances got so tight that they were faced with eviction as well as having no money for food. The couple and their 18-month-old daughter, Tia, were living and sleeping in one room to reduce heating bills. They resorted to borrowing a tin of soup from their neighbours to stop little Tia going hungry. ‘I don’t know what we would have done next if it wasn’t for the foodbank’, said Danny. There are some people who believe that in Britain where more than 13 million people live in poverty, food banks are unnecessary. Last year former Tory MP, Edwina Currie told Radio 5 live she did not believe . people in the UK were going hungry. 'Are you telling me people in this country are going hungry? Seriously? Seriously?' she said in October. But a recent survey revealed that one in five Britons are borrowing money for groceries because of the soaring cost of living. One in four said they have had to dip into their savings to buy food or other daily essentials, while 19 per cent have gone into debt to do this. Another 10 per cent said they could envisage borrowing money to buy food in the future. The survey by consumer group Which? found that only 43 per cent of consumers feel they can afford to live on their income, while 36 per cent admitted to finding things difficult – twice the proportion who were struggling in 2006. A separate study by Scottish  Widows found evidence of families subsidising less well-off members to the tune of almost £13,000 in recent years. Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Over half of UK consumers are not coping on their current incomes. Worryingly, one in five people told us they had gone into debt just to buy food and other essential goods. ‘We know consumers are worried about rising food and energy prices. Our research also highlights significant changes being made to other buying decisions.’",One in five Britons are borrowing money for groceries because of the soaring cost of living .

Beneath an exclusive area of London (Baroness Thatcher lives nearby), behind the white stucco facade of one of the UK’s most expensive properties, I am 50ft underground. Barefoot, I pad across the leather, under-heated floor of a private gym towards a shimmering turquoise pool. The walls of this subterranean oasis are illuminated with video images of windswept beaches on wall-size screens. Tycoon David Graham's secret: A modest schoolhouse conceals a lavish mansion underground . Exterior: David Graham's Knightsbridge home . There is a treatment room with fluffy towels, scented candles and a massage bed, and a dark, tiled steam room. The soft lighting and air conditioning  are controlled by a computer. Being one level below the original basement, the whole floor is completely without natural light or fresh air. As a claustrophobic, I was expecting it to be about as inviting as Hitler’s Berlin bunker. But a combination of clever interior design, expert building and state-of-the-art technology means that it is blissful and cocoon-like. No wonder these new layers of London housing have become so fashionable. But acquiring this underworld paradise, and one of the largest indoor swimming pools in Belgravia, is never going to come cheap: this five-bedroom house in Graham Terrace is for sale with estate agents Ayrton Wylie at just under £16 million. This is a classic bankers’ bunker: an underground retreat with its own spa and pool. In a city where the smartest neighbourhoods have limitless cash, but are governed by strict planning laws, building up or sideways is rarely allowed. Going underground: Heiresses Petra, left, and Tamara Ecclestone both want to extend the basement of their homes . So digging down is the ever-more popular answer. These new extensions are known as ‘icebergs’ because while you may only see the house above ground level, there is much more: multiple secret storeys hidden below. Kensington & Chelsea planning department now do little else but assess residents’ downwardly mobile ambitions. They have received well over 800 applications for fancy basements in the past four years. The vast majority have been accepted. The pretty Victorian streets and squares are marked less by trees now than by angled conveyor belts transferring dug-out rubble and soil into skips to be carted away in trucks. It’s a complicated business — building works must be assiduously sealed to avoid flooding. Despite these technical considerations, some London streets in smart parts of town seem to have about three underground pools being built at any one time. Residents’ time is taken up either investigating their own subterranean potential or complaining about other people’s efforts. Not everyone sees the need for private spas in the middle of town. Take the recently released plans of Canadian cable TV tycoon David Graham, a ‘socialite Palm Beach type’ (according to his acquaintances), who was once married to Lord (Conrad) Black’s wife Barbara Amiel. He wants to build an ‘iceberg’ basement four storeys deep beneath a 19th-century schoolhouse in Knightsbridge. His underground extension will house a pool, a ballroom, a car lift and parking spaces, and will expand his house into a giant with most of it lurking beneath the surface. Neighbours, including novelist Edna O’Brien and the Duchess of St Albans, are furious. ‘Monstrous and unnecessary . . . it’s absolute greed. No one needs that much space,’ said the Duchess. ‘The commotion is going to be dreadful.’ A spokesman for Milner Street Area Residents Association added: ‘Why should we all suffer just so one man can indulge his fantasy?’ Digging out and shifting tons of earth around can, indeed, be pretty disruptive. The anger of neighbours is usually inflamed by the fact that the homeowner is often living elsewhere while the works are carried out, and so is immune to the stress and noise. Angry: Edna O'Brien, novelist and short story writer, is said to be opposed to David Graham's plans to extend his home . Goldman Sachs director Christoph Stanger had to apologise to his furious neighbours in Kensington this summer after his £1 million basement excavation — built to fit a playroom, guest room, gym, wine cellar and cinema into his £7 million house — turned into a Leonard Rossiter farce. Slight shifts in the foundations saw neighbours left stuck in their flats by doors that wouldn’t open, while cracks appeared like a hatching egg. Louise Stael von Holstein, who lives in the flat next door, said: ‘They’ve been digging since the beginning of the year, down into the basement, and it’s caused the house to subside. The basement flat in my block has got cracks everywhere.’ Even Stanger’s own house wobbled, and required emergency surgery. Neighbour Jonathan Wearing said wearily: ‘Once planning permission is granted there are only the fine words and empty promises of architects, surveyors and party-wall agreements to protect neighbours.’ In 2009, Jon Hunt, the wily founder of Foxtons Estate Agents who sold his company for £370 million just before the financial crash, put in an application for a whopping five-level basement that included a swimming pool, a full-sized underground tennis court and a car museum for his Ferraris, vintage cars and motorbikes ‘to be displayed like objects of art’. Steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal, meanwhile, has a jewelled swimming pool and warren of steam rooms made from the same marble as the Taj Mahal in the basement of his house (known, of course, as the Taj Mittal) in Kensington. Swish: Indian Lakshmi Mittal, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the world's largest steel company, ArcelorMittal, has a jewelled swimming pool and a warren of steam rooms in the basement of his home . Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone added 5,000 sq ft to the 17,000 sq ft Kensington house she recently bought for £45 million. Her basement extension included a bowling alley, swimming pool, disco and a ‘3D movie theatre with eight custom-designed seats each with its own refrigerator and popcorn maker’, according to her Los Angeles-based designer. She did however, in an uncharacteristic display of self-restraint, scrap the plans for a ‘dog spa’. Tamara’s younger sister Petra, not to be outdone, is doing her own basement in Chelsea. Her underground extension will have all the usual ‘toys’ and, apparently, a waterfall. Naturally. Isla Baring, a philanthropist who lives nearby, led furious residents who wrote to her father Bernie asking for compensation for the disruption. ‘We suggested that he give us some money rather than throwing it all away on his spoiled daughter so she can live in this enormous monster of a house,’ she said tartly. Meanwhile, elsewhere in Kensington, Howard Donald of boy band Take That is engaged in the ongoing excavation of his £4.4 million Kensington house to build ‘nanny quarters’ and a playroom. One neighbour said: ‘We predicted this would cause a lot of trouble and we were right. We’ve been condemned to months of noise and inconvenience. Normal family life is being ruined by this fashion for excavations.’ Extending: Take That's Howard Donald is excavating his Kensington home to build a 'nanny quarters' and a playroom . Such ‘iceberg’ extensions have become so desirable that even houses where no extra space is needed are having their foundations excavated. Take Witanhurst House in Highgate, North London. This enormous pile is to be doubled in size — even though there is already 45,000 sq ft of it. Plans of the proposed extension show two home cinemas, a spa with a hair salon and massage room, a 70ft swimming pool, and a car park for  25 cars. The entire enterprise is thought to be costing more than £50 million.  When completed, it will be the largest home in London not owned by the Royal Family. Prime London property prices have risen 43 per cent in the past three years, leading many homeowners to look at ways of improving their existing properties before considering a move. But while increasing your square footage may increase the value of your property, you need very deep pockets for a deep dig. And what do you need all that underground space for? Roarie Scarisbrick, of Property Vision, which acts for top-end buyers, sounds a note of caution. ‘A bedroom legally has to have a window — not unreasonably — so you quickly run out of things to do with sub-basements. ‘Icebergs just don’t feel right. I’ve seen — with a heavy heart — golf simulation rooms, a pilates studio, a cinema, and a massive pool with a retractable roof that turned into a dancefloor. But the further you go down, the further you are from proper ventilation and daylight.’ The rich used to build towers and follies as trophies of their wealth, although there has always been the odd rich eccentric who fancied life underground. In the mid-19th century, the fifth Duke of Portland, a strange, shy agrophobic, built a web of tunnels 15 miles long, and a huge pink ballroom underneath his estate at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire. Not surprisingly for such a withdrawn character, he never held a ball there. At Witley Park in Godalming, a mining magnate called Whitaker Wright built a billiards room with a glass ceiling under the lake. This display of wealth didn’t do him any good in the long run. His empire collapsed and he committed suicide. In 1903, the estate was bought by Lord Pirrie, the shipbuilder who went on to build the Titanic. Icebergs. You really can’t trust them.","The rich and famous are downwardly mobile - with an increasing trend to extend homes underground through the basement rather than overground .

Extra charges are expected to be added once the remains are identified. 'There’s evidence and statements that have led us to check this property,' said Police Chief Dwayne Flourney. 'We believe that evidence that is linked to Dontrell’s disappearance is on the property.' Dontrell's father Calvin Melvin Jr has also been arrested and was the last person to see the child . The child's disappearance came to . light after a routine welfare check at the home on Wednesday discovered . there were only two children there when there should have been three. Melvin told police he took Dontelle to . his parents in Pompano so he could have a better life with them. When . police went there, the child's grandparents said they hadn't seen the . boy in more than a year. The mother claims she did not question this account until October last year and reported the matter to Child Protection. The Florida Department of Children and Families conducted an investigation but the findings were unknown, Flournoy said. Child protection administrators too failed to notice Dontrell was gone, even though they received a call to their abuse hotline last year reporting concerns about Dontrell's welfare. But the call was deemed unworthy of investigation, according to the Miami Herald. Fluornoy said: 'The mother previously gave an indication that she hasn't seen her child since July 2011, and she has questioned the father on numerous occasions as to the whereabouts of the child.' Melvin initially fled after police went to his parent's home but he was found a few hours later and changed his story to say that he dropped his son off at a Miami Gardens fire station utilizing the safe haven law. There is no record of this. After Dontrell disappeared, his parents went on to have another child. The mother has a third child with a different father. Police are appealing to the public for help in finding Dontrell, who would now be two-years-old.","Dontrell Melvin was five months old when he was last seen .

Mr Iffrig became an icon of the Boston Marathon bombings after being pictured crumpled on the ground . Horrific: Mr Iffrig can be seen falling to the ground as the explosion rocked the sidelines near the finish line of the marathon . Lucky: Mr Iffrig suffered little more than a skinned knee after the blast and counts himself lucky to be alive . Mr Iffrig said he felt the impact of one of the blasts as he was feet away from crossing the finish line into what was his third Boston Marathon, and it caused him to drop to the ground. He told Good Morning America: 'All of a sudden this enormous blast right next to me and it just kind of buckled my legs. 'So as soon as I hit the blacktop I started looking around to see how I was doing and I seemed to be OK but I didn’t get up right away.' He told the show that a marathon worker helped him up and got him to the finish line. He told his local paper, The Herald Of Everett, that he knew the noise was a bomb. 'It was only....feet away from me,' he said.  'It was really loud.' He told ESPN2 he was heading for the finish line and 'feeling pretty good' when he heard a terrible explosion. 'The shockwaves must have hit my body and my legs just started going like noodles and I knew I was going down right there.' 'My legs just gave out,' he told CNN on Monday night. He said most of the runners just kept on going, but he went down because he was nearest the blast. He said he never lost consciousness but described how he 'woke up' a little later and saw what he believed to be a part of a bomb nearby. Mr Iffrig said what he saw was a . casing that looked like a coffee can, but added: 'Then all this smoke . was coming from someplace, and I wasn't able to see too much.' A race official came to help him, and he struggled to his feet and crossed the finishing line. Viewers who watched the footage of the first blast will be heartened by the news of what happened to Mr Iffrig, who appeared seriously hurt as he crumpled to the ground. While he was down, Boston Globe photographer John Tlumacki took a picture that has already become the iconic image of the explosions.  It shows the elderly runner on the ground, shielding his face from the smoke as Boston police officers leap into action around him. According to numerous reports, the bombs that detonated were packed with ball bearings. Three people died in the twin blasts and at least 183 were injured - many of them losing legs, calves or feet in the explosions. Mr Iffrig, a veteran of 45 marathons, said he didn't even think about not crossing the finish line at the time because his head was set on the race.

'After you've run 26 miles you're not going to stop there.' He said he finished in just over 4 hours, and suffered little more than a scraped knee. Mr Iffrig then walked six blocks back to his hotel room, turned on the television, and realized the magnitude of what . had happened. 'It was a close one though, boy. I'll tell you, that scared me,' he told his local paper. 'He's a hell of a runner.  He runs a lot, and he's fast.' Mr Iffrig's son, Mark Iffrig, from Seattle, was tracking his father's progress online and didn't realise what had happened until he saw news of the event and went to ring his father. He said: 'It's horrible.  He said it was quite a concussive blast.  He was a little dazed.  Someone helped him up - he was only about 10ft from the finish line.' Mr Iffrig junior added: 'He's a hell of a runner.  He runs a lot, and he's fast.' The runner's granddaughter, Amanda Kilburn from Ellensburg, said she was walking across campus at Central Washington University when she heard there had been a bomb at the Boston marathon. She said: 'I kind of freaked out and ran home to call my dad.  He said my grandpa was OK.' Bill Iffrig took up running in the 1970s to help keep him fit for his main love of mountain-climbing. Eventually the climbing gave way to serious running, and Mr Iffrig went on to win races across the U.S. A race volunteer helped Mr Iffrig to his feet after the first blast, as a second explosion can be seen in the background.

A man in a small Michigan town is livid after he claims a St Louis police officer gunned down his beloved eight-year-old golden retriever. St. Louis police officer Matt Vanhall was on patrol in the small neighbourhood when he said the dog, Scout, darted in front of his police cruiser. According to his report, Vanhall followed the dog who then began biting his leg. After the dog wouldn’t stop, Vanhall said he had no choice but to shoot him. Scroll down for video . Gunned down: Scout, an eight-year-old golden retriever, was shot seven times by a St. Louis, Michigan police officer . According to the Morning Sun, Vanhall’s shooting of Brian and Hillary Goetzinger’s prized pet turned the small town, located in the centre of the state, upside down. One of the Goetzinger’s neighbours told local news station WNEM a different story. ‘I heart “pop pop pop pop pop,” and I thought what is going on here?’ She added: ‘He just started shooting (Scout,) he just kept shooting him in the head,’ Lori Walmsley said. She told the Sun that the only reason that Scout was growling in the first place was because he was upset at being forced to leave an area with which he was comfortable. Scout was rushed to a veterinary clinic, but succumbed to his wounds. Shot dead: Scout was shot in a neighbour's yard . Wrongful death?

An Egyptian woman has been ordered to pay her former husband £5240 in compensation after he discovered she had lied to him about her virginity. The man accused his wife of deceiving him into believing she had never been married before - and therefore a virgin - and of having surgery to fake her virginity, during a bitter divorce battle which went to the court of appeal in Abu Dhabi. The court upheld a previous ruling that found she had deceived her husband and increased the compensation she must now pay for the emotional damage she caused him. Accused: An Egyptian bride has been ordered to pay more than £5,000 compensation to her husband after he accused her of lying about being a virgin before they married (file picture) The money is also meant to help him overcome the stigma of what is considered in some parts of Arab society to be an embarrassing ordeal for him and his family. The case centred around the original marriage contract made by the couple where the Egyptian bride, the court heard, allegedly faked a number of key points about her background. The court established the woman had been married earlier and had divorced her first husband. It also acknowledged that she had made false statements 'with the help of her father, in the couple’s marriage contract - stating that she had never been married or had sex,' according to press reports. The demise of the couple’s marriage came about following a spiteful sms message sent to the current husband, the court heard. Court records show that after three years of marriage, and the birth of a child, her current husband received an anonymous text message informing him that his wife had been married in the past. Tradition: Divorce is still frowned upon by some parts of Arab society and is seen as an embarrassment for those involved and their families . The text message was later followed up by a copy of the woman’s divorce document which was also sent to the husband as proof, prompting the man to file for divorce against his Egyptian wife for lying to him. He claimed compensation from her for the emotional damage he suffered, claiming that he was 'suffering from depression and had lost trust in the people around him as a result of her deception.' The husband also accused his wife of undergoing surgery to make it seem as though she was a virgin – a simple operation which is becoming increasingly common in some Arab countries. This is far from the first bizarre divorce case in the United Arab Emirates. In July of last year a Dubai court reportedly awarded an Emirati woman about £16,000 in a shocking divorce settlement, after she claimed her husband was 'obsessed' with internet pornography. It was also heard in court that their wedding was doomed from the beginning when the bridegroom allegedly admitted on their honeymoon to having sexually transmitted diseases which were currently being medically treated.","He accused her of lying to him about her virginity before marriage .

Guilty: Casey Fury, pictured, was sentenced to a little more than 17 years in federal prison on Friday . A shipyard worker who set fire to rags aboard a nuclear submarine because he wanted to go home was sentenced today to 17 years in federal prison for the blaze that transformed the vessel into a fiery furnace, injured seven people and caused about $450 million in damage. Casey James Fury also was ordered to pay $400 million in restitution by a judge who weighed his lack of criminal record and the severity of the fire before imposing a 205-month prison sentence. The 25-year-old Fury, formerly of Portsmouth, N.H., pleaded guilty to setting the May 23 fire while the USS Miami was undergoing a 20-month dry dock overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery. The civilian painter and sand blaster told authorities that he wanted to go home because he was suffering from an anxiety attack. He told them he never envisioned such extensive damage when he used a lighter to set fire to a plastic bag of rags that he left on a bunk in a state room. The blaze quickly grew into an inferno spewing superheated smoke that billowed from hatches. It took 12 hours and the efforts of more than 100 firefighters to save the submarine. Seven people were hurt, the Navy has said. Eric Hardy, a shipyard firefighter who suffered back and shoulder injuries fighting the blaze, called it the worst fire he had ever seen. 'The best way I could describe it, sir, is fighting a fire in a wood stove and climbing down a chimney,' Hardy told the judge. Fury, who had been working in the . torpedo room, fled to the safety of the pier, prosecutors said, and . watched as firefighters went down hatches and into the burning Los . Angeles class-attack submarine, staying inside for only minutes at a . time because of smoke and blistering heat. Inferno: Fury admitted lighting the blaze on the USS Miami nuclear submarine, pictured, which caused $400 million worth of damage . Hardy said the smoke inside the sub was so thick he couldn't see more than a foot and his flashlight was virtually useless. Firefighters had 20-minute air packs, but it was so hard to get aboard sub and move around inside that they were limited to two to three minutes of actual firefighting. About three weeks later, Fury set a second fire outside the crippled sub, again because of anxiety. That fire caused no damage. He pleaded guilty to two counts of arson in November. Assistant U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee said it was telling that Fury set a second fire after the extensive damage caused by the first one. But the defense lawyer David Beneman . contended Fury suffered from depression and anxiety and that he never . intended to harm anyone. Beneman described a 'spin cycle' caused by . Fury's failure to receive adequate treatment. Fury spoke briefly Friday, apologizing to the people who were hurt and saying he meant no disrespect to the Navy. 'From . the bottom of my heart, I'm truly sorry for what I have done,' he said. When he's release from prison, he'll have to serve five years of . probation. Faced life: Fury pictured, could have been sentenced to life in prison . Depressed: Fury, pictured, was taking sleeping pills and medication for anxiety and depression . U.S. District Judge George J. Singal weighed the extreme damage caused by the fire against Fury's lack of criminal record, which consisted of one drunken driving arrest, in finding a sentence in the middle of the 235 months sought by prosecutors and 18 months sought by the defense. He said he was troubled that Fury set the second fire. 'One of the lessons is that a small fire can cause tremendous damage,' Singal said. 'Yet within a month he starts another one.' The first blaze damaged forward compartments including living quarters, a command and control center and the torpedo room. It did not reach the rear of the Groton, Conn.-based submarine, where the nuclear propulsion components are located. Metallurgists who examined the hull found no major damage and the Navy determined it was cost-effective to repair the vessel with a goal of returning it to service in the middle of 2015. But its future is now uncertain. Repairs have been postponed under mandatory budget cuts known as sequestration. Rear Adm. Richard Breckenridge, a submarine group commander, said the ship's extensive damage had ripple effects around the Navy, delaying repairs on other vessels and leading to longer deployments for thousands of sailors.","Casey James Fury was sentenced today after the May 23, 2012, fire that injured seven people and caused $450 million in damage at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, New Hampshire .

The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that among the more than 1,300 youths who reported victimization by adult staff, 9 out of 10 were male juvenile detainees reporting sexual activity with female staff members. According to the bureau, about 2.5 per cent of juveniles, or 450, reported a sexual incident involving another youth last year, and 7.7 per cent, or 1,390, reported an incident involving facility staff. Victims: Young males made up more than 90 per cent of the juvenile population at the facilities surveyed . Georgia, Illinois, Ohio and South Carolina each had a sexual victimization rate of more than 15 per  cent. Delaware, Massachusetts, New York and the District of Columbia had no reported incidents of sexual victimization. The survey mandated by the Prison Rape Elimination Act defines sexual victimization as any unwanted sexual activity between youth and all sexual activity between youth and adult staff. Young males made up more than 90 per cent of the juvenile population at the facilities surveyed, and women accounted for nearly 45 per cent of the staff.

'It's deeply troubling that staff – the very people charged with helping these young people turn their lives around – are the primary perpetrators of sexual abuse,' said Lovisa Stannow, executive director of Just Detention International, an advocacy group. 'Today's report illustrates the fundamental failure of many juvenile detention facilities to keep their youth safe, and to demand that staff uphold the most basic standards of professional behavior.' There was marked improvement in the figures between 2008-09 and 2012. The rate of sexual victimization dropped from 12.6 per cent to 9.9 per cent in that period.

A Navy warship might seem an unlikely place for a ballerina to practice her pirouettes and plies. But that is exactly what happened on board HMS Ocean after Officer of the Watch - and talented dancer - Lieutenant Anna Sanocki won a place at a prestigious U.S. ballet school. The 30-year-old naval officer's superiors granted her special permission to attend a two week summer programme at Boston Ballet School - and she used an impromptu dance studio set up on Britain's biggest warship to prepare for her 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'. Talented: Officer of the Watch Anna Sanocki was one of only 25 people picked for the summer programme at the prestigious Boston Ballet School in the U.S. Lt Sanocki, from Plymouth in Devon, has served around the world on board the assault ship, but she kept up her dancing at the same time after falling in love with ballet at university. She was one of only 25 dancers picked for the school's summer programme on the back of her ten years experience as an amateur ballerina. 'There are a lot more ballet schools in America than there are in the UK, and it's much more common for adults to do ballet over there,' said the naval officer, who trained under some of the world's best instructors during her sojourn at the Boston Ballet School. 'Boston has always been on my list of places to visit, so I got to kill two birds with one stone.' Unlikely setting: Amateur ballerina and naval officer Anna is pictured practising her moves on the deck of HMS Ocean . Lt Sanocki said she had been hesitant . about applying for the scheme at first, because it clashed with the . London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. HMS Ocean is currently moored . on the River Thames at Greenwich as part of the security operation . surrounding the event. But the ship's commanding officer, Captain Andrew Betton, encouraged her application. 'Initially I was a bit nervous about . bringing it up, because I knew about our tasking for the Olympics and . Paralympics and how busy we were likely to be. 'But when I spoke to him about it, the captain was really supportive of the idea. 'He told me I had to go, that it was a . once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and that he was sure they could get . around my absence somehow.' Lt Sanocki's crew mates even helped her by turning a spare compartment on the ship into an impromptu dance studio. 'Some of the crew bring bikes and golf clubs on board. I just bring a barre instead,' she explained. 'Lots of people think ballet is easy, that it . isn’t exercise, but it is,' the officer said. 'It’s . a very different kind of fitness and it’s all about making it look easy . and graceful when you’re actually working really hard. 'It’s a pretty weird hobby for a naval officer to have. 'But . it makes me happy so I don’t mind. When you’re focusing so intently on . every movement, the rest of the world just disappears into the . background. It’s very cathartic.' Lt .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 17:23 EST, 14 November 2011 . The Pentagon detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has been declared the most expensive prison on Earth. The Guantanamo Bay Prison, which opened on the U.S. naval base in Cuba in January 2002, costs U.S. taxpayers $800,000 per year per each of its 171 inmates, according to a new report. That's more than even the most expensive four-year college degree in the U.S., and more than 30 times the cost of keeping captives on U.S. soil at $25,000 per inmate. Facilities: A class area in Camp VI in Guantánamo Bay, where 171 prisoners are currently detained . According to The Miami Herald report by Carol Rosenberg, officials would not accommodate a request for a line-by-line analysis of expenses. The executive order creating the Guantanamo Bay detention camp was . signed by President Bush on November 18, 2001, meaning the ten year . anniversary is little over a week away. The closure of Guantanamo was a . popular part of Barack Obama's presidential campaign, but since coming . to office it has appeared more difficult than first thought. After setbacks due to incomplete . files on many detainees and problems finding a place to put the inmates if the camp were to shudder, the closure of the camps is still . on President Obama's to-do list, and its facilities still funded as an open-ended battlefield necessity. Sources, however, tell the Herald the operation functions more like 'a five-star resort and not a detention facility for terrorists', as Florida Republican Representative and former Army lieutenant Allen West pointed out. Education: Shackles line the floor of a classroom in Guantánamo Bay Camp VI, where inmates learn skills such as resume writing . This summer in a letter to Congress, . the Obama administration confirmed the Defense Department 'spends . approximately $150 million per year on detention operations at . Guantánamo, currently at a rate of more than $800,000 per detainee.' 'Meanwhile, our federal prisons spend a little over $25,000 per year, . per prisoner, and federal courts and prosecutors routinely handle . numerous terrorist case a year well within their operating budgets,' continued the letter, written by Attorney General . Eric Holder and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and other Cabinet members . to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, and others. By that time, Congress - now tasked . with cutting $1.2trillion from the federal budget before year's end - had . allocated $139million to run the centre in 2010, two years after the arrival of its last inmate. Federal funding: Congress allocated $139million to run the centre in 2010, two years after the arrival of its last inmate . Healthy: A spokesman for the prison said it 'executed $2.4M in FY11 for detainee rations' - amounting to $38.45 worth of food per day per inmate . However, the camps spokesman, Navy . Commander Tamsen Reese, told the newspaper the prison 'executed $2.4M in . FY11 for detainee rations'. That amounts to each prisoner getting $38.45 worth of food per day - nearly 17 times as much as . the State of Florida spends to feed its prisoners. And nearly five times the amount the average American spends on food daily, according to the report. Inmates are also treated to amenities like satellite television, and there are plans to build another soccer field at the detention centre. Then there is the expense of paying . for the revolving staff of 1,850 troops, linguists, intelligence . analysts, federal agents and contract workers. A guard at Guantánamo can make anywhere from $2,900 to $7,800 a month depending on their military rank; a guard with the rank of third class Petty Officer earns nearly $3,000 a month. This is in addition to receiving the same combat pay that a troop fighting in Afghanistan would receive. Employees also have their own gym, . dining rooms and movie theatre that, and are . sometimes allowed to move their families to the deployment. Due to the secret nature of the evidence, religious tensions among prisoners and high-profile aspects of many of the detainees, the camp, and those involved, have long been a point of controversy. Most of the occupants are terror suspects, and many aspects of the cases are shrouded in secrecy.

More than 11,000 rape kits that were left in police storage, some for 20 years, are to finally be tested after a $4 million grant from the attorney-general. The discovery of the kits gathering dust in a Detroit warehouse in 2009 has shocked prosecutors, who have pushed for the evidence to be processed and the rapists to be brought to justice. On Wednesday Michigan Governor Rick . Snyder and attorney-general Bill Schuette announced that $4 million in . settlement funds will be used to examine the kits. Scroll down for video: . Justice: Prosecutor Kym Worthy, announces the $4 million testing fund with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, left, and attorney-general Bill Schuette. The money will be used to test thousands of rape kits found in storage . 'There are people who have been victims that are in these kits that deserve justice,' Mr Snyder said. The discovery of the rape kits prompted Michigan prosecutor Kym . Worthy to campaign for the DNA evidence to be processed and the rapists brought to justice. 'What we were potentially looking at, at . that time, was over 10,000 rape kits, representing over 10,000 cases . where women had reported, whose lives and what happened to them was . sitting on a shelf and nobody cared,' she told Rock Center in February. 'I was shocked, and I think I was . kind of stunned – and not too much stuns me.' In 2009 Mrs Worthy's assistant prosecutor Rob Spada discovered the kits as he was given a tour of a Detroit police storage warehouse while helping them to organize their records. 'I saw numerous . racks with cardboard boxes, and they told me at that point those were . rape kits. I immediately asked the representatives, were they tested rape . kits or untested rape kits. And at that point they said, ""We don’t . know"",' he said. Forgotten: More than 11,000 untested rape kits were found among police files in this Detroit warehouse . Campaign: Prosecutor Kym Worthy and her staff volunteered their time to work through the backlog . The rape kits are about half the size of a small pizza box. They contain documentation, supplies for technicians, swabs and other items to collect samples, according to CBS Detroit. The Detroit Crime Commission has . supported the campaign to have the kits tested. It will cost between $1,200 and $1,500 to have each one processed. However, of the 569 tested so far, 136 have matched results in the FBI's combined DNA index system. And 32 of those matches were for serial rapists, Mrs Worthy told NBC News. 'To know that we had all of these . potential victims sitting out there, all of them, mostly women, and . nothing had been done, was just truly appalling,' she said. One of the women whose evidence was left in the warehouse was a mother, who was raped by an unknown intruder at her Detroit home in 1997 as her children slept in the bed next to her. Fourteen years after she came forward to give evidence and a statement, the victim told Rock Center she was shocked to receive a knock on the door to say her case was now being investigated. After Mr Spada discovered the forgotten kits, Prosecutor Worthy's staff volunteered their time to help sort through the records and try to build cases. Prosecutor Worthy, who was the victim of a sexual assault in law school, said she also discovered that forgotten rape kits were not just a problem in Detroit. At the time, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and many other major cities faced the same backlog. The campaign group End the Backlog, estimates tens of thousand of kits remain untested across the U.S. adding that a lack of time and technology had added to the problem. Backlog: Constraints on time and technology has caused delays in testing rape kits in many U.S. cities . Discovery: Rob Spada stands outside the Detroit warehouse where he found the untested kits gathering dust . Mr Snyder backed the prosecutor's campaign, adding: 'It's right for our criminal justice system because there are . bad people out there who should be put away. This will . allow us to do that.' Mr Schuette added: 'Twice women were violated, once by the rape and second by the justice was put in a box; put on a shelf. That’s going to end now.' 'Today marks the beginning of healing closure and justice for women who’ve been brutalized.' Prosecutor Worthy's office will now begin building cases around the old evidence.

E.W. Jackson, a minister from Chesapeake, beat six other candidates to win the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket behind Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. Since then he has been no stranger to controversy. So far he has compared the Democratic Party to a 'slave market' and said Planned Parenthood is more of a threat to black Americans than the Klu Klux Klan. Now  the National Review’s Betsy Woodruff has posted passages from his 2008 book, 'Ten Commandments to an Extraordinary Life'. In it he claims that 'emptying' oneself with yoga, can lead the devil to occupy the void. He writes that while the word meditation 'conjures images' of Yoga and striving for nirvana: 'The purpose of such meditation is to empty oneself. … Satan is happy to invade the empty vacuum of your soul and possess it. 'That is why people serve Satan without ever knowing it or deciding to, but no one can be a child of God without making a decision to surrender to him. Beware of systems of spirituality which tell you to empty yourself. ' He adds that people could l end up filled with something 'you probably do not want.', Yahoo! news reports.

In a 'message to black Christians' posted on YouTube last year, Jackson says, 'It is time to end the slavish devotion to the Democrat Party.' He has written that 'emptying' oneself with yoga, can lead the devil to occupy the void . Jackson, a minister, he also compared the Democratic Party to a 'slave market' and said Planned Parenthood is more of a threat to black Americans than the Klu Klux Klan . 'The Democrat Party has created an unholy alliance between certain so-called civil rights leaders and Planned Parenthood, which has killed unborn black babies by the tens of millions,' he says. 'Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was,' he continues. 'And the Democratic Party and their black civil rights allies are partners in this genocide.' Also in the YouTubevideo, he condemns Democrats for 'equating homosexuality with being black.' He says that discrimination against both groups cannot be lumped together under the same civil rights umbrella. 'They can keep their homosexuality private,' he says. 'You and I cannot hide being black.' Jackson has also reportedly made a number of anti-gay statements in the past, comparing homosexuals to paedophiles and calling them 'frankly very sick people psychologically, mentally and emotionally.'","E.W.

These literature-loving ladies are taking a leaf out of the men's book - by sunbathing topless in parks and public spaces. A group of friends decided to form a topless book club so women can enjoy relaxing and tanning in public, just like men. Using New York law, which says women can go bare chested anywhere men can, the social group formed so women could meet and safely sunbathe together. The women said they take the literature part of the book club very seriously . Topless Pulp Fiction members said they have received overwhelmingly positive reaction from other women . The women, who withheld their names to protect themselves online, take photographs of themselves sunbathing around New York in just shorts and bikini bottoms. Among the locations favoured by the book club are Central Park, hotel rooftops, riverside walkways and even the steps of the Metropolitan Museum. One of the group's founders said the response to their meetings, which are always formed of six or more women, has been overwhelmingly positive. She said: 'For every woman who glares when we pass and mutters: ""There are children around"", there are a dozen who come over and thank us for what we're doing. 'The best was an elderly woman who came over with her miniature poodle earlier this summer and spent an hour sitting with us. 'She was just so delighted. It felt wonderful to make her day.' The group (pictured in Central Park) said if a man can show his chest then a woman should be allowed to . The group meet outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art (right) and Central Park and in roof gardens (left) The founders knew the law allowed a woman to be topless anywhere a man could be, but had never seen it in practice. Hesitant to test the law as individuals, the women found the confidence to remove their bikini tops in the company of friends. The founder said: 'There's no rational reason a woman's breasts should be forbidden if a man's chest is not. 'The more we show people that seeing a woman's nipples won't cause the sky to fall, the more freedom and equality women will enjoy.' As well as making a feminist statement, the group takes the literary aspect of the book club quite seriously. The founder said: 'That probably makes it pretty boring for someone who isn't interesting in the books and discussions. 'People's significant others sometimes wonder if there's something sexual about the group. They say they want people to realise there is nothing shocking about a woman's breasts . 'But when they come, they discover it's just a batch of friends sitting around in the sun, reading and discussing books, laughing and eating cupcakes.' Although the book club occasionally receive inappropriate stares, it has not deterred them having fun. The founder said: 'I think we get fewer catcalls and less harassment when we're out topless in a group than when any one of us is just walking down the street fully clothed. 'We've been approached by the police a couple of times, but every time the police have confirmed that what we're doing is completely legal and they've been very polite about it.' As well as having fun and enjoying reading in the sun, the club hopes to inspire other women. The founder said: 'Our hope would be that we set an example for other women, and that a few years from now a woman going bare-chested in the park or even on the street would attract no more attention than a bare-chested man.'","Group used a law that allows women to be topless anywhere a man can be .

All 20,000 British troops will be withdrawn from Germany by 2020, bringing to an end a continuous presence since 1945, it will be announced today. Under the Strategic Defence and Security Review, hundreds of military personnel will return home in January. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that an announcement will be made about the pull-out of UK forces, who have had a presence on the Rhine since the end of the Second World War.

Timetable: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is due to announce detailed plans for the withdrawal today . The forces were initially tasked with ensuring the stability of Germany after the fall of the Nazis, but troops remained to deter the Russians from advancing from the East as Cold War tensions grew. According to the Daily Telegraph, . 1,800 troops will leave by January and another 8,200 by 2015. The rest . will be back by the end of the decade - 15 years earlier than first . proposed. The withdrawal has been accelerated as part of the budget cuts that aim to streamline the Armed Forces. The . first unit to move will be 43 Close Support Squadron of the Royal . Logistics Corps, which will go from Gutersloh in Germany to Abingdon in . Oxfordshire, it was reported.

Surrendering German troops march past anti-tank gun after British forces press into Germany in 1945. Allied forces occupied the country after the fall of the Nazis to ensure stability in Europe . At the end of the Second World War, Germany was divided by the Allies into four military zones. During the 1945 Potsdam Conference it was decided that the French should occupy the southwest, the British the northwest, the U.S would take the south, and the Soviets the east. Thus began British troops' deployment int he country. And while the aim was to stabilise Germany after the fall of the Nazis, a threat was emerging from the Soviets, who were pressing ahead with Communist expansionism in eastern Europe. The growing tensions were outlined in the famous 'iron curtain' speech by Sir Winston Churchill, pictured, in 1946 which many consider to be the beginning of the Cold War. He was referring to the ideological fighting and physical boundary that now split Europe into two separate areas - those occupied by the Allies in the west and Russia. In the speech, the former British Prime Minister said: 'From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.' The British Army very soon bolstered troop numbers in Germany over fears the country could become a battleground with Russia. British Armed Forces personnel and civilians come under the banner British Forces Germany (BFG), which was fist established as the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). Their presence was significantly reduced following the end of the Cold War in 1989. Under the changes, 2nd Battalion the . Royal Anglian Regiment will reportedly go to former RAF base Cottesmore . in Rutland, which closed earlier this year. Personnel from 7 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps (RLC) will also go to Cottesmore. The MoD is also expected to announce . what will happen to main UK bases in Germany, with British facilities in . Celle and Munster to be handed back to the German authorities. The Rheindahlen Military Complex is to . close, and Waterbeach Barracks in Cambridgeshire will be sold. The MoD . is also expected to outline a restructuring of the hierarchy of the . Army's regional brigades and divisions. This . includes the closure of regional headquarters in Edinburgh and . Shrewsbury, whose work is to be taken over by a new HQ in Aldershot. British Forces Germany, as the Armed Forces in the country are known, are concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The divisional HQ is located at Herford, near Bielefeld, with garrisons at Gütersloh, Hohne, and Paderborn. British bases in Germany still represent the biggest deployment of UK forces overseas. With civilians, families and children, the British contingent in the country stands at more than 43,000. Last year, it was claimed the UK will have to pay out tens of millions of pounds to Germany before pulling forces out of the country. The bill will have to be settled to ‘make good’ land and property used by British forces, former Labour Defence Minister Kevan Jones insisted. MoD sources conceded that the withdrawal would have ‘initial costs’ but insisted there would be long-term savings of more than £1billion from the withdrawal.

Curiosity has sent back an incredible panoramic image of the towering mountain which looms above the crater it has spent the last eight months exploring on the surface of Mars. Aeolis Mons rises nearly three-and-a-half miles (18,000ft) from the centre of the Gale Crater, making its base to peak height greater than any mountain on Earth. Known unofficially as Mount Sharp, the massive peak is an enormous layered-mound of eroded sediment rising above the crater floor location Curiosity has been exploring. Mountain on Mars: This mosaic of images from the Mast Camera . (Mastcam) on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity shows Aeolis Mons in a . white-balanced colour adjustment that makes the sky look overly blue but . shows the terrain as if under Earth-like lighting. White-balanced versions help scientists recognise rock materials . The lower slopes of Mount Sharp remain the final destination for the mission, though the rover will first spend many . more weeks around a location called 'Yellowknife Bay'. That's where it recently found evidence of a past environment which could have been once favourable for microbial life. A . pair of mosaics, just released by Nasa, assembled from dozens of . telephoto images taken by Curiosity shows Mount Sharp in dramatic . detail. The component images . were taken by the 100-millimeter-focal-length telephoto lens camera . mounted on the right side of Curiosity's remote sensing mast on . September 20 last year, the 45th Martian day of the rover's mission on . the Red Planet. Nasa has released two versions of the . mosaic image. One has been white-balanced to show the terrain as if . under Earth-like lighting, casting the sky as rather more blue than it . really appears. White-balanced versions help scientists recognise rock materials based on their terrestrial experience. Nasa's Curiosity rover has found that Mars could have once supported primitive life. An analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover, pictured right, found key chemical ingredients. 'We have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life, that probably if this water was around and you had been there, you would have been able to drink it,' said John Grotzinger, Curiosity's project scientist. 'A fundamental question for this mission is whether Mars could have supported a habitable environment,' said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the agency's headquarters in Washington. 'From what we know now, the answer is yes.' The groundbreaking analysis by the chemical lab onboard the Curiosity rover shows ancient Mars could have supported living microbes. Scientists identified sulphur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder Curiosity drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed in the Gale Crater last month. To . a human observer on Mars, the sky over the planet would look like more . of a butterscotch colour. A version of the mosaic with raw colour, as a . typical smart-phone camera would show the scene, has also been released. In . both versions, the sky has been filled out by extrapolating colour and . brightness information from the portions of the sky that were captured . in images of the terrain. Nasa's . Mars Science Laboratory project is using Curiosity and the rover's ten . science instruments to investigate environmental history within Gale . Crater. Aeolis Mons forms . the central peak within the crater and is located around 5.08°S . 137.85°E, rising 5.5 km (18,000 ft) high from the valley floor. It . is about the same height as Mons Huygens, the tallest lunar mountain, . and taller than Mons Hadley, which was  visited by lunar explorers . aboard Apollo 15 in 1971.

Four Maryland  abortion clinics have been shut down and three doctors have had their licenses suspended after a patient died at one clinic and regulators say they found lax procedures at all four. The clinics, run by Associates in OB/GYN Care, were shuttered last month after state regulators received a complaint about a patient receiving an abortion-inducing drug with no doctor present. The patient, 38-year-old Maria Santiago, underwent the procedure on February 13 in Baltimore and was 'still very drowsy' when she was allegedly left in the care of an unlicensed medical assistant. She suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and died later at a hospital. Regulators said her doctor, Iris Dominy, had failed to use a defibrillator - which was later found to be broken. Dominy is one of the three suspended doctors, according to the Maryland Board of Physicians. Two more, Drs. Michael Basco and Mansour Panah, have also had their licenses suspended. Scene: Three doctors have had their licenses suspended after a patient died at an abortion clinic, located in this complex in Baltimore, in February after she was being watched by an untrained worker . The allegations appear in documents posted online by the state Office of Health Care Quality, which regulates the clinics -  in Baltimore, Cheverly, Frederick and Silver Spring - and ordered them to close. The clinics are affiliated with . American Women's Services, a company controlled by Dr. Steven Brigham, a beleaguered abortionist whose license has been suspended or . revoked in five states. He was at one point charged with murder for late-term abortions, but the charges were dropped. Dominy lost her license because unlicensed employees at the . clinic were dispensing drugs to patients, the regulators noted, not because of the patient's death. Basco was on duty at the Baltimore . clinic on May 4 when an unlicensed clinic employee performed an . ultrasound on a patient and found that the woman was . carrying more than one fetus. The employee then gave the woman . misoprostol, a drug that's used to induce abortions, according . to the Maryland Board of Physicians. Suspended: Michael Basco, left, was on duty when an unlicensed employee gave a patient drugs. The clinics are affiliated with Dr Steven Brigham, right, who has had his license suspended in five states . The patient who died after visiting the Associates in OB/GYN Care in Baltimore on February 13 was 38-year old Maria Santiago. Santiago was 12.5 weeks pregnant at the time of the abortion and her doctor, Iris Dominy told Maryland Department of Health inspectors that Santiago slept through her abortion. The doctor then left the woman in the room with an unqualified worker, according to the inspector's report. The worker filled out paperwork as Santiago lay on the table. She later called for a second worker to help her move Santiago to the recovery area. The second worker noticed Santiago was pale and not breathing, and they notified Dominy. No one at the clinic had current CPR certification, and there was no attempt to use a defibrillator, which was found to be broken. Santiago's death certificate showed she died from Severe Pulminary Edema, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and Hypoxia Brain Injury. It is unknown how long she went without breathing. Inspectors found staff failed to provide proper post-anesthesia care and observation. After the patient took the drug, Basco arrived and . determined that the patient needed a surgical abortion because the . multiple fetuses had made her uterus larger, the board said. Basco told . the patient she would have to go elsewhere for a surgical abortion, they . said. Basco and other staff told regulators it was . standard procedure in the clinics for patients to be given misoprostol . at 11 weeks or later, regardless of whether a doctor was . present, the board wrote. Panah, the medical director of the clinics, was responsible for patient care at the time of Santiago's death. He previously had his license suspended by the board in 1988 for . sexual contact with three patients and again in 1995 for sexual conduct . with another patient. In 2011, he was placed on two years of probation . by the board for failing to meet appropriate standards for delivery of . quality medical and surgical care. Bardos, who also represents . Panah, said the allegations related to wrongdoing at the abortion . clinics do not involve his client. He said the previous sexual contact . cases 'involved kisses'. Marc Cohen, the attorney for Dominy, said that most of the allegations were broad and do not directly . involve his client, and that the patient's death at the Baltimore clinic . was not her fault. He said the allegation that unlicensed workers . administered drugs on her watch was false. 'She's a well-trained, . well-qualified and well-experienced doctor,' Cohen said. 'There just . appears to be something that happened to that particular patient, but . there wasn't anything wrong with the procedure as far as we know.' Lax procedures: The doctors and other clinic employees said it was standard procedure for patients to receive abortion-inducing drugs, like those pictured, whether a doctor was present or not . A . hearing on the suspensions of the doctors' licenses is scheduled for . next Wednesday. Bardos has requested a hearing before an administrative . law judge on the closure of the clinics. That hearing has not yet been . scheduled, he said. Richard Bardos, an attorney who represents Associates in OB/GYN Care, said Dr Steve Brigham is not the owner of the clinics or the LLC. He declined to identify the owners. But Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, or NAF, which represents abortion providers, said it was common knowledge among providers that the Maryland clinics belong to him. 'It's not surprising that his four Maryland clinics have been suspended,' Saporta said. 'We have been an advocate for his substandard clinics being shut down wherever they operate in the country.'","Dr Iris Dominy has had her license suspended 'for allowing unlicensed staff to give patients drugs at Baltimore clinic'

Ellen Sturtz said she that if there was a risk of being arrested then you could ‘count me in!’ in an online profile she wrote in August 2011 - having already been booked once for protesting. MailOnline can also reveal that Miss Sturtz has been doing activism full-time since divorcing her rabbi wife and moving to the other side of the country. Last year Miss Sturtz left the San Luis Obispo, California home she shared with Barbara Zacky and now lives in Washington, D.C. Fighting back: Ellen Sturtz, who heckled First Lady Michelle Obama, vowed to take strong action for gay rights - even getting arrested - after splitting with her wife . The beginning: Michelle Obama was speaking at a DNC fundraiser on Tuesday when she was interrupted by a heckler . Taking action: She then stepped down from the . platform and went right up to the heckler and had words before walking . in the other direction and flashing her hand . The pair were once a wealthy power couple who were patrons of the arts but now friends fear they may ‘never be close again’ because of the split. Miss Sturtz made her outburst on Tuesday night in front of 200 guests at the $10,000 a head fundraiser at the $6.9m home of lesbians Karen Dixon and Dr Nan Schaffer in Washington. Interrupting the First Lady or the President is seen as a breach of protocol and is generally frowned upon. Mrs Obama was obviously upset and lost her cool, telling Miss Sturtz to either shut up and let her talk or she would leave. Miss Sturtz, 56, walked out to applause from the crowd. Now it appears that her intervention was . the most high profile of many of Miss Sturtz's protests, which include . turning up to a fundraiser for President Obama in Hollywood in 2011 to . lambast him for not fulfilling his election promises. In an online profile for a 2011 event . in Memphis she wrote on the website for GetEqual, the activism group . she works with, Miss Sturtz said: ‘I bring a bit of sadness to Memphis . from my father dying in his sleep last week, a desire to no longer be a . nice lesbian, and an interest in figuring out how to best further full . LGBT equality - and if that means getting arrested, count me in!’ Miss Sturtz was part of the anti-nuclear movement and helped organise the first Gay Pride festival in San Luis Obispo. 'I bring a bit of sadness to Memphis from my father dying in his sleep last week, a desire to no longer be a nice lesbian, and an interest in figuring out how to best further full LGBT equality - and if that means getting arrested, count me in!' Ellen Sturtz, in 2011 post on GetEqual website . In 2011 she and others marched in Los Angeles with a giant dollar bill to protest the decision by the secretary of the Smithsonian museum to remove a controversial piece of art from a show. A retired government regulator, Miss Sturtz has said that when she worked for San Luis Obispo County, it was ‘the most satisfying to push the envelope where not everyone always agreed with me.’ On her online biography she also . wrote: ‘My first arrest took place on January 30th (2011) in Rancho . Mirage (California) in front of the place the Koch Brothers and their . billionaire friends were gathering.’ Her marriage to rabbi Miss Zacky, 61, ended when they divorced in January last year, according to public records. Until . then they lived a fairy tale life as prominent members of the Jewish . and LGBT communities in California and were well known art lovers too. Artist Bonita Helmer did a site specific installation at their home in Malibu in 2007. The . couple were donors to the film East LA Interchange, about migration . changes in Los Angeles, and in 2005 they gave more than $10,000 to the . Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, Pennsylvania. The home where the heckling happened belongs to power couple Karen Dixon and Nan Schaffer, formerly of Chicago, who have hosted fundraisers for the Obamas in the past . Karen Dixon, pictured (left) is an attorney who serves on the national board of Lambda Legal, an organization working for LGBT rights. Her partner Schaffer, (right), is a veterinarian who works to preserve the rhino population through artificial insemination . They gave around $2,000 to the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Centre in 2010 and have vowed to match any $15,000 donation to Liberty Hill, a California education nonprofit. In addition, they were also listed as patrons for an Elton John concert for the American Foundation for Equal Rights in January 2011. Miss Zacky was ordained as a rabbi in 2009 and is involved in progressive groups such as Rabbis for Human Rights. She is currently continuing her pastoral education at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles. Miss Sturtz’s former sister-in-law Laura, 60, said that the marriage had been ‘nourishing and loving’ but that it had come to an end, much to her regret. She said: ‘ I don’t know if she and Barbara will be close again but I believe Ellen will find her soul mate’. Losing her cool: The heckler said that the First Lady 'got up in her face' Striking a deal: She offered the choice of her leaving or the heckler . With the crowd cheering for her, she headed back on stage to continue the talk on education . She added that Miss Sturtz had gotten into trouble in the past because of her ‘big mouth.’ She said: ‘This (heckling Mrs Obama) is exactly the kind of thing she would do. She is not afraid to speak her mind’. Gay marriage in California was made legal between June and November 2008, which is when Miss Sturtz and Miss Zacky appear to have got married. It is now the subject of a landmark Supreme Court ruling expected later this month which could overturn the ban and make it legal once more. In another twist, Miss Sturtz claimed that she heckled Mrs Obama because she could ‘not stay silent any longer’. But a post on her Twitter page suggests that this is not exactly the case. On May 30, just five days earlier, she Tweeted: ‘Would be interested in discussing some bold LGBT activity in DC. Purposely cryptic’ and included her email address, suggesting that there was some planning involved and that others might have known what she was up to. Miss Sturtz did not respond to emails or Tweets requesting comment.","First lady loses her cool and said: 'Listen to me or you can take the mic, but I'm leaving. You all decide'

'Very worrying case': RE teacher Geoffrey Bettley (pictured) has been allowed to carry on working in schools despite being cautioned for possessing indecent images of children . A teacher who downloaded child porn has been allowed to resume his career by the Department for Education. Geoffrey Bettley, 36, was sacked, given a police caution and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register after  admitting viewing sickening images over several years. But a professional conduct panel said the married RE teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘excellent teaching’. A senior official, acting on  behalf of Education Secretary Michael Gove, rubber-stamped the decision, saying there was a ‘need to be proportionate and to act in the public interest’. Last night the case sparked a  furious reaction from MPs, schools campaigners and a children’s  charity. Research has shown that one in six men who view child porn go on to abuse children. Fears about the effects of child porn have been heightened after child killers Mark Bridger and Stuart Hazell were found to have been heavy users of it in the run up to the murders of April Jones, five, and Tia Sharp, 12. Culture Secretary Maria Miller has summoned internet giants, including Google, to a summit in an attempt to find ways to reduce the amount of harmful material available online. The Bettley case is similar to a scandal that rocked Labour in 2006 and damaged then Education Secretary Ruth Kelly’s reputation. At the time, Norfolk-based PE teacher Paul Reeve was told he could  continue working after receiving a caution for viewing child porn. Bettley was a teacher at St Mary’s Catholic High School in Menston, West Yorkshire, for ten years until he was sacked in December 2011. Disgraced: Bettley, 36, was dismissed from his ten-year career at St Mary's Catholic School (above), in Menston, West Yorkshire, after he accepted a police caution . Details of his web habits were . revealed in a report by the National College for Teaching and Leadership . after its professional conduct panel considered his case. He initially visited an internet site in 2009 and viewed ‘six child abuse images’. By the time police seized his . computer in December last year he had seen 143 images – assessed to be . on the lowest ‘level one’ scale for seriousness. Another 46 more serious ‘level three’ images, including scenes of child abuse, were on the computer but had not been viewed. The panel said the photographs were . ‘not at the most serious end of the scale but, nevertheless, embarking . on the process of downloading such images may lead to the viewing of . more serious images’. All-clear: Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) has now supported a disciplinary panel’s recommendation that Bettley does not pose a risk to children and that he should be able to resume his teaching career . The report said Bettley had used the . website for ‘two to three years on and off.’ Instead of being taken to . court, he was given the option of accepting a police caution. The panel decided his actions . amounted to ‘conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute’ and . his behaviour amounted to ‘unacceptable professional conduct’. But it took his ‘excellent’ teaching . history into account and said the ‘principle of proportionality’ had . been taken into account in deciding he should be allowed to continue . teaching in future. Its conclusions were forwarded to the . Department for Education where the official concluded: ‘Although the . findings in the case are serious ones... I support the recommendation of . the panel that a prohibition order should not be applied in this case.’ Bettley had been put on a ‘barred . list’ by the Independent Safeguarding Authority, which replaced the . Criminal Records Bureau, but his name was removed last June. Yesterday Tory Philip Davies said: . ‘This is a very worrying case and I suspect most parents would feel very . uneasy about this man being able to continue teaching, given his past . record. ‘I think that in such cases there should be an automatic bar on  people being able to teach.’ Chris McGovern, chairman of the . Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘Since this involved indecent images . of children it should have been taken more seriously. Many parents would . be very concerned to know this person was teaching their children.’ An NSPCC spokesman added: ‘It’s . shocking that someone who downloaded images of children should be . allowed to continue to teach in a school. ‘And I’m sure most parents will feel . very uncomfortable knowing Mr Bettley is back in the classroom.’ Parents . connected to St Mary’s School were also astonished. Mother-of-five . Sarah Jaggo, whose son recently attended the school, said: ‘I certainly . wouldn’t want my child to be taught by anyone who has done that. He . shouldn’t get a job as a lollipop man let alone in a school.’ A Department for Education spokesman . said: ‘The Secretary of State does not make these decisions himself. They are made by an independent panel and reviewed by a senior official. ‘We keep the process under review because of legal complexities and we are examining whether this case was handled correctly.’ Bettley has been married to wife . Jennifer for almost ten years. It was not clear last night if she is . standing by him but a woman was seen at his home in Leeds. Bettley declined to comment when approached.","Geoffrey Bettley viewed six child abuse images on internet site in 2009 .

Scott Harrington's patients who have been tested since March . Two new cases of hepatitis C have been reported in a health scare involving patients of a Tulsa oral surgeon whose clinics were found to be unsanitary. The Tulsa Health Department says the two new cases were found among the thousands of Dr. W. Scott Harrington's patients who have been tested since March. A total of 73 patients have tested positive for hepatitis C, five for hepatitis B and three for HIV, but there is no indication the diseases spread at the clinics. Health experts also say the spread of disease in dental clinics is extremely rare. More than 4,000 of Harrington's patients have been tested so far. As many as 7,000 people may have been exposed to blood-borne viruses. Inspectors said they found unsanitary conditions inside Harrington's clinics at Tulsa and Owasso, where it it believed that Harrington used rusty instruments and recycled needles. Harrington voluntarily stopped treating patients March 20 and is said to be cooperating with the investigation. The department says they will . personally contact those who have tested positive for any of the . diseases and will offer them and their family counseling. The . department notes the possibility that some that test positive may not . be related to the dental procedures at the Harrington practice. 'This is a complex investigation,' emphasized State Epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley last month. Health . officials opened their investigation into Harrington's surgeries after a . patient with no known risk factors tested positive for both hepatitis C . and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. It turned out the person was a . patient of Harrington's and had recently had a dental procedure at one . of his clinics. Investigated: A health . scare was sparked over the work of Dr Wayne Scott Harrington, an oral surgeon . in Tulsa. Now at least three of his patients have tested positive for HIV and 73 for . hepatitis C . On one occasion authorities launched a surprise inspection at his practice on March 18 that turned up old needles, rusty instruments and a practice of pouring bleach on patients' wounds, until they 'turned white,' according to a complaint filed by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. While . testing for HIV and hepatitis continues among former patients of . Harrington, the criminal investigation continues with the involvement of . both state and federal authorities. Tulsa County District . Attorney Tim Harris has released a statement regarding the allegations . against Harrington by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. The state dental board filed a 17-count complaint calling Harrington ""a menace to the public health.' Among the allegations, Harrington allowed dental assistants to administer IV sedation and reused equipment on multiple patients. It . is improper sterilization procedures such as this that could have . infected many of his patients with any number of blood-borne viruses. Among the claims was one detailing the use of rusty instruments in patients known to have infectious diseases that were dipped twice in bleach in hope of cleaning them. ‘The CDC has determined that rusted instruments are porous and cannot be properly sterilized,’ the board said of that practice. Harrington told officials he left questions about sterilization and drug procedures to his employees. ‘They take care of that, I don't,’ the dentistry board quoted him as saying. Nearly 200 patients of Dr. W. Scott Harrington line up outside the Tulsa Health Department North Regional Health and Wellness Center in Tulsa to be tested for HIV and hepatitis . 'The . goal is to do a thorough investigation and then make some common sense . decisions on potential criminal charges and which agency is in the best . position to prosecute any case,' Harris said. Based on the number . of individuals to be interviewed and the involvement of both federal . and state investigators, Harris says the investigation is likely to be a . long one. 'Once an investigation is complete, the case will be reviewed for potential criminal charges.' Health inspectors found expired . morphine and dirty, rusty instruments that were used on patients with . infectious diseases inside an Oklahoma dental clinic, putting thousands . of people at risk for hepatitis and the virus that causes AIDS. Health officials opened their . investigation after a patient with no known risk factors tested positive . for both hepatitis C and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. After . determining the 'index patient' had a dental procedure about the likely . time of exposure, investigators visited Harrington's office and found a . number of unsafe practices, state epidemiologist Kristy Bradley said. Inspectors allege workers at his two . clinics risked cross-contamination to the point that the state Dentistry . Board branded Harrington a 'menace to the public health.' Shocking: Health officials are urging 7,000 patients of an Oklahoma dentist (pictured Dr. W. Scott Harrington's dental office in Tulsa) to seek medical tests to ensure they haven't been exposed to the virus that causes AIDS . According to the inspectors' complaint, needles were re-inserted in drug vials after their initial . use and the office had no written infection-protection procedure. Harrington told officials he left questions about sterilization and drug procedures to his employees. 'They take care of that, I don't,' the dentistry board quoted him as saying. The doctor also is accused of letting . his assistants perform tasks only a licensed dentist should have done, . including administering IV sedation. The complaint says the doctor's . staff could not produce permits for the assistants when asked. Susan Rogers, executive director of . the state Dentistry Board, said that as an oral surgeon Harrington . regularly did invasive procedures involving 'pulling teeth, open wounds, . open blood vessels.' The board's complaint also noted Harrington and . his staff told investigators a 'high population of known infectious . disease carrier patients' received dental care from him. Despite the high-risk clientele, a . device used to sterilize instruments wasn't being properly used and . hadn't been tested in six years, the board complaint said. Tests are . required monthly. Also, a drug vial found at a clinic . this year had an expiration date of 1993 and one assistant's drug log . said morphine had been used in the clinic last year despite its not . receiving any morphine shipments since 2009. Health risk: The agencies said they found 'major violations' of the Oklahoma Dental Act (pictured the dental office is Owasso) Investigation: Letters were sent to 7,000 patients from Harrington's clinics in Tulsa and suburban Owasso since 2007 recommending testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV (stock photos) 'The office looked clean,' said Joyce . Baylor, who had a tooth pulled at Harrington's Tulsa office 1½ years . ago. In an interview, Baylor, 69, said she'll be tested next week to . determine whether she contracted any infection. 'I'm sure he's not suffering financially that he can't afford instruments,' Baylor said of Harrington. Harrington voluntarily gave up his . license, closed his offices in Tulsa and suburban Owasso, and is . cooperating with investigators, said Kaitlin Snider, a spokeswoman for . the Tulsa Health Department. 'It's uncertain how long those practices have been in place,' Snider said. 'He's been practicing for 36 years.' The Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention is consulting on the case, and agency spokeswoman Abbigail . Tumpey said such situations involving dental clinics are rare. Last year . a Colorado oral surgeon was accused of reusing needles and syringes, . prompting letters to 8,000 patients, Tumpey said. It wasn't clear . whether anyone was actually infected. 'We've only had a handful of dental facilities where we've had notifications in the last decade,' Tumpey said. The Oklahoma Dentistry Board lodged a . 17-count complaint against Harrington, saying he was a 'menace to the . public health by reasons of practicing dentistry in an unsafe or . unsanitary manner.' Among the claims was one detailing the use of rusty . instruments in patients known to have infectious diseases. 'The CDC has determined that rusted instruments are porous and cannot be properly sterilized,' the board said. Health officials sent letters . to 7,000 known patients but cautioned that they don't know who visited . his clinics before 2007. The letters urged the patients to be tested for . hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV — viruses typically spread through . intravenous drug use or unprotected sex, not occupational settings.","Tulsa County's top prosecutor says no decision has been made on pursuing criminal charges against Dr Scott Harrington .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:18 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:37 EST, 17 October 2012 . An Earth-sized planet has been found orbiting a star in Alpha Centauri, our nearest neighbouring solar system. The mystery world circling Alpha Centauri B is thought to be much too hot to support life, with surface temperatures of around 1,500C. But astronomers say it is likely to be part of a more extensive solar system containing other planets, one or more of which might be habitable. Next-door neighbour: An artist's impression of the recently found planet orbiting Alpha Centauri B, a member of the triple star system that is the closest to our own . At just 4.3 light years from the Sun, Alpha Centauri B is only a step away in astronomical terms; still, with current propulsion technology it would take a probe 40,000 years to get there. Nevertheless, astronomers described the discovery as 'extraordinary' and did not rule out the possibility of sending an unmanned space mission there in the not-too-distant future. Xavier Dumusque, of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland, said: 'This result represents a major step towards the detection of a twin Earth in the immediate vicinity of the Sun. We live in exciting times.' The planet was detected by European Southern Observatory (ESO) astronomers who measured tiny wobbles in the motion of Alpha Centauri B caused by a gravitational tug of war with the orbiting planet. The planet orbiting Alpha Centauri B was found using a high-precision instrument called Harps on the ESO's 3.5m telescope at La Silla in Chile, pictured above. Harps measures the radial velocity of a star — its speed towards or away from the Earth — with extraordinary precision. A planet in orbit around a star causes the star to regularly move towards and away from a distant observer on Earth. Due to the Doppler effect, this radial velocity change induces a shift of the star’s spectrum towards longer wavelengths as it moves away (called a redshift) and a blueshift (towards shorter wavelengths) as it approaches. This tiny shift of the star’s spectrum can be measured with a high-precision spectrograph such as Harps and used to infer the presence of a planet. A high-precision instrument called Harps . on the ESO's 3.6m telescope at La Silla in Chile was used to spot minute . light wave fluctuations generated by the wobbles. Data published today in the journal Nature show that the as-yet unnamed planet is unusually light, containing only a little more material than the Earth. It is the lightest exoplanet ever found orbiting a Sun-like star. The planet hugs its parent star at a distance of just six million kilometres - much nearer than Mercury is to the Sun - making a complete orbit every 3.2 days. Its surface is so hot it would probably resemble molten lava, the researchers say. However previous experience tells the scientists that when you find one low-mass exoplanet of this kind, it is likely to be part of a bigger family. The astronomers also know that Alpha Centauri B has a stable 'habitable zone', also known as the 'Goldilocks zone'. This is the orbital band where conditions would be 'just right' to support surface water and, potentially, life. Leading U.S. planet hunter and astronomer Professor Greg Laughlin, from the University of California at Santa Cruz, said: 'I think the prospects are excellent for finding further planets in this system. 'Everything we know indicates that when you find one planet like this you're very likely to find additional planets further out, so it's very exciting in terms of looking forward to further detection. 'Alpha Centauri is our closest neighbour. This is our back yard, and to find out that planet formation is occurring there is just extraordinary.' Alpha Centauri in the constellation of Centaurus (The Centaur): The star Alpha Centauri, marked with a red circle, is one of the brightest stars in the southern sky. It lies just 4.3 light-years from the Earth and one component in a triple star system . The scientists say they are '99.9 per cent' sure they have not been fooled by a false result caused by background noise in the data. Co-author Dr Stephane Udry, also from Geneva Observatory, said: 'This is the first planet with a mass similar to Earth ever found around a star like the Sun. Amateur astronomers have discovered a new planet that not only orbits two suns but is simultaneously being orbited by two other suns. The incredible four sun solar system, the first of its kind ever discovered, was found as part of the Planet Hunters project led by a team from Yale University. Amateur enthusiasts work alongside professional scientists to analyse data collected by NASA's Kepler space telescope and find evidence of new worlds . The planet, called PH1, a gas giant slightly bigger than Neptune, has being likened to Tatooine, the fictional two-sun planet and childhood home of Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars films. But while Tattoine is a circumbinary planet, the likes of which have been known to scientists for some time, PH1 takes things even further with an extra two suns orbiting the entire set-up. It means if someone were able to stand on PH1, they would be able to see a double sunset as well as two extremely bright stars far off in the night sky. The quadruple star system, roughly 3,200 light-years from Earth, has been named KIC 4862625. 'Its orbit is very close to its star . and it must be much too hot for life as we know it, but it may well be . just one planet in a system of several.' Further 'wobble' observations will difficult to carry out until the two A and B Alpha Centauri stars move further apart in a few years time. But if the astronomers are lucky they might spot a 'transit' - the crossing of a planet in front of its star as seen from the Earth. When this happens the star light dims very slightly, betraying the planet's presence. Increasing numbers of planets are now being detected in this way. Members of the same European team made the first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet in 1995. Since then there have been more than 800 confirmed finds, but none so close to home. Most are much bigger than the Earth, and many are as big as Jupiter. The challenge astronomers now face is to detect and characterise a planet of mass comparable to the Earth that is orbiting in the habitable zone around another star. Travel to the stars is the stuff of science fiction, but in the case of Alpha Centauri it might not be out of the question, according to Professor Laughlin. He said: 'Using our current technology, the kind of space missions being sent to Mars and planets in our own solar system, it would require 40,000 years to get to Alpha Centauri. That's not really an option. 'I think if a potentially habitable planet is found orbiting Alpha Centauri A or B you might see a ground-swell of excitement and a look at new kinds of propulsion technologies, leading to a mission to send an unmanned probe there in the period of a lifetime. 'There have been design studies on the time scale of decades. They remain speculative and far-fetched, but it's not impossible.'","Newly found world orbits Alpha Centauri B, 4.3 light years from our Sun .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:11 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:14 EST, 6 June 2013 . A Minnesota woman was sentenced yesterday to six months in a county 'workhouse' for allowing her special-needs daughter to be prostituted out to multiple men over a six-week period, one of whom got the 19-year-old woman pregnant. In addition to the six months in the Ramsey County workhouse, Judge Gary Bastian sentenced 51-year-old Cheryl Tchida to a 185-day stayed sentence for two years probation after she pleaded guilty in April to neglect. Tchida was charged in January after she repeatedly dropped her daughter - who has the mental capacity of a 5-year-old, an IQ of 45 and dwarfism - off at various locations to have sex with multiple men, even after the disabled girl told her she was being raped. 'Dropped the ball': That's how neglectful mother Cheryl Tchida summed up her decision to drop her special needs daughter off at motels where she was raped and impregnated . The initial incident happened on July 3, 2012, when Tchida dropped her daughter off at a motel in Roseville to 'hang out' with a 17-year-old male 'friend' she'd met at a fast-food drive-through a few days earlier. Inside the motel, the disabled woman met her 'friend,' who had brought along his uncle and four other men. When the woman arrived, one of the men setup an online dating account through the website LiveLinks and began advertising the woman as a prostitute charging $200 per sexual act. The teen - who can't tell time, read, or care for herself - later told police that she'd had sex against her will with five men that night; each time she said tried to say no, a man, identified in court documents first obtained by Pioneer Press, as 32-year-old Hasan Muhammad, told her he would harm her if she didn't do what the 'customers' asked. The woman called Tchida for a ride following the night of repeated non-consensual sex. When Tchida called her back, Muhammad answered the phone and told her '[the woman] needs more chocolate and isn't coming home.' Tchida never returned to the hotel to pick up her daughter. 'Work house': a 'work house' in Minnesota essentially is a county jail for inmates sentenced to a year or less of incarceration . According to the complaint, Muhammad then drove the woman to his apartment in St. Paul and had sex with her for the next several days. Once he allowed her to leave, he sent the disabled woman text messages asking her to visit him again, which she did - with the help of Tchida. Muhammad told the woman she needed to dress in shorts, a tank-top and high-heeled sandals for her next visit. Tchida then dropped her off at his apartment, and she was taken to a motel in Minneapolis and forced to have sex with multiple men, again for $200 per act. According to the complaint, the teen reported the rapes to Tchida but she continued to drive her to Muhammad's apartment, . By August, Tchida learned that her daughter was pregnant, with the baby having been conceived in early July - and that's when she decided to call the cops and report the multiple rapes. During a pre-sentencing interview, when asked about her failure to protect her disabled daughter, Tchida told the interviewer, 'yeah, I dropped the ball.' The teen has since been placed in foster care because she requires round-the-clock care. The woman's daughter - who also was born with special needs - also has been placed in state custody. At sentencing, Tchida talked about wanting to regain custody of her daughter, according to a Star-Tribune reporter who was in the courtroom. Her plea was not received well by Judge Bastian.'You talk about wanting to be reunited with your daughter. To me...that would be the worst thing that could happen to your daughter,' Bastian said.","Cheryl Tchida's daughter has an IQ of 45 and the mental capacity of a 5-year-old .

"Homeless man given a ticket for going through rubbish bin in the search for food . City of Houston passed a law last summer making it illegal for people to give homeless people food and to delve through trash . K.J. will likely face a fine if found guilty before a court in April . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 10:45 EST, 11 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:37 EST, 11 March 2013 . A homeless man has been given a ticket for rummaging through a trash can in the downtown area of one of America's biggest cities. K.J. as he is known, who is on the streets in Houston, Texas is a 44-year-old Caucasian veteran who has become forced to dumpster dive in order to find food. The summons he was issued cites his violation as: 'disturbing the contents of a garbage can in downtown central business district.' Ticketed: A Homeless veteran known as K.J. is ticketed in Houston's business district. His crime? Looking through a trash can in search of food . There are many who are standing behind K.J. and who feel sympathy. Another resident of Houston, Joe Ablaza, has said the city's laws which ban the feeding of homeless people has made K.J. a symbol, not least for the absurdity of it all. 'What little dignity this man has continues to be assaulted by the uncompassionate leadership of this city,' Mr Ablaza writes, in a public Facebook post that has been shared almost 1000 times since the weekend. In most other cities homeless people are able to rely on the kindness of strangers for food and those who have fallen on hard times are free to dive through the garbage at will, but in Houston even that source of food is banned. Downtown Houston: The buildings may be gleaming but the city council seem determined to make the homeless most unwelcome . Mr Ablaza explains the city's issues succinctly: 'As you all know, the city of Houston has made it almost impossible for good people to feed the homeless. As a result many have had to revert to searching trash cans for their meals. Apparently we can't have that either.' Houston's strict 'feeding ordinance law' was passed last April in a 11-6 vote by the City Council. The laws came into effect in July of last year and they now require people to give Houston City Council notice or receive written permission in order to serve food to the homeless. Standing up for what's right: Joe Ablazza writes on facebook that the city of Houston has made it almost impossible for good people to feed the homeless . Joe Ablazza: His Facebook posting that hold Houston Council firmly to account for the city's draconian homeless food ban has been shared more than 1000 times . Those who register are also required to obtain the consent of public or private property owners before handing out food. Houston Mayor Annise Parker: We identify a problem, put an idea out there to address it and then listen to find out if it is the best we can do . James . Rodriguez, a Houston councilman told News 92 the policy aimed to . 'treat our homeless with dignity, to be more efficient and to protect . public property.' Mr Ablaza who is also a veteran, says the city's Mayor Annise Parker leaves the homeless with few options. He . also calls out the police officer who issued the ticket noting cops in . other cities have reacted differently: 'Officer J.R. Richards - Dude, . cut these people a break! Are you a veteran? I mean we have cops in NYC . giving the homeless boots for crying out loud!' Houston's laws on food are clearly divisive. One twitter user demanded the homeless be ticketed for littering as well, but many are sharing their concern for K.J. and the others who find themselves with little choice. One Republican Houston activist, Jason Baldwin asked for information on K.J. so he could treat him to a meal. K.J. will appear in court to face his charges on April 10th.","Homeless man given a ticket for going through rubbish bin in the search for food .

This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby has admitted that she might eat her placenta if she were to get pregnant again. The mother of two made the revelation during a discussion with placenta specialist Lynnea Shrief on today's show. Shrief is an advocate of new mothers eating their placenta immediately after giving birth, and even runs a company that turns the organ into capsules that the mother can keep taking in the days following childbirth. Kim Kardashian has revealed that she wants to eat her placenta after giving birth next month and today Holly Willoughby admitted that she might try it if she had another baby . Last week Kim Kardashian revealed that she plans to eat her placenta following the birth of her first child next month. In Sunday night's episode of her reality show the 32-year-old revealed that she was having a baby girl and then shocked viewers when she told her doctor that she hopes to eat the placenta after the birth. 'Don’t you think it makes you look younger? I really want to do it,' Kim said, much to the horror of her mother Kris Jenner. Kim would not be the first celebrity mother to eat her placenta for its nutritious benefits. It's . a girl! It was revealed that Kim and Kanye were having a girl on the . season eight premiere of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday night . After the birth of her son Xander, January Jones widely spoke about how she had eaten hers, although she was unsure at first. The actress told People Magazine: 'It's something I was very hesitant about, but we're only the only mammals who don't ingest our own placentas. It's not witch-crafty or anything! I suggest it to all moms!' As well as reportedly helping you 'appear youthful', Chinese herbalists among others believe that re-ingesting the protective layer that connects the baby to the wall of the uterus is a great way to nourish the body following childbirth. The placenta contains high levels of oxytocin, and as hormone levels drop after giving birth, is believed to be a good way to replace them, which can prevent postpartum depression. On This Morning today Shrief, founder of the IPEN Placenta Network, explained why she thinks the 'afterbirth practise' is so important. Shrief said: 'Every other mammal on the planet comsumes the placenta imediately after birth. It helps increase breast milk supply, reduces bleeding and increases iron levels and energy. 'It is a  normal, natural way to heal quicker and feel better after birth. It contains iron, hormones, minerals and has a much higher absorption rate than supplements. Presenter Holly seemed squeamish at first when discussing the merits of eating placenta . During the early part of the discussion . 32-year-old Holly appeared to get squeamish at the thought but had come . round to the idea by the end of the chat after listening to Shrief's . argument. Shrief . advises mothers to drink a smoothie made of raw placenta immediately . after the birth for maximum benefit and then encapsulate the rest. She . added: 'It . doesn't taste like liver at all, in fact you can't taste it when mixed . with fruit in a smoothie and every new mum that I have made one for says . how delicious it is. Also . part of the debate was journalist Sally Windsor who is horrified by the . thought and says that new mothers should be concentrating on their new . babies rather than indulging in 'faddy diets'. Windsor said: I . can't think of anything worse than doing this after birth - isn't there . enough pressure on new mums without bringing this in to it - it's like . caveman behaviour! 'There is no proof that it works and it is just another faddy diet.' Holly wrapped up the discussion by saying: 'The jury's out, I'm not saying I wouldn't do it.' Co-host . Phillip Schofield then cheekily quipped: 'If you say that you'll be . straight on the MailOnline!' before Holly said with a smile and a wave: 'Hello . MailOnline!'.

Tulisa Contostavlos could lose up to £1million following allegations she fixed an £800 cocaine deal. The former X Factor judge's biggest contract with clothing firm Bank is now being 'reviewed' following a report that she helped arrange a drug deal between an undercover reporter and her friend Mike GLC. Bank, which is owned by JD Sports, is now said to be considering pulling the 24-year-old's range TFB and her image from marketing campaigns. Shamed: Tulisa Contostavlos, pictured with Mike GLC on May 29, is in hiding following the revelations . A statement by Bank to the Daily Mirror read: 'Following the news that has unfolded . this weekend concerning Tulisa - Bank Fashion are currently reviewing . their options regarding her continued involvement with Bank and her . clothing range TFB.' Parent company JD Sports added: 'We are deeply concerned by the allegations regarding Tulisa’s actions. 'We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to do so as it develops.' Following Sunday's revelations in The Sun newspaper, Tulisa's spokesperson has declined to comment and she has been holed up in her £6million Hertfordshire mansion. Under review: Tulisa's contract with clothing firm Bank is now being looked at following the revelations . On Monday, police officers were spotted arriving at the singer's home, before she was visited by her PA Gareth Varey. The report on Sunday claimed that the former X Factor judge boasted to a tabloid reporter about her links to drugs and claimed to be able to get hold of 'whatever you want'. During one meeting, Tulisa told the reporter: 'Half my phone book sells it. Of course I can get it for you. Half the guys I know are drug dealers.' The N-Dubz star also revealed her best friend is a 'massive cocaine dealer'. And that brag was proved correct when her pal - Mike GLC - allegedly sold £800 worth of the Class A drug to the undercover reporter after Tulisa had sent text messages to him to sort the deal out. Talks: Tulisa was visited by police at her Hertfordshire home on Monday . During an evening out, the singer was asked if she could get hold of some cocaine, to which she replied 'yes, definitely'. She then gave him a number and gave the reporter instructions to call him and say he was her friend and he 'will sort you out'. The reporter then spoke to Mike, who said he only supplied wholesale quantities of the drug and eventually agreed to sell half an ounce for £800, with an added £20 for delivery costs. Since the scandal broke, Mike has been busy promoting his music career by tweeting links to his videos. Loyal: Tulisa's PA Gareth Varey seen accepting a delivery of Papa John's pizza on Monday night at the singer's home . On Monday, he tweeted: 'What do d**k head artist thinks the rules changed because I'm in this madness keep making video and talking my name that's all I'm saying (sic).' Meanwhile, further revelations from The Sun's reporter's interview with Tulisa suggest she ended her relationship with footballer Danny Simpson in an argument over Christian Louboutin heels. She said the former Newcastle United player was furious after she placed a pair of the £1,000 shoes he had bought her in a Tesco plastic bag. Tulisa claimed Danny said he was normally thanked for buying Louboutins for women with a sex act. The Sun also reported Tulisa claimed that Danny had been a 'fan' of hers for years and his intellect was below hers. Love split: Tulisa split from footballer Danny Simpson last month . She said: 'He was obsessed for six years. He had a massive crush on me. Finally he found somebody who knew me. He wasn’t a celebrity until he met me. He was a famous footballer but not a celebrity. As soon as he got with me, he became a celebrity footballer... 'He’s not as intelligent as me. And he’s very shallow and I’m very real.' Tulisa and father-of-two Danny started dating last autumn, but split last month. The singer confirmed her newfound single status in a Twitter statement last week when she was pictured partying in Marbella with a host of male pals, including Mike GLC. She wrote: 'Wow, I'm a 24 year old single girl and I had a convo with a dude on holiday and any more then that I'm sure it would be all over the papers,considering I can't take a p**s with out sum1 printing it.

Michael Gove's nine-year-old daughter has been withdrawn from her ballet classes over fears she was becoming worried about her weight. The Education Secretary's wife, Sarah Vine, took the decision after Beatrice refused to eat on days of her lessons and insisted on wearing a smaller leotard. She said what used to be an enjoyable way of exercising had turned into a 'stressful and somewhat sinister ordeal.' Her comments come after the head of the English National Ballet last year revealed she wanted to stamp out weight issues in the discipline after audiences complained stars were too thin. Writing in The Times, the columnist said: 'It began when she mentioned that some of the girls in her group were better than her, even though they hadn't been doing ballet as long, because they ""they were more the right size"". 'Then she wanted to wear her old leotard, the one that's too small for her. 'She clearly felt that if she could fit into a smaller size that would be a good thing. 'That was the final straw.' Mrs Vine, who lives with Mr Gove and their two children in North Kensington, said she hopes she caught the problem early enough. Weight issues in ballet were addressed in front of a world-wide audience in the Hollywood blockbuster Black Swan which sees actress Natalie Portman playing a ballerina with an eating disorder. Last year, the new artistic director of English National Ballet revealed how the drama reflected the painful reality for many dancers. Tamara Rojo, widely considered the best female dancer in Britain, said she wanted to tackle anorexia in ballet. She said: ‘Audiences want to see beautiful and healthy-looking dancers yet there is still that pressure to be thin. ‘Some comes from the fashion world and that in turn affects ballet. When you are in a ballet company, you often lose perspective of reality. So you go for extremes in order to stand out and be noticed.’ Taking action: The artistic director of the English National Ballet, Tamara Rojo (pictured), wants to tackle eating problems in ballet . Medical experts warned last month that up to one in ten teenage girls has an eating disorder. And increasing numbers of boys are also at risk, some of them as young as ten, according to a major study. Experts said that with the young under increasing pressure to ‘be perfect and look perfect’, the problem is now so severe it threatens the mental health of an entire generation. For the first time, doctors have tried to measure the rate of eating disorders through the numbers of patients attending GP practices. Across the population as a whole, the data shows a 13 per cent jump in the number of new cases diagnosed each year between 2003 and 2009. The highest rates of new cases are among girls aged 15 to 19 and boys aged ten to 14.","Mr Gove's wife made decision after Beatrice refused to eat on lesson days .

A young mother due to stand trial with Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins today admitted sexually touching a child. Watkins, 35, is accused of 24 sex offences including the rape of a baby who was aged under 12 months. Watkins and two mothers, aged 20 and 24, were arrested by police investigating allegations of sex offences. The younger woman - who cannot be named but is from the Doncaster area - today admitted sexually touching the child, making an indecent photo of the child, and distributing the image. Watkins - a former boyfriend of TV presenter Fearne Cotton - appeared at court via video link from prison during for an hour-long hearing ahead of his trial. The case is scheduled to go before a jury at Cardiff Crown Court on November 25 after a judge rejected an application to have it moved. Alexia Power, defending, said: 'Watkins, although a celebrity in other parts of the world, was more well known in Wales. 'He is a man who has maintained his links to his home town - he is a local celebrity. The fact that he finds himself where he is is a spectacular fall from grace.' But Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees said: 'Watkins previously had a high profile in the music world. I cannot recommend moving this case as this will be a factor wherever in the country it is heard.' Watkins also faces a charge of aiding and abetting the sexual assault of another child who was aged one at the time. The singer, of Pontypridd, South Wales, is also accused of conspiracy to rape and conspiracy to sexually assault the same child. He also denies further charges of possessing, taking and making indecent photographs of children - the oldest of dating back to March 2007.

Olli Rehn, the EU's top economic and monetary official, said today that Latvia's membership bid was 'further evidence that those who predicted the disintegration of the euro area were wrong.' Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis tweeted that the decision was 'the next step for growth.' However, many of Latvia's 2million population are skeptical of the need to join in the midst of the eurozone's debt troubles. Anti-Euro parties won more than half the vote in local elections in the capital, Riga, last weekend. Euro opponent Andris Orols, head of 'Latvia for the Lat,' vowed to ask the constitutional court to review the government's decision. 'We are against the euro because we believe that an independent and sovereign country cannot exist without its own money which it controls,' he said. Latvia committed to join the euro in 2004 when it joined the European Union. Latvia's Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis (second row, third from left, pictured with European leaders) announced the single currency news over Twitter . Valdis Dombrovskis tweeted that the decision was 'the next step for growth' Under the EU's treaty, all EU members must adopt the euro eventually although it can take years to meet the tough requirements. The only exceptions are Britain and Denmark, which were given opt-outs. Latvia and its Baltic neighbours Lithuania and Estonia are keen to strengthen ties with Western Europe and reduce their dependency on Russia. To join the single currency, Latvia had to show the EU that it could control inflation, deficits and government debt, and keep its currency in a narrow exchange rate range with the euro. Compared with heavily indebted Euro countries such as Greece, Portugal and Italy, its government finances are in good shape. Its budget deficit at the end of 2012 was 1.2 per cent of annual economic output, well below the EU's 3 per cent limit. Its debt burden was 41 per cent of output, less than the 60 per cent requirement and far less than the Eurozone average of 91 per cent. Its economy would be the third-smallest, larger only than those of Cyprus and Malta. With annual output of about 22.3 billion euros ($29 billion) it would account for just 0.2 per cent of the overall eurozone economy. Economic benefits of joining the euro include not having the costs and inconvenience of exchanging one currency for another while travelling or doing business across borders. However, Latvia will not be able to independently raise of lower its interest rates to deal with an economic slowdown or excessive inflation. here is just one benchmark interest rate set for all euro members by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, based on the needs of the entire Eurozone economy. European Central Bank said Latvia would need to exercise continued vigilance to make sure inflation stayed under control and that its banks were strong enough . Euro members also cannot devalue their currency to boost exports, as a way of adjusting to an economic downturn or crisis. Latvia has won praise from the EU and international finance officials for pushing through required reforms - mainly cuts to wages and government spending - to make its economy more competitive. That put Latvians through several years of austerity. It also came soon after a profound recession in 2008-2010, when the economy shrank about 25 per cent as a credit-fuelled real estate boom collapsed. The economy has since returned to strong growth, expanding 5.6 per cent in 2012. In a separate assessment, the European Central Bank said that Latvia would need to exercise continued vigilance to make sure inflation stayed under control and that its banks were strong enough. It called non-resident deposits 'an important risk to financial stability.'","European Commission granted approval for Latvia to join the Euro .

Police Minister Damian Green has said cultural and religious differences are no defence for men from ethnic minorities linked to sex crimes against young girls . Cultural and religious differences cannot be used as a defence for men from ethnic minorities linked to sex crimes against young girls, Tory Damian Green has insisted. The Police Minister said he was not prepared to accept mitigation that some child abuse would be regarded as acceptable in other parts of the world. A new taskforce led by Mr Green to tackle organised grooming and child sex exploitation is considering a number of measures, including giving defence barristers special training in how to deal with young witnesses. It comes after high-profile court cases in Rochdale and Oxford, involving mainly Asian men targeting white girls. Nine Asian men received jail sentences of between four and 19 years last May for offences which happened in and around Rochdale in 2008 and 2009. Five girls, aged between 13 and 15, were given alcohol, food and money in return for sex but there were times when violence was used. Last month a paedophile ring was found guilty of a catalogue of charges involving vulnerable underage girls who were groomed for sexual exploitation in the Oxford area. 'We have turned over a stone and discovered that for a number of years, in the case of organised grooming, horrible and profoundly unacceptable things have been happening in a number of places in this country and large parts of the public sector have got to get better at dealing with them,' Mr Green told The Times. 'The age of consent may be puberty in other parts of the world, but it is not in this country. And in this country it is not acceptable to regard anyone else as being in some way less than human because they may not share your religious views or your race. 'We are all equal under the law. If you are abusing children sexually then that's criminality and I am not prepared to accept, as a plea in mitigation, the argument that in some parts of the world this would be regarded as acceptable. It's not acceptable in Britain in 2013.' He added: 'If you come and live in 21st-century Britain then you obey the laws and observe the conventions of 21st-century Britain. And the law says that exploiting children for sexual purposes is a serious and disgusting crime.' Brothers Anjum Dogar (left) and Akhtar Dogar (right) were among seven members of a paedophile ring in Oxford convicted of offences involving underage girls . Leading Islamic groups, including the Muslim Council of Britain, has condemned those involved in such crimes, The Times has reported, adding the majority of British Pakistanis felt revulsion for such actions. Mr Green said the Sexual Violence Against Children and the Vulnerable task force was treating organised grooming as a priority, although it would address all forms of child sexual abuse. New guidance is also due to be published next week aimed at improving the response of the Crown Prosecution Service and police forces to suspected cases of abuse.

The spurned mother of Francois Hollande’s four children is being tipped to run against him for the French presidency in 2017. Segolene Royal, herself a leading Socialist politician, was furious when Mr Hollande left her for magazine journalist Valerie Trierweiler following a long secret affair. The two women detest each other, but Ms Royal is particularly angry that she was left out of Mr Hollande’s government when he came to power last year. Bitter split: Francois Hollande, pictured left with his new partner Valerie Trierweiler, is said to be facing a challenge for the presidency from his ex-partner and mother of his four children Segolene Royal . In recent weeks, she has started criticising his administration – leading commentators to believe that she will stand against Mr Hollande when he bids for a second term in 2017. ‘There is no doubt that Segolene wants to be France’s first female president, and she will stop at nothing to achieve that ambition,’ said a Socialist Party source. ‘Segolene is all over the media at the moment, attacking Mr Hollande, and making clear that she means business.’ Ms Royal, 59, has appeared on TV constantly over the past few days, attacking Mr Hollande’s failing economic policies, and refusing to rule out a bid for power in four years’ time. Asked if she was ready for government, Ms Royal said: ‘If the occasion arises, why not? If it doesn’t arise, I don’t need that to be useful.’ She also said Mr Hollande’s pace of reform was ‘too slow’, saying: ‘It should go much more quickly.’ Lovers turned rivals: Francois Hollande and Segolene Royal, pictured together left, became partners in the late 1970s and had four children. They split in 2007 after he had an affair and leading socialist politician Ms Royal, pictured left, is now tipped to challenge him for the presidency . Ms Royal was the Socialist candidate for the presidency in 2007, but was beaten by the conservative Nicolas Sarkozy. The notoriously hen-pecked Mr Hollande is clearly unsure how to deal with his ex-girlfriend. He tried to pacify Ms Royal by making her vice-chairman of the national Public Investment Bank, but this is not proving enough for her. If he gives Ms Royal a cabinet job during an expected summer reshuffle it will infuriate Ms Trierweiler. If he ignores her she is likely to become even more of a political rival. ‘Segolene is angry,’ said political commentator Caroline Roux. ‘She has erupted in the public debate. She remains unpredictable and sure of her destiny.’ Ms Trierweiler caused outrage last year when she tweeted support for a rival of Ms Royal in a parliamentary election - one which Ms Royal went on to lose. Ms Royal has also never forgiven her love rival for conducting her affair with Mr Hollande behind her back. In a recent TV interview to publish a new book, Ms Royal was asked if she had forgiven Ms Trierweiler. Ms Royal replied: 'In life, when you are betrayed, when someone hurts you - what is more, gratuitously - when it's ferocious, when it's violent, if you want to survive you have to forgive. 'At the end of the day, they hurt themselves, you know, nasty and aggressive people.'","Leading Socialist politician Segolene Royal 'to fight for French presidency'

Battle: France has accused Amazon of being a 'destroyer' of bookshops in new war against internet giants . France has accused Amazon of being a 'destroyer' of bookshops in a new war against internet giants. The country has launched a battle against the American internet giant. 'Today, everyone has had enough of . Amazon, which, by dumping, slashes prices to get a foothold in markets . only to raise them once they have established a virtual monopoly,' Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti said reported AFP. 'It is destructive for bookshops,' the minister told a conference of booksellers Monday in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Ms Filippetti said that she would be examining measures that could curb Amazon's growth. One of them could be restricting the American giant's ability to combine offers of free deliveries with discounts on cover prices. The maximum discount allowed in France under existing legislation is five per cent - this is is designed to protect small booksellers. Amazon is already firmly on France's radar - last year it received a £159million demand from France for unpaid taxes. The figure includes fines and interest in relation to 'the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions'. Damaging: 'It is destructive for bookshops,' the minister told a conference of booksellers in the southwestern city of Bordeaux . Amazon has also run into problems with the tax authorities in other countries, with American and Japanese officials both forcing the company to ‘reach an agreement’ on the allocation of the company’s earnings between 2006 and 2012. The company has also revealed that it is under investigation by the US Internal Revenue Service over its tax returns for the two years from 2005. The company is also facing demands for taxes dating back to 2003 from countries including China, Germany, and Luxembourg, as well as Britain. Gaining ground: Amazon has been delivering groceries in their hometown of Seattle for five years but now they are rolling out those services in more cities, immediately including Los Angeles and soon San Francisco . There are also fears in America that Amazon is going to destroy another local type of store - supermarkets. Amazon is planning a major roll-out of an online grocery business that it has been quietly developing for years. The online retailer has been delivering food to locals in Seattle, Washington- where the internet giant's headquarters are based- but they announced on Tuesday that they plan to expand the operation to include many more U.S. markets. It will clearly be a cause for concern in the food industry as brick-and-mortar grocery stores will see their markets threatened by the familiar online store.","The country has launched a battle against the American internet giant .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 18:57 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:39 EST, 7 June 2013 . Music is more than the food of love – it is better than sex. Britons say that music is more likely to make them feel good than making love – and Abba’s Dancing Queen is the most upbeat track. Some 40 per cent of the 2,000 men and women questioned said that listening to their favourite songs lifted their mood, compared with the 20 per cent who said that having sex put a spring in their step. To get your pulse racing: Experts say listening to music is all the more pleasurable because it is a selfish experience . In fact, romantic moments only scraped third place in the poll, with gorging on foods such as chocolate our second favourite way of making ourselves feel happy. And women were more likely than men to choose songs over sex. Tomas Chamorro, a professor of psychology at University College London, said: ‘Men and women approach sex in different ways: for men it is more of a pleasure-seeking thing and for women it has a higher level of emotional involvement. ‘Most people are not happy with their relationship status – whether they are in a relationship or not. ‘Music is a more selfish activity because it is just about you and you can immerse yourself it. ‘It is very self-indulgent.’ Energising: Music can excite and motivate the listener . Those surveyed, for Upbeat, a high-protein fruit drink, also rated  Dancing Queen as the song most likely to put them in a good mood. Billy Joel’s Uptown Girl, Gloria Gaynor’s disco anthem I Will Survive, The Beatles’ Hey Jude and the theme from Fame, sung by Irene Cara, complete the top five. The other songs in the top ten are Ride on Time by Black Box, Rhianna’s Only Girl (In the World), I Feel Love by Donna Summer, Somebody that I Used to Know by Gotye featuring Kimbra, and Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy. Professor Chamorro said that uplifting songs are mid-paced and comfortingly familiar. Typically, they have around 110 beats per minute – a pace quick enough to energise us without being so fast that it makes us feel anxious or stressed. Familiarity is also important, with songs that we know from films, Christmas parties and summer holidays particularly likely to hit the right buttons. The professor said: ‘Very few songs have any significant effect on people the first time they hear them. ‘If they do, they are not likely to be successful or popular because it means we become bored of them very quickly.’ Songs rated as being uplifting also tend to be in the major key and, not surprisingly, have positive lyrics. Intimacy: Findings show that romantic moments did not spring to mind when people were asked what activity improves their mood . Those questioned rated pop and rock music as being the most energising. Almost half of  said they listen to music while doing housework and more than a quarter of men said they’d rather give up watching sport than stop listening to music.","Abba's Dancing Queen, I Feel Love by Donna Summer and The Beatles' Hey Jude top list of most enjoyable tunes .

Wealthy businesswoman Diana Lee was murdered and her body mutilated by the penniless lover to whom she had given £70,000, a court has heard . A wealthy businesswoman was murdered and her body mutilated by the penniless lover to whom she had given £70,000, a court has heard. During their 20-month affair, David Ryan left his wife at home as he sneaked off to have sex with Diana Lee in the back of her car in lay-bys and pub car parks and inside her isolated £500,000 mansion. After one rendezvous at her house, Ryan, 48, is alleged to have bludgeoned to death 54-year-old Miss Lee, who was less than 5ft tall and weighed less than 8 stone. The bankrupt former conservatory fitter, who was £90,000 in debt, denies murder and has said he was at home with his wife watching the Olympic Games at the time. Chester Crown Court heard that after killing Miss Lee in August last year, Ryan mutilated her body with a saw to destroy DNA evidence, before dragging her body into the garage and setting it on fire. Ryan then tried to frame Miss Lee’s live-in lodger. He smeared her blood on the man’s antique German army SS dagger, slashed her dressing gown with it to make it appear it had been used to stab her to death and left some of her underwear in his bedroom. He also sent text messages from Miss Lee’s mobile phone to customers of her cattery business, which she ran from her house near the village of Cranage, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, to imply that she was still alive. Ryan then fled in Miss Lee’s car, before abandoning it 10 miles away and attempting to set fire to it. However, Ryan’s attempts to cover his tracks failed after the fire in the garage failed to take hold and it was discovered by Miss Lee’s brother a few hours later. Police found her naked, partly charred body in a wheelbarrow, surrounded by petrol, her bedding, shredded paper and logs. Three weeks later, police interviewed Ryan after discovering he had contacted her by mobile phone in the days before her death. Ryan, who had a penchant for designer clothes and Italian shoes, met Miss Lee at a dance club and she did not know that he was married, Brian Cummings QC, prosecuting, told the jury. During their 20-month affair, David Ryan . (pictured outside Chester Crown Court) left his wife at home as he sneaked off to have sex with Diana Lee in . the back of her car in lay-bys and pub car parks, a court heard . He said that Ryan, who was seeing a third woman at the time of Miss Lee’s death, initially denied having been in a relationship with her. However, after being asked to provide a DNA sample to eliminate him from inquiries, he became ‘unnerved’ and admitted that he had had sex with the former garden centre worker on the night before her death. He told police that he would sneak off to a phone box near his home in Hale to arrange to meet Miss Lee and that they slept together at least ten times. A post-mortem examination revealed that Ryan and Miss Lee had engaged in sexual activity hours before her death on August 9. Forensic tests on footprints in blood found on the downstairs carpet of Miss Lee’s home, called Parklands, were also found to match a brand of Italian shoes favoured by Ryan. Analysis of his computer also indicated that he had viewed and deleted files relating to the murder, as well as researching on the internet countries to which he could escape to which did not have an extradition treaty with the UK. When questioned, Ryan denied borrowing or stealing money from Miss Lee, instead claiming he only took cash from her for doing odd jobs around her home. The businesswoman's body was found in the burnt out garage of her luxury rural home. She suffered fatal injuries in the attack a court heard . Chester Crown Court heard that after killing Miss Lee in August last year, Ryan mutilated her body with a saw to destroy DNA evidence, before dragging her body into the garage and setting it on fire . Mr Cummings said: ‘The defendant was having a relationship with Diana Lee which they both kept secret from other people. Other than the fact that he had unprotected sex with her, he believed there would be nothing to link him to her... that is why he mutilated her body and attempted to incinerate it.’ A woman on the jury wept after they were shown computer-generated images and photographs of Miss Lee’s mutilated body. Mr Cummings said he realised the images made ‘unpleasant viewing’ but stressed that they were vital to the prosecution’s case. Police inquiries revealed that Miss Lee, who apparently had told no one about her affair with Ryan, had withdrawn £70,000 in cash from her bank accounts in the ten months before her death. During the same period, unemployed Ryan, who had just £100 to his name, made cash purchases of £53,000 and around £7,000 had been paid into his bank account. Mr Cummings said it was the prosecution’s case that Ryan had received ‘large amounts of cash’ from Miss Lee. He added: ‘It would not be the first time that he had managed to persuade someone to supply him with large sums of cash, which he did not repay.’ The case continues.

A former Radio 1 DJ has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal. Chris Denning, 72, was detained on Monday at a hostel in East London by officers working on Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree. Police said the suspect, whom they have not formally named, was questioned on suspicion of sexual offences. But today it emerged that the arrested man was Denning and that he was quizzed over ‘historic allegations’. It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague. Denning famously posed for a picture with a host of famous DJs for the launch of Radio 1 and Radio 2 in 1967. Among those alongside him were Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart and John Peel. After leaving Radio 1, Denning helped launched the career of Gary Glitter and later moved overseas. In recent times, he has been staying at a hostel for the homeless in East London, which the Mail is not identifying for legal reasons. There was no sign of him there on Tuesday or yesterday, but sources confirmed he had been a resident there. Scotland Yard said Denning, the 13th man to be detained by Yewtree, was arrested on Monday afternoon. He was later bailed to return pending further inquiries on a date in July. Last month the Mail revealed that comedian Jim Davidson is being investigated by Yewtree officers over claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s. It is understood the ex-Radio 1 DJ is not accused of any offences with Savile (above), a former colleague . Detectives, are probing claims the 59-year-old comedian committed a sex offence during a concert tour after the Falklands War. The attack is alleged to have happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining British troops. Davidson, 59, was originally arrested in January of this year over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies all the allegations. Other arrested celebrities include, entertainer Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Gary Glitter has also been detained. They also deny any wrongdoing. Other arrested celebrities include DJ Dave Lee Travis (left) and entertainer Rolf Harris (right) PR guru Max Clifford has charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls. The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations “a load of nonsense”. Critics claim the Yewtree investigation has become a celebrity witch-hunt. But Yard chiefs insist it is fair and proportionate. At least one more celebrity is expected to face criminal charges in the coming weeks.

Roache, who has strenuously denied the previous rape allegations, is due in Preston magistrates’ court over the new charges this morning. He is one of the best-known stars to be held over child sex allegations in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal. His friend Stuart Hall, the disgraced BBC TV presenter, is due to be sentenced later this month after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 girls during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. One was aged just nine when she was molested by the It’s a Knockout host. The Crown Prosecution Service said three of the new offences allegedly committed by Roache took place in 1965 and two in 1968. Nazir Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West, said: ‘We have carefully considered all the evidence gathered by Lancashire Police in relation to recent allegations from four complainants that William Roache indecently assaulted them in the 1960s. ‘Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Roache to be charged with five offences of indecent assault relating to four girls who were aged between 11 or 12 and 16 at the time that the alleged offences happened. ‘We have been reviewing evidence and providing early investigative advice to Lancashire Police regarding these allegations, which were made to police after Mr Roache was charged with two offences of rape on 1 May 2013.’ Roache – the world’s longest-serving soap actor – has played Ken Barlow in the ITV1 soap since its launch, but will not be appearing in the programme until legal proceedings are concluded. The CPS said: 'It is in the public interest for Mr Roache to be charged with five offences of indecent assault' Fans of the soap were stunned when . the twice-married star was taken into custody following a raid at his . home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, last month and charged with twice raping a . 15-year-old girl in 1967 when he was 35 and married to his first wife. In a statement issued by his lawyers . after he was charged with those offences, he said: ‘I am astounded and . deeply horrified by the extraordinary events of the last 24 hours. ‘I strenuously deny the allegations . and will now focus my full attention on fighting to preserve my . innocence in the challenging times ahead. ‘I would like to offer my sincere . thanks to all those people who have offered me their support and good . wishes at this difficult time.’ In March, Roache issued a public . apology after he claimed in a TV interview that sex abuse victims . brought it upon themselves and were being punished for sins in a past . life. He also called for the same anonymity . for those accused of child sex offences as alleged victims are given . until conviction because of the stigma they faced even if subsequently . found innocent. Following the new charges, Roache was seen arriving back at his secluded, £650,000 home just before 6.30pm yesterday. He was driven there by his lawyer . Brian Russell who will be representing him in court this morning. He . emerged from the front passenger seat of the car and walked to the . pavement to punch in the code to the substantial black electronic gates . across his drive. Off air: Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was charged with 19 sexual offences against a child. His charges are not connected to William Roache's charges . Dressed in blue trousers, a . lightweight blue jacket over a white, open-neck shirt and wearing . lightly tinted glasses, Roach refused to answer questions about the . latest charges laid against him, offering reporters a thin-lipped . grimace. Fellow Coronation Street star Michael . Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air . after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including . rape, indecent assault and sexual activity. He denies the charges, which . are not linked to Roache. Roache’s marriage to his first wife, Anna, ended in divorce in 1974. His second wife Sara died in 2009. Earlier this year it was revealed he . ended his two-year relationship with TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, 44, so . he could explore a ‘mystic message of love’ linked to his membership of . the Pure Love Movement, a religious group. Last month, the Mail revealed that . comedian Jim Davidson is being investigated by Yewtree officers over . claims he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the . 1980s during a concert tour. The attack is alleged to have . happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining British . troops stationed there after the Falklands conflict. Davidson, 59, was originally arrested . in January of this year over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies . all the allegations. Other arrested celebrities include entertainer Rolf . Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Glitter has also been detained. They all deny any wrongdoing. PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls. The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’. Critics claim the Yewtree investigation has become a celebrity witch-hunt. But Yard chiefs insist it is fair and proportionate. At least one more celebrity is expected to face criminal charges in the coming weeks. Detained: Chris Denning helped launch Gary Glitter's career . A former Radio 1 DJ has been arrested by detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile scandal. Chris Denning, 72, was detained at a hostel in East London by officers working on Operation Yewtree. Scotland Yard said the suspect, whom they have not formally named, was questioned on suspicion of sexual offences. Yesterday it emerged that the arrested man was Denning and that he was quizzed over ‘historic allegations’. It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague. Denning was one of the original Radio 1 DJs alongside Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart and John Peel when the station launched in 1967. Denning later helped launch the career of Gary Glitter. He lived overseas but recently has been staying at a hostel for the homeless which the Mail is not identifying for legal reasons.

English teacher Eppie Sprung Dawson has been told she won't face prison after she was caught having sex with a pupil . A teacher who admitted having sex with a pupil had been abused when she was a teenager, a court heard yesterday. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, was targeted when she was aged between 13 and 18 by a man 29 years her senior, a sheriff was told. Yesterday, Dawson was told she would escape a custodial sentence after earlier admitting having sex with the 17-year-old boy in the front seat of her car last December. She will have to return to court to learn her fate next month, but a sheriff told her she had breached a position of trust, although she had not abused anyone. Sheriff George Jamieson added: 'You were there simply to teach but you have been called into temptation and you have committed adultery – your marriage is gone, and your career as a teacher is gone. 'What you have been charged with is breach of trust, and I cannot see that there is anything to be gained by a custodial sentence. 'Had it not been for the fact that you were this young man's teacher, there would have been no criminality.' Dawson, of Dumfries, will return to court on July 10 to find out what counselling and help is available through social work services and to give her a chance to attend psycho-sexual counselling. Sheriff Jamieson said it was likely she would be made the subject of a community payback order, but it had not yet reached that stage. Earlier this year, Dawson admitted that on December 21 last year, while she was in a position of trust and being the teacher of the youth, she engaged in sexual activities with, or directed towards, a person under the age of 18 and that she had sexual intercourse with him. The court heard earlier that she had picked up the pupil in Dumfries, drove to a secluded layby on the Cummertrees to Hoddam Road. Police noticed the car and, as they approached, they saw condensation on the windows. When they approached the parked car, they knocked on the car door and saw the accused and a male, both naked from the waist down, having sexual intercourse. Dawson had sex with a dyslexic pupil she offered to give extra help to at St Joseph's College, Dumfries . Dumfries Sheriff Court heard that Dawson's career was in ruins and the tryst had ended her marriage with husband Ranald . Dawson taught at St Joseph's College in Dumfries and had earlier agreed to give the dyslexic teenager extra lessons. Her agent David Finnie said that she had been abused when she was between 13 and 18 by a man 29 years her senior. Although it did not provide an excuse, it gave some explanation as to the background. He added: 'This case is about one incident and there was a complete lack of any malice on the part of Eppie Sprung Dawson. There was no intention to cause any harm or problems to the other party. 'What we are dealing with is an incident involving a woman of 26 and a teenager who is now 17 and a half. It was one incident, on one occasion and we are not dealing with a more extended period of abuse.' Dawson, who is now on the Sex Offenders' Register, is no longer employed by Dumfries and Galloway Council. She was married to Ranald Dawson, 32, son of former Solicitor General for Scotland Lord Dawson. Mr Finnie described Dawson as a gifted, talented and committed teacher who was dedicated to her job: 'She has all the facets that are required to make a first-class teacher and she has thrown all that away. 'She has been punished already with her career wrecked, her marriage wrecked. I would suggest that this is not a case appropriate to make an example of her.'","Eppie Dawson had sex with pupil in a layby and was found by police .

Back at work: Teacher Geoffrey Bettley at his . home after it was revealed he'd escaped a classroom ban despite . downloading almost 200 child porn images . More paedophiles have been cleared to work in classrooms by the Department for Education, it emerged yesterday. Teachers convicted or cautioned for viewing child porn have been given permission to continue with their careers by senior officials. It means thousands of children could be coming into contact with individuals with criminal records for the offence. A DfE source confirmed the potential . threat in schools the day after married father-of-four Geoffrey Bettley . was revealed to have escaped a ban despite downloading almost 200 . sickening images. The . religious education teacher was given a police caution and put on the . Sex Offenders’ Register, but the DfE ruled any action against him should . be ‘proportionate’. Details emerged as: . Bettley, 36, could have been given a prohibition order which would have prevented him from working with children. Instead, . the professional conduct panel of the National College for Teaching and . Leadership said he ‘does not pose a risk to children’. The . NCTL recommendation was sent to the DfE where an official acting on Mr . Gove’s behalf agreed, despite saying his behaviour ‘falls significantly . short of that expected of a teacher’. A DfE source yesterday admitted a . ‘handful’ of teachers who had been convicted or cautioned for viewing . child porn had escaped bans. The source added: ‘All the cases we have come across so far are not in the classroom, we believe.’ But the source admitted some might be working in schools. Conservative MP Philip Davies called on Mr Gove to explain himself, saying: ‘Many parents will be deeply disturbed that someone who has been convicted of downloading child porn should be allowed to teach again.’ Fellow Tory Priti Patel said: ‘The public need to know of individuals who have been convicted of these awful crimes and who are in our schools.’ Meg Munn, the Labour chairman of the all-party Parliamentary group on child protection, said that no one with Bettley’s background should be allowed in a school. ‘It isn’t just about whether they may or may not go on to abuse children,’ she said. ‘Children have already been abused because their pictures have appeared and these people have compounded that abuse by looking at it.’ 'Many parents will be deeply disturbed': Conservative MP Philip Davies called on Education Secretary Michael Gove to explain himself, while Priti Patel said the public 'need to know' which teachers had been convicted . Peter Saunders, of the  National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘The public have an absolute right to know how many decisions like this there have been. We are talking about the worst crime we’ve got.’ From yesterday's Mail . The NASUWT teachers’ union was drawn into the scandal when it was revealed that a letter from a regional official to the NCTL’s lawyers argued that Bettley should be given the chance to ‘rebuild his life and hopefully his career’. It asked them to ‘consider the impact a prohibition order would have on Mr Bettley and his young family’. The union said Bettley had endured ‘two periods of sustained absence from school due to stress, which resulted in him requiring counselling’. Bettley taught at St Mary’s Catholic High School in Menston, West Yorkshire, until December 2011, when he was sacked. He was placed on a ‘barred list’ by the Independent Safeguarding Authority but his name was removed last year. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We want to ensure that anyone cautioned or prosecuted for offences related to child pornography is prohibited from teaching. We are taking steps to revise the guidance the independent panel uses to make a decision on whether a teacher should be barred.’ NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘Unions are governed by strict legal and regulatory provisions which cover the entitlement of members to representation.’","Potential threat confirmed the day after it emerged teacher Geoffrey Bentley had escaped classroom ban for downloading child pornography .

'I've got something naughty': Wayne Greenfield, . 27, from South Shields, was sentenced to three months jail after threatening to . blow up his local Jobcentre . A mentally-ill man who threatened to 'blow people up' at his local Jobcentre after his benefits were stopped has been jailed. Wayne Greenfield from South Shields, South Tyneside, told an operator at the Department of Work and Pensions that he had 'something naughty to go to the Jobcentre and kill them all'. The 27-year-old had telephoned the benefits agency because his benefits had been stopped and he didn't know why. But minutes into his call he told the operator he had two grenades and would blow up everyone in the building. Greenfield was today jailed for three months after pleading guilty to making a threatening or malicious communication at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court. Magistrates were played a recording of the phone call. During the call, Greenfield, who is schizophrenic, said: 'I've bought something naughty to go to the JobCentre and kill them all. 'It's in my head, I'm trying to sort this out, but people keep cutting me off. 'It's making me want to set grenades off in the JobCentre. 'They were £100 each and I spent all my money on them - I've got two ready to blow people up.' Lee Poppett, prosecuting, told the court it was on December 14 at 12.20pm when Greenfield called the DWP. He said: 'During the phone call he said he was in possession of hand grenades and would go into the Jobcentre and kill everyone. 'The call lasted about 16 minutes and during it he said he had been in trouble for having firearms before. 'He told the call handler that he had schizophrenia. 'The DWP staff member reported the call to police and the defendant was arrested.' The court heard that Greenfield had . previous convictions for possessing an extendible baton and a weapon for . the release of a noxious gas. 'It's making me want to set grenades off': South .

Rachel Mangenie, defending, said: 'This isn't a case where he is ranting and raving and issuing threats. 'This is someone who suffers from mental health problems and has little recollection of the call. 'While they are extremely unpleasant threats to make, they were spoken by someone who was desperate and frustrated - he had been on the phone six or seven times in the previous few days.' Chairman of the Bench Gerry Tierney said: 'This is a very serious offence, which has crossed the custody threshold. 'We're imposing a custodial sentence for 12 weeks, we don't think there is any other option.'","Wayne Greenfield had called the DWP after his benefits were stopped .

The Ministry of Justice has refused to ban websites showing simulated violent scenes of child abuse and rape, insisting there is ‘no evidence’ to link them to the actual crimes. In a letter to concerned charities, an official played down the suggestion that websites purporting to show rape can lead users to commit sex offences. Dave Pearson said: ‘We note what you say about such images potentially glorifying sexual violence . . . However, we are not convinced that evidence for this is any more than anecdotal and cannot, therefore, be used to justify a change in the law.’ Inspired to kill: Mark Bridger, right, who was last week jailed for the murder of April Jones, and Stuart Hazell, left, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, both progressed from viewing child porn to committing child murder . The letter came after charities wrote . to the Ministry of Justice asking it to consider reclassifying such . simulation sites as illegal. They are already banned in Scotland. Last . week the Mail revealed research which shows that one in six men who view . child porn go on to abuse youngsters. The MoJ’s response emerged a week . after Mark Bridger was given a life sentence for the murder of . five-year-old April Jones. He had collected a ‘library’ of sickening . images. Both he and Stuart . Hazell, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no previous convictions . for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the . internet to committing child murder. But . the department’s dismissive response seemed to contradict its own . evidence assessment, which pointed out that rapists ‘are much more . aroused by depictions of coercion than non-criminals’ and that ‘one . third of rapists report using forced sexual depictions as part of their . deliberate pre-offence preparation’. Sites which show actual rape and child abuse are banned under existing pornography legislation. But those purporting to show simulated rape and child abuse are not illegal in England and Wales. More than 100 campaigners have written to David Cameron, urging him to ban depictions of ‘rape or other non-consensual penetrative sexual activity’. Anyone found downloading such images would be committing an offence. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘We share the public’s concern about the availability of harmful content on the internet and have already taken steps to ensure there are better online filters to protect children. 'But we want to look at what more can be done and so the Culture Secretary has invited internet providers to a summit this month.’","Child killers Mark Bridger and Stuary Hazell both viewed sick porn online before going on to commit murder .

The BBC were officially warned following an investigation in 1972 that . young girls in the Top of the Pops audience were at risk . An inquiry officially warned the BBC more than 40 years ago that girls in the Top of the Pops audience were being put at risk, it has been revealed. Sexual misconduct was investigated, following concerns, in 1972 by a leading QC who discovered what was described as 'immorality' at the programme. A 64-page report was then handed to the director general and chairman at the time in which Sir Brian Neill QC raised concerns. The conclusions of the report have been made public after four decades following a Freedom of Information Act request by The Telegraph. The paper reports that in the heavily redacted report, Sir Brian concludes: 'A programme such as Top of the Pops does... present certain problems in that it introduces into the labyrinthine TV Centre a substantial number of teenage girls.' He also urged the corporation to issue 'clear guidance as to who is to be ultimately responsible for the behaviour and control of audiences of this kind'. The inquiry was commissioned following stories about sex scandals at the BBC and the suicide of 15-year-old Top of the Pops dancer Claire, also known as Samantha, McAlpine, the paper has reported. In her diary, which was found near her body, the teenager had named a string of radio disc jockeys - and other showbusiness personalities - who, she claimed, had 'used' her. Her brother-in-law Mark Ufland said Jimmy Savile was among those named in the diary 'for having some sort of sexual relationship with her'. Police decided she was a fantasist after investigating her death. Following his investigation, Sir Brian concluded 'isolated instances of immorality may have occurred'. According to The Telegraph, senior figures including Sir Bill Cotton, head of light entertainment at the BBC, persuaded Sir Brian that any problems were rare. Top of the Pops: Jimmy Savile (second from the right) presenting the Friday night programme in 1977 . The Metropolitan Police has been passed a copy of the report as it investigates historical sexual offences by Savile and others. A BBC spokesperson said: 'In 1971, allegations of corrupt practices at the BBC were made by a newspaper. 'The BBC took these allegations extremely seriously and commissioned Brian Neill QC to prepare an independent report to establish what had happened. The inquiry was commissioned following stories about sex scandals at the BBC more than 40 years ago . 'Neill noted that the evidence . available to him ""fell a very long way short"" of justifying the . allegation of widespread corruption that had been made, though he also . noted that despite his best efforts he was not able to access all the . material that was held by the newspaper. Suicide: Claire McAlpine, 15, pictured dancing in the Top Of The Pops audience just weeks before she died . 'In spite of this Neill did make recommendations for changes at the BBC which were duly responded to by the Corporation. 'The BBC introduced clearer guidance . on the supervision of audiences and guests at Television Centre and . maintaining stricter control of visitors to the BBC club. 'None of the allegations of misconduct referred to Jimmy Savile.' Last month, MailOnline reported that . sexual allegations about 81 BBC staff have been reported since the Jimmy . Savile scandal came to light - with almost half still working for the . corporation. Figures revealed that 40 of the people whose names have come up since October 3 are either current staff or contributors to the organisation. The remainder have either died or no longer work for the BBC. Data released as a result of a Freedom Of Information request shows that just ten of the cases involving present staff or contributors are still ongoing with investigations by the police or the BBC . Of the 81 people about whom allegations have been made, 54 are physical with 23 still involved with the corporation. The remainder relate to verbal and 'non-physical' incidents. In all there have been 152 sexual allegations made about BBC staff and contributors, with 52 of those still involved with the organisation. The Savile scandal erupted last year and sent the BBC into crisis over its handling of the issue. Director general George Entwistle resigned as a result of the fall-out only 54 days into the job.","Sexual misconduct at BBC was investigated in 1972 following concerns .

Statement of intent: Vterean democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has admitted she wants to run for president . Mynamar's pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said she wants to run for president. The Nobel peace prize laureate made the admission during the first day of open discussions at the World Economic Forum today. 'I want to run for president and I'm quite frank about it,' the Associated Free Press reports her as saying. 'If I pretended that I didn't want to be president, I wouldn't be honest and I would rather be honest with my people than otherwise.' Speaking in the capital Naypyidaw, Suu Kyi called for an amendment of the military-drafted constitution which prevents her from leading the country. It currently prohibits anyone whose spouses or children are overseas citizens from leading the country. Suu Kyi had two sons with her late husband Michael and it is widely believed the clause was included specifically to bar her from running for president. The government of President Thein Sein has been praised in the past two years for wide-ranging democratic reforms which have led to lifting of most Western sanctions. Political prisoners have been freed, Suu Kyi has been welcomed into a new parliament and fragile creasefires have been achieved between Myanmar's warring ethnic minorities. Suu Kyi, who was imprisoned by the former military dictatorship for 15 years, remains a popular icon in Myanmar and her party the National League for Democracy is expected to win the next elections if they are free and fair. But she said the large majority of the population are yet to see the benefits of reform. 'If you talk to the man on the street, if you talk to people in villages, the great majority of them would say that their lives have not changed since 2010. 'This is a transformation time.' Troubles: The two years of Myanmar's new government have been marred by violent sectarian clashes between Buddhists and Muslims . Suu Kyi admitted the first task will be for her to campaign for the constitution to be amended for her to become president. She did not speak of having optimism of achieving the change, but said she would instead concentrate on 'endeavour'. Although heralded as a heroine by many, Suu Kyi has faced some critcism for not speaking up for the human rights of Muslims who have been persecuted in Myanmar. Human Rights Watch has accused the Myanmar government of the 'systematic and wide ranging persecution' of Muslims in the state of Rohingya, who it says have been the target of ethnic cleansing. Veteran: Democracy activist Suu yi, pictured with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, spent 15 years in jail under Myanmar's military junta . Suu Kyi argued that she has tried to intervene, but that the solution to the problem is establishing a rule of law which meets 'international norms'. 'I would like all of the world to understand that we are aware of the difficulties in our country and we're doing our best to cope with it,' she added. 'When I say 'we' I'm not talking about the government, I'm talking about ordinary people in Burma.' Government minister Soe Thane, who was also on the panel, agreed that the constitution had to change, but said that it will take time to establish democracy after decades of military rule. but stressed that decades of military rule had created binds that would take time to unravel. 'We need time. We are in the dark ages, the other system was in place about 60 years. We have an idea to arrange for everything we have to change but we need time,' he said.","Nobel peace laureate says she wants to lead democratic Myanmar .

The mum-of-five, from Grindon, said: 'I got a phone call at about 7pm, and I just went straight down to the hospital, but no one knew what was happening because the ambulance hadn't turned up. I was in a terrible state. It was horrendous.' German Shepherd's are regularly used by police and the army to keep control . The attack happened on Friday evening after Meghan had been to a barbecue at a friend's house. The owners of the dog, which has since been put down, are devastated by what happened and no one can understand why the animal, which has happily lived with children, turned on Meghan. The plucky teenager said: 'It is a good thing it happened to me or it could have been a little child. 'The owner was really lovely. She sat holding me until the police car came and took me to hospital, and has sent me gifts and a card.'

Anyone cautioned or prosecuted for child pornography offences in the future will be banned from teaching, the Department for Education announced tonight. It came as Education Secretary Michael Gove was urged to explain why his department approved a decision to allow a teacher who downloaded indecent images of children back into the classroom. The move sparked outrage and Mr Gove has been urged to appear in the Commons to tell MPs why Geoffrey Bettley was reinstated after police found nearly 200 child abuse images on his computer. RE teacher: Geoffrey Bettley, 36, had been suspended from a school in Menston, West Yorkshire, in 2010 . A DfE spokesman said: ‘We want to ensure that in future anyone cautioned or prosecuted for offences related to child pornography is prohibited from teaching. We are taking steps to revise the guidance the independent panel uses to make a decision on whether a teacher should be barred.’ Under current law, the announcement cannot be applied retrospectively. Mr Bettley, 36, had been suspended from St Mary's Catholic School in Menston, West Yorkshire, in December 2010. He accepted a police caution and was dismissed by the school following a disciplinary hearing in December 2011. But a professional conduct panel has ruled that the RE teacher should be allowed to return to teaching after concluding he ‘does not represent a risk to children and young people’. The decision was signed off by a senior official at the Department for Education. Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said that many parents would be ‘deeply disturbed’ that Mr Bettley, 36, had been allowed to teach again. Speaking during the weekly Commons . business statement, Mr Davies said: ‘He downloaded child porn images and . was rightly sacked by the school and put on the sex offenders register. ‘In a decision which has been ratified by . the Education Secretary, he's now been told he's allowed back to teach . again. I'm sure you will appreciate many parents will be deeply . disturbed someone who has been convicted of downloading child porn . should be allowed to teach again. Pressure: Education Secretary Michael Gove was urged to explain why his department approved a decision to allow the teacher who downloaded indecent images of children back into the classroom . ‘Can we have a statement from the Education Secretary so he can explain what on earth he was thinking about when he allowed this person to teach again?’ Commons Leader Andrew Lansley replied: ‘I have read the press reports relating to this matter and of course it was a decision taken by the National College of Teaching and Leadership, which was then endorsed by a senior official at the department. 'Many parents will be deeply disturbed someone who has been convicted of downloading child porn should be allowed to teach again' Philip Davies, Conservative MP . ‘I will, of course, contact Mr Gove so he might be able to give you an account of the process in this case.’ In its judgment, the National College of Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel said the images viewed by Mr Bettley were ‘not at the most serious end’ of the scale and there were ‘relatively few’ on his computer. The panel said it had considered it safe to conclude that the RE teacher ‘does not pose a risk to children’. While Mr Bettley's actions were a ‘serious departure’ from the official Teachers' Standards, the panel said, it added that it did not consider that there was evidence of ‘a deep seated attitude on the part of Mr Bettley which leads to harmful behaviour’. The panel's report added: ‘In the . circumstances, the paneldoes not consider that it would be appropriate . to recommend prohibition to the Secretary of State and it does not.’ At . the end of the panel's report, under a section on the Secretary of . State's decision and reasons, a senior DfE official said: ‘Although the . findings in this case are serious ones, for the reasons set out, I . support the recommendation of the panel that a prohibition order should . not be applied in this case.’ Educational establisment: Mr Bettley accepted a police caution and was dismissed by St Mary's Catholic School (pictured) in Menston, West Yorkshire, following a disciplinary hearing in December 2011 . Mr Bettley was employed at St Mary's from September 2001 to December 2011. He visited a website in March 2009 where he viewed six child abuse images, according to the panel's ruling. When his computer was seized by the police in December 2010, 143 images were found at level one, which covers nudity and/or erotic posing. A further 46 images considered to be at level three on the scale were found but had not been opened, the panel said. 'We want to ensure that in future anyone cautioned or prosecuted for offences related to child pornography is prohibited from teaching' Department for Education spokesman . Mr Bettley acknowledged that the images were of underage children and were child abuse images and admitted to police that he had accessed and viewed the images, the panel said. He was cautioned for the offence of possessing an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child and placed on the sex offenders register for two years, according to the ruling. In the judgment, the panel said Mr Bettley's conduct had brought his profession ‘into disrepute’ but acknowledged the Independent Safeguarding Authority had since removed his name from the Children's Barred List and the Adults' Barred List. A report from Leeds Children and Young People's Social Care in September 2011 had also concluded that Mr Bettley posed little risk, the panel added. A DfE spokesman said: ‘We keep the process under review because of legal complexities and we are examining whether this case was handled correctly.’ A spokesman for the department later said that all schools must carry out vetting checks when recruiting staff and a caution of the type Mr Bettley was given would be highlighted.","Education Sec.

The editor of the Oscar-winning Muppets movie was a sexist who singled out female staff for abuse and told one woman she should not be a working mother, according to claims in a new lawsuit. The film's assistant editor Cecilia Hyoun is suing Disney after she was fired from the 2011 blockbuster, and insists she was forced out because of the sexist atmosphere on set. Her lawsuit singles out editor James Thomas, claiming he repeatedly grilled Ms Hyoun on her family life and referred to a female colleague as a 'c***'. Lovable: But a new lawsuit claims that the Muppets movie had a sexist atmosphere during production . Ms Hyoun this week filed papers with a court in Los Angeles seeking compensation for her firing, which came in June 2011. In the documents, she complained that producers 'treated [her] differently because she was an Asian woman over age 40, and terminated [her] employment because of her gender, race and family responsibilities'. The mother of two's specific complaints were mostly directed at Mr Thomas, a British editor who has previously worked on Sacha Baron Cohen's films such as Borat and Bruno. Mr Thomas, who is named as a defendant in Ms Hyoun's lawsuit, allegedly 'frequently interrogated [her] about her personal life and family situation', as well as making racially charged comments. The documents went on to claim that the editor spoke about other women working on the film in derogatory terms, and described one senior female colleague as a 'c***'. On set: The Oscar-winning film starring Jason Segel was allegedly a hostile place for women to work . Soon before Ms Hyoun was fired, according to the court documents, Mr Thomas 'grilled [her] repeatedly about choosing between her family responsibilities and her work, telling her to decide between ""being a mom"" and working'. Although the assistant editor insisted she was dedicated to her work, she was sacked from the film just weeks later. Ms Hyoun said she was told that her job was now redundant, but claimed that a less qualified man was quickly hired in her place. In the legal papers, she said she was 'fearful of being blackballed for standing up to a major studio', but was seeking damages because the circumstances of her firing had prevented her from finding work ever since. She also claimed to have suffered 'pain and suffering, extreme and severe mental anguish and emotional distress' over the alleged sexism. Disney and Mr Thomas have so far declined to comment publicly on the allegations against them. Ms Hyoung previously worked on Hollywood blockbusters such as Almost Famous, 8 Mile and Vanilla Sky. The Muppets was not the first time she had worked under Mr Thomas - the pair also collaborated on 2010 comedy Hot Tub Time Machine.","James Thomas allegedly called female colleague a 'c***' during production .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 05:33 EST, 18 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:22 EST, 18 July 2012 . Brave new world: Yokamon Hearn, 33, became the first Texas prisoner to be executed under the state's new single-drug lethal injection procedure . A Texas prisoner who murdered a 23-year-old stockbroker in 1998 has just become the first to be executed under the U.S. state's new single-drug lethal injection procedure. Yokamon Hearn, 33, who shot Frank Meziere ten times before dumping his body on the side of the road, was executed Wednesday night in Huntsville, Texas. Hearn was the sixth prisoner executed in Texas this year, but the first since the Texas Department of Criminal Justice announced its switch to single-drug lethal injections amid a drug shortage that has left states in the U.S. scrambling for acceptable alternatives. It was announced last week that Texas would use a single dose of pentobarbital as a lethal injection, instead of using the sedative in combination with two other drugs as before. Ohio became the first state to use a single drug a year ago, and several other states have since made the switch. Last rites: The death chamber inside the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, where Yokamon Hearn was executed Wednesday evening . Courts have upheld the practice, despite the reaction of death penalty opponents who claim that prisoners take longer to die with a single drug. Hearn - known to his friends as Yogi - had made appeals against his sentence based on his mental capacity, the competence of his lawyers, and whether recent lower federal court rulings improperly blocked his current legal team from pursuing appeals. In 2004, a federal court spared Hearn less than an hour before he could have been taken to the death chamber, so that it could consider arguments that he was mentally impaired and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. That appeal was subsequently rejected. More recently Hearn's lawyers told the U.S. Supreme Court that, while tests show Hearn's IQ is considerably higher than levels determining mental impairment, he suffers from a fetal alcohol disorder that should disqualify him from execution. Jason January, the former Dallas . County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Hearn for capital . murder, dismissed claims that the 33-year-old was disabled. 'He was quite capable of functioning and figuring out how to rob people,' he said. Hearn was 19 at the time of Meziere's murder and had a lengthy criminal record that included burglary, robbery, assault, sexual assault and possession of weapons. The Texas State Penitentiary is following the lead of prisons in other U.S. states by switching to the single-drug lethal injection method . Meziere was abducted at gunpoint as he was cleaning his car at a self-service car wash in Dallas. A security camera video at a convenience store next to the car wash captured images of Hearn with two other Dallas men and a woman from Oklahoma City. They had been out looking for someone to carjack, authorities said. According to trial testimony, Hearn and Delvin Diles forced Meziere into the stockbroker's car, and Hearn drove it to an area near Dallas' wastewater treatment plant. The two others, Dwight Burley and Teresa Shirley, followed in a second car. Meziere, from Plano, was shot with a stolen, assault-style rifle and then with a .22-caliber pistol. Shirley testified that Hearn shot Meziere with the rifle and then continued to fire after he hit the ground. Diles then shot him with the pistol. She also testified that Hearn later waved around a newspaper account of the crime and was pleased it said Meziere had been shot in the head, or 'domed' in street slang. According to The Dallas Morning News, Hearn told her: 'I told you I domed him. I told you. I told you.' Diles, 19 at the time, pleaded guilty and received consecutive life terms for Meziere's death and an unrelated aggravated robbery. Shirley, 19, and Burley, then 20, pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery and received 10-year prison sentences. Hearn beame the 483rd inmate executed since Texas resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982. He is among at least nine men with execution dates in the coming months.","Yokamon Hearn was convicted of murdering 23-year-old stockbroker Frank Meziere in Dallas, Texas, in 1998 .

"By . Matt Chorley and Jason Groves . PUBLISHED: . 16:59 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:23 EST, 6 June 2013 . Nick Clegg today claimed Tory childcare reforms which he has vetoed would have increased bills for parents. As the bitter coalition row deepened over Lib Dem opposition to changes, the Deputy Prime Minister dismissed research suggesting that allowing nurseries to look after more children would cut costs. Mr Clegg ramped up the row with the Tories, insisting he had never agreed to the ratio changes which were opposed by parents and industry groups. U-turn: Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, said he would now block any attempt to increase the number of infants a childminder can care for . However, his decision to veto the reforms have triggered accusations of ‘turning his back on working parents’. It had been estimated that the move to allow nurseries and childminders to look after more children could have saved parents nearly a third on their childcare bills. But Mr Clegg claimed there was no evidence for this, and some nurseries said the changes would lead to rising costs. 'What we said was we would consult people on this idea and then we would react to how people responded. 'What I said very explicitly within Government is that you can only decide on this when we’ve heard the responses from people who frankly know better than any politician what it’s like to look after four, five, six two-year-old toddlers.' He told his LBC 97.3 weekly phone-in show: 'The response, not just from nurseries, but overwhelmingly from parent groups was they thought this was a bad idea. 'They thought it was a bad idea for a number of reasons but the one I focused on…was the claim initially made that it would somehow reduce the weekly childcare bill for families. I, like everyone desperately want to do whatever I can to bring childcare costs down. 'What came back was a really clear answer that there was no real evidence that this would reduce childcare costs. 'In . fact at one nursery after another that I visited, they said, ‘To be . honest Mr Clegg’, they would say to me privately, ""It might well drive . costs up because we’re going to have to spend more money on more . higher-qualified staff"".' However . Mr Clegg’s decision raises questions about where power lies in the . Coalition and will infuriate many Tories, including the Education . Secretary Michael Gove. A senior Number 10 source last night said the final childcare package ‘has not yet been agreed’. Asked about Mr Clegg’s actions, the source said: ‘It is not a good way to behave – it’s best to announce things when they have been agreed.’ A study by the Department for Education found the changes, which were due to be introduced in September, could have slashed the cost of childcare by up to 28 per cent. The analysis suggested the move could save parents an average £1,329 a year per child if it was widely adopted by nurseries. But the proposal faced a backlash from influential parenting website Mumsnet and some parents, nurseries and childminding organisations, which argued that care would suffer. Relaxation: Under the proposals one childminder would have been able to look after four babies under the age of one instead of three, and one adult would also have been able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four . Ministers stressed that the new . child-to-carer ratios would be voluntary, and cited extensive evidence . from other countries suggesting the change would cut costs without . damaging the quality of care. Tory MP Chris Skidmore accused Mr Clegg of ignoring the plight of parents faced with crippling childcare bills. Mr . Skidmore, a member of the Commons education committee, said: ‘This is a . huge U-turn from Mr Clegg and undermines his claim that he wants . cheaper childcare.’ Mr Clegg last night dismissed the . DfE’s analysis, saying there was ‘no real evidence that increasing . ratios will reduce the cost of childcare for families’. He . added: ‘I have concluded that, because it will not reduce costs for . parents or increase the quality of childcare, the proposed ratio changes . for pre-school children cannot proceed.’ Yesterday he telephoned leaders in the childcare sector and told them the plans were ‘dead in the water’. Mr Clegg’s decision to wield the veto – and David Cameron’s apparent inability to stop him – is a major setback to Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss, who had championed the reforms. One Government source said she had been ‘hung out to dry’. The move is also a blow to Michael Gove, who said last month that the case for change was ‘formidable’. 'Hung out to dry': Mr Clegg's decision to veto the relaxing of childcare regulations is a major setback to Childcare Minister Elizabeth Truss, left, and a blow to Education Secretary Michael Gove, right . From September, one childminder would have been able to look after four babies under the age of one instead of three. One adult would also have been able to look after six two-year-olds instead of four. Mr Clegg signed off on the plans in January, but got cold feet last month after private talks with figures at Mumsnet. Downing Street last night stressed the childcare package had not been finalised.","Deputy PM blocks move to allow childminders to look after more children .

Classic: A wealthy car collector sold this Ferrari at auction for a record-breaking £8.4million . The multi-millionaire bought the Ferrari 375MM from JCB magnate Sir Anthony Bamford in 2004 for an undisclosed figure. He sold it at RM Auctions' prestigious Villa Erba sale in Italy over the Bank Holiday weekend for £8.4 million. This is a 13 fold increase on its price 20 years ago, when it was sold in the US for $987,000. It makes it the most expensive car sold at auction this year and a world record for a Ferrari coupe. In 2011 the 1957 Farrari 250 Testa Rossa became the most expensive Farrari ever sold smashing the previous record by more than $4million.

Almost seven out of ten said the books were likely to be raunchier than the film and most fans believe the film will not be more popular than the books. Fans were split down the middle over whether American or British stars should take the lead rolls - 50 per cent favouring each country. A spokesman for Lovehoney said: 'This is the first time fans have been asked who they think should play Christian and Ana. 'It will be interesting to see if movie bosses agree with their choices. 'Fans have also said emphatically that they want all the sex kept IN the movie. 'There is huge excitement about the film but, if the fans are right, it will be a big mistake to make a Fifty Shades-lite version with the bondage left out. I am sure the final version will be amazing.' Fifty Shades of Grey sold 70 million copies worldwide and Universal plan to make three movies from the trilogy of best-sellers.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:34 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:37 EST, 6 June 2013 . The New Hampshire girls tennis singles final ended prematurely on Tuesday when one of the players walked off the court after being heckled by the crowd. Bow High School senior Sunday Swett was already one set up when her opponent Briana Leonard from Bishop Guertin, a college preparatory private Roman Catholic high school in Nashua, New Hampshire, chose to end the match. The forfeit occurred when officials attempted to move the final at the end of the first set to a different court due to the failing light. Champion: Sunday Swett pictured at an earlier Derryfield tournament, was already ahead in the match . Quit: Briana Leonard forfeited the match after her parents complained about the hostile crowd . Instead of heading to the new court, Leonard left with her parents and drove home. ‘This has been going on for the last two years,’ Kristen Leonard told the Nashua Telegraph. ‘This is an 18-year-old girl who fell and got hurt and people are cheering. They were bullying her. This has been going on for two years. They’ve wanted her out for two years because she’s not a New Hampshire girl. Because we live in Massachusetts.’ Her coach, Barry Ndynia, acknowledged that she had had to endure a hostile crowd, but said such challenges were often an integral part of sports. 'They thought the crowd was over the top, cheering for their daughter’s faults and things like that,' he said. ‘In sports that’s something you have to deal with. Some people will not cheer for you. They’ll cheer for your opponent. That’s why I was trying to keep her focused.' Concern: Tim and Kristen Leonard say Briana faces hostility because she lives in Massachusetts . Briana, who until Tuesday had not lost a match all season, was also docked a point before the match began because she was late getting to the court. Her father, Tim, had been told to leave the premises after discussing the sanction with officials, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader. It took a moment for Sunday to realize she had won. 'I thought it was a bathroom break and when everyone started cheering I thought it was more like, ""First Set! Keep it going!"" And I was kind of like, thank you, but I’ve got to stay focused here,' Sunday told Gazettenet.com. 'But [Briana] just picked up her stuff and left.' Sunday added: 'It was her choice. I’m not going to let it dampen my happiness.' New Hampshire Interscholastic . Activities Association Executive Director R. Patrick Corbin described . the situation as ‘an unfortunate experience.’ ‘I’ve never seen something like this at a tennis match,’ he told the Telegraph. As . for Sunday, she said the manner of her victory didn’t spoil the . achievement for her as it was the first time she had beaten Briana. Tough match: Briana, left, had been undefeated this season, but Sunday, right, was already ahead in their game . School team: Briana Leonard is a senior at Bishop Guertin high school in Nashua, New Hampshire . ‘I’ve played her before [including a 6-0, 6-1 loss to Briana in the 2012 quarterfinals], and, not to be mean, but I know she has an attitude, and I was ready to put up with it. But this brought it to a whole new level,’ she told the Concord Monitor. Bow coach Jonsey Rainville was also proud of Sunday's achievement. She said: 'Her goal from Day One was to win it, the goal of the whole team was for her to win it. I'm so proud of her. She deserves it. She's a fabulous tennis player and an even better kid.' She added: 'They're both extremely talented tennis players. I wish it could have gone the extra set. I think the result would have been the same. Sunday was the better player out there today.'","Sunday Swett won Tuesday final after her opponent walked out at the end of the first set .
